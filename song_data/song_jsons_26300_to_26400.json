Laugh\u201d\n\nThe secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in. Round the cottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall of rough stones. Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight and on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked there planting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbs for his mother. In the company of his \u201ccreatures\u201d he did wonders there and was never tired of doing them, it seemed. While he dug or weeded he whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.\n\n\u201cWe'd never get on as comfortable as we do,\u201d Mrs. Sowerby said, \u201cif it wasn't for Dickon's garden. Anything'll grow for him. His 'taters and cabbages is twice th' size of any one else's an' they've got a flavor with 'em as nobody's has.\u201d\n\nWhen she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him. After supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that was her quiet time. She could sit upon the low rough wall and look on and hear stories of the day. She loved this time. There were not only vegetables in this garden. Dickon had bought penny packages of flower seeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among gooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette and pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could save year after year or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps. The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire because he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and hedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones were to be seen.\n\n\u201cAll a chap's got to do to make 'em thrive, mother,\u201d he would say, \u201cis to be friends with 'em for sure. They're just like th' 'creatures.' If they're thirsty give 'em drink and if they're hungry give 'em a bit o' food. They want to live same as we do. If they died I should feel as if I'd been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.\u201d\n\nIt was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that happened at Misselthwaite Manor. At first she was only told that \u201cMester Colin\u201d had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with Miss Mary and that it was doing him good. But it was not long before it was agreed between the two children that Dickon's mother might \u201ccome into the secret.\u201d Somehow it was not doubted that she was \u201csafe for sure.\u201d\nSo one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all the thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze which had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned never to reveal. The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him, the doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his introduction to the hidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff's angry face peering over the wall and Mester Colin's sudden indignant strength, made Mrs. Sowerby's nice-looking face quite change color several times.\n\n\u201cMy word!\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a good thing that little lass came to th' Manor. It's been th' makin' o' her an' th' savin, o' him. Standin' on his feet! An' us all thinkin' he was a poor half-witted lad with not a straight bone in him.\u201d\n\nShe asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were full of deep thinking.\n\n\u201cWhat do they make of it at th' Manor\u2014him being so well an' cheerful an' never complainin'?\u201d she inquired. \u201cThey don't know what to make of it,\u201d answered Dickon. \u201cEvery day as comes round his face looks different. It's fillin' out and doesn't look so sharp an' th' waxy color is goin'. But he has to do his bit o' complainin',\u201d with a highly entertained grin.\n\n\u201cWhat for, i' Mercy's name?\u201d asked Mrs. Sowerby.\n\nDickon chuckled.\n\n\u201cHe does it to keep them from guessin' what's happened. If the doctor knew he'd found out he could stand on his feet he'd likely write and tell Mester Craven. Mester Colin's savin' th' secret to tell himself. He's goin' to practise his Magic on his legs every day till his father comes back an' then he's goin' to march into his room an' show him he's as straight as other lads. But him an' Miss Mary thinks it's best plan to do a bit o' groanin' an' frettin' now an' then to throw folk off th' scent.\u201d\n\nMrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he had finished his last sentence.\n\n\u201cEh!\u201d she said, \u201cthat pair's enjoyin' their-selves I'll warrant. They'll get a good bit o' actin' out of it an' there's nothin' children likes as much as play actin'. Let's hear what they do, Dickon lad.\u201d Dickon stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to tell her. His eyes were twinkling with fun.\n\n\u201cMester Colin is carried down to his chair every time he goes out,\u201d he explained. \u201cAn' he flies out at John, th' footman, for not carryin' him careful enough. He makes himself as helpless lookin' as he can an' never lifts his head until we're out o' sight o' th' house. An' he grunts an' frets a good bit when he's bein' settled into his chair. Him an' Miss Mary's both got to enjoyin' it an' when he groans an' complains she'll say, 'Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so much? Are you so weak as that, poor Colin?'\u2014but th' trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keep from burstin' out laughin'. When we get safe into the garden they laugh till they've no breath left to laugh with. An' they have to stuff their faces into Mester Colin's cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin', if any of, 'em's about.\u201d\n\n\u201cTh' more they laugh th' better for 'em!\u201d said Mrs. Sowerby, still laughing herself. \u201cGood healthy child laughin's better than pills any day o' th' year. That pair'll plump up for sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are plumpin' up,\u201d said Dickon. \u201cThey're that hungry they don't know how to get enough to eat without makin' talk. Mester Colin says if he keeps sendin' for more food they won't believe he's an invalid at all. Miss Mary says she'll let him eat her share, but he says that if she goes hungry she'll get thin an' they mun both get fat at once.\u201d\n\nMrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty that she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak, and Dickon laughed with her.\n\u201cI'll tell thee what, lad,\u201d Mrs. Sowerby said when she could speak. \u201cI've thought of a way to help 'em. When tha' goes to 'em in th' mornin's tha' shall take a pail o' good new milk an' I'll bake 'em a crusty cottage loaf or some buns wi' currants in 'em, same as you children like. Nothin's so good as fresh milk an' bread. Then they could take off th' edge o' their hunger while they were in their garden an' th, fine food they get indoors 'ud polish off th' corners.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh! mother!\u201d said Dickon admiringly, \u201cwhat a wonder tha' art! Tha' always sees a way out o' things. They was quite in a pother yesterday. They didn't see how they was to manage without orderin' up more food\u2014they felt that empty inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey're two young 'uns growin' fast, an' health's comin' back to both of 'em. Children like that feels like young wolves an' food's flesh an' blood to 'em,\u201d said Mrs. Sowerby. Then she smiled Dickon's own curving smile. \u201cEh! but they're enjoyin' theirselves for sure,\u201d she said.\n\nShe was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature\u2014and she had never been more so than when she said their \u201cplay actin'\u201c would be their joy. Colin and Mary found it one of their most thrilling sources of entertainment. The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had been unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and then by Dr. Craven himself.\n\n\u201cYour appetite. Is improving very much, Master Colin,\u201d the nurse had said one day. \u201cYou used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing disagrees with me now\u201d replied Colin, and then seeing the nurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps he ought not to appear too well just yet. \u201cAt least things don't so often disagree with me. It's the fresh air.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps it is,\u201d said the nurse, still looking at him with a mystified expression. \u201cBut I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow she stared at you!\u201d said Mary when she went away. \u201cAs if she thought there must be something to find out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won't have her finding out things,\u201d said Colin. \u201cNo one must begin to find out yet.\u201d When Dr. Craven came that morning he seemed puzzled, also. He asked a number of questions, to Colin's great annoyance.\n\n\u201cYou stay out in the garden a great deal,\u201d he suggested. \u201cWhere do you go?\u201d\n\nColin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion.\n\n\u201cI will not let any one know where I go,\u201d he answered. \u201cI go to a place I like. Every one has orders to keep out of the way. I won't be watched and stared at. You know that!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm\u2014I do not think so. The nurse says that you eat much more than you have ever done before.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, \u201cperhaps it is an unnatural appetite.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,\u201d said Dr. Craven. \u201cYou are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps\u2014perhaps I am bloated and feverish,\u201d said Colin, assuming a discouraging air of gloom. \u201cPeople who are not going to live are often\u2014different.\u201d Dr. Craven shook his head. He was holding Colin's wrist and he pushed up his sleeve and felt his arm.\n\n\u201cYou are not feverish,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cand such flesh as you have gained is healthy. If you can keep this up, my boy, we need not talk of dying. Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable improvement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won't have him told!\u201d Colin broke forth fiercely. \u201cIt will only disappoint him if I get worse again\u2014and I may get worse this very night. I might have a raging fever. I feel as if I might be beginning to have one now. I won't have letters written to my father\u2014I won't\u2014I won't! You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me. I feel hot already. I hate being written about and being talked over as much as I hate being stared at!\u201d\n\n\u201cHush-h! my boy,\u201d Dr. Craven soothed him. \u201cNothing shall be written without your permission. You are too sensitive about things. You must not undo the good which has been done.\u201d\n\nHe said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he saw the nurse he privately warned her that such a possibility must not be mentioned to the patient.\n\n\u201cThe boy is extraordinarily better,\u201d he said. \u201cHis advance seems almost abnormal. But of course he is doing now of his own free will what we could not make him do before. Still, he excites himself very easily and nothing must be said to irritate him.\u201d Mary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously. From this time dated their plan of \u201cplay actin'.\u201d\n\n\u201cI may be obliged to have a tantrum,\u201d said Colin regretfully. \u201cI don't want to have one and I'm not miserable enough now to work myself into a big one. Perhaps I couldn't have one at all. That lump doesn't come in my throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible ones. But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to do something.\u201d\n\nHe made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possible to carry out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with an amazing appetite and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast of home-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam and clotted cream. Mary always breakfasted with him and when they found themselves at the table\u2014particularly if there were delicate slices of sizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver cover\u2014they would look into each other's eyes in desperation.\n\n\u201cI think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary,\u201d Colin always ended by saying. \u201cWe can send away some of the lunch and a great deal of the dinner.\u201d\n\nBut they never found they could send away anything and the highly polished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakened much comment.\n\n\u201cI do wish,\u201d Colin would say also, \u201cI do wish the slices of ham were thicker, and one muffin each is not enough for any one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt's enough for a person who is going to die,\u201d answered Mary when first she heard this, \u201cbut it's not enough for a person who is going to live. I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh heather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window.\u201d\n\nThe morning that Dickon\u2014after they had been enjoying themselves in the garden for about two hours\u2014went behind a big rosebush and brought forth two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk with cream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant buns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tucked in that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness. What a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of! What a kind, clever woman she must be! How good the buns were! And what delicious fresh milk!\n\n\u201cMagic is in her just as it is in Dickon,\u201d said Colin. \u201cIt makes her think of ways to do things\u2014nice things. She is a Magic person. Tell her we are grateful, Dickon\u2014extremely grateful.\u201d He was given to using rather grown-up phrases at times. He enjoyed them. He liked this so much that he improved upon it.\n\n\u201cTell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme.\u201d\n\nAnd then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself with buns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner of any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and breathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours behind him.\n\nThis was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind. They actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen people to provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two extra appetites every day. So they asked her to let them send some of their shillings to buy things.\n\nDickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park outside the garden where Mary had first found him piping to the wild creatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort of tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it. Roasted eggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt and fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king\u2014besides being deliciously satisfying. You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as many as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the mouths of fourteen people.\n\nEvery beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under the plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after its brief blossom-time was ended. After the ceremony Colin always took his walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly found power at intervals. Each day he grew stronger and could walk more steadily and cover more ground. And each day his belief in the Magic grew stronger\u2014as well it might. He tried one experiment after another as he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him the best things of all.\n\n\u201cYesterday,\u201d he said one morning after an absence, \u201cI went to Thwaite for mother an' near th' Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth. He's the strongest chap on th' moor. He's the champion wrestler an' he can jump higher than any other chap an' throw th' hammer farther. He's gone all th' way to Scotland for th' sports some years. He's knowed me ever since I was a little 'un an' he's a friendly sort an' I axed him some questions. Th' gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o' thee, Mester Colin, and I says, 'How did tha' make tha' muscles stick out that way, Bob? Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?' An' he says 'Well, yes, lad, I did. A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite once showed me how to exercise my arms an' legs an' every muscle in my body. An' I says, 'Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with 'em, Bob?' an' he laughed an' says, 'Art tha' th' delicate chap?' an' I says, 'No, but I knows a young gentleman that's gettin' well of a long illness an' I wish I knowed some o' them tricks to tell him about.' I didn't say no names an' he didn't ask none. He's friendly same as I said an' he stood up an' showed me good-natured like, an' I imitated what he did till I knowed it by heart.\u201d\n\nColin had been listening excitedly.\n\n\u201cCan you show me?\u201d he cried. \u201cWill you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, to be sure,\u201d Dickon answered, getting up. \u201cBut he says tha' mun do 'em gentle at first an' be careful not to tire thysel'. Rest in between times an' take deep breaths an' don't overdo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'll be careful,\u201d said Colin. \u201cShow me! Show me! Dickon, you are the most Magic boy in the world!\u201d\n\nDickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully practical but simple series of muscle exercises. Colin watched them with widening eyes. He could do a few while he was sitting down. Presently he did a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied feet. Mary began to do them also. Soot, who was watching the performance, became much disturbed and left his branch and hopped about restlessly because he could not do them too.\n\nFrom that time the exercises were part of the day's duties as much as the Magic was. It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more of them each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that but for the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he arrived they would have been lost. But the little oven in the hollow and Mrs. Sowerby's bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and the nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again. You can trifle with your breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream.\n\n\u201cThey are eating next to nothing,\u201d said the nurse. \u201cThey'll die of starvation if they can't be persuaded to take some nourishment. And yet see how they look.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook!\u201d exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly. \u201cEh! I'm moithered to death with them. They're a pair of young Satans. Bursting their jackets one day and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook can tempt them with. Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread sauce did they set a fork into yesterday\u2014and the poor woman fair invented a pudding for them\u2014and back it's sent. She almost cried. She's afraid she'll be blamed if they starve themselves into their graves.\u201d\n\nDr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully, He wore an extremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showed him the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to look at\u2014but it was even more worried when he sat down by Colin's sofa and examined him. He had been called to London on business and had not seen the boy for nearly two weeks. When young things begin to gain health they gain it rapidly. The waxen tinge had left, Colins skin and a warm rose showed through it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the hollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out. His once dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from his forehead and were soft and warm with life. His lips were fuller and of a normal color. In fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight. Dr. Craven held his chin in his hand and thought him over.\n\n\u201cI am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will not do. You will lose all you have gained\u2014and you have gained amazingly. You ate so well a short time ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told you it was an unnatural appetite,\u201d answered Colin.\n\nMary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly made a very queer sound which she tried so violently to repress that she ended by almost choking.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d said Dr. Craven, turning to look at her.\n\nMary became quite severe in her manner.\n\n\u201cIt was something between a sneeze and a cough,\u201d she replied with reproachful dignity, \u201cand it got into my throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d she said afterward to Colin, \u201cI couldn't stop myself. It just burst out because all at once I couldn't help remembering that last big potato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through that thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there any way in which those children can get food secretly?\u201d Dr. Craven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.\n\n\u201cThere's no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the trees,\u201d Mrs. Medlock answered. \u201cThey stay out in the grounds all day and see no one but each other. And if they want anything different to eat from what's sent up to them they need only ask for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dr. Craven, \u201cso long as going without food agrees with them we need not disturb ourselves. The boy is a new creature.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo is the girl,\u201d said Mrs. Medlock. \u201cShe's begun to be downright pretty since she's filled out and lost her ugly little sour look. Her hair's grown thick and healthy looking and she's got a bright color. The glummest, ill-natured little thing she used to be and now her and Master Colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones. Perhaps they're growing fat on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps they are,\u201d said Dr. Craven. \u201cLet them laugh.\u201dEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1182685", "artist_names": "Livingston Taylor", "full_title": "Get Out of Bed by\u00a0Livingston\u00a0Taylor", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/86a1c15650033192acfb2e6c39573256.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/86a1c15650033192acfb2e6c39573256.500x500x1.jpg", "id": 1182685, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429684713, "path": "/Livingston-taylor-get-out-of-bed-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Livingston-taylor-get-out-of-bed-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/86a1c15650033192acfb2e6c39573256.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/86a1c15650033192acfb2e6c39573256.500x500x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Get Out of Bed", "title_with_featured": "Get Out of Bed", "updated_by_human_at": 1481759566, "url": "https://genius.com/Livingston-taylor-get-out-of-bed-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/363001", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c0f57219a6dd4e552c3926e77775b2a0.667x1000x1.jpg", "id": 363001, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c0f57219a6dd4e552c3926e77775b2a0.667x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "l", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Livingston Taylor", "slug": "Livingston-taylor", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Livingston-taylor"}, "artist": "Livingston Taylor", "lyrics": "Get Out of Bed LyricsThere's a festival today\nCome and see it's all so fine\nPeople who are not my kind are here\nThere's a festival today\nThe world is changing fresh and new\nIt's mostly green with bits of blue\nBut it's all here for you\nAnd here's all you have to do:\n\nCHORUS:\nGet up, get up\nGet out of bed\nLet the sunshine fill your head\nListen to what your friends have said\nGet up, get out of bed\nMorning with a quick yawn\nI'll be gone\nI'll be hurrying on my way\nI hear there's a bad cat\nOn your back\nAnd you'd best stay in today\nAnd tomorrow I'm here to say:\n\nCHORUS\n\nCan you see me clearly?\nLover I do not know\nCan you hear me nearly?\nOh and I do think so\nThen you ain't got far to go\n\nCHORUSYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 196, "api_path": "/songs/181579", "artist_names": "James Joyce", "full_title": "Ulysses (Chap. 16 - Eumaeus) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "id": 181579, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 149810, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1646147203, "path": "/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-16-eumaeus-annotated", "pyongs_count": 2, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-16-eumaeus-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1922, "month": 2, "day": 2}, "release_date_for_display": "February 2, 1922", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 2, 1922", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 151, "hot": false, "pageviews": 9753}, "title": "Ulysses (Chap. 16 - Eumaeus)", "title_with_featured": "Ulysses (Chap. 16 - Eumaeus)", "updated_by_human_at": 1646147203, "url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-16-eumaeus-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22971", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/98f10611fc0aa6a525b9fbcab2ffa297.1000x600x1.jpg", "id": 22971, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9997f2e769ef85b9f941405cac99d1af.570x570x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Joyce", "slug": "James-joyce", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-joyce"}, "artist": "James Joyce", "lyrics": "Ulysses (Chap. 16 - Eumaeus) LyricsPreparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion, which he very badly needed. His (Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom, in view of the hour it was and there being no pumps of Vartry water available for their ablutions, let alone drinking purposes, hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt Bridge, where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e. d. ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly, after a few such preliminaries, as, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, brushing, they both walked together along Beaver street, or, more properly, lane, as far as the farrier's and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens Street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But, as he confidently anticipated, there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star Hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.\n\nThis was a quandary but, bringing commonsense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullet's and the Signal House, which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons, though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So, as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder man recounted to his companion \u00e0 propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour, and, passing the back door of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night), ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high, at present unlit, warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's, the stonecutter's, in his mind somehow in Talbot Place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his fidus Achates, inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread? At Rourke's the baker's, it is said.\n\nEn route, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events, was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while, though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little juijitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour, the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward, or, failing that, the Bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias, or, he being the solicitor, rather old Wall, he meant to say, or Malony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A Division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the City, Pembroke Road, for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description, liable to go off at any time, which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall nut over anything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of #. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and blood-making and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confr\u00e8res but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.\n\n\u2014And that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.\n\nDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge when a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's Gumley. To avoid a meeting be drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.\n\n\u2014Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.\nA figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted again, calling: Night! Stephen, of course, started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. Mr Bloom, actuated by motives of inherent delicacy, inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business, moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. Although unusual in the Dublin area, he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garotted.\n\nStephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in any over sober state himself, recognised Corley's breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley, some called him, and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of Inspector Corley of the G Division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael Corley, of New Ross, had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it, though not proved, that she descended from the house of the Lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, his mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.\n\nTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends had all deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalled-for expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God's earth he could get something, anything at all to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow, he was ill in.\n\n\u2014I wouldn't ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I'm on the rocks.\n\n\u2014There'll be a job tomorrow or the next day, Stephen told him, in a boys' school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garret Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.\n\n\u2014Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.\n\n\u2014I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.\n\nCorley, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadn't said a word about it.\n\nThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley's brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving of much credence. However, haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco, etcetera, as the Latin poet remarks, especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it Out of Corley's head that he was living in affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful - whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the idea of finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat. But the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left, because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect about biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However, in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously, however, as it turned out.\n\n\u2014Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.\n\nAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.\n\n\u2014Thanks, Corley answered. You're a gentleman. I'll pay you back some time. Who's that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeper.\n\nSubsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's bookkeeper there, that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow, he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.\nMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman's sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally, testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his next door neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude, with or without the option of a fine, would be a very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.\n\nThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom, who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:\n\n\u2014He's down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.\n\nAt this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucket dredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse Quay and quite possibly Out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:\n\n\u2014Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?\n\n\u2014Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.\n\n\u2014Needs, Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does. Everyone according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds. But talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is Out of the question and, even supposing you did, you won't get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father's house?\n\n\u2014To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.\n\n\u2014I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned. Today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.\n\n\u2014I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?\n\n\u2014A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. He takes great pride, quite legitimately, Out of you. You could go back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying, as if the whole bally station belonged to them, to give Stephen the slip in the confusion.\n\nThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as it was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister, Dilly, sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny, with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were in your shoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn't notice as much as I did but it wouldn't occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.\nHe understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it? was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.\n\n\u2014Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.\n\nThe guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by friendliness, which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled, to judge by two or three low spirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through the affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed matters to more or less... Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.\n\nAdjacent to the men's public urinal he perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.\n\n\u2014Putana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!\n\n\u2014Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi\u00f9\n\n\u2014Dice lui, pero.\n\n\u2014Farabutto! Mortacci sui!\n\nMr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been before; the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it, said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris, the invincible, though he wouldn't vouch for the actual facts, which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner, only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo, already there engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by conversation, for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.\n\n\u2014Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say a roll of some description.\n\nAccordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores, or whatever they were, after a cursory examination, turned their eyes, apparently dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded bibulous individual, a portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor, probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.\n\nMr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in an audible tone of voice, apropos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:\n\n\u2014Beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write your poetry in that language? Bella Poetria! it is so melodious and full. Belladonna voglio.\n\nStephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from dead lassitude generally, replied:\n\n\u2014To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.\n\n\u2014Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.\n\nThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed, after which he beat a retreat to his counter. Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to... for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.\n\n\u2014Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time. Like names, Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody, Jesus, Mr Doyle. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?\n\n\u2014Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.\n\nThe redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:\n\n\u2014And what might your name be?\n\nJust in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure, from an unexpected quarter, answered:\n\n\u2014Dedalus.\n\nThe sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.\n\n\u2014You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.\n\n\u2014I've heard of him, Stephen said.\n\nMr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.\n\n\u2014He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.\n\n\u2014All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.\n\nAs for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor, of his own accord, turned to the other Occupants of the shelter with the remark: I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. The left hand dead shot.\n\nThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.\n\n\u2014Bottle Out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.\n\nHe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he screwed his features up some way sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.\n\n\u2014Pom, he then shouted once.\n\nThe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.\n\n\u2014Pom, he shouted twice.\n\nEgg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:\n\nBuffalo Bill shoots to kill,\nNever missed nor he never will.\n\nA silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.\n\n\u2014Beg pardon, the sailor said.\n\n\u2014Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.\n\n\u2014Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.\n\n\u2014Murphy's my name, the sailor continued, W. B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?\n\n\u2014Queenstown Harbour, Stephen replied.\n\n\u2014That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's where I hails from. My little woman's down there. She's waiting for me, I know. For England, home and beauty. She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years now, sailing about.\n\nMr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene - the homecoming to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones - a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece, by the way, of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way? Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but I've come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grass widow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead. Rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father. Boo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband, W. B. Murphy.\n\nThe sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:\n\n\u2014You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?\n\nThe jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.\n\n\u2014Thank you, the sailor said.\n\nHe deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:\n\n\u2014We come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon. There's my discharge. See? W. B. Murphy, A. B. S.\n\nIn confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbours a not very clean looking folded document.\n\n\u2014You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor answered, upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and North America and South America. I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain Dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. Gospodi pomilooy. That's how the Russians prays.\n\n\u2014You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug, I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.\n\nHe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously.\n\n\u2014Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.\n\nHe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.\n\nAll focused their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping, amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.\n\n\u2014Chews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more children. See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver raw.\n\nHis postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes, if not more.\n\n\u2014Know how to keep them off? he inquired genially.\n\nNobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying:\n\n\u2014Glass. That boggles 'em. Glass.\n\nMr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows: Tarjeta Postal. Se\u00f1or A. Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat), having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend's bona fides, nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside, considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on, culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower, abbey, wealth of Park Lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C. P. M'Coy type - lend me your valise and I'll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star Irish cast, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with its own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.\n\nAlso, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the tapis in the Circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.\n\nIt was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for a matter of a couple of paltry pounds, was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime, for choice, when Dame Nature is at her spectacular best, constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs, even, Poulaphouca, to which there was a steam tram, but also farther away from the madding crowd, in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen, so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds of Donegal, where if report spoke true, the coup d'oeil was exceedingly grand, though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it, while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men, especially in the spring when young men s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the pillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to fathom, it seemed to him, from a motive of curiosity pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or vice-versa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to Stephen.\n\n\u2014I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened, and every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the Chinese does.\n\nPossibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces, the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures.\n\n\u2014And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his back. Knife like that.\n\nWhilst speaking he produced a dangerous looking clasp knife, quite in keeping with his character, and held it in the striking position.\n\n\u2014In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. Prepare to meet your God, says he. Chuck! It went into his back up to the butt.\n\nHis heavy glance, drowsily roaming about, kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to. That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable stiletto.\n\nAfter which harrowing d\u00e9nouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.\n\n\u2014They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.\n\nAt this remark, passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss, Mr Bloom and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias the keeper, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His inscrutable face, which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on. Funny very.\n\nThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading by fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the natives choza de; another, the seaman's discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, some score of years previously, in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.\n\n\u2014Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.\n\nThe request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape.\n\n\u2014Have you seen the Rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.\n\nThe sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay, or no.\n\n\u2014Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.\n\n\u2014What year would that be about? Mr Bloom interpolated. Can you recall the boats?\n\nOur soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile, hungrily, before answering.\n\n\u2014I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. Salt junk all the time.\n\nTired, seemingly, he ceased. His questioner, perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe. Suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant, to rule the waves. On more than one occasion - a dozen at the lowest - near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under - well, not exactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance, which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason, if no other, lifeboat Sunday was a very laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living, inland or seaside,-is the case might be, having it brought home to them like that, should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements, whatever the season, when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on, and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.\n\n\u2014There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded. Went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman's valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I've on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I'm game for that job, shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There's my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.\n\n\u2014What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance. My son Danny? He'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it.\n\nThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink, intended to represent an anchor.\n\n\u2014There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked. Sure as nuts. I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It's them black lads I objects to. I hate those buggers. Sucks your blood dry, they does.\n\nSeeing they were all looking at his chest, he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that, on top of the time honoured symbol of the mariner's hope and rest, they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man's sideface looking frowningly rather.\n\n\u2014Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton Fellow the name of Antonio done that. There he is himself, a Greek.\n\n\u2014Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.\n\nThat worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the someway in his. Squeezing or...\n\n\u2014See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is, cursing the mate. And there he is now, he added. The same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.\n\nAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody, including Skin-the-Goat who this time stretched over.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He's gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.\n\nHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.\n\n\u2014Neat bit of work, longshoreman one said.\n\n\u2014And what's the number for? loafer number two queried.\n\n\u2014Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time, with some sort of a half smile, for a brief duration only, in the direction of the questioner about the number. A Greek he was.\n\nAnd then he added, with rather gallowsbird humour, considering his alleged end:\n\n\u2014As bad as old Antonio,\nFor he left me on my ownio.\n\nThe face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat, peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment, flusterfied but outwardly calm, and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink? His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond Quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.), and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing, which seemed rather vague than not?\n\nYour washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles Street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say. Love me, love my dirty shirt. Still, just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round Skipper Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more of her.\n\n\u2014The gunboat, the keeper said.\n\n\u2014It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course, I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no matter what the cause is from...\n\nStephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:\n\n\u2014In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.\n\nThe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said that it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing he could truthfully state he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of that sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.\n\n\u2014 You, as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup? I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?\n\nThus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:\n\n\u2014They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause, Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette.\n\nMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:\n\n\u2014Simple? I shouldn't think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays R\u00f6ntgen did, Or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time, Galileo was the man I mean. The same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.\n\n\u2014O, that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the best known passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence. On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair, poles apart as they were, both in schooling and everything else, with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.\n\n\u2014Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point. I'm not so sure about that. That's a matter of every man's opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them, like Hamlet and Bacon, as you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn't tell you. Can't you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it and take a piece of that bun. It's like one of our skipper's bricks disguised. Still, no one can give what he hasn't got. Try a bit.\n\n\u2014Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.\n\nFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom thought well to stir, or try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good. Shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings, and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders. On the other hand, he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. Sulphate of copper poison, SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't remember when it was or where. Anyhow, inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.\n\n\u2014Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.\n\nThus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle - it clopped out of it when taken up - by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.\n\n\u2014Still, it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.\n\n\u2014Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But oblige me by taking away that knife. I can't look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.\n\nMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.\n\n\u2014Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom, apropos of knives, remarked to his confidente sotto voce. Do you think they are genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. Look at him.\n\nYet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.\n\nHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up, ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen Of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness, because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera. And when all was said and done, the lies a fellow told about himself couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.\n\nMind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, though, that is rather a far cry you see once in a way. Marcella, the midget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged. They couldn't straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline, the sinews, or whatever you like to call them, behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. There's an example again of simple souls.\n\nHowever, reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains), there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary, that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those Italianos, though candidly he was none the less free to admit those ice creamers and friers in the fish way, not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth, over in little Italy there, near the Coombe, were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuck in with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.\n\n\u2014Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus double quick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half, that is. Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite dark, regular brunette, black. I, for one, certainly believe climate accounts for character. That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.\n\n\u2014The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.\n\n\u2014Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.\n\n\u2014Then, Stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle, Miss Portinari, he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.\n\n\u2014It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the Kildare street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind of women here. An exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides, they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings - it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but still it's a thing I simply hate to see.\n\nInterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy, of course, had his own say to say. He had doubled the Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him, or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.\n\nSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck of Daunt's rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque - nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it, Palme, on Booterstown Strand, that was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times) breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. Lady Cairns of Swansea, run into by the Mona, which was on an Opposite tack, in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the Mona's, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.\n\nAt this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef, the sailor vacated his seat.\n\n\u2014Let me cross your bows, mate, he said to his neighbour, who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful dose.\n\nHe made tracks heavily, slowly, with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings, Mr Bloom, who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it, or unscrew, and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female, who, however, had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could, by straining, just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gazing up at the piers and girders of the Loop Line, rather out of his depth, as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but, after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme, the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself close at hand, the noise of his bilge-water some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently woke a horse of the cabrank.\n\nA hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brasier of live coke, the watcher of the corporation, who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability, from dictates of humanity, knowing him before - shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in the arms of Morpheus. A truly amazing piece of hard times in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool #100 a year at one time which of course the double-barrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink, without a beggarly stiver. He drank, needless to be told, and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if - a big if, however - he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.\n\nAll, meantime, were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra Basin, the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.\n\nThere were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said, who was evidently au fait.\n\nWhat he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway Bay when the Galway Harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask her captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British Government gave him for that day's work. Captain John Lever of the Lever line.\n\n\u2014Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.\n\nThat worthy, picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words, growled in wouldbe music, but with great vim, some Kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-cum-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soir\u00e9e, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:\n\n\u2014The biscuits was as hard as brass,\nAnd the beef as salt as Lot's wife's arse.\nO Johnny Lever!\nJohnny Lever, O!\n\nAfter which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and, regaining his seat, he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.\n\nSkin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland, or something of that sort, which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds' worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always, and gobbling up the best meat in the market, and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was Colonel Everard down there in Cavan growing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice - thoroughly monopolising all the conversation - was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero - a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.\n\nSilence all round marked the termination of his finale. The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed.\n\n\u2014Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.\n\nTo which cold douche, referring to downfall and so on, the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.\n\n\u2014Who's the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and generals we've got? Tell me that.\n\n\u2014The Irish for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.\n\n\u2014That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic peasant. He's the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?\n\nWhile allowing him his individual opinions, as every man, the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words, when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to blows.\n\nFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went On, that turned Out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries, even though poles apart. Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place, rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged, as the lookeron, a student of the human soul, if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn't the other person at all, he (Bloom) couldn't help feeling, and most properly, it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen's evidence - or king's now - like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that, he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel, and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was), a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing, off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south - have her or swing for her - when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (the man having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on\n\nhis adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell - positively last performance then come up smiling again. Generous to a fault, of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some #. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the others, he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo, as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.\n\nHe took umbrage at something or other, that much injured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew, and in a heated fashion, offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts in the least, told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his family, like me, though in reality I'm not. That was one for him. A soft answer turns away wrath. He hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone saw. Am I not right?\n\nHe turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment, with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly.\n\n\u2014Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, Christus or Bloom his name is, or, after all, any other, secundum carnem.\n\n\u2014Of course, Mr Bloom proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It's all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality? I resent violence or intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the due instalments plan. It's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, so to speak.\n\n\u2014Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen assented, between Skinner's alley and Ormond market.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right and the whole world was overwhelmingly full of that sort of thing.\n\n\u2014You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely.\n\nAll those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood - bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag - were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.\n\n\u2014They accuse - remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others, who probably... and spoke nearer to, so as the others... in case they...\n\n\u2014Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused of ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History - would you be surprised to learn? - proves up to' the hilt Spain decayed when the Inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian, who, in other respects, has much to answer for, imported them. Why? Because they are practical and are proved to be so. I don't want to indulge in any... because you know the standard works on the subject, and then, orthodox as you are... But in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America. Turks, it's in the dogma. Because if they didn't believe they'd go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better - at least, so I think. That's the juggle on which the p.p.'s raise the wind on false pretences. I'm, he resumed, with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of #300 per annum That's the vital issue at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man. At least that's my idea for what it's worth. I call that patriotism. Ubi patria, as we learned a small smattering of in our classical day in Alma Mater, vita bene. Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.\n\nOver his untasteable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning, burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn't say the words the voice he heard said - if you work.\n\n\u2014Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning to work.\n\nThe eyes were surprised at this observation, because as he, the person who owned them pro. tem. observed, or rather, his voice speaking did: All must work, have to, together.\n\n\u2014I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense. Also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays. That's work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education, you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.\n\n\u2014You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called Ireland for short.\n\n\u2014I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.\n\n\u2014But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.\n\n\u2014What belongs? queried Mr Bloom, bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately I didn't catch the latter portion. What was it you?...\n\nStephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee, Or whatever you like to call it, none too politely, adding:\n\n\u2014We can't change the country. Let us change the subject.\n\nAt this pertinent suggestion, Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down, but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say, the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way, foreign to his sober state. Probably the home life, to which Mr Bloom attached the utmost importance, had not been all that was needful or he hadn't been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear for the young man beside him, whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly, nipped in the bud of premature decay, and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance, there was the case of O'Callaghan, for one, the half crazy faddist, respectably connected, though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries, among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual d\u00e9nouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged, for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen, which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts, even In the House of Lords, because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy as the law stands was terribly down on, though not for the reason they thought they were probably, whatever it was, except women chiefly, who were always fiddling more or less at one another, it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every well tailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine fillip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.\n\nFor which and further reasons he felt it was interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlooked for occasion, though why, he could not exactly tell, being, as it was, already several shillings to the bad, having, in fact, let himself in for it. Still, to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small... Intellectual stimulation as such was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt, of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in, especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz., coalminers, divers, scavengers, etc., were very much under the microscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing. Suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column, My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabman's Shelter.\n\nThe pink edition, extra sporting, of the Telegraph, tell a graphic lie, lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was addressed to A. Boudin, find the captain's age, his eyes went aimlessly over the respective captions which came under his special province, the allembracing give us this day our daily press. First he got a bit of a start but it turned out to be only something about somebody named H. du Boyes, agent for typewriters or something like that. Great battle Tokio.

Ascot Throwaway recalls Derby of '92 when Captain Marshall's dark horse, Sir Hugo , captured the blue riband at long odds. New York disaster, thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth. Funeral of the late Mr Patrick Dignam.\n\nSo to change the subject he read about Dignam, R.I.P., which, he reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff.\n\n\u2014This morning (Hynes put it in, of course), the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount, for internment in Clasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise, after a brief illness, came as great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present, were carried out (certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny) by Messrs. H. J. O'Neill & Son, 164 North Strand road. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan (motherinlaw), John Henry Menton, solr., Martin Cunningham, John Power eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora (must be where he called Monks the dayfather about Keyes's ad), Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus, Stephen Dedalus, B. A., Edward J. Lambert, Cornelius Kelleher, Joseph M'C. Hynes, L. Boom, C. P. M'Coy, - M'Intosh, and several others.\n\nNettled not a little by L. Boom (as it incorrectly stated) and the line of bitched type, but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P. M'Coy and Stephen Dedalus, B. A., who were conspicuous, needless to say, by their total absence (to say nothing of M'Intosh), L. Boom pointed it out to his companion B. A., engaged in stifling another yawn, half nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints.\n\n\u2014Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked, as soon as his bottom jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.\n\n\u2014It is, really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford's after all managing the thing, there.\n\nWhile the other was reading it on page two Boom (to give him for the nonce his new misnomer) whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits and starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three, his sidevalue 1,000 sovs., with 3,000 sovs. In specie added for entire colts and fillies, Mr F.

Though that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left. Of course, gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though, as the event turned out, the poor fool hadn't much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.\n\n\u2014There was every indication they would arrive at that, Mr Bloom said.\n\n\u2014Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.\n\nOne morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read, Return of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after Committee Room No. 15 until he was his old self again with no-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses. Dead he wasn't. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they brought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.\n\nAll the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels, and not singly but in their thousands, and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years. Highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow of truth in the stories and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before, there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the Alice, where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart, so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility. Naturally then, it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men, which undoubtedly he was, and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So-and-So who, though they weren't even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay. And then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come back - that haunting sense kind of drew you - to show the understudy in the title r\u00f4le how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the Insuppressible or was it United Ireland, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said Thank you, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid expression notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip - what's bred in the bone. Still, as regards return, you were a lucky dog if they didn't set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed. Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials, like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne. Bella was the boat's name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in, as the evidence went to show, and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, Lord Bellew, was it? As he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with, Excuse me, my name is So-and-So or some such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, Mr Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.\n\n\u2014That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.\n\n\u2014Fine lump of a woman, all the same, the soi-disant town-clerk, Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. I seen her picture in a barber's. Her husband was a captain or an officer.\n\n\u2014Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added. He was, and a cottonball one.\n\nThis gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom, he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet nothings. First, it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them, till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however, who were resolved upon encouraging his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Sino their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact namely, that he had shared her bedroom, which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact that the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties. The usual sequel, to bask in the loved one's smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly, augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary, that is (who was just the usual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate), and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame, which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head, much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement, all seemed a kind of dream. And the coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown Strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years, looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or south however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying, as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.\n\n\u2014Just bears out what I was saying, he with glowing bosom said to Stephen. And, if I don't greatly mistake, she was Spanish too.\n\n\u2014The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.\n\n\u2014Was she? Bloom ejaculated surprised, though not astonished by any means. I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there it was, as she lived there. So, Spain.\n\nCarefully avoiding a book in his pocket Sweets of, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents rapidly, finally he.\n\n\u2014Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a fades photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?\n\nStephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady, with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion, as she was in the full bloom of womanhood, In evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted, and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano, on the rest of which was In old Madrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her (the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin's premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.\n\nMrs Bloom, my wife the prima donna, Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about '96. Very like her then.\n\nBeside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for the face, it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure, which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the... He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon, he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry. All the rest, yes, Puritanism. It does though, St Joseph's sovereign... whereas no photo could, because it simply wasn't art, in a word.\n\nThe spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he... so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional etiquette so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm... And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. Nevertheless, he sat tight, just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear, however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other's possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint. In fact, the slight soiling was only an added charm, like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better, in fact, with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he?... I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (sic) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.\n\nThe vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, distingu\u00e9, and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch, though you wouldn't think he had it in him... yet you would. Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of make-believe went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of letterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions, leaving no loophole, to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Then the decree nisi and the King's Proctor to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. But as for that, the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor, who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, Bloom, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred in the historic fracas when the fallen leader's - who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery - (leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the Insuppressible or no it was United Ireland (a by no means, by the by, appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation, reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man, he was still a commanding figure, though carelessly garbed as usual, with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay, after placing him upon a pedestal, which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell's) was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who, panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time, being a gentleman born with a stake in the country, he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone, instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: Thank you, sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference; after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.\n\nOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabmen and so on, who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones, with tears in her eyes, though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time, as quite possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed, and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either, that man, or men in the plural, were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life, and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.\n\nIt was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains, as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women, who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies' society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi- or tri-weekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentpaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers' ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other's senior or like his father. But something substantial he certainly ought to eat, were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.\n\n\u2014At what o'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.\n\n\u2014Some time yesterday, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014Yesterday, exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow, Friday. Ah, you mean it's after twelve!\n\n\u2014The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.\n\nLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence, Bloom reflected. Though they didn't see eye to eye in everything, a certain analogy there somehow was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance, when the evicted tenants' question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people's minds though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn't exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle, at all events, was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession, as voicing the trend of modern Opinion, a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of, and even was twitted with going a step further than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\n\nAnyhow, upon weighing the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw, not that the cases were either identical or the reverse, though he had hurt his hand too, to Ontario Terrace, as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives... Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. His initial impression was that he was a bit standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn't what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps's cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow. At least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet. He failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question, who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids') with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let XX equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks passim. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his God being a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles, your God was a jew, because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhere about in the county Sligo.\n\n\u2014I propose, our hero eventually suggested, after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here, you just come with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the vicinity. You can't drink that stuff. Wait, I'll just pay this lot.\n\nThe best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty, who didn't seem to...\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen, to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.\n\nAll kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (Bloom's) busy brain. Education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, hydros and concert tours in English watering resorts packed with theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.\n\nThe cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association dinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that Sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why. - Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.\n\n\u2014And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.\n\nThe sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.\n\n\u2014Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the town clerk queried.\n\n\u2014Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of sea-green portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. Sand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking. The Arabian Nights' Entertainment was my favourite and Red as a Rose is She.\n\nThereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him, as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.\n\nTo cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise to his feet so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans) he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite to him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d., confectionery do., and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark. - Come, he counselled, to close the s\u00e9ance.\n\nSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear, they left the shelter or shanty together and the \u00e9lite society of oil skin and company whom nothing short Of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment... the door to...\n\n\u2014One thing I never understood, he said, to be original on the spur of the moment, why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down on the tables In cafes.\n\nTo which impromptu the never failing Bloom replied without a moment's hesitation, saying straight off:\n\n\u2014To sweep the floor in the morning.\n\nSo saying he skipped around nimbly, considering frankly, at the same time apologetic, to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the by, the right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.\n\n\u2014It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man. It's not far. Lean on me.\n\nAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on accordingly.\n\n\u2014Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.\n\nAnyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier, etc. where the municipal supernumerary, ex-Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones, the analogy was not at all bad, as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.\n\nSo they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's Huguenots, Meyerbeer's Seven Last Words on the Cross, and Mozart's Twelfth Mass, he simply revelled in, the Gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini's Stabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers' church in Upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and, suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character, there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole, though favouring preferably light opera of the Don Giovanni description, and Martha, a gem in its line, he had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par excellence Lionel's air in Martha, M'appari, which, curiously enough, he heard, or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn't but launched out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom did not quite recall, though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and Byrd (William), who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen's Chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.\n\nOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swing chain, a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught a right the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.\n\nBy the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other's sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:\n\n\u2014Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.\n\nThey thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near, so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh, because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger, putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute, he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big foolish nervous noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees; whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator, tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke; chalk a circle for a rooster; tiger, my eagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind, somewhat distracted from Stephen's words, while the ship of the street was manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old...\n\n\u2014What's this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging in medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.\n\nHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual blackguard type they unquestionably had an indubitable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.\n\nStill, supposing he had his father's gift, as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind, such as Lady Fingall's Irish industries concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.\n\nExquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here has End by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:\n\nVon der Sirenen Listigkeit\nTun die Poeten dichten.\n\nThese opening bars he sang and translated extempore. Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means, which he did.\n\nA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entr\u00e9e into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in- society's sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record - in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus omne. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big if however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped-up a too much feted prince of good fellows. And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.\n\nThe horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person's character, no pun intended.\n\nThe horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted\nand, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.\n\nSide by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.\n\nUnd alle Schiffe br\u00fccken.\n\nThe driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by Father Maher. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their t\u00e9te \u00e0 t\u00e9te (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

Burton", "lyrics": "Arabian Nights, Vol. 10 (Chap. 1) LyricsMa'aruf the Cobbler and His Wife Fatimah\n\n\nThere dwelt once upon a time in the God-guarded city of Cairo a cobbler who lived by patching old shoes.[FN#1] His name was Ma'aruf[FN#2] and he had a wife called Fatimah, whom the folk had nicknamed \"The Dung;\"[FN#3] for that she was a whorish, worthless wretch, scanty of shame and mickle of mischief. She ruled her spouse and abused him; and he feared her malice and dreaded her misdoings; for that he was a sensible man but poor-conditioned. When he earned much, he spent it on her, and when he gained little, she revenged herself on his body that night, leaving him no peace and making his night black as her book;[FN#4] for she was even as of one like her saith the poet:\u2014\n\nHow manifold nights have I passed with my wife * In the saddest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  plight with all misery rife:\nWould Heaven when first I went in to her * With a cup of cold\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   poison I'd ta'en her life.\n\nOne day she said to him, \"O Ma'aruf, I wish thee to bring me this night a vermicelli-cake dressed with bees' honey.\"[FN#5] He replied, \"So Allah Almighty aid me to its price, I will bring it thee. By Allah, I have no dirhams to-day, but our Lord will make things easy.\"[FN#6] Rejoined she,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\nWhen it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetieth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ma'aruf the Cobbler said to his spouse, \"By Allah, I have no dirhams to-day, but our Lord will make things easy to me!\" She rejoined, \"I wot naught of these words; look thou come not to me save with the vermicelli and bees' honey; else will I make thy night black as thy fortune whenas thou fellest into my hand.\" Quoth he, \"Allah is bountiful!\" and going out with grief scattering itself from his body, prayed the dawn-prayer and opened his shop. After which he sat till noon, but no work came to him and his fear of his wife redoubled. Then he arose and went out perplexed as to how he should do in the matter of the vermicelli-cake, seeing he had not even the wherewithal to buy bread. Presently he came to the shop of the Kunafah-seller and stood before it, whilst his eyes brimmed with tears. The pastry-cook glanced at him and said, \"O Master Ma'aruf, why dost thou weep? Tell me what hath befallen thee.\" So he acquainted him with his case, saying, \"My wife would have me bring her a Kunafah; but I have sat in my shop till past mid-day and have not gained even the price of bread; wherefore I am in fear of her.\" The cook laughed and said, \"No harm shall come to thee. How many pounds wilt thou have?\" \"Five pounds,\" answered Ma'aruf. So the man weighed him out five pounds of vermicelli-cake and said to him, \"I have clarified butter, but no bees' honey. Here is drip-honey,[FN#7] however, which is better than bees' honey; and what harm will there be, if it be with drip-honey?\" Ma'aruf was ashamed to object, because the pastry-cook was to have patience with him for the price, and said, \"Give it me with drip-honey.\" So he fried a vermicelli-cake for him with butter and drenched it with drip-honey, till it was fit to present to Kings. Then he asked him, \"Dost thou want bread[FN#8] and cheese?\"; and Ma'aruf answered, \"Yes.\" So he gave him four half dirhams worth of bread and one of cheese, and the vermicelli was ten nusfs. Then said he, \"Know, O Ma'aruf, that thou owest me fifteen nusfs; so go to thy wife and make merry and take this nusf for the Hammam;[FN#9] and thou shalt have credit for a day or two or three till Allah provide thee with thy daily bread. And straiten not thy wife, for I will have patience with thee till such time as thou shalt have dirhams to spare.\" So Ma'aruf took the vermicelli-cake and bread and cheese and went away, with a heart at ease, blessing the pastry-cook and saying, \"Extolled be Thy perfection, O my Lord! How bountiful art Thou!\" When he came home, his wife enquired of him, \"Hast thou brought the vermicelli-cake?\"; and, replying \"Yes,\" he set it before her. She looked at it and seeing that it was dressed with cane-honey,[FN#10] said to him, \"Did I not bid thee bring it with bees' honey? Wilt thou contrary my wish and have it dressed with cane-honey?\" He excused himself to her, saying, \"I bought it not save on credit;\" but said she, \"This talk is idle; I will not eat Kunafah save with bees' honey.\" And she was wroth with it and threw it in his face, saying, \"Begone, thou pimp, and bring me other than this !\" Then she dealt him a buffet on the cheek and knocked out one of his teeth. The blood ran down upon his breast and for stress of anger he smote her on the head a single blow and a slight; whereupon she clutched his beard and fell to shouting out and saying, \"Help, O Moslems!\" So the neighbours came in and freed his beard from her grip; then they reproved and reproached her, saying, \"We are all content to eat Kunafah with cane-honey. Why, then, wilt thou oppress this poor man thus? Verily, this is disgraceful in thee!\" And they went on to soothe her till they made peace between her and him. But, when the folk were gone, she sware that she would not eat of the vermicelli, and Ma'aruf, burning with hunger, said in himself, \"She sweareth that she will not eat; so I will e'en eat.\" Then he ate, and when she saw him eating, she said, \"Inshallah, may the eating of it be poison to destroy the far one's body.\"[FN#11] Quoth he, \"It shall not be at thy bidding,\" and went on eating, laughing and saying, \"Thou swarest that thou wouldst not eat of this; but Allah is bountiful, and to-morrow night, an the Lord decree, I will bring thee Kunafah dressed with bees' honey, and thou shalt eat it alone.\" And he applied himself to appeasing her, whilst she called down curses upon him; and she ceased not to rail at him and revile him with gross abuse till the morning, when she bared her forearm to beat him. Quoth he, \"Give me time and I will bring thee other vermicelli-cake.\" Then he went out to the mosque and prayed, after which he betook himself to his shop and opening it, sat down; but hardly had he done this when up came two runners from the Kazi's court and said to him, \"Up with thee, speak with the Kazi, for thy wife hath complained of thee to him and her favour is thus and thus.\" He recognised her by their description; and saying, \"May Allah Almighty torment her!\" walked with them till he came to the Kazi's presence, where he found Fatimah standing with her arm bound up and her face-veil besmeared with blood; and she was weeping and wiping away her tears. Quoth the Kazi, \"Ho man, hast thou no fear of Allah the Most High? Why hast thou beaten this good woman and broken her forearm and knocked out her tooth and entreated her thus?\" And quoth Ma'aruf, \"If I beat her or put out her tooth, sentence me to what thou wilt; but in truth the case was thus and thus and the neighbours made peace between me and her.\" And he told him the story from first to last. Now this Kazi was a benevolent man; so he brought out to him a quarter dinar, saying, \"O man, take this and get her Kunafah with bees' honey and do ye make peace, thou and she.\" Quoth Ma'aruf, \"Give it to her.\" So she took it and the Kazi made peace between them, saying, \"O wife, obey thy husband; and thou, O man, deal kindly with her.[FN#12]\" Then they left the court, reconciled at the Kazi's hands, and the woman went one way, whilst her husband returned by another way to his shop and sat there, when, behold, the runners came up to him and said, \"Give us our fee.\" Quoth he, \"The Kazi took not of me aught; on the contrary, he gave me a quarter dinar.\" But quoth they \"'Tis no concern of ours whether the Kazi took of thee or gave to thee, and if thou give us not our fee, we will exact it in despite of thee.\" And they fell to dragging him about the market; so he sold his tools and gave them half a dinar, whereupon they let him go and went away, whilst he put his hand to his cheek and sat sorrowful, for that he had no tools wherewith to work. Presently, up came two ill-favoured fellows and said to him, \"Come, O man, and speak with the Kazi; for thy wife hath complained of thee to him.\" Said he, \"He made peace between us just now.\" But said they, \"We come from another Kazi, and thy wife hath complained of thee to our Kazi.\" So he arose and went with them to their Kazi, calling on Allah for aid against her; and when he saw her, he said to her, \"Did we not make peace, good woman?\" Whereupon she cried, \"There abideth no peace between me and thee.\" Accordingly he came forward and told the Kazi his story, adding, \"And indeed the Kazi Such-an-one made peace between us this very hour.\" Whereupon the Kazi said to her, \"O strumpet, since ye two have made peace with each other, why comest thou to me complaining?\" Quoth she, \"He beat me after that;\" but quoth the Kazi, \"Make peace each with other, and beat her not again, and she will cross thee no more.\" So they made peace and the Kazi said to Ma'aruf, \"Give the runners their fee.\" So he gave them their fee and going back to his shop, opened it and sat down, as he were a drunken man for excess of the chagrin which befel him. Presently, while he was still sitting, behold, a man came up to him and said, \"O Ma'aruf, rise and hide thyself, for thy wife hath complained of thee to the High Court[FN#13] and Ab\u00fa Tabak[FN#14] is after thee.\" So he shut his shop and fled towards the Gate of Victory.[FN#15] He had five nusfs of silver left of the price of the lasts and gear; and therewith he bought four worth of bread and one of cheese, as he fled from her. Now it was the winter season and the hour of mid-afternoon prayer; so, when he came out among the rubbish-mounds the rain descended upon him, like water from the mouths of water-skins, and his clothes were drenched. He therefore entered the 'Adiliyah,[FN#16] where he saw a ruined place and therein a deserted cell without a door; and in it he took refuge and found shelter from the rain. The tears streamed from his eyelids, and he fell to complaining of what had betided him and saying, \"Whither shall I flee from this whore? I beseech Thee, O Lord, to vouchsafe me one who shall conduct me to a far country, where she shall not know the way to me!\" Now while he sat weeping, behold, the wall clave and there came forth to him therefrom one of tall stature, whose aspect caused his body-pile to bristle and his flesh to creep, and said to him, \"O man, what aileth thee that thou disturbest me this night? These two hundred years have I dwelt here and have never seen any enter this place and do as thou dost. Tell me what thou wishest and I will accomplish thy need, as ruth for thee hath got hold upon my heart.\" Quoth Ma'aruf, \"Who and what art thou?\"; and quoth he, \"I am the Haunter[FN#17] of this place.\" So Ma'aruf told him all that had befallen him with his wife and he said, \"Wilt thou have me convey thee to a country, where thy wife shall know no way to thee?\" \"Yes,\" said Ma'aruf; and the other, \"Then mount my back.\" So he mounted on his back and he flew with him from after supper-tide till daybreak, when he set him down on the top of a high mountain\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Marid having taken up Ma'aruf the Cobbler, flew off with him and set him down upon a high mountain and said to him, \"O mortal, descend this mountain and thou wilt see the gate of a city. Enter it, for therein thy wife cannot come at thee.\" He then left him and went his way, whilst Ma'aruf abode in amazement and perplexity till the sun rose, when he said to himself, \"I will up with me and go down into the city: indeed there is no profit in my abiding upon this highland.\" So he descended to the mountain-foot and saw a city girt by towering walls, full of lofty palaces and gold-adorned buildings which was a delight to beholders. He entered in at the gate and found it a place such as lightened the grieving heart; but, as he walked through the streets the townsfolk stared at him as a curiosity and gathered about him, marvelling at his dress, for it was unlike theirs. Presently, one of them said to him, \"O man, art thou a stranger?\" \"Yes.\" \"What countryman art thou?\" \"I am from the city of Cairo the Auspicious.\" \"And when didst thou leave Cairo?\" \"I left it yesterday, at the hour of afternoon-prayer.\" Whereupon the man laughed at him and cried out, saying, \"Come look, O folk, at this man and hear what he saith!\" Quoth they, \"What doeth he say?\"; and quoth the townsman, \"He pretendeth that he cometh from Cairo and left it yesterday at the hour of afternoon-prayer!\" At this they all laughed and gathering round Ma'aruf, said to him, \"O man, art thou mad to talk thus? How canst thou pretend that thou leftest Cairo at mid-afternoon yesterday and foundedst thyself this morning here, when the truth is that between our city and Cairo lieth a full year's journey?\" Quoth he, \"None is mad but you. As for me, I speak sooth, for here is bread which I brought with me from Cairo, and see, 'tis yet new.\" Then he showed them the bread and they stared at it, for it was unlike their country bread. So the crowd increased about him and they said to one another, \"This is Cairo bread: look at it;\" and he became a gazing-stock in the city and some believed him, whilst others gave him the lie and made mock of him. Whilst this was going on, behold, up came a merchant riding on a she-mule and followed by two black slaves, and brake a way through the people, saying, \"O folk, are ye not ashamed to mob this stranger and make mock of him and scoff at him?\" And he went on to rate them, till he drave them away from Ma'aruf, and none could make him any answer. Then he said to the stranger, \"Come, O my brother, no harm shall betide thee from these folk. Verily they have no shame.\"[FN#18] So he took him and carrying him to a spacious and richly-adorned house, seated him in a speak-room fit for a King, whilst he gave an order to his slaves, who opened a chest and brought out to him a dress such as might be worn by a merchant worth a thousand.[FN#19] He clad him therewith and Ma'aruf, being a seemly man, became as he were consul of the merchants. Then his host called for food and they set before them a tray of all manner exquisite viands. The twain ate and drank and the merchant said to Ma'aruf, \"O my brother, what is thy name?\" \"My name is Ma'aruf and I am a cobbler by trade and patch old shoes.\" \"What countryman art thou?\" \"I am from Cairo.\" \"What quarter?\" \"Dost thou know Cairo?\" \"I am of its children.[FN#20] I come from the Red Street.[FN#21]\" \"And whom dost thou know in the Red Street?\" \"I know such an one and such an one,\" answered Ma'aruf and named several people to him. Quoth the other, \"Knowest thou Shaykh Ahmad the druggist?[FN#22]\" \"He was my next neighbour, wall to wall.\" \"Is he well?\" \"Yes.\" \"How many sons hath he?\" \"Three, Mustaf\u00e0, Mohammed and Ali.\" \"And what hath Allah done with them?\" \"As for Mustaf\u00e0, he is well and he is a learned man, a professor[FN#23]: Mohammed is a druggist and opened him a shop beside that of his father, after he had married, and his wife hath borne him a son named Hasan.\" \"Allah gladden thee with good news!\" said the merchant; and Ma'aruf continued, \"As for Ali, he was my friend, when we were boys, and we always played together, I and he. We used to go in the guise of the children of the Nazarenes and enter the church and steal the books of the Christians and sell them and buy food with the price. It chanced once that the Nazarenes caught us with a book; whereupon they complained of us to our folk and said to Ali's father:\u2014An thou hinder not thy son from troubling us, we will complain of thee to the King. So he appeased them and gave Ali a thrashing; wherefore he ran away none knew whither and he hath now been absent twenty years and no man hath brought news of him.\" Quoth the host, \"I am that very Ali, son of Shaykh Ahmad the druggist, and thou art my playmate Ma'aruf.\"[FN#24] So they saluted each other and after the salam Ali said, \"Tell me why, O Ma'aruf, thou camest from Cairo to this city.\" Then he told him all that had befallen him of ill-doing with his wife Fatimah the Dung and said, \"So, when her annoy waxed on me, I fled from her towards the Gate of Victory and went forth the city. Presently, the rain fell heavy on me; so I entered a ruined cell in the Adiliyah and sat there, weeping; whereupon there came forth to me the Haunter of the place, which was an Ifrit of the Jinn, and questioned me. I acquainted him with my case and he took me on his back and flew with me all night between heaven and earth, till he set me down on yonder mountain and gave me to know of this city. So I came down from the mountain and entered the city, when people crowded about me and questioned me. I told them that I had left Cairo yesterday, but they believed me not, and presently thou camest up and driving the folk away from me, carriedst me this house. Such, then, is the cause of my quitting Cairo; and thou, what object brought thee hither?\" Quoth Ali, \"The giddiness[FN#25] of folly turned my head when I was seven years old, from which time I wandered from land to land and city to city, till I came to this city, the name whereof is Ikhtiy\u00e1n al-Khatan.[FN#26] I found its people an hospitable folk and a kindly, compassionate for the poor man and selling to him on credit and believing all he said. So quoth I to them:\u2014I am a merchant and have preceded my packs and I need a place wherein to bestow my baggage. And they believed me and assigned me a lodging. Then quoth I to them:\u2014Is there any of you will lend me a thousand dinars, till my loads arrive, when I will repay it to him; for I am in want of certain things before my goods come? They gave me what I asked and I went to the merchants' bazar, where, seeing goods, I bought them and sold them next day at a profit of fifty gold pieces and bought others.[FN#27] And I consorted with the folk and entreated them liberally, so that they loved me, and I continued to sell and buy, till I grew rich. Know, O my brother, that the proverb saith, The world is show and trickery: and the land where none wotteth thee, there do whatso liketh thee. Thou too, an thou say to all who ask thee, I'm a cobbler by trade and poor withal, and I fled from my wife and left Cairo yesterday, they will not believe thee and thou wilt be a laughing-stock among them as long as thou abidest in the city; whilst, an thou tell them, An Ifrit brought me hither, they will take fright at thee and none will come near thee; for they will say, This man is possessed of an Ifrit and harm will betide whoso approacheth him. And such public report will be dishonouring both to thee and to me, because they ken I come from Cairo.\" Ma'aruf asked:\u2014\"How then shall I do?\"; and Ali answered, \"I will tell thee how thou shalt do, Inshallah! To-morrow I will give thee a thousand dinars and a she-mule to ride and a black slave, who shall walk before thee and guide thee to the gate of the merchants' bazar; and do thou go into them. I will be there sitting amongst them, and when I see thee, I will rise to thee and salute thee with the salam and kiss thy hand and make a great man of thee. Whenever I ask thee of any kind of stuff, saying, Hast thou brought with thee aught of such a kind? do thou answer, \"Plenty.[FN#28]\" And if they question me of thee, I will praise thee and magnify thee in their eyes and say to them, Get him a store-house and a shop. I also will give thee out for a man of great wealth and generosity; and if a beggar come to thee, bestow upon him what thou mayst; so will they put faith in what I say and believe in thy greatness and generosity and love thee. Then will I invite thee to my house and invite all the merchants on thy account and bring together thee and them, so that all may know thee and thou know them,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-second Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant Ali said to Ma'aruf, \"I will invite thee to my house and invite all the merchants on thy account and bring together thee and them, so that all may know thee and thou know them, whereby thou shalt sell and buy and take and give with them; nor will it be long ere thou become a man of money.\" Accordingly, on the morrow he gave him a thousand dinars and a suit of clothes and a black slave and mounting him on a she-mule, said to him, \"Allah give thee quittance of responsibility for all this,[FN#29] inasmuch as thou art my friend and it behoveth me to deal generously with thee. Have no care; but put away from thee the thought of thy wife's misways and name her not to any.\" \"Allah requite thee with good!\" replied Ma'aruf and rode on, preceded by his blackamoor till the slave brought him to the gate of the merchants' bazar, where they were all seated, and amongst them Ali, who when he saw him, rose and threw himself upon him, crying, \"A blessed day, O Merchant Ma'aruf, O man of good works and kindness[FN#30]!\" And he kissed his hand before the merchants and said to them, \"Our brothers, ye are honoured by knowing[FN#31] the merchant Ma'aruf.\" So they saluted him, and Ali signed to them to make much of him, wherefore he was magnified in their eyes. Then Ali helped him to dismount from his she-mule and saluted him with the salam; after which he took the merchants apart, one after other, and vaunted Ma'aruf to them. They asked, \"Is this man a merchant?;\" and he answered, \"Yes; and indeed he is the chiefest of merchants, there liveth not a wealthier than he; for his wealth and the riches of his father and forefathers are famous among the merchants of Cairo. He hath partners in Hind and Sind and Al-Yaman and is high in repute for generosity. So know ye his rank and exalt ye his degree and do him service, and wot also that his coming to your city is not for the sake of traffic, and none other save to divert himself with the sight of folk's countries: indeed, he hath no need of strangerhood for the sake of gain and profit, having wealth that fires cannot consume, and I am one of his servants.\" And he ceased not to extol him, till they set him above their heads and began to tell one another of his qualities. Then they gathered round him and offered him junkets[FN#32] and sherbets, and even the Consul of the Merchants came to him and saluted him; whilst Ali proceeded to ask him, in the presence of the traders, \"O my lord, haply thou hast brought with thee somewhat of such and such a stuff?\"; and Ma'aruf answered,\"Plenty.\" Now Ali had that day shown him various kinds of costly clothes and had taught him the names of the different stuffs, dear and cheap. Then said one of the merchants, \"O my lord, hast thou brought with thee yellow broad cloth?\": and Ma'aruf said, \"Plenty\"! Quoth another, \"And gazelles' blood red[FN#33]?\"; and quoth the Cobbler, \"Plenty\"; and as often as he asked him of aught, he made him the same answer. So the other said, \"O Merchant Ali had thy countryman a mind to transport a thousand loads of costly stuffs, he could do so\"; and Ali said, \"He would take them from a single one of his store-houses, and miss naught thereof.\" Now whilst they were sitting, behold, up came a beggar and went the round of the merchants. One gave him a half dirham and another a copper,[FN#34] but most of them gave him nothing, till he came to Ma'aruf who pulled out a handful of gold and gave it to him, whereupon he blessed him and went his ways. The merchants marvelled at this and said, \"Verily, this is a King's bestowal for he gave the beggar gold without count, and were he not a man of vast wealth and money without end, he had not given a beggar a handful of gold.\" After a while, there came to him a poor woman and he gave her a handful of gold; whereupon she went away, blessing him, and told the other beggars, who came to him, one after other, and he gave them each a handful of gold, till he disbursed the thousand dinars. Then he struck hand upon hand and said, \"Allah is our sufficient aid and excellent is the Agent!\" Quoth the Consul, \"What aileth thee, O Merchant Ma'aruf?\"; and quoth he, \"It seemeth that the most part of the people of this city are poor and needy; had I known their misery I would have brought with me a large sum of money in my saddle-bags and given largesse thereof to the poor. I fear me I may be long abroad[FN#35] and 'tis not in my nature to baulk a beggar; and I have no gold left: so, if a pauper come to me, what shall I say to him?\" Quoth the Consul, \"Say, Allah will send thee thy daily bread[FN#36]!\"; but Ma'aruf replied, \"That is not my practice and I am care-ridden because of this. Would I had other thousand dinars, wherewith to give alms till my baggage come!\" \"Have no care for that,\" quoth the Consul and sending one of his dependents for a thousand dinars, handed them to Ma'aruf, who went on giving them to every beggar who passed till the call to noon-prayer. Then they entered the Cathedral-mosque and prayed the noon-prayers, and what was left him of the thousand gold pieces he scattered on the heads of the worshippers. This drew the people's attention to him and they blessed him, whilst the merchants marvelled at the abundance of his generosity and openhandedness. Then he turned to another trader and borrowing of him other thousand ducats, gave these also away, whilst Merchant Ali looked on at what he did, but could not speak. He ceased not to do thus till the call to mid-afternoon prayer, when he entered the mosque and prayed and distributed the rest of the money. On this wise, by the time they locked the doors of the bazar,[FN#37] he had borrowed five thousand sequins and given them away, saying to every one of whom he took aught, \"Wait till my baggage come when, if thou desire gold I will give thee gold, and if thou desire stuffs, thou shalt have stuffs; for I have no end of them.\" At eventide Merchant Ali invited Ma'aruf and the rest of the traders to an entertainment and seated him in the upper end, the place of honour, where he talked of nothing but cloths and jewels, and whenever they made mention to him of aught, he said, \"I have plenty of it.\" Next day, he again repaired to the market-street where he showed a friendly bias towards the merchants and borrowed of them more money, which he distributed to the poor: nor did he leave doing thus twenty days, till he had borrowed threescore thousand dinars, and still there came no baggage, no, nor a burning plague.[FN#38] At last folk began to clamour for their money and say, \"The merchant Ma'aruf's baggage cometh not. How long will he take people's monies and give them to the poor?\" And quoth one of them, \"My rede is that we speak to Merchant Ali.\" So they went to him and said, \"O Merchant Ali, Merchant Ma'aruf's baggage cometh not.\" Said he, \"Have patience, it cannot fail to come soon.\" Then he took Ma'aruf aside and said to him, \"O Ma'aruf, what fashion is this? Did I bid thee brown[FN#39] the bread or burn it? The merchants clamour for their coin and tell me that thou owest them sixty thousand dinars, which thou hast borrowed and given away to the poor. How wilt thou satisfy the folk, seeing that thou neither sellest nor buyest?\" Said Ma'aruf, \"What matters it[FN#40]; and what are threescore thousand dinars? When my baggage shall come, I will pay them in stuffs or in gold and silver, as they will.\" Quoth Merchant Ali, \"Allah is Most Great! Hast thou then any baggage?\"; and he said, \"Plenty.\" Cried the other, \"Allah and the Hallows[FN#41] requite thee thine impudence! Did I teach thee this saying, that thou shouldst repeat it to me? But I will acquaint the folk with thee.\" Ma'aruf rejoined, \"Begone and prate no more! Am I a poor man? I have endless wealth in my baggage and as soon as it cometh, they shall have their money's worth two for one. I have no need of them.\" At this Merchant Ali waxed wroth and said, \"Unmannerly wight that thou art, I will teach thee to lie to me and be not ashamed!\" Said Ma'aruf, \"E'en work the worst thy hand can do! They must wait till my baggage come, when they shall have their due and more.\" So Ali left him and went away, saying in himself, \"I praised him whilome and if I blame him now, I make myself out a liar and become of those of whom it is said:- -Whoso praiseth and then blameth lieth twice.\"[FN#42] And he knew not what to do. Presently, the traders came to him and said, \"O Merchant Ali, hast thou spoken to him?\" Said he, \"O folk, I am ashamed and, though he owe me a thousand dinars, I cannot speak to him. When ye lent him your money ye consulted me not; so ye have no claim on me. Dun him yourselves, and if he pay you not, complain of him to the King of the city, saying:\u2014He is an impostor who hath imposed upon us. And he will deliver you from the plague of him.\" Accordingly, they repaired to the King and told him what had passed, saying, \"O King of the age, we are perplexed anent this merchant, whose generosity is excessive; for he doeth thus and thus, and all he borroweth, he giveth away to the poor by handsful. Were he a man of naught, his sense would not suffer him to lavish gold on this wise; and were he a man of wealth, his good faith had been made manifest to us by the coming of his baggage; but we see none of his luggage, although he avoucheth that he hath baggage-train and hath preceded it. Now some time hath past, but there appeareth no sign of his baggage-train, and he oweth us sixty thousand gold pieces, all of which he hath given away in alms.\" And they went on to praise him and extol his generosity. Now this King was a very covetous man, a more covetous than Ash'ab[FN#43]; and when he heard tell of Ma'aruf's generosity and openhandedness, greed of gain got the better of him and he said to his Wazir, \"Were not this merchant a man of immense wealth, he had not shown all this munificence. His baggage-train will assuredly come, whereupon these merchants will flock to him and he will scatter amongst them riches galore. Now I have more right to this money than they; wherefore I have a mind to make friends with him and profess affection for him, so that, when his baggage cometh whatso the merchants would have had I shall get of him; and I will give him my daughter to wife and join his wealth to my wealth.\" Replied the Wazir, \"O King of the age, methinks he is naught but an impostor, and 'tis the impostor who ruineth the house of the covetous;\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-third Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir said to the King, \"Methinks he is naught but an impostor, and 'tis the impostor who ruineth the house of the covetous;\" the King said, \"O Wazir, I will prove him and soon know if he be an impostor or a true man and whether he be a rearling of Fortune or not.\" The Wazir asked, \"And how wilt thou prove him?\"; and the King answered, \"I will send for him to the presence and entreat him with honour and give him a jewel which I have. An he know it and wot its price, he is a man of worth and wealth; but an he know it not, he is an impostor and an upstart and I will do him die by the foulest fashion of deaths.\" So he sent for Ma'aruf, who came and saluted him. The King returned his salam and seating him beside himself, said to him, \"Art thou the merchant Ma'aruf?\" and said he, \"Yes.\" Quoth the King, \"The merchants declare that thou owest them sixty thousand ducats. Is this true?\" \"Yes,\" quoth he. Asked the King, \"Then why dost thou not give them their money?\"; and he answered, \"Let them wait till my baggage come and I will repay them twofold. An they wish for gold, they shall have gold; and should they wish for silver, they shall have silver; or an they prefer for merchandise, I will give them merchandise; and to whom I owe a thousand I will give two thousand in requital of that wherewith he hath veiled my face before the poor; for I have plenty.\" Then said the King, \"O merchant, take this and look what is its kind and value.\" And he gave him a jewel the bigness of a hazel-nut, which he had bought for a thousand sequins and not having its fellow, prized it highly. Ma'aruf took it and pressing it between his thumb and forefinger brake it, for it was brittle and would not brook the squeeze. Quoth the King, \"Why hast thou broken the jewel?\"; and Ma'aruf laughed and said, \"O King of the age, this is no jewel. This is but a bittock of mineral worth a thousand dinars; why dost thou style it a jewel? A jewel I call such as is worth threescore and ten thousand gold pieces and this is called but a piece of stone. A jewel that is not of the bigness of a walnut hath no worth in my eyes and I take no account thereof. How cometh it, then, that thou, who art King, stylest this thing a jewel, when 'tis but a bit of mineral worth a thousand dinars? But ye are excusable, for that ye are poor folk and have not in your possession things of price.\" The King asked, \"O merchant, hast thou jewels such as those whereof thou speakest?\"; and he answered, \"Plenty.\" Whereupon avarice overcame the King and he said, \"Wilt thou give me real jewels?\" Said Ma'aruf, \"When my baggage-train shall come, I will give thee no end of jewels; and all that thou canst desire I have in plenty and will give thee, without price.\" At this the King rejoiced and said to the traders, \"Wend your ways and have patience with him, till his baggage arrive, when do ye come to me and receive your monies from me.\" So they fared forth and the King turned to his to his Wazir and said to him, Pay court to Merchant Ma'aruf and take and give with him in talk and bespeak him of my daughter, Princess Duny\u00e1, that he may wed her and so we gain these riches he hath.\" Said the Wazir, \"O King of the age, this man's fashion misliketh me and methinks he is an impostor and a liar: so leave this whereof thou speakest lest thou lose thy daughter for naught.\" Now this Minister had sued the King aforetime to give him his daughter to wife and he was willing to do so, but when she heard of it she consented not to marry him. Accordingly, the King said to him, \"O traitor, thou desirest no good for me, because in past time thou soughtest my daughter in wedlock, but she would none of thee; so now thou wouldst cut off the way of her marriage and wouldst have the Princess lie fallow, that thou mayst take her; but hear from me one word. Thou hast no concern in this matter. How can he be an impostor and a liar, seeing that he knew the price of the jewel, even that for which I bought it, and brake it because it pleased him not? He hath jewels in plenty, and when he goeth in to my daughter and seeth her to be beautiful she will captivate his reason and he will love her and give her jewels and things of price: but, as for thee, thou wouldst forbid my daughter and myself these good things.\" So the Minister was silent, for fear of the King's anger, and said to himself, \"Set the curs on the cattle[FN#44]!\" Then with show of friendly bias he betook himself to Ma'aruf and said to him, \"His Highness the King loveth thee and hath a daughter, a winsome lady and a lovesome, to whom he is minded to marry thee. What sayst thou?\" Said he, \"No harm in that; but let him wait till my baggage come, for marriage-settlements on Kings' daughters are large and their rank demandeth that they be not endowed save with a dowry befitting their degree. At this present I have no money with me till the coming of my baggage, for I have wealth in plenty and needs must I make her marriage-portion five thousand purses. Then I shall need a thousand purses to distribute amongst the poor and needy on my wedding-night, and other thousand to give to those who walk in the bridal procession and yet other thousand wherewith to provide provaunt for the troops and others[FN#45]; and I shall want an hundred jewels to give to the Princess on the wedding-morning[FN#46] and other hundred gems to distribute among the slavegirls and eunuchs, for I must give each of them a jewel in honour of the bride; and I need wherewithal to clothe a thousand naked paupers, and alms too needs must be given. All this cannot be done till my baggage come; but I have plenty and, once it is here, I shall make no account of all this outlay.\" The Wazir returned to the King and told him what Ma'aruf said, whereupon quoth he, \"Since this is his wish, how canst thou style him impostor and liar?\" Replied the Minister, \"And I cease not to say this.\" But the King chid him angrily and threatened him, saying, \"By the life of my head, an thou cease not this talk, I will slay thee! Go back to him and fetch him to me and I will manage matters with him myself.\" So the Wazir returned to Ma'aruf and said to him, \"Come and speak with the King.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" said Ma'aruf and went in to the King, who said to him, \"Thou shalt not put me off with these excuses, for my treasury is full; so take the keys and spend all thou needest and give what thou wilt and clothe the poor and do thy desire and have no care for the girl and the handmaids. When the baggage shall come, do what thou wilt with thy wife, by way of generosity, and we will have patience with thee anent the marriage-portion till then, for there is no manner of difference betwixt me and thee; none at all.\" Then he sent for the Shaykh Al-Islam[FN#47] and bade him write out the marriage-contract between his daughter and Merchant Ma'aruf, and he did so; after which the King gave the signal for beginning the wedding festivities and bade decorate the city. The kettle drums beat and the tables were spread with meats of all kinds and there came performers who paraded their tricks. Merchant Ma'aruf sat upon a throne in a parlour and the players and gymnasts and effeminates[FN#48] and dancing-men of wondrous movements and posture-makers of marvellous cunning came before him, whilst he called out to the treasurer and said to him, \"Bring gold and silver.\" So he brought gold and silver and Ma'aruf went round among the spectators and largessed each performer by the handful; and he gave alms to the poor and needy and clothes to the naked and it was a clamorous festival and a right merry. The treasurer could not bring money fast enough from the treasury, and the Wazir's heart was like to burst for rage; but he dared not say a word, whilst Merchant Ali marvelled at this waste of wealth and said to Merchant Ma'aruf, \"Allah and the Hallows visit this upon on thy head-sides[FN#49]! Doth it not suffice thee to squander the traders' money, but thou must squander that of the King to boot?\" Replied Ma'aruf, \"'Tis none of thy concern: whenas my baggage shall come, I will requite the King manifold.\" And he went on lavishing money and saying in himself, \"A burning plague! What will happen will happen and there is no flying from that which is fore-ordained.\" The festivities ceased not for the space of forty days, and on the one-and-fortieth day, they made the bride's cort\u00e8ge and all the Emirs and troops walked before her. When they brought her in before Ma'aruf, he began scattering gold on the people's heads, and they made her a mighty fine procession, whilst Ma'aruf expended in her honour vast sums of money. Then they brought him in to Princess Dunya and he sat down on the high divan; after which they let fall the curtains and shut the doors and withdrew, leaving him alone with his bride; whereupon he smote hand upon hand and sat awhile sorrowful and saying, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" Quoth the Princess, \"O my lord, Allah preserve thee! What aileth thee that thou art troubled?\" Quoth he, \"And how should I be other than troubled, seeing that thy father hath embarrassed me and done with me a deed which is like the burning of green corn?\" She asked, \"And what hath my father done with thee? Tell me!\"; and he answered, \"He hath brought me in to thee before the coming of my baggage, and I want at very least an hundred jewels to distribute among thy handmaids, to each a jewel, so she might rejoice therein and say, My lord gave me a jewel on the night of his going in to my lady. This good deed would I have done in honour of thy station and for the increase of thy dignity; and I have no need to stint myself in lavishing jewels, for I have of them great plenty.\" Rejoined she, \"Be not concerned for that. As for me, trouble not thyself about me, for I will have patience with thee till thy baggage shall come, and as for my women have no care for them. Rise, doff thy clothes and take thy pleasure; and when the baggage cometh we shall get the jewels and the rest.\" So he arose and putting off his clothes sat down on the bed and sought love-liesse and they fell to toying with each other. He laid his hand on her knee and she sat down in his lap and thrust her lip like a tit-bit of meat into his mouth, and that hour was such as maketh a man to forget his father and his mother. So he clasped her in his arms and strained her fast to his breast and sucked her lip, till the honey-dew ran out into his mouth; and he laid his hand under her left-armpit, whereupon his vitals and her vitals yearned for coition. Then he clapped her between the breasts and his hand slipped down between her thighs and she girded him with her legs, whereupon he made of the two parts proof amain and crying out, \"O sire of the chin-veils twain[FN#50]!\" applied the priming and kindled the match and set it to the touch-hole and gave fire and breached the citadel in its four corners; so there befel the mystery[FN#51] concerning which there is no enquiry: and she cried the cry that needs must be cried.[FN#52]\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it Was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that while the Princess Duny\u00e1 cried the cry which must be cried, Merchant Ma'aruf abated her maidenhead and that night was one not to be counted among lives for that which it comprised of the enjoyment of the fair, clipping and dallying langue fourr\u00e9e and futtering till the dawn of day, when he arose and entered the Hammam whence, after donning a suit for sovrans suitable he betook himself to the King's Divan. All who were there rose to him and received him with honour and worship, giving him joy and invoking blessings upon him; and he sat down by the King's side and asked, \"Where is the treasurer?\" They answered, \"Here he is, before thee,\" and he said to him, \"Bring robes of honour for all the Wazirs and Emirs and dignitaries and clothe them therewith.\" The treasurer brought him all he sought and he sat giving to all who came to him and lavishing largesse upon every man according to his station. On this wise he abode twenty days, whilst no baggage appeared for him nor aught else, till the treasurer was straitened by him to the uttermost and going in to the King, as he sat alone with the Wazir in Ma'aruf's absence, kissed ground between his hands and said, \"O King of the age, I must tell thee somewhat, lest haply thou blame me for not acquainting thee therewith. Know that the treasury is being exhausted; there is none but a little money left in it and in ten days more we shall shut it upon emptiness.\" Quoth the King, \"O Wazir, verily my son-in-law's baggage-train tarrieth long and there appeareth no news thereof.\" The Minister laughed and said , Allah be gracious to thee, O King of the age! Thou art none other but heedless with respect to this impostor, this liar. As thy head liveth, there is no baggage for him, no, nor a burning plague to rid us of him! Nay, he hath but imposed on thee without surcease, so that he hath wasted thy treasures and married thy daughter for naught. How long therefore wilt thou be heedless of this liar?\" Then quoth the King, \"O Wazir, how shall we do to learn the truth of his case?\"; and quoth the Wazir, \"O King of the age, none may come at a man's secret but his wife; so send for thy daughter and let her come behind the curtain, that I may question her of the truth of his estate, to the intent that she may make question of him and acquaint us with his case.\" Cried the King, \"There is no harm in that; and as my head liveth, if it be proved that he is a liar and an impostor, I will verily do him die by the foulest of deaths!\" Then he carried the Wazir into the sitting-chamber and sent for his daughter, who came behind the curtain, her husband being absent, and said, \"What wouldst thou, O my father?\" Said he \"Speak with the Wazir.\" So she asked, \"Ho thou, the Wazir, what is thy will?\"; and he answered, \"O my lady, thou must know that thy husband hath squandered thy father's substance and married thee without a dower; and he ceaseth not to promise us and break his promises, nor cometh there any tidings of his baggage; in short we would have thee inform us concerning him.\" Quoth she, \"Indeed his words be many, and he still cometh and promiseth me jewels and treasures and costly stuffs; but I see nothing.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"O my lady, canst thou this night take and give with him in talk and whisper to him:\u2014Say me sooth and fear from me naught, for thou art become my husband and I will not transgress against thee. So tell me the truth of the matter and I will devise thee a device whereby thou shalt be set at rest. And do thou play near and far[FN#53] with him in words and profess love to him and win him to confess and after tell us the facts of his case.\" And she answered, \"O my papa, I know how I will make proof of him.\" Then she went away and after supper her husband came in to her, according to his wont, whereupon Princess Dunya rose to him and took him under the armpit and wheedled him with winsomest wheedling (and all-sufficient[FN#54] are woman's wiles whenas she would aught of men); and she ceased not to caress him and beguile him with speech sweeter than the honey till she stole his reason; and when she saw that he altogether inclined to her, she said to him, \"O my beloved, O coolth of my eyes and fruit of my vitals, Allah never desolate me by less of thee nor Time sunder us twain me and thee! Indeed, the love of thee hath homed in my heart and the fire of passion hath consumed my liver, nor will I ever forsake thee or transgress against thee. But I would have thee tell me the truth, for that the sleights of falsehood profit not, nor do they secure credit at all seasons. How long wilt thou impose upon my father and lie to him? I fear lest thine affair be discovered to him, ere we can devise some device and he lay violent hands upon thee? So acquaint me with the facts of the case for naught shall befal thee save that which shall begladden thee; and, when thou shalt have spoken sooth, fear not harm shall betide thee. How often wilt thou declare that thou art a merchant and a man of money and hast a luggage-train? This long while past thou sayest, My baggage! my baggage! but there appeareth no sign of thy baggage, and visible in thy face is anxiety on this account. So an there be no worth in thy words, tell me and I will contrive thee a contrivance whereby by thou shalt come off safe, Inshallah!\" He replied, \"I will tell thee the truth, and then do thou whatso thou wilt.\" Rejoined she, \"Speak and look thou speak soothly; for sooth is the ark of safety, and beware of lying, for it dishonoureth the liar and God-gifted is he who said:\u2014\n\n'Ware that truth thou speak, albe sooth when said * Shall cause\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    thee in threaten\u00e8d fire to fall:\nAnd seek Allah's approof, for most foolish he * Who shall anger\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   his Lord to make friends with thrall.\"\n\nHe said, \"Know, then, O my lady, that I am no merchant and have no baggage, no, nor a burning plague; nay, I was but a cobbler in my own country and had a wife called Fatimah the Dung, with whom there befel me this and that.\" And he told her his story from beginning to end; whereat she laughed and said, \"Verily, thou art clever in the practice of lying and imposture!\" Whereto he answered, \"O my lady, may Allah Almighty preserve thee to veil sins and countervail chagrins!\" Rejoined she, \"Know, that thou imposedst upon my sire and deceivedst him by dint of thy deluding vaunts, so that of his greed for gain he married me to thee. Then thou squanderedst his wealth and the Wazir beareth thee a grudge for this. How many a time hath he spoken against thee to my father, saying, Indeed, he is an impostor, a liar! But my sire hearkened not to his say, for that he had sought me in wedlock and I consented not that he be baron and I femme. However, the time grew longsome upon my sire and he became straitened and said to me, Make him confess. So I have made thee confess and that which was covered is discovered. Now my father purposeth thee a mischief because of this; but thou art become my husband and I will never transgress against thee. An I told my father what I have learnt from thee, he would be certified of thy falsehood and imposture and that thou imposest upon Kings' daughters and squanderest royal wealth: so would thine offence find with him no pardon and he would slay thee sans a doubt: wherefore it would be bruited among the folk that I married a man who was a liar, an impostor, and this would smirch mine honour. Furthermore an he kill thee, most like he will require me to wed another, and to such thing I will never consent; no, not though I die![FN#55] So rise now and don a Mameluke's dress and take these fifty thousand dinars of my monies, and mount a swift steed and get thee to a land whither the rule of my father doth not reach. Then make thee a merchant and send me a letter by a courier who shall bring it privily to me, that I may know in what land thou art, so I may send thee all my hand can attain. Thus shall thy wealth wax great and if my father die, I will send for thee, and thou shalt return in respect and honour; and if we die, thou or I and go to the mercy of God the Most Great, the Resurrection shall unite us. This, then, is the rede that is right: and while we both abide alive and well, I will not cease to send thee letters and monies. Arise ere the day wax bright and thou be in perplexed plight and perdition upon thy head alight!\" Quoth he, \"O my lady, I beseech thee of thy favour to bid me farewell with thine embracement;\" and quoth she, \"No harm in that.\"[FN#56] So he embraced her and knew her carnally; after which he made the Ghusl-ablution; then, donning the dress of a white slave, he bade the syces saddle him a thoroughbred steed. Accordingly, they saddled him a courser and he mounted and farewelling his wife, rode forth the city at the last of the night, whilst all who saw him deemed him one of the Mamelukes of the Sultan going abroad on some business. Next morning, the King and his Wazir repaired to the sitting-chamber and sent for Princess Dunya who came behind the curtain; and her father said to her, \"O my daughter, what sayst thou?\" Said she, \"I say, Allah blacken thy Wazir's face, because he would have blackened my face in my husband's eyes!\" Asked the King, \"How so?\"; and she answered, \"He came in to me yesterday; but, before I could name the matter to him, behold, in walked Faraj the Chief Eunuch, letter in hand, and said:\u2014Ten white slaves stand under the palace window and have this letter, saying:\u2014Kiss for us the hands of our lord, Merchant Ma'aruf, and give him this letter, for we are of his Mamelukes with the baggage, and it hath reached us that he hath wedded the King's daughter, so we are come to acquaint him with that which befel us by the way. Accordingly I took the letter and read as follows:\u2014From the five hundred Mamelukes to his highness our lord Merchant Ma'aruf. But further. We give thee to know that, after thou quittedst us, the Arabs[FN#57] came out upon us and attacked us. They were two thousand horse and we five hundred mounted slaves and there befel a mighty sore fight between us and them. They hindered us from the road thirty days doing battle with them and this is the cause of our tarrying from thee.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Dunya said to her sire, \"My husband received a letter from his dependents ending with:\u2014The Arabs hindered us from the road thirty days which is the cause of our being behind time. They also took from us of the luggage two hundred loads of cloth and slew of us fifty Mamelukes. When the news reached my husband, he cried, Allah disappoint them! What ailed them to wage war with the Arabs for the sake of two hundred loads of merchandise? What are two hundred loads? It behoved them not to tarry on that account, for verily the value of the two hundred loads is only some seven thousand dinars. But needs must I go to them and hasten them. As for that which the Arabs have taken, 'twill not be missed from the baggage, nor doth it weigh with me a whit, for I reckon it as if I had given it to them by way of an alms. Then he went down from me, laughing and taking no concern for the wastage of his wealth nor the slaughter of his slaves. As soon as he was gone, I looked out from the lattice and saw the ten Mamelukes who had brought him the letter, as they were moons, each clad in a suit of clothes worth two thousand dinars, there is not with my father a chattel to match one of them. He went forth with them to bring up his baggage and hallowed be Allah who hindered me from saying to him aught of that thou badest me, for he would have made mock of me and thee, and haply he would have eyed me with the eye of disparagement and hated me. But the fault is all with thy Wazir,[FN#58] who speaketh against my husband words that besit him not.\" Replied the King, \"O my daughter, thy husband's wealth is indeed endless and he recketh not of it; for, from the day he entered our city, he hath done naught but give alms to the poor. Inshallah, he will speedily return with the baggage, and good in plenty shall betide us from him.\" And he went on to appease her and menace the Wazir, being duped by her device. So fared it with the King; but as regards Merchant Ma'aruf he rode on into waste lands, perplexed and knowing not to what quarter he should betake him; and for the anguish of parting he lamented and in the pangs of passion and love-longing he recited these couplets:\u2014\n\nTime falsed our Union and divided who were one in tway; * And the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sore tyranny of Time doth melt my heart away:\nMine eyes ne'er cease to drop the tear for parting with my dear;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * When shall Disunion come to end and dawn the Union-day?\nO favour like the full moon's face of sheen, indeed I'm he * Whom\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  thou didst leave with vitals torn when faring on thy way.\nWould I had never seen thy sight, or met thee for an hour; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Since after sweetest taste of thee to bitters I'm a prey.\nMa'aruf will never cease to be enthralled by Duny\u00e1's[FN#59]\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  charms * And long live she albe he die whom love and longing\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  slay,\nO brilliance, like resplendent sun of noontide, deign them heal *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    His heart for kindness[FN#60] and the fire of longing love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   allay!\nWould Heaven I wot an e'er the days shall deign conjoin our lots,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * Join us in pleasant talk o' nights, in Union glad and gay:\nShall my love's palace hold two hearts that savour joy, and I *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Strain to my breast the branch I saw upon the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   sand-hill[FN#61] sway?\nO favour of full moon in sheen, never may sun o' thee * Surcease\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    to rise from Eastern rim with all-enlightening ray!\nI'm well content with passion-pine and all its bane and bate *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    For luck in love is evermore the butt of jealous Fate.\nAnd when he ended his verses, he wept with sore weeping, for indeed the ways were walled up before his face and death seemed to him better than dreeing life, and he walked on like a drunken man for stress of distraction, and stayed not till noontide, when he came to a little town and saw a plougher hard by, ploughing with a yoke of bulls. Now hunger was sore upon him; and he went up to the ploughman and said to him, \"Peace be with thee!\"; and he returned his salam and said to him, \"Welcome, O my lord! Art thou one of the Sultan's Mamelukes?\" Quoth Ma'aruf, \"Yes;\" and the other said \"Alight with me for a guest-meal.\" Whereupon Ma'aruf knew him to be of the liberal and said to him, \"O my brother, I see with thee naught with which thou mayst feed me: how is it, then, that thou invitest me?\" Answered the husbandman, \"O my lord, weal is well nigh.[FN#62] Dismount thee here: the town is near hand and I will go and fetch thee dinner and fodder for thy stallion.\" Rejoined Ma'aruf, \"Since the town is near at hand, I can go thither as quickly as thou canst and buy me what I have a mind to in the bazar and eat.\" The peasant replied, \"O my lord, the place is but a little village[FN#63] and there is no bazar there, neither selling nor buying. So I conjure thee by Allah, alight here with me and hearten my heart, and I will run thither and return to thee in haste.\" Accordingly he dismounted and the Fellah left him and went off to the village, to fetch dinner for him whilst Ma'aruf sat awaiting him. Presently he said in himself, \"I have taken this poor man away from his work; but I will arise and plough in his stead, till he come back, to make up for having hindered him from his work.[FN#64]\" Then he took the plough and starting the bulls, ploughed a little, till the share struck against something and the beasts stopped. He goaded them on, but they could not move the plough; so he looked at the share and finding it caught in a ring of gold, cleared away the soil and saw that it was set centre-most a slab of alabaster, the size of the nether millstone. He strave at the stone till he pulled it from its place, when there appeared beneath it a souterrain with a stair. Presently he descended the flight of steps and came to a place like a Hammam, with four da\u00efses, the first full of gold, from floor to roof, the second full of emeralds and pearls and coral also from ground to ceiling; the third of jacinths and rubies and turquoises and the fourth of diamonds and all manner other preciousest stones. At the upper end of the place stood a coffer of clearest crystal, full of union-gems each the size of a walnut, and upon the coffer lay a casket of gold, the bigness of a lemon. When he saw this, he marvelled and rejoiced with joy exceeding and said to himself, \"I wonder what is in this casket?\" So he opened it and found therein a seal-ring of gold, whereon were graven names and talismans, as they were the tracks of creeping ants. He rubbed the ring and behold, a voice said, \"Adsum! Here am I, at thy service, O my lord! Ask and it shall be given unto thee. Wilt thou raise a city or ruin a capital or kill a king or dig a river-channel or aught of the kind? Whatso thou seekest, it shall come to pass, by leave of the King of All-might, Creator of day and night.\" Ma'aruf asked, \"O creature of my lord, who and what art thou?\"; and the other answered, \"I am the slave of this seal-ring standing in the service of him who possesseth it. Whatsoever he seeketh, that I accomplish for him, and I have no excuse in neglecting that he biddeth me do; because I am Sultan over two-and-seventy tribes of the Jinn, each two-and-seventy thousand in number every one of which thousand ruleth over a thousand Marids, each Marid over a thousand Ifrits, each Ifrit over a thousand Satans and each Satan over a thousand Jinn: and they are all under command of me and may not gainsay me. As for me, I am spelled to this seal-ring and may not thwart whoso holdeth it. Lo! thou hast gotten hold of it and I am become thy slave; so ask what thou wilt, for I hearken to thy word and obey thy bidding; and if thou have need of me at any time, by land or by sea rub the signet-ring and thou wilt find me with thee. But beware of rubbing it twice in succession, or thou wilt consume me with the fire of the names graven thereon; and thus wouldst thou lose me and after regret me. Now I have acquainted thee with my case and\u2014the Peace!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Slave of the Signet-ring acquainted Ma'aruf with his case, the Merchant asked him, \"What is thy name?\" and the Jinni answered, \"My name is Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t.[FN#65]\" Quoth Ma'aruf, \"O Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t what is this place and who enchanted thee in this casket?\"; and quoth he, \"O my lord, this is a treasure called the Hoard of Shadd\u00e1d son of Ad, him who the base of Many-columned Iram laid, the like of which in the lands was never made.[FN#66]' I was his slave in his lifetime and this is his seal-ring, which he laid up in his treasure; but it hath fallen to thy lot.\" Ma'aruf enquired, \"Canst thou transport that which is in this hoard to the surface of the earth?\"; and the Jinni replied, \"Yes! Nothing were easier.\" Said Ma'aruf, \"Bring it forth and leave naught.\" So the Jinni signed with his hand to the ground, which clave asunder, and he sank and was absent a little while. Presently, there came forth young boys full of grace, and fair of face bearing golden baskets filled with gold which they emptied out and going away, returned with more; nor did they cease to transport the gold and jewels, till ere an hour had sped they said, \"Naught is left in the hoard.\" Thereupon out came Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t and said to Ma'aruf, \"O my lord, thou seest that we have brought forth all that was in the hoard.\" Ma'aruf asked, \"Who be these beautiful boys?\" and the Jinni answered, \"They are my sons. This matter merited not that I should muster for it the Marids, wherefore my sons have done thy desire and are honoured by such service. So ask what thou wilt beside this.\" Quoth Ma'aruf, \"Canst thou bring me he-mules and chests and fill the chests with the treasure and load them on the mules?\" Quoth Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t, \"Nothing easier,\" and cried a great cry; whereupon his sons presented themselves before him, to the number of eight hundred, and he said to them, \"Let some of you take the semblance of he-mules and others of muleteers and handsome Mamelukes, the like of the least of whom is not found with any of the Kings; and others of you be transmewed to muleteers, and the rest to menials.\" So seven hundred of them changed themselves into b\u00e2t-mules and other hundred took the shape of slaves. Then Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t called upon his Marids, who presented themselves between his hands and he commanded some of them to assume the aspect of horses saddled with saddles of gold crusted with jewels. And when Ma'aruf saw them do as he bade he cried, \"Where be the chests?\" They brought them before him and he said, \"Pack the gold and the stones, each sort by itself.\" So they packed them and loaded three hundred he-mules with them. Then asked Ma'aruf, \"O Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t, canst thou bring me some loads of costly stuffs?\"; and the Jinni answered, \"Wilt thou have Egyptian stuffs or Syrian or Persian or Indian or Greek?\" Ma'aruf said, \"Bring me an hundred loads of each kind, on five hundred mules;\" and Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t, \"O my lord accord me delay that I may dispose my Marids for this and send a company of them to each country to fetch an hundred loads of its stuffs and then take the form of he-mules and return, carrying the stuffs.\" Ma'aruf enquired, \"What time dost thou want?\"; and Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t replied, \"The time of the blackness of the night, and day shall not dawn ere thou have all thou desirest.\" Said Ma'aruf, \"I grant thee this time,\" and bade them pitch him a pavilion. So they pitched it and he sat down therein and they brought him a table of food. Then said Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t to him, \"O my lord, tarry thou in this tent and these my sons shall guard thee: so fear thou nothing; for I go to muster my Marids and despatch them to do thy desire.\" So saying, he departed, leaving Ma'aruf seated in the pavilion, with the table before him and the Jinni's sons attending upon him, in the guise of slaves and servants and suite. And while he sat in this state behold, up came the husband man, with a great porringer of lentils[FN#67] and a nose-bag full of barley and seeing the pavilion pitched and the Mamelukes standing, hands upon breasts, thought that the Sultan was come and had halted on that stead. So he stood openmouthed and said in himself, \"Would I had killed a couple of chickens and fried them red with clarified cow-butter for the Sultan!\" And he would have turned back to kill the chickens as a regale for the Sultan; but Ma'aruf saw him and cried out to him and said to the Mamelukes, \"Bring him hither.\" So they brought him and his porringer of lentils before Ma'aruf, who said to him, \"What is this?\" Said the peasant, \"This is thy dinner and thy horse's fodder! Excuse me, for I thought not that the Sultan would come hither; and, had I known that, I would have killed a couple of chickens and entertained him in goodly guise.\" Quoth Ma'aruf, \"The Sultan is not come. I am his son-in-law and I was vexed with him. However he hath sent his officers to make his peace with me, and now I am minded to return to city. But thou hast made me this guest-meal without knowing me, and I accept it from thee, lentils though it be, and will not eat save of thy cheer.\" Accordingly he bade him set the porringer amiddlemost the table and ate of it his sufficiency, whilst the Fellah filled his belly with those rich meats. Then Ma'aruf washed his hands and gave the Mamelukes leave to eat; so they fell upon the remains of the meal and ate; and, when the porringer was empty, he filled it with gold and gave it to the peasant, saying, \"Carry this to thy dwelling and come to me in the city, and I will entreat thee with honour.\" Thereupon the peasant took the porringer full of gold and returned to the village, driving the bulls before him and deeming himself akin to the King. Meanwhile, they brought Ma'aruf girls of the Brides of the Treasure,[FN#68] who smote on instruments of music and danced before him, and he passed that night in joyance and delight, a night not to be reckoned among lives. Hardly had dawned the day when there arose a great cloud of dust which presently lifting, discovered seven hundred mules laden with stuffs and attended by muleteers and baggage-tenders and cresset-bearers. With them came Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t, riding on a she-mule, in the guise of a caravan-leader, and before him was a travelling-litter, with four corner-terminals[FN#69] of glittering red gold, set with gems. When Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t came up to the tent, he dismounted and kissing the earth, said to Ma'aruf, \"O my lord, thy desire hath been done to the uttermost and in the litter is a treasure-suit which hath not its match among Kings' raiment: so don it and mount the litter and bid us do what thou wilt.\" Quoth Ma'aruf, \"O Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t, I wish thee to go to the city of Ikhtiyan al-Khatan and present thyself to my father-in-law the King; and go thou not in to him but in the guise of a mortal courier;\" and quoth he, \"To hear is to obey.\" So Ma'aruf wrote a letter to the Sultan and sealed it and Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t took it and set out with it; and when he arrived, he found the King saying, \"O Wazir, indeed my heart is concerned for my son-in-law and I fear lest the Arabs slay him. Would Heaven I wot whither he was bound, that I might have followed him with the troops! Would he had told me his destination!\" Said the Wazir, \"Allah be merciful to thee for this thy heedlessness! As thy head liveth, the wight saw that we were awake to him and feared dishonour and fled, for he is nothing but an impostor, a liar.\" And behold, at this moment in came the courier and kissing ground before the King, wished him permanent glory and prosperity and length of life. Asked the King, \"Who art thou and what is thy business?\" \"I am a courier,\" answered the Jinni, \"and thy son-in-law who is come with the baggage sendeth me to thee with a letter, and here it is!\" So he took the letter and read therein these words, \"After salutations galore to our uncle[FN#70] the glorious King! Know that I am at hand with the baggage-train: so come thou forth to meet me with the troops.\" Cried the King, \"Allah blacken thy brow, O Wazir! How often wilt thou defame my son-in-law's name and call him liar and impostor? Behold, he is come with the baggage-train and thou art naught but a traitor.\" The Minister hung his head ground-wards in shame and confusion and replied, \"O King of the age, I said not this save because of the long delay of the baggage and because I feared the loss of the wealth he hath wasted.\" The King exclaimed, \"O traitor, what are my riches! Now that his baggage is come he will give me great plenty in their stead.\" Then he bade decorate the city and going in to his daughter, said to her, \"Good news for thee! Thy husband will be here anon with his baggage; for he hath sent me a letter to that effect and here am I now going forth to meet him.\" The Princess Duny\u00e1 marvelled at this and said in herself, \"This is a wondrous thing! Was he laughing at me and making mock of me, or had he a mind to try me, when he told me that he was a pauper? But Alhamdolillah, Glory to God, for that I failed not of my duty to him!\" On this wise fared it in the palace; but as regards Merchant Ali, the Cairene, when he saw the decoration of the city and asked the cause thereof, they said to him, \"The baggage-train of Merchant Ma'aruf, the King's son-in-law, is come.\" Said he, \"Allah is Almighty! What a calamity is this man![FN#71] He came to me, fleeing from his wife, and he was a poor man. Whence then should he get a baggage-train? But haply this is a device which the King's daughter hath contrived for him, fearing his disgrace, and Kings are not unable to do anything. May Allah the Most High veil his fame and not bring him to public shame!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,\n\nShe pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Merchant Ali asked the cause of the decorations, they told him the truth of the case; so he blessed Merchant Ma'aruf and cried, \"May Allah Almighty veil his fame and not bring him to public shame!\" And all the merchants rejoiced and were glad for that they would get their monies. Then the King assembled his troops and rode forth, whilst Ab\u00fa al-Sa'\u00e1d\u00e1t returned to Ma'aruf and acquainted him with the delivering of the letter. Quoth Ma'aruf, \"Bind on the loads;\" and when they had done so, he donned the treasure-suit and mounting the litter became a thousand times greater and more majestic than the King. Then he set forward; but, when he had gone half-way, behold, the King met him with the troops, and seeing him riding in the Takhtrawan and clad in the dress aforesaid, threw himself upon him and saluted him, and giving him joy of his safety, greeted him with the greeting of peace. Then all the Lords of the land saluted him and it was made manifest that he had spoken the truth and that in him there was no lie. Presently he entered the city in such state procession as would have caused the gall-bladder of the lion to burst[FN#72] for envy and the traders pressed up to him and kissed his hands, whilst Merchant Ali said to him, \"Thou hast played off this trick and it hath prospered to thy hand, O Shaykh of Impostors! But thou deservest it and may Allah the Most High increase thee of His bounty!\"; whereupon Ma'aruf laughed. Then he entered the palace and sitting down on the throne said, \"Carry the loads of gold into the treasury of my uncle the King and bring me the bales of cloth.\" So they brought them to him and opened them before him, bale after bale, till they had unpacked the seven hundred loads, whereof he chose out the best and said, \"Bear these to Princess Duny\u00e1 that she may distribute them among her slavegirls; and carry her also this coffer of jewels, that she may divide them among her handmaids and eunuchs.\" Then he proceeded to make over to the merchants in whose debt he was stuffs by way of payment for their arrears, giving him whose due was a thousand, stuffs worth two thousand or more; after which he fell to distributing to the poor and needy, whilst the King looked on with greedy eyes and could not hinder him; nor did he cease largesse till he had made an end of the seven hundred loads, when he turned to the troops and proceeded to apportion amongst them emeralds and rubies and pearls and coral and other jewels by handsful, without count, till the King said to him, \"Enough of this giving, O my son! There is but little left of the baggage.\" But he said, \"I have plenty.\" Then indeed, his good faith was become manifest and none could give him the lie; and he had come to reck not of giving, for that the Slave of the Seal-ring brought him whatsoever he sought. Presently, the treasurer came in to the King and said, \"O King of the age, the treasury is full indeed and will not hold the rest of the loads. Where shall we lay that which is left of the gold and jewels?\" And he assigned to him another place. As for the Princess Dunya when she saw this, her joy redoubled and she marvelled and said in herself, \"Would I wot how came he by all this wealth!\" In like manner the traders rejoiced in that which he had given them and blessed him; whilst Merchant Ali marvelled and said to himself, \"I wonder how he hath lied and swindled, that he hath gotten him all these treasures[FN#73]? Had they come from the King's daughter, he had not wasted them on this wise! But how excellent is his saying who said:\u2014\n\nWhen the Kings' King giveth, in reverence pause * And venture not\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   to enquire the cause:\nAllah gives His gifts unto whom He will, * So respect and abide\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  by His Holy Laws!\"\n\nSo far concerning him; but as regards the King, he also marvelled with passing marvel at that which he saw of Ma'aruf's generosity and open-handedness in the largesse of wealth. Then the Merchant went in to his wife, who met him, smiling and laughing-lipped and kissed his hand, saying, \"Didst thou mock me or hadst thou a mind to prove me with thy saying:\u2014I am a poor man and a fugitive from my wife? Praised be Allah for that I failed not of my duty to thee! For thou art my beloved and there is none dearer to me than thou, whether thou be rich or poor. But I would have thee tell me what didst thou design by these words.\" Said Ma'aruf, \"I wished to prove thee and see whether thy love were sincere or for the sake of wealth and the greed of worldly good. But now 'tis become manifest to me that thine affection is sincere and as thou art a true woman, so welcome to thee! I know thy worth.\" Then he went apart into a place by himself and rubbed the seal-ring, whereupon Abu al-Sa'adat presented himself and said to him, \"Adsum, at thy service! Ask what thou wilt.\" Quoth Ma'aruf, \"I want a treasure-suit and treasure-trinkets for my wife, including a necklace of forty unique jewels.\" Quoth the Jinni, \"To hear is to obey,\" and brought him what he sought, whereupon Ma'aruf dismissed him and carrying the dress and ornaments in to his wife, laid them before her and said, \"Take these and put them on and welcome!\" When she saw this, her wits fled for joy, and she found among the ornaments a pair of anklets of gold set with jewels of the handiwork of the magicians, and bracelets and earrings and a belt[FN#74] such as no money could buy. So she donned the dress and ornaments and said to Ma'aruf, \"O my lord, I will treasure these up for holidays and festivals.\" But he answered, \"Wear them always, for I have others in plenty.\" And when she put them on and her women beheld her, they rejoiced and bussed his hands. Then he left them and going apart by himself, rubbed the seal-ring whereupon its slave appeared and he said to him, \"Bring me an hundred suits of apparel, with their ornaments of gold.\" \"Hearing and obeying,\" answered Abu al-Sa'adat and brought him the hundred suits, each with its ornaments wrapped up within it. Ma'aruf took them and called aloud to the slave-girls, who came to him and he gave them each a suit: so they donned them and became like the black-eyed girls of Paradise, whilst the Princess Dunya shone amongst them as the moon among the stars. One of the handmaids told the King of this and he came in to his daughter and saw her and her women dazzling all who beheld them; whereat he wondered with passing wonderment. Then he went out and calling his Wazir, said to him, \"O Wazir, such and such things have happened; what sayst thou now of this affair?\" Said he, \"O King of the age, this be no merchant's fashion; for a merchant keepeth a piece of linen by him for years and selleth it not but at a profit. How should a merchant have generosity such as this generosity, and whence should he get the like of these monies and jewels, of which but a slight matter is found with the Kings? So how should loads thereof be found with merchants? Needs must there be a cause for this; but, an thou wilt hearken to me, I will make the truth of the case manifest to thee.\" Answered the King, \"O Wazir, I will do thy bidding.\" Rejoined the Minister, \"Do thou foregather with thy son-in-law and make a show of affect to him and talk with him and say:\u2014O my son-in-law, I have a mind to go, I and thou and the Wazir but no more, to a flower-garden that we may take our pleasure there. When we come to the garden, we will set on the table wine, and I will ply him therewith and compel him to drink; for, when he shall have drunken, he will lose his reason and his judgment will forsake him. Then we will question him of the truth of his case and he will discover to us his secrets, for wine is a traitor and Allah-gifted is he who said:\u2014\n\nWhen we drank the wine, and it crept its way * To the place of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Secrets, I cried, \"O stay!\"\nIn my fear lest its influence stint my wits * And my friends spy\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   matters that hidden lay.\n\nWhen he hath told us the truth we shall ken his case and may deal with him as we will; because I fear for thee the consequences of this his present fashion: haply he will covet the kingship and win over the troops by generosity and lavishing money and so depose thee and take the kingdom from thee.\" \"True,\" answered the King.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,\n\nShe resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir devised this device the King said to him, \"Thou hast spoken sooth!\"; and they passed the night on this agreement. And when morning morrowed the King went forth and sat in the guest-chamber, when lo, and behold! the grooms and serving-men came in to him in dismay. Quoth he, \"What hath befallen you?\"; and quoth they, \"O King of the age, the Syces curried the horses and foddered them and the he-mules which brought the baggage; but, when we arose in the morning, we found that thy son-in-law's Mamelukes had stolen the horses and mules. We searched the stables, but found neither horse nor mule; so we entered the lodging of the Mamelukes and found none there, nor know we how they fled.\" The King marvelled at this, unknowing that the horses and Mamelukes were all Ifrits, the subjects of the Slave of the Spell, and asked the grooms, \"O accursed how could a thousand beasts and five hundred slaves and servants flee without your knowledge?\" Answered they, \"We know not how it happened,\" and he cried, \"Go, and when your lord cometh forth of the Harim, tell him the case.\" So they went out from before the King and sat down bewildered, till Ma'aruf came out and, seeing them chagrined enquired of them, \"What may be the matter?\" They told him all that had happened and he said, \"What is their worth that ye should be concerned for them? Wend your ways.\" And he sat laughing and was neither angry nor grieved concerning the case; whereupon the King looked in the Wazir's face and said to him, \"What manner of man is this, with whom wealth is of no worth? Needs must there be a reason for this?\" Then they talked with him awhile and the King said to him, \"O my son-in-law, I have a mind to go, I, thou and the Wazir, to a garden, where we may divert ourselves.\" \"No harm in that,\" said Ma'aruf. So they went forth to a flower-garden, wherein every sort of fruit was of kinds twain and its waters were flowing and its trees towering and its birds carolling. There they entered a pavilion, whose sight did away sorrow from the soul, and sat talking, whilst the Minister entertained them with rare tales and quoted merry quips and mirth-provoking sayings and Ma'aruf attentively listened, till the time of dinner came, when they set on a tray of meats and a flagon of wine. When they had eaten and washed hands, the Wazir filled the cup and gave it to the King, who drank it off; then he filled a second and handed it to Ma'aruf, saying, \"Take the cup of the drink to which Reason boweth neck in reverence.\" Quoth Ma'aruf, \"What is this, O Wazir?\"; and quoth he, \"This is the grizzled[FN#75] virgin and the old maid long kept at home,[FN#76] the giver of joy to hearts, whereof saith the poet:\u2014\n\nThe feet of sturdy Miscreants[FN#77] went trampling heavy tread,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   * And she hath ta'en a vengeance dire on every Arab's head.\nA K\u00e1fir youth like fullest moon in darkness hands her round *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Whose eyne are strongest cause of sin by him inspirit\u00e8d.\n\nAnd Allah-gifted is he who said:\u2014\n\n'Tis as if wine and he who bears the bowl, * Rising to show her charms for man to see,[FN#78] Were dancing undurn-Sun whose face the moon * Of night adorned with stars of Gemini.

The Wazir ceased not to fill for him and he to drink and enjoy himself and make merry, till his wits wandered and he could not distinguish right from wrong. When the Minister saw that drunkenness had attained in him to utterest and the bounds transgressed, he said to him, \"By Allah, O Merchant Ma'aruf, I admire whence thou gottest these jewels whose like the Kings of the Chosro\u00ebs possess not! In all our lives never saw we a merchant that had heaped up riches like unto thine or more generous than thou, for thy doings are the doings of Kings and not merchants' doings. Wherefore, Allah upon thee, do thou acquaint me with this, that I may know thy rank and condition.\" And he went on to test him with questions and cajole him, till Ma'aruf, being reft of reason, said to him, \"I'm neither merchant nor King,\" and told him his whole story from first to last. Then said the Wazir, \"I conjure thee by Allah, O my lord Ma'aruf, show us the ring, that we may see its make.\" So, in his drunkenness, he pulled off the ring and said, \"Take it and look upon it.\" The Minister took it and turning it over, said, \"If I rub it, will its slave appear?\" Replied Ma'aruf, \"Yes. Rub it and he will appear to thee, and do thou divert thyself with the sight of him.\" Thereupon the Wazir rubbed the ring and behold forthright appeared the Jinni and said, \"Adsum, at thy service, O my lord! Ask and it shall be given to thee. Wilt thou ruin a city or raise a capital or kill a king? Whatso thou seekest, I will do for thee, sans fail.\" The Wazir pointed to Ma'aruf and said, \"Take up yonder wretch and cast him down in the most desolate of desert lands, where he shall find nothing to eat nor drink, so he may die of hunger and perish miserably, and none know of him.\" Accordingly, the Jinni snatched him up and flew with him betwixt heaven and earth, which when Ma'aruf saw, he made sure of destruction and wept and said, \"O Abu al-Sa'adat, whither goest thou with me?\" Replied the Jinni, \"I go to cast thee down in the Desert Quarter,[FN#91] O ill-bred wight of gross wits. Shall one have the like of this talisman and give it to the folk to gaze at? Verily, thou deservest that which hath befallen thee; and but that I fear Allah, I would let thee fall from a height of a thousand fathoms, nor shouldst thou reach the earth, till the winds had torn thee to shreds.\" Ma'aruf was silent[FN#92] and did not again bespeak him till he reached the Desert Quarter and casting him down there, went away and left him in that horrible place.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Slave of the Seal-ring took up Ma'aruf and cast him down in the Desert Quarter where he left him and went his ways. So much concerning him; but returning to the Wazir who was now in possession of the talisman, he said to the King, \"How deemest thou now? Did I not tell thee that this fellow was a liar, an impostor, but thou wouldst not credit me?\" Replied the King, \"Thou wast in the right, O my Wazir, Allah grant thee weal! But give me the ring, that I may solace myself with the sight.\" The Minister looked at him angrily and spat in his face, saying, \"O lack-wits, how shall I give it to thee and abide thy servant, after I am become thy master? But I will spare thee no more on life.\" Then he rubbed the seal-ring and said to the Slave, \"Take up this ill-mannered churl and cast him down by his son-in-law the swindler-man.\" So the Jinni took him up and flew off with him, whereupon quoth the King to him, \"O creature of my Lord, what is my crime?\" Abu al-Sa'adat replied, \"That wot I not, but my master hath commanded me and I cannot cross whoso hath compassed the enchanted ring.\" Then he flew on with him, till he came to the Desert Quarter and, casting him down where he had cast Ma'aruf left him and returned. The King hearing Ma'aruf weeping, went up to him and acquainted him with his case; and they sat weeping over that which had befallen them and found neither meat nor drink. Meanwhile the Minister, after driving father-in-law and son-in-law from the country, went forth from the garden and summoning all the troops held a Divan, and told them what he had done with the King and Ma'aruf and acquainted them with the affair of the talisman, adding, \"Unless ye make me Sultan over you, I will bid the Slave of the Seal-ring take you up one and all and cast you down in the Desert Quarter where you shall die of hunger and thirst.\" They replied, \"Do us no damage, for we accept thee as Sultan over us and will not anywise gainsay thy bidding.\" So they agreed, in their own despite, to his being Sultan over them, and he bestowed on them robes of honour, seeking all he had a mind to of Abu al-Sa'adat, who brought it to him forthwith. Then he sat down on the throne and the troops did homage to him; and he sent to Princess Dunya, the King's daughter, saying, \"Make thee ready, for I mean to come in unto thee this night, because I long for thee with love.\" When she heard this, she wept, for the case of her husband and father was grievous to her, and sent to him saying, \"Have patience with me till my period of widowhood[FN#93] be ended: then draw up thy contract of marriage with me and go in to me according to law.\" But he sent back to say to her, \"I know neither period of widowhood nor to delay have I a mood; and I need not a contract nor know I lawful from unlawful; but needs must I go in unto thee this night.\" She answered him saying, \"So be it, then, and welcome to thee!\"; but this was a trick on her part. When the answer reached the Wazir, he rejoiced and his breast was broadened, for that he was passionately in love with her. He bade set food before all the folk, saying, \"Eat; this is my bride-feast; for I purpose to go in to the Princess Dunya this night.\" Quoth the Shaykh al-Islam, \"It is not lawful for thee to go in unto her till her days of widowhood be ended and thou have drawn up thy contract of marriage with her.\" But he answered, \"I know neither days of widowhood nor other period; so multiply not words on me.\" The Shaykh al-Islam was silent,[FN#94] fearing his mischief, and said to the troops, \"Verily, this man is a Kafir, a Miscreant, and hath neither creed nor religious conduct.\" As soon as it was evenfall, he went in to her and found her robed in her richest raiment and decked with her goodliest adornments. When she saw him, she came to meet him, laughing and said, \"A blessed night! But hadst thou slain my father and my husband, it had been more to my mind.\" And he said, \"There is no help but I slay them.\" Then she made him sit down and began to jest with him and make show of love caressing him and smiling in his face so that his reason fled; but she cajoled him with her coaxing and cunning only that she might get possession of the ring and change his joy into calamity on the mother of his forehead:[FN#95] nor did she deal thus with him but after the rede of him who said[FN#96]:\u2014\n\nI attained by my wits * What no sword had obtained,\nAnd return wi' the spoils * Whose sweet pluckings I gained.\n\nWhen he saw her caress him and smile upon him, desire surged up in him and he besought her of carnal knowledge; but, when he approached her, she drew away from him and burst into tears, saying, \"O my lord, seest thou not the man looking at us? I conjure thee by Allah, screen me from his eyes! How canst thou know me what while he looketh on us?\" When he heard this, he was angry and asked, \"Where is the man?\"; and answered she, \"There he is, in the bezel of the ring! putting out his head and staring at us.\" He thought that the Jinni was looking at them and said laughing, \"Fear not; this is the Slave of the Seal-ring, and he is subject to me.\" Quoth she, \"I am afraid of Ifrits; pull it off and throw it afar from me.\" So he plucked it off and laying it on the cushion, drew near to her, but she dealt him a kick, her foot striking him full in the stomach[FN#97], and he fell over on his back senseless; whereupon she cried out to her attendants, who came to her in haste, and said to them, \"Seize him!\" So forty slavegirls laid hold on him, whilst she hurriedly snatched up the ring from the cushion and rubbed it; whereupon Abu al-Sa'adat presented himself, saying, \"Adsum, at thy service O my mistress.\" Cried she, \"Take up yonder Infidel and clap him in jail and shackle him heavily.\" So he took him and throwing him into the Prison of Wrath[FN#98] returned and reported, \"I have laid him in limbo.\" Quoth she, \"Whither wentest thou with my father and my husband?\"; and quoth he, \"I cast them down in the Desert Quarter.\" Then cried she, \"I command thee to fetch them to me forthwith.\" He replied, \"I hear and I obey,\" and taking flight at once, stayed not till he reached the Desert Quarter, where he lighted down upon them and found them sitting weeping and complaining each to other. Quoth he, \"Fear not, for relief is come to you\"; and he told them what the Wazir had done, adding, \"Indeed I imprisoned him with my own hands in obedience to her, and she hath bidden me bear you back.\" And they rejoiced in his news. Then he took them both up and flew home with them; nor was it more than an hour before he brought them in to Princess Dunya, who rose and saluted sire and spouse. Then she made them sit down and brought them food and sweetmeats, and they passed the rest of the night with her. On the next day she clad them in rich clothing and said to the King, \"O my papa, sit thou upon thy throne and be King as before and make my husband thy Wazir of the Right and tell thy troops that which hath happened. Then send for the Minister out of prison and do him die, and after burn him, for that he is a Miscreant, and would have gone in unto me in the way of lewdness, without the rites of wedlock and he hath testified against himself that he is an Infidel and believeth in no religion. And do tenderly by thy son-in-law, whom thou makest thy Wazir of the Right.\" He replied, \"Hearing and obeying, O my daughter. But do thou give me the ring or give it to thy husband.\" Quoth she, \"It behoveth not that either thou or he have the ring. I will keep the ring myself, and belike I shall be more careful of it than you. Whatso ye wish seek it of me and I will demand it for you of the Slave of the Seal-ring. So fear no harm so long as I live and after my death, do what ye twain will with the ring.\" Quoth the King, \"This is the right rede, O my daughter,\" and taking his son-in-law went forth to the Divan. Now the troops had passed the night in sore chagrin for Princess Dunya and that which the Wazir had done with her, in going in to her after the way of lewdness, without marriage-rites, and for his ill-usage of the King and Ma'aruf, and they feared lest the law of Al-Islam be dishonoured, because it was manifest to them that he was a Kafir. So they assembled in the Divan and fell to reproaching the Shaykh al-Islam, saying, \"Why didst thou not forbid him from going in to the Princess in the way of lewdness?\" Said he, \"O folk, the man is a Miscreant and hath gotten possession of the ring and I and you may not prevail against him. But Almighty Allah will requite him his deed, and be ye silent, lest he slay you.\" And as the host was thus engaged in talk, behold the King and Ma'aruf entered the Divan.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Thousandth Night,\n\nShe continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the troops sorely chagrined sat in the Divan talking over the ill-deeds done by the Wazir to their Sovran, his son-in-law and his daughter, behold, the King and Ma'aruf entered. Then the King bade decorate the city and sent to fetch the Wazir from the place of duresse. So they brought him, and as he passed by the troops, they cursed him and abused him and menaced him, till he came to the King, who commanded to do him dead by the vilest of deaths. Accordingly, they slew him and after burned his body, and he went to Hell after the foulest of plights; and right well quoth one of him:\u2014\n\nThe Compassionate show no ruth to the tomb where his bones shall lie * And Munkar and eke Nak\u00edr[FN#99] ne'er cease to abide thereby!\n\nThe King made Ma'aruf his Wazir of the Right and the times were pleasant to them and their joys were untroubled. They abode thus five years till, in the sixth year, the King died and Princess Dunya made Ma'aruf Sultan in her father's stead, but she gave him not the seal-ring. During this time she had conceived by him and borne him a boy of passing loveliness, excelling in beauty and perfection, who ceased not to be reared in the laps of nurses till he reached the age of five, when his mother fell sick of a deadly sickness and calling her husband to her, said to him, \"I am ill.\" Quoth he, \"Allah preserve thee, O dearling of my heart!\" But quoth she, \"Haply I shall die and thou needest not that I commend to thy care thy son: wherefore I charge thee but be careful of the ring, for thine own sake and for the sake of this thy boy.\" And he answered, \"No harm shall befal him whom Allah preserveth!\" Then she pulled off the ring and gave it to him, and on the morrow she was admitted to the mercy of Allah the Most High,[FN#100] whilst Ma'aruf abode in possession of the kingship and applied himself to the business of governing. Now it chanced that one day, as he shook the handkerchief[FN#101] and the troops withdrew to their places that he betook himself to the sitting-chamber, where he sat till the day departed and the night advanced with murks bedight. Then came in to him his cup-companions of the notables according to their custom, and sat with him by way of solace and diversion, till midnight, when they craved permission to withdraw. He gave them leave and they retired to their houses; after which there came in to him a slave-girl affected to the service of his bed, who spread him the mattress and doffing his apparel, clad him in his sleeping-gown. Then he lay down and she kneaded his feet, till sleep overpowered him; whereupon she withdrew to her own chamber and slept. But suddenly he felt something beside him in the bed and awaking started up in alarm and cried, \"I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned!\" Then he opened his eyes and seeing by his side a woman foul of favour, said to her, \"Who art thou?\" Said she, \"Fear not, I am thy wife Fatimah al-Urrah.\" Whereupon he looked in her face and knew her by her loathly form and the length of her dog-teeth: so he asked her, \"Whence camest thou in to me and who brought thee to this country?\" \"In what country art thou at this present?\" \"In the city of Ikhtiyan al-Khatan. But thou, when didst thou leave Cairo?\" \"But now.\" \"How can that be?\" \"Know,\" said she, \"that, when I fell out with thee and Satan prompted me to do thee a damage, I complained of thee to the magistrates, who sought for thee and the Kazis enquired of thee, but found thee not. When two days were past, repentance gat hold upon me and I knew that the fault was with me; but penitence availed me not, and I abode for some days weeping for thy loss, till what was in my hand failed and I was obliged to beg my bread. So I fell to begging of all, from the courted rich to the contemned poor, and since thou leftest me, I have eaten of the bitterness of beggary and have been in the sorriest of conditions. Every night I sat beweeping our separation and that which I suffered, since thy departure, of humiliation and ignominy, of abjection and misery.\" And she went on to tell him what had befallen her, whilst he stared at her in amazement, till she said, \"Yesterday, I went about begging all day but none gave me aught; and as often as I accosted any one and craved of him a crust of bread, he reviled me and gave me naught. When night came, I went to bed supperless, and hunger burned me and sore on me was that which I suffered: and I sat weeping when, behold, one appeared to me and said, O woman why weepest thou? Said I, erst I had a husband who used to provide for me and fulfil my wishes; but he is lost to me and I know not whither he went and have been in sore straits since he left me. Asked he, What is thy husband's name? and I answered, His name is Ma'aruf. Quoth he, I ken him. Know that thy husband is now Sultan in a certain city, and if thou wilt, I will carry thee to him. Cried I, I am under thy protection: of thy bounty bring me to him! So he took me up and flew with me between heaven and earth, till he brought me to this pavilion and said to me:\u2014 Enter yonder chamber, and thou shalt see thy husband asleep on the couch. Accordingly I entered and found thee in this state of lordship. Indeed I had not thought thou wouldst forsake me, who am thy mate, and praised be Allah who hath united thee with me!\" Quoth Ma'aruf, \"Did I forsake thee or thou me? Thou complainedst of me from Kazi to Kazi and endedst by denouncing me to the High Court and bringing down on me Ab\u00fa Tabak from the Citadel: so I fled in mine own despite.\" And he went on to tell her all that had befallen him and how he was become Sultan and had married the King's daughter and how his beloved Dunya had died, leaving him a son who was then seven years old. She rejoined, \"That which happened was fore-ordained of Allah; but I repent me and I place myself under thy protection beseeching thee not to abandon me, but suffer me eat bread, with thee by way of an alms.\" And she ceased not to humble herself to him and to supplicate him till his heart relented towards her and he said, \"Repent from mischief and abide with me, and naught shall betide thee save what shall pleasure thee: but, an thou work any wickedness, I will slay thee nor fear any one. And fancy not that thou canst complain of me to the High Court and that Abu Tabak will come down on me from the Citadel; for I am become Sultan and the folk dread me: but I fear none save Allah Almighty, because I have a talismanic ring which when I rub, the Slave of the Signet appeareth to me. His name is Abu al-Sa'adat, and whatsoever I demand of him he bringeth to me. So, an thou desire to return to thine own country, I will give thee what shall suffice thee all thy life long and will send thee thither speedily; but, an thou desire to abide with me, I will clear for thee a palace and furnish it with the choicest of silks and appoint thee twenty slave-girls to serve thee and provide thee with dainty dishes and sumptuous suits, and thou shalt be a Queen and live in all delight till thou die or I die. What sayest thou of this?\" \"I wish to abide with thee,\" she answered and kissed his hand and vowed repentance from frowardness. Accordingly he set apart a palace for her sole use and gave her slave-girls and eunuchs, and she became a Queen. The young Prince used to visit her as he visited his sire; but she hated him for that he was not her son; and when the boy saw that she looked on him with the eye of aversion and anger, he shunned her and took a dislike to her. As for Ma'aruf, he occupied himself with the love of fair handmaidens and bethought him not of his wife Fatimah the Dung, for that she was grown a grizzled old fright, foul-favoured to the sight, a bald-headed blight, loathlier than the snake speckled black and white; the more that she had beyond measure evil entreated him aforetime; and as saith the adage, \"Ill-usage the root of desire disparts and sows hate in the soil of hearts;\" and God-gifted is he who saith:\u2014\n\nBeware of losing hearts of men by thine injurious deed; * For\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    when Aversion takes his place none may dear Love restore:\nHearts, when affection flies from them, are likest unto glass *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Which broken, cannot whole be made,\u2014'tis breached for\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    evermore.\n\nAnd indeed Ma'aruf had not given her shelter by reason of any praiseworthy quality in her, but he dealt with her thus generously only of desire for the approval of Allah Almighty.\u2014 Here Dunyazad interrupted her sister Shahrazad, saying, \"How winsome are these words of thine which win hold of the heart more forcibly than enchanters' eyne; and how beautiful are these wondrous books thou hast cited and the marvellous and singular tales thou hast recited!\" Quoth Shahrazad, \"And where is all this compared with what I shall relate to thee on the coming night, an I live and the King deign spare my days?\" So when morning morrowed and the day brake in its sheen and shone, the King arose from his couch with breast broadened and in high expectation for the rest of the tale and saying, \"By Allah, I will not slay her till I hear the last of her story;\" repaired to his Durb\u00e1r while the Wazir, as was his wont, presented himself at the Palace, shroud under arm. Shahriyar tarried abroad all that day, bidding and forbidding between man and man; after which he returned to his Harim and, according to his custom went in to his wife Shahrazad.[FN#102]\n\nWhen it was the Thousand and First Night,\n\nDunyazad said to her sister, \"Do thou finish for us the History of Ma'aruf!\" She replied, \"With love and goodly gree, an my lord deign permit me recount it.\" Quoth the King, \"I permit thee; for that I am fain of hearing it.\" So she said:\u2014It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ma'aruf would have naught to do with his wife by way of conjugal duty. Now when she saw that he held aloof from her bed and occupied himself with other women, she hated him and jealousy gat the mastery of her and Iblis prompted her to take the seal-ring from him and slay him and make herself Queen in his stead. So she went forth one night from her pavilion, intending for that in which was her husband King Ma'aruf; and it chanced by decree of the Decreer and His written destiny, that Ma'aruf lay that night with one of his concubines; a damsel endowed with beauty and loveliness, symmetry and a stature all grace. And it was his wont, of the excellence of his piety, that, when he was minded to have to lie with a woman, he would doff the enchanted seal-ring from his finger, in reverence to the Holy Names graven thereon, and lay it on the Pillow, nor would he don it again till he had purified himself by the Ghusl-ablution. Moreover, when he had lain with a woman, he was used to order her go forth from him before daybreak, of his fear for the seal-ring; and when he went to the Hammam he locked the door of the pavilion till his return, when he put on the ring, and after this, all were free to enter according to custom. His wife Fatimah the Dung knew of all this and went not forth from her place till she had certified herself of the case. So she sallied out, when the night was dark, purposing to go in to him, whilst he was drowned in sleep, and steal the ring, unseen of him. Now it chanced at this time that the King's son had gone out, without light, to the Chapel of Ease for an occasion, and sat down over the marble slab[FN#103] of the jakes in the dark, leaving the door open. Presently, he saw Fatimah come forth of her pavilion and make stealthily for that of his father and said in himself, \"What aileth this witch to leave her lodging in the dead of the night and make for my father's pavilion? Needs must there be some reason for this:\" so he went out after her and followed in her steps unseen of her. Now he had a short sword of watered steel, which he held so dear that he went not to his father's Divan, except he were girt therewith; and his father used to laugh at him and exclaim, \"Mahallah![FN#104] This is a mighty fine sword of thine, O my son! But thou hast not gone down with it to battle nor cut off a head therewith.\" Whereupon the boy would reply, \"I will not fail to cut off with it some head which deserveth[FN#105] cutting.\" And Ma'aruf would laugh at his words. Now when treading in her track, he drew the sword from its sheath and he followed her till she came to his father's pavilion and entered, whilst he stood and watched her from the door. He saw her searching about and heard her say to herself, \"Where hath he laid the seal-ring?\"; whereby he knew that she was looking for the ring and he waited till she found it and said, \"Here it is.\" Then she picked it up and turned to go out; but he hid behind the door. As she came forth, she looked at the ring and turned it about in her grasp. But when she was about to rub it, he raised his hand with the sword and smote her on the neck; and she cried a single cry and fell down dead. With this Ma'aruf awoke and seeing his wife strown on the ground, with her blood flowing, and his son standing with the drawn sword in his hand, said to him, \"What is this, O my son?\" He replied, \"O my father, how often hast thou said to me, Thou hast a mighty fine sword; but thou hast not gone down with it to battle nor cut off a head. And I have answered thee, saying, I will not fail to cut off with it a head which deserveth cutting. And now, behold, I have therewith cut off for thee a head well worth the cutting!\" And he told him what had passed. Ma'aruf sought for the seal-ring, but found it not; so he searched the dead woman's body till he saw her hand closed upon it; whereupon he took it from her grasp and said to the boy, \"Thou art indeed my very son, without doubt or dispute; Allah ease thee in this world and the next, even as thou hast eased me of this vile woman! Her attempt led only to her own destruction, and Allah-gifted is he who said:\u2014\n\nWhen forwards Allah's aid a man's intent, * His wish in every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    case shall find consent:\nBut an that aid of Allah be refused, * His first attempt shall do\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0him damagement.\"\n\nThen King Ma'aruf called aloud to some of his attendants, who came in haste, and he told them what his wife Fatimah the Dung had done and bade them to take her and lay her in a place till the morning. They did his bidding, and next day he gave her in charge to a number of eunuchs, who washed her and shrouded her and made her a tomb[FN#106] and buried her. Thus her coming from Cairo was but to her grave, and Allah-gifted is he who said[FN#107]:\u2014\n\nWe trod the steps appointed for us: and he whose steps are\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    appointed must tread them.\nHe whose death is decreed to take place in our land shall not die\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   in any land but that.\n\nAnd how excellent is the saying of the poet:\u2014\n\nI wot not, whenas to a land I fare, * Good luck pursuing, what my\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     lot shall be.\nWhether the fortune I perforce pursue * Or the misfortune which\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    pursueth me.\n\nAfter this, King Ma'aruf sent for the husbandman, whose guest he had been, when he was a fugitive, and made him his Wazir of the Right and his Chief Counsellor.[FN#108] Then, learning that he had a daughter of passing beauty and loveliness, of qualities nature-ennobled at birth and exalted of worth, he took her to wife; and in due time he married his son. So they abode awhile in all solace of life and its delight and their days were serene and their joys untroubled, till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies, the Depopulator of populous places and the Orphaner of sons and daughters.

The fire-drake in the text was summoned by the Cobbler's exclamation and even Marids at times do a kindly action.\n\n[FN#18] The style is modern Cairene jargon.\n\n[FN#19] Purses or gold pieces see vol. ix. 313.\n\n[FN#20] i.e. I am a Cairene.\n\n[FN#21] Arab. \"Darb al-Ahmar,\" a street still existing near to and outside the noble Bab Zuwaylah, for which see vol. i. 269.\n\n[FN#22] Arab. \"'Att\u00e1r,\" perfume-seller and druggist; the word is connected with our \"Ottar\" ('Atr).\n\n[FN#23] Arab. \"Mudarris\" lit.=one who gives lessons or lectures (dars) and pop. applied to a professor in a collegiate mosque like Al-Azhar of Cairo.\n\n[FN#24] This thoroughly dramatic scene is told with a charming na\u00efvet\u00e9. No wonder that The Nights has been made the basis of a national theatre amongst the Turks.\n\n[FN#25] Arab. \"Taysh\" lit.=vertigo, swimming of head.\n\n[FN#26] Here Tr\u00e9butien (iii. 265) reads \"la ville de Kha\u00eftan (so the Mac. Edit. iv. 708) capital du royaume de Sohatan.\" Ikhtiy\u00e1n Lane suggests to be fictitious: Khatan is a district of Tartary east of K\u00e1shgar, so called by S\u00e1dik al-Isfah\u00e1ni p. 24.\n\n[FN#27] This is a true picture of the tact and savoir faire of the Cairenes. It was a study to see how, under the late Khedive they managed to take precedence of Europeans who found themselves in the background before they knew it. For instance, every Bey, whose degree is that of a Colonel was made an \"Excellency\" and ranked accordingly at Court whilst his father, some poor Fellah, was ploughing the ground. Tanf\u00edk Pasha began his ill-omened rule by always placing natives close to him in the place of honour, addressing them first and otherwise snubbing Europeans who, when English, were often too obtuse to notice the petty insults lavished upon them.\n\n[FN#28] Arab. \"Kath\u00edr\" (pron. Katir)=much: here used in its slang sense, \"no end.\"\n\n[FN#29] i.e. \"May the Lord soon make thee able to repay me; but meanwhile I give it to thee for thy own free use.\"\n\n[FN#30] Punning upon his name. Much might be written upon the significance of names as ominous of good and evil; but the subject is far too extensive for a footnote.\n\n[FN#31] Lane translates \"\u00c1nisa-kum\" by \"he hath delighted you by his arrival\"; Mr. Payne \"I commend him to you.\"\n\n[FN#32] Arab. \"Fat\u00far\u00e1t,\"=light food for the early breakfast of which the \"Fat\u00edrah\"-cake was a favourite item. See vol. i. 300.\n\n[FN#33] A dark red dye (Lane).\n\n[FN#34] Arab. \"Jad\u00edd,\" see vol. viii. 121.\n\n[FN#35] Both the texts read thus, but the reading has little sense. Ma'aruf probably would say, \"I fear that my loads will be long coming.\"\n\n[FN#36] One of the many formulas of polite refusal.\n\n[FN#37] Each bazar, in a large city like Damascus, has its tall and heavy wooden doors which are locked every evening and opened in the morning by the Ghafir or guard. The \"silver key,\" however, always lets one in.\n\n[FN#38] Arab. \"Wa l\u00e1 Kabbata h\u00e1miyah,\" a Cairene vulgarism meaning, \"There came nothing to profit him nor to rid the people of him.\"\n\n[FN#39] Arab. \"Kammir,\" i.e. brown it before the fire, toast it.\n\n[FN#40] It is insinuated that he had lied till he himself believed the lie to be truth\u2014not an uncommon process, I may remark.\n\n[FN#41] Arab. \"Rij\u00e1l\"=the Men, equivalent to the Walis, Saints or\nSantons; with perhaps an allusion to the Rij\u00e1l al-Ghayb, the\nInvisible Controls concerning whom I have quoted Herklots in vol.\nii. 211.\n\n[FN#42] A saying attributed to Al-Hariri (Lane). It is good enough to be his: the Persians say, \"Cut not down the tree thou plantedst,\" and the idea is universal throughout the East.\n\n[FN#43] A quotation from Al-Hariri (Ass. of the Badawin). Ash'ab (ob. A.H. 54), a Medinite servant of Caliph Osman, was proverbial for greed and sanguine, Micawber-like expectation of \"windfalls.\" The Scholiast Al-Shar\u00edshi (of Xeres) describes him in Theophrastic style. He never saw a man put hand to pocket without expecting a present, or a funeral go by without hoping for a legacy, or a bridal procession without preparing his own house, hoping they might bring the bride to him by mistake. * * * When asked if he knew aught greedier than himself he said \"Yes; a sheep I once kept upon my terrace-roof seeing a rainbow mistook it for a rope of hay and jumping to seize it broke its neck!\" Hence \"Ash'ab's sheep\" became a by-word (Preston tells the tale in full, p. 288).\n\n[FN#44] i.e. \"Show a miser money and hold him back, if you can.\"\n\n[FN#45] He wants \u00a340,000 to begin with.\n\n[FN#46] i.e. Arab. \"Sab\u00edhat al-'urs\" the morning after the wedding. See vol. i. 269.\n\n[FN#47] Another sign of modern composition as in Kamar al-Zaman\nII.\n\n[FN#48] Arab. \"Al-Jink\" (from Turk.) are boys and youths mostly Jews, Armenians, Greeks and Turks, who dress in woman's dress with long hair braided. Lane (M. E. chapts. xix. and xxv.) gives same account of the customs of the \"Gink\" (as the Egyptians call them) but cannot enter into details concerning these catamites. Respectable Moslems often employ them to dance at festivals in preference to the Ghaw\u00e1zi-women, a freak of Mohammedan decorum. When they grow old they often preserve their costume, and a glance at them makes a European's blood run cold.\n\n[FN#49] Lane translates this, \"May Allah and the Rijal retaliate upon thy temple!\"\n\n[FN#50] Arab. \"Y\u00e1 aba 'l-lith\u00e1mayn,\" addressed to his member. Lathm the root means kissing or breaking; so he would say, \"O thou who canst take her maidenhead whilst my tongue does away with the virginity of her mouth.\" \"He breached the citadel\" (which is usually square) \"in its four corners\" signifying that he utterly broke it down.\n\n[FN#51] A mystery to the Author of Proverbs (xxx. 18-19),\n\nThere be three things which are too wondrous for me,\nThe way of an eagle in the air;\nThe way of a snake upon a rock;\nAnd the way of a man with a maid.\n\n[FN#52] Several women have described the pain to me as much resembling the drawing of a tooth.\n\n[FN#53] As we should say, \"play fast and loose.\"\n\n[FN#54] Arab. \"N\u00e1h\u00ed-ka\" lit.=thy prohibition but idiomatically used=let it suffice thee!\n\n[FN#55] A character-sketch like that of Princess Dunya makes ample amends for a book full of abuse of women. And yet the superficial say that none of the characters have much personal individuality.\n\n[FN#56] This is indeed one of the touches of nature which makes all the world kin.\n\n[FN#57] As we are in Tartary \"Arabs\" here means plundering nomades, like the Persian \"Iliy\u00e1t\" and other shepherd races.\n\n[FN#58] The very cruelty of love which hates nothing so much as a rejected lover. The Princess, be it noted, is not supposed to be merely romancing, but speaking with the second sight, the clairvoyance, of perfect affection. Men seem to know very little upon this subject, though every one has at times been more or less startled by the abnormal introvision and divination of things hidden which are the property and prerogative of perfect love.\n\n[FN#59] The name of the Princess meaning \"The World,\" not unusual amongst Moslem women.\n\n[FN#60] Another pun upon his name, \"Ma'aruf.\"\n\n[FN#61] Arab. \"Nak\u00e1,\" the mound of pure sand which delights the eye of the Badawi leaving a town. See vol. i. 217, for the lines and explanation in Night cmlxiv. vol. ix. p. 250.\n\n[FN#62] Euphemistic: \"I will soon fetch thee food.\" To say this bluntly might have brought misfortune.\n\n[FN#63] Arab. \"Kafr\"=a village in Egypt and Syria e.g. Capernaum\n(Kafr Nahum).\n\n[FN#64] He has all the bonhomie of the Cairene and will do a kindness whenever he can.\n\n[FN#65] i.e. the Father of Prosperities: pron. Aboosa'\u00e1d\u00e1t; as in the Tale of Hasan of Bassorah.\n\n[FN#66] Koran lxxxix. \"The Daybreak\" which also mentions Thamud and Pharaoh.\n\n[FN#67] In Egypt the cheapest and poorest of food, never seen at a hotel table d'h\u00f4te.\n\n[FN#68] The beautiful girls who guard ensorcelled hoards: See vol. vi. 109.\n\n[FN#69] Arab. \"As\u00e1kir,\" the ornaments of litters, which are either plain balls of metal or tapering cones based on crescents or on balls and crescents. See in Lane (M. E. chapt. xxiv.) the sketch of the Mahmal.\n\n[FN#70] Arab. \"Amm\"=father's brother, courteously used for \"father-in-law,\" which suggests having slept with his daughter, and which is indecent in writing. Thus by a pleasant fiction the husband represents himself as having married his first cousin.\n\n[FN#71] i.e. a calamity to the enemy: see vol. ii. 87 and passim.\n\n[FN#72] Both texts read \"Asad\" (lion) and Lane accepts it: there is no reason to change it for \"H\u00e1sid\" (Envier), the Lion being the Sultan of the Beasts and the most majestic.\n\n[FN#73] The Cairene knew his fellow Cairene and was not to be taken in by him.\n\n[FN#74] Arab. \"Hiz\u00e1m\": Lane reads \"Khiz\u00e1m\"=a nose-ring for which see appendix to Lane's M. E. The untrained European eye dislikes these decorations and there is certainly no beauty in the hoops which Hindu women insert through the nostrils, camel-fashion, as if to receive the cord-acting bridle. But a drop-pearl hanging to the septum is at least as pretty as the heavy pendants by which some European women lengthen their ears.\n\n[FN#75] Arab. \"Shamt\u00e1,\" one of the many names of wine, the \"speckled\" alluding to the bubbles which dance upon the freshly filled cup.\n\n[FN#76] i.e. in the cask. These \"merry quips\" strongly suggest the dismal toasts of our not remote ancestors.\n\n[FN#77] Arab. \"A'l\u00e1j\" plur. of \"'Ilj\" and rendered by Lane \"the stout foreign infidels.\" The next line alludes to the cupbearer who was generally a slave and a non-Moslem.\n\n[FN#78] As if it were a bride. See vol. vii. 198. The stars of\nJauz\u00e1 (Gemini) are the cupbearer's eyes.\n\n[FN#79] i.e. light-coloured wine.\n\n[FN#80] The usual homage to youth and beauty.\n\n[FN#81] Alluding to the cup.\n\n[FN#82] Here Abu Nowas whose name always ushers in some abomination alluded to the \"Ghul\u00e1miyah\" or girl dressed like boy to act cupbearer. Civilisation has everywhere the same devices and the Bordels of London and Paris do not ignore the \"she-boy,\" who often opens the door.\n\n[FN#83] Abdallah ibn al-Mu'tazz, son of Al-Mu'tazz bi 'llah, the 13th Abbaside, and great-great-grandson of Harun al-Rashid. He was one of the most renowned poets of the third century (A.H.) and died A.D. 908, strangled by the partisans of his nephew Al-Muktadir bi 'llah, 18th Abbaside.\n\n[FN#84] Jaz\u00edrat ibn Omar, an island and town on the Tigris north of Mosul. \"Some versions of the poem, from which these verses are quoted, substitute El-Mutireh, a village near Samara (a town on the Tigris, 60 miles north of Baghdad), for El-Jezireh, i.e. Jeziret ibn Omar.\" (Payne.)\n\n[FN#85] The Convent of Abdun on the east bank of the Tigris opposite the Jezirah was so called from a statesman who caused it to be built. For a variant of these lines see Ibn Khallikan, vol. ii. 42; here we miss \"the shady groves of Al-Mat\u00edrah.\"\n\n[FN#86] Arab. \"Ghurrah\" the white blaze on a horse's brow. In Ibn\nKhallikan the bird is the lark.\n\n[FN#87] Arab. \"T\u00e1y'i\"=thirsty used with J\u00e1y'i=hungry.\n\n[FN#88] Lit. \"Kohl'd with Ghunj\" for which we have no better word than \"coquetry.\" But see vol. v. 80. It corresponds with the Latin crissare for women and cevere for men.\n\n[FN#89] i.e. gold-coloured wine, as the Vino d'Oro.\n\n[FN#90] Compare the charming song of Abu Mij\u00e1n translated from the German of Dr. Weil in Bohn's Edit. of Ockley (p. 149),\n\nWhen the Death-angel cometh mine eyes to close,\nDig my grave 'mid the vines on the hill's fair side;\nFor though deep in earth may my bones repose,\nThe juice of the grape shall their food provide.\nAh, bury me not in a barren land,\nOr Death will appear to me dread and drear!\nWhile fearless I'll wait what he hath in hand I\nAn the scent of the vineyard my spirit cheer.\nThe glorious old drinker!\n\n[FN#91] Arab. \"Rub'a al-Khar\u00e1b\" in Ibn al-Wardi Central Africa south of the Nile-sources, one of the richest regions in the world. Here it prob. alludes to the Rub'a al-Kh\u00e1li or Great Arabian Desert: for which see Night dclxxvi. In rhetoric it is opposed to the \"Rub'a Mask\u00fan,\" or populated fourth of the world, the rest being held to be ocean.\n\n[FN#92] This is the noble resignation of the Moslem. What a dialogue there would have been in a European book between man and devil!\n\n[FN#93] Arab. \"Al-'iddah\" the period of four months and ten days which must elapse before she could legally marry again. But this was a palpable wile: she was not sure of her husband's death and he had not divorced her; so that although a \"grass widow,\" a \"Strohwitwe\" as the Germans say, she could not wed again either with or without interval.\n\n[FN#94] Here the silence is of cowardice and the passage is a fling at the \"timeserving\" of the Olema, a favourite theme, like \"banging the bishops\" amongst certain Westerns.\n\n[FN#95] Arab. \"Umm al-raas,\" the poll, crown of the head, here the place where a calamity coming down from heaven would first alight.\n\n[FN#96] From Al-Hariri (Lane): the lines are excellent.\n\n[FN#97] When the charming Princess is so ready at the voie de faits, the reader will understand how common is such energetic action among women of lower degree. The \"fair sex\" in Egypt has a horrible way of murdering men, especially husbands, by tying them down and tearing out the testicles. See Lane M. E. chapt. xiii.\n\n[FN#98] Arab. \"Sijn al-Ghazab,\" the dungeons appropriated to the worst of criminals where they suffer penalties far worse than hanging or guillotining.\n\n[FN#99] According to some modern Moslems Munkar and Nakir visit\nthe graves of Infidels (non-Moslems) and Bashshir and Mubashshir\n(\"Givers of glad tidings\") those of Mohammedans. Petis de la\nCroix (Les Mille et un Jours vol. iii. 258) speaks of the\n\"Zoubanya,\" black angels who torture the damned under their chief\nDabilah.\n\n[FN#100] Very simple and pathetic is this short sketch of the noble-minded Princess's death.\n\n[FN#101] In sign of dismissal (vol. iv. 62) I have noted that \"throwing the kerchief\" is not an Eastern practice: the idea probably arose from the Oriental practice of sending presents in richly embroidered napkins and kerchiefs.\n\n[FN#102] Curious to say both Lane and Payne omit this passage which appears in both texts (Mac. and Bul.). The object is evidently to prepare the reader for the ending by reverting to the beginning of the tale; and its prolixity has its effect as in the old Romances of Chivalry from Amadis of Ghaul to the Seven Champions of Christendom. If it provoke impatience, it also heightens expectation; \"it is like the long elm-avenues of our forefathers; we wish ourselves at the end; but we know that at the end there is something great.\"\n\n[FN#103] Arab. \"al\u00e0 mal\u00e1kay bayti 'l-r\u00e1hah;\" on the two slabs at whose union are the round hole and longitudinal slit. See vol. i. 221.\n\n[FN#104] Here the exclamation wards off the Evil Eye from the Sword and the wearer: Mr. Payne notes, \"The old English exclamation Cock's 'ill!' (i.e., God's will, thus corrupted for the purpose of evading the statute of 3 Jac. i. against profane swearing) exactly corresponds to the Arabic\"\u2014with a difference, I add.\n\n[FN#105] Arab. \"Mustahakk\"=deserving (Lane) or worth (Payne) the cutting.\n\n[FN#106] Arab. \"Mashhad\" the same as \"Sh\u00e1hid\"=the upright stones at the head and foot of the grave. Lane mistranslates, \"Made for her a funeral procession.\"\n\n[FN#107] These lines have occurred before. I quote Lane.\n\n[FN#108] There is nothing strange in such sudden elevations amongst Moslems and even in Europe we still see them occasionally. The family in the East, however humble, is a model and miniature of the state, and learning is not always necessary to wisdom.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path":

My Son LyricsWhen I was a very small boy (Just a small boy)\nLooked through the cornfields and I wonder (oh, I wondered)\nIf every man had his own piece of land\nSo he'd never

my son (easy)\nThat's what my daddy said to me\nSaid, you be a man and you learn all you can\nLot of class and someday, you'll be free\nOh, I remember one rainy day back home (I rem\u0435mber)\nSally Brown's house burned down (y\u0435s, it did now)\nAnd everybody had to lend a helping hand\nFolks came from miles around\n\nThey didn't do this expecting something in return\nThey simply did it because they cared\nAnd these were the kind of folk\nIf they had anything at all\nThey were more than willing to share\n\nAnd daddy said, you walk easy, boy (Walk easy)\nYeah, and when your trouble get to falling like rain\n(You gotta walk easy)\nHey, I want you to understand\nYou can't trust every man\nCause it'll only bring you pain\n\nAnd now that I'm out here\nIn this big old world\nI hear strange words like pollution\nAnd I see a man that needs a helping hand\nHave to go somewhere to find his own solution\nOh, my Lord, how this whole world had changed\nI say, God, save us all\nYeah, I hate the day that I ever came\nThis world is heading for a great big fall\nYou might also likeAnd you walk easy, son (easy)\nYeah, that's what my daddy said to me\nHe said you know you can't trust everyone\nCause it will only bring you misery\nYou walk easy, my son (easy)\nAnd when your trouble get to falling like rain\nOh, don't you try to trust everybody, child\nCause it will only bring you painEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/7550776", "artist_names": "WEARETHEGOOD & Scootie Wop", "full_title": "Coco Bread by\u00a0WEARETHEGOOD\u00a0& Scootie Wop",

with that app in your phone\nA swear word hurts like a hurt man swears\nLately I feel a need to fucking disappear\nWhile you get busy cheering for the songs you never hear\nOn my way to the top all I need is the stairs\nAnother rhyme to reminisce about the hard times\nReality is nice till it hits you like a punchline\nOverdue debts got you lining up to pay the fine\nIf I don't speak the truth feel free to pay no mind\nI ain't taking a break I'm staying awake smoking a flake I'm rolling a J making my way double the pay I'm trouble for\nYou don't get in my way\nI did a double time Cizz just the

Cypher\n\nHardknok:\nI'm the reason my city has bragging rights\nMy adam's apple has ammo for dragon fights\nI'm mad precise and appatize on a rappers vice who think they dominate...\nBut ain't half

Well, see, what you expressed was vast\nBut we saved the best for last\nSo respect the blast as you cover your eyes\nAs I suffer the lies of suckers who strive\nTo cover up time, claim to hustle and grind\nYour only real struggle is the struggle to rhyme\nEveryone's a pioneer, just a bunch of gimmicks kid\nFuck who started the scene, let's see who finishes\nI hear the weak chatter when this man speak\nBut I gotta eat rappers 'coz they banned beef\nShow some heart son, what's the hating about?\nI got a sharp tongue, born with a blade in the mouth\nBunch of misogynists I'm exhausted with\nBattle a homophobic rappper, give him box of dicks\nGive him box of dicks\nGive him box of dicks\nFuck Misogynists\nGive him box of dicks\nDon't need pen and pad for the suckers\nAshwini Mishra,

the bunkhouse, inside it was dusk. Through the open door came the thuds and occasional clangs of a horseshoe game, and now and then the sound of voices raised in approval or derision. Slim and George came into the darkening bunkhouse together. Slim reached up over the card table and turned on the tin-shaded electric light. Instantly the table was brilliant with light, and the cone of the shade threw its brightness straight downward, leaving the corners of the bunkhouse still in dusk. Slim sat down on a box and George took his place opposite.\n\n\"It wasn't nothing,\" said Slim. \"I would of had to drowned most of 'em anyways. No need to thank me about that.\"\nGeorge said, \"It wasn't much to you, maybe, but it was a hell of a lot to him. Jesus Christ, I don't know how we're gonna get him to sleep in here. He'll want to sleep right out in the barn with 'em. We'll have trouble keepin' him from getting right in the box with them pups.\"\n\n\"It wasn't nothing,\" Slim repeated. \"Say, you sure was right about him. Maybe he ain't bright, but I never seen such a worker. He damn near killed his partner buckin' barley. There ain't nobody can keep up with him. God awmighty, I never seen such a strong guy.\"\nGeorge spoke proudly. \"Jus' tell Lennie what to do an' he'll do it if it don't take no figuring. He can't think of nothing to do himself, but he sure can take orders.\"\nThere was a clang of horseshoe on iron stake outside and a little cheer of voices.\n\nSlim moved back slightly so the light was not on his face. \"Funny how you an' him string along together.\" It was Slim's calm invitation to confidence.\n\n\"What's funny about it?\" George demanded defensively.\n\n\"Oh, I dunno. Hardly none of the guys ever travel together. I hardly never seen two guys travel together. You know how the hands are, they just come in and get their bunk and work a month, and then they quit and go out alone. Never seem to give a damn about nobody. It jus' seems kinda funny a cuckoo like him and a smart little guy like you travelin' together.\"\n\n\"He ain't no cuckoo,\" said George. \"He's dumb as hell, but he ain't crazy. An' I ain't so bright neither, or I wouldn't be buckin' barley for my fifty and found. If I was bright, if I was even a little bit smart, I'd have my own little place, an' I'd be bringin' in my own crops, 'stead of doin' all the work and not getting what comes up outa the ground.\"\n\nGeorge fell silent. He wanted to talk. Slim neither encouraged nor discouraged him. He just sat back quiet and receptive.\n\n\"It ain't so funny, him an' me goin' aroun' together,\" George said at last. \"Him and me was both born in Auburn. I knowed his Aunt Clara. She took him when he was a baby and raised him up. When his Aunt Clara died, Lennie just come along with me out workin'. Got kinda used to each other after a little while.\"\n\n\"Umm,\" said Slim.\n\nGeorge looked over at Slim and saw the calm, Godlike eyes fastened on him. \"Funny,\" said George. \"I used to have a hell of a lot of fun with 'im. Used to play jokes on 'im 'cause he was too dumb to take care of 'imself. But he was too dumb even to know he had a joke played on him. I had fun. Made me seem God damn smart alongside of him. Why he'd do any damn thing I tol' him. If I tol' him to walk over a cliff, over he'd go. That wasn't so damn much fun after a while. He never got mad about it, neither. I've beat the hell outa him, and he coulda bust every bone in my body jus' with his han's, but he never lifted a finger against me.\" George's voice was taking on the tone of confession. \"Tell you what made me stop that. One day a bunch of guys was standin' around up on the Sacramento River. I was feelin' pretty smart. I turns to Lennie and says, 'Jump in.' An' he jumps. Couldn't swim a stroke. He damn near drowned before we could get him. An' he was so damn nice to me for pullin' him out. Clean forgot I\ntold him to jump in. Well, I ain't done nothing like that no more.\"\n\n\"He's a nice fella,\" said Slim. \"Guy don't need no sense to be a nice fella. Seems to me sometimes it jus' works the other way around. Take a real smart guy and he ain't hardly ever a nice fella.\"\n\nGeorge stacked the scattered cards and began to lay out his solitaire hand. The shoes thudded on the ground outside. At the windows the light of the evening still made the window squares bright. \"I ain't got no people,\" George said. \"I seen the guys that go around on the ranches alone. That ain't no good. They don't have no fun. After a long time they get mean. They get wantin' to fight all the time.\"\n\n\"Yeah, they get mean,\" Slim agreed. \"They get so they don't want to talk to nobody.\"\n\n\"'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time,\" said George. \"But you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't get rid of him.\"\n\"He ain't mean,\" said Slim. \"I can see Lennie ain't a bit mean.\"\n\n\"'Course he ain't mean. But he gets in trouble alla time because he's so God damn dumb. Like what happened in Weed-\" He stopped, stopped in the middle of turning over a card. He looked alarmed and peered over at Slim. \"You wouldn't tell nobody?\"\n\n\"What'd he do in Weed?\" Slim asked calmly.\n\n\"You wouldn' tell?... No, 'course you wouldn'.\"\n\n\"What'd he do in Weed?\" Slim asked again.\n\n\"Well, he seen this girl in a red dress. Dumb bastard like he is, he wants to touch ever'thing he likes. Just wants to feel it. So he reaches out to feel this red dress an' the girl lets out a squawk, and that gets Lennie all mixed up, and he holds on 'cause that's the only thing he can think to do. Well, this girl squawks and squawks.\nI was jus' a little bit off, and I heard all the yellin', so I comes running, an' by that time Lennie's so scared all he can think to do is jus' hold on. I socked him over the head with a fence picket to make him let go. He was so scairt he couldn't let go of that dress. And he's so God damn strong, you know.\"\n\nSlim's eyes were level and unwinking. He nodded very slowly. \"So what happens?\"\n\nGeorge carefully built his line of solitaire cards. \"Well, that girl rabbits in an' tells the law she been raped. The guys in Weed start a party out to lynch Lennie. So we sit in a irrigation ditch under water all the rest of that day. Got on'y our heads sticking outa water, an' up under the grass that sticks out from the side of the ditch. An' that night we scrammed outa there.\"\n\nSlim sat in silence for a moment. \"Didn't hurt the girl none, huh?\" he asked finally.\n\nHell, no. He just scared her. I'd be scared too if he grabbed me. But he never hurt her. He jus' wanted to touch that red dress, like he wants to pet them pups all the time.\"\n\n\"He ain't mean,\" said Slim. \"I can tell a mean guy a mile off.\"\n\n\"'Course he ain't, and he'll do any damn thing I-\"\n\nLennie came in through the door. He wore his blue denim coat over his shoulders like a cape, and he walked hunched way over. \"Hi, Lennie,\" said George. \"How you like the pup now?\"\nLennie said breathlessly, \"He's brown an' white jus' like I wanted.\"\n\nHe went directly to his bunk and lay down and turned his face to the wall and drew up his knees. George put down his cards very deliberately. \"Lennie,\" he said sharply.\n\nLennie twisted his neck and looked over his shoulder. \"Huh? What you want, George?\"\n\n\"I tol' you you couldn't bring that pup in here.\"\n\"What pup, George? I ain't got no pup.\"\n\nGeorge went quickly to him, grabbed him by the shoulder and rolled him over. He reached down and picked the tiny puppy from where Lennie had been concealing it against his stomach. Lennie sat up quickly. \"Give 'um to me, George.\"\n\nGeorge said, \"You get right up an' take this pup back to the nest. He's gotta sleep with his mother. You want to kill him? Just born last night an' you take him out of the nest. You take him back or I'll tell Slim not to let you have him.\"\n\nLennie held out his hands pleadingly. \"Give 'um to me, George. I'll take 'um back. I didn't mean no harm, George. Honest I didn't. I jus' wanted to pet 'um a little.\"\n\nGeorge handed the pup to him. \"Awright. You get him back there quick, and don't you take him out no more. You'll kill him, the first thing you know.\" Lennie fairly scuttled out of the room.\n\nSlim had not moved. His calm eyes followed Lennie out the door. \"Jesus,\" he said. \"He's jus' like a kid, ain't he?\"\n\n\"Sure he's jes' like a kid. There ain't no more harm in him than a kid neither, except he's so strong. I bet he won't come in here to sleep tonight. He'd sleep right alongside that box in the barn. Well- let 'im. He ain't doin' no harm out there.\"\n\nIt was almost dark outside now. Old Candy, the swamper, came in and went to his bunk, and behind him struggled his old dog. \"Hello, Slim. Hello, George. Didn't neither of you play horseshoes?\"\n\n\"I don't like to play ever' night,\" said Slim.\n\nCandy went on, \"Either you guys got a slug of whisky? I gotta gut ache.\"\n\n\"I ain't,\" said Slim. \"I'd drink it myself if I had, an' I ain't got a gut ache neither.\"\n\n\"Gotta bad gut ache,\" said Candy. \"Them God damn turnips give it to me. I knowed they was going to before I ever eat 'em.\"\n\nThe thick-bodied Carlson came in out of the darkening yard. He walked to the other end of the bunk house and turned on the second shaded light. \"Darker'n hell in here,\" he said. \"Jesus, how that nigger can pitch shoes.\"\n\n\"He's plenty good,\" said Slim.\n\n\"Damn right he is,\" said Carlson. \"He don't give nobody else a chance to win-\" He stopped and sniffed the air, and still sniffing, looked down at the old dog. \"God awmighty, that dog stinks. Get him outa here, Candy! I don't know nothing that stinks as bad as an old dog. You gotta get him out.\"\n\nCandy rolled to the edge of his bunk. He reached over and patted the ancient dog, and he apologized, \"I been around him so much I never notice how he stinks.\"\n\n\"Well, I can't stand him in here,\" said Carlson. \"That stink hangs around even after he's gone.\" He walked over with his heavy-legged stride and looked down at the dog.\n\n\"Got no teeth,\" he said. \"He's all stiff with rheumatism. He ain't no good to you, Candy. An' he ain't no good to himself. Why'n't you shoot him, Candy?\"\n\nThe old man squirmed uncomfortably. \"Well- hell! I had him so long. Had him since he was a pup. I herded sheep with him.\" He said proudly, \"You wouldn't think it to look at him now, but he was the best damn sheep dog I ever seen.\"\n\nGeorge said, \"I seen a guy in Weed that had an Airedale could herd sheep. Learned it from the other dogs.\"\n\nCarlson was not to be put off. \"Look, Candy. This ol' dog jus' suffers hisself all the time. If you was to take him out and shoot him right in the back of the head-\" he leaned over and pointed, \"-right there, why he'd never know what hit him.\"\n\nCandy looked about unhappily. \"No,\" he said softly. \"No, I couldn't do that. I had 'im too long.\"\n\n\"He don't have no fun,\" Carlson insisted. \"And he stinks to beat hell. Tell you what. I'll shoot him for you. Then it won't be you that does it.\"\n\nCandy threw his legs off his bunk. He scratched the white stubble whiskers on his cheek nervously. \"I'm so used to him,\" he said softly. \"I had him from a pup.\"\n\"Well, you ain't bein' kind to him keepin' him alive,\" said Carlson. \"Look, Slim's bitch got a litter right now. I bet Slim would give you one of them pups to raise up, wouldn't you, Slim?\"\n\nThe skinner had been studying the old dog with his calm eyes.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said. \"You can have a pup if you want to.\" He seemed to shake himself free for speech. \"Carl's right, Candy. That dog ain't no good to himself. I wisht somebody'd shoot me if I get old an' a cripple.\"\n\nCandy looked helplessly at him, for Slim's opinions were law. \"Maybe it'd hurt him,\" he suggested. \"I don't mind takin' care of him.\"\n\nCarlson said, \"The way I'd shoot him, he wouldn't feel nothing. I'd put the gun right there.\" He pointed with his toe. \"Right back of the head. He wouldn't even quiver.\"\n\nCandy looked for help from face to face. It was quite dark outside by now. A young laboring man came in. His sloping shoulders were bent forward and he walked heavily on his heels, as though he carried the invisible grain bag. He went to his bunk and put his hat on his shelf. Then he picked a pulp magazine from his shelf and brought it to the light over the table.\n\n\"Did I show you this, Slim?\" he asked.\n\n\"Show me what?\"\n\nThe young man turned to the back of the magazine, put it down on the table and pointed with his finger. \"Right there, read that.\" Slim bent over it. \"Go on,\" said the young man. \"Read it out loud.\"\n\n\"'Dear Editor,'\" Slim read slowly. \"'I read your mag for six years and I think it is the best on the market. I like stories by Peter Rand. I think he is a whing-ding. Give us more like the Dark Rider. I don't write many letters. Just thought I would tell you I think your mag is the best dime's worth I ever spent.'\"\n\nSlim looked up questioningly. \"What you want me to read that for?\"\n\nWhit said, \"Go on. Read the name at the bottom.\"\n\nSlim read, \"'Yours for success, William Tenner.'\" He glanced up at Whit again. \"What you want me to read that for?\"\n\nWhit closed the magazine impressively. \"Don't you remember Bill Tenner? Worked here about three months ago?\"\n\nSlim thought.... \"Little guy?\" he asked. \"Drove a cultivator?\"\n\n\"That's him,\" Whit cried. \"That's the guy!\"\n\n\"You think he's the guy wrote this letter?\"\n\n\"I know it. Bill and me was in here one day. Bill had one of them books that just come. He was lookin' in it and he says, 'I wrote a letter. Wonder if they put it in the book!' But it wasn't there.\n\nBill says, 'Maybe they're savin' it for later.' An' that's just what they done. There it is.\"\n\n\"Guess you're right,\" said Slim. \"Got it right in the book.\"\n\nGeorge held out his hand for the magazine. \"Let's look at it?\"\n\nWhit found the place again, but he did not surrender his hold on it.\n\nHe pointed out the letter with his forefinger. And then he went to his box shelf and laid the magazine carefully in. \"I wonder if Bill seen it,\" he said. \"Bill and me worked in that patch of field peas. Run cultivators, both of us. Bill was a hell of a nice fella.\"\n\nDuring the conversation Carlson had refused to be drawn in. He continued to look down at the old dog. Candy watched him uneasily. At last Carlson said, \"If you want me to, I'll put the old devil out of his misery right now and get it over with. Ain't nothing left for him. Can't eat, can't see, can't even walk without hurtin'.\"\n\nCandy said hopefully, \"You ain't got no gun.\" \"The hell I ain't. Got a Luger. It won't hurt him none at all.\"\n\nCandy said, \"Maybe tomorra. Le's wait till tomorra.\"\n\n\"I don't see no reason for it,\" said Carlson. He went to his bunk, pulled his bag from underneath it and took out a Luger pistol. \"Le's get it over with,\" he said. \"We can't sleep with him stinkin' around in here.\"\n\nHe put the pistol in his hip pocket. Candy looked a long time at Slim to try to find some reversal. And Slim gave him none. At last Candy said softly and hopelessly, \"Awright- take 'im.\"\n\nHe did not look down at the dog at all. He lay back on his bunk and crossed his arms behind his head and stared at the ceiling. From his pocket Carlson took a little leather thong. He stooped over and tied it around the old dog's neck. All the men except Candy watched him. \"Come boy. Come on, boy,\" he said gently. And he said\napologetically to Candy, \"He won't even feel it.\" Candy did not move nor answer him. He twitched the thong.\n\n\"Come on, boy.\" The old dog got slowly and stiffly to his feet and followed the gently pulling leash.\n\nSlim said, \"Carlson.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"You know what to do.\"\n\n\"What ya mean, Slim?\"\n\n\"Take a shovel,\" said Slim shortly.\n\n\"Oh, sure! I get you.\" He led the dog out into the darkness. George followed to the door and shut the door and set the latch gently in its place. Candy lay rigidly on his bed staring at the ceiling.\n\nSlim said loudly, \"One of my lead mules got a bad hoof. Got to get some tar on it.\" His voice trailed off. It was silent outside.\n\nCarlson's footsteps died away. The silence came into the room. And the silence lasted.\n\nGeorge chuckled, \"I bet Lennie's right out there in the barn with his pup. He won't want to come in here no more now he's got a pup.\" Slim said, \"Candy, you can have any one of them pups you want.\"\n\nCandy did not answer. The silence fell on the room again. It came out of the night and invaded the room.\n\nGeorge said, \"Anybody like to play a little euchre?\"\n\n\"I'll play out a few with you,\" said Whit.\n\nThey took places opposite each other at the table under the light, but George did not shuffle the cards. He rippled the edge of the deck nervously, and the little snapping noise drew the eyes of all the men in the room, so that he stopped doing it. The silence fell on the room again. A minute passed, and another minute. Candy lay still, staring at the ceiling. Slim gazed at him for a moment and then looked down at his hands; he subdued one hand with the other, and held it down. There came a little gnawing sound from under the floor and all the men looked down toward it gratefully. Only Candy continued to stare at the ceiling.\n\n\"Sounds like there was a rat under there,\" said George. \"We ought to get a trap down there.\"\n\nWhit broke out, \"What the hell's takin' him so long? Lay out some cards, why don't you? We ain't going to get no euchre played this way.\"\n\nGeorge brought the cards together tightly and studied the backs of them. The silence was in the room again. A shot sounded in the distance. The men looked quickly at the old man. Every head turned toward him. For a moment he continued to stare at the ceiling. Then he rolled slowly over and faced the wall and lay silent. George shuffled the cards noisily and dealt them. Whit drew a scoring board to him and set the pegs to start.\n\nWhit said, \"I guess you guys really come here to work.\"\n\n\"How do ya mean?\" George asked.\n\nWhit laughed. \"Well, ya come on a Friday. You got two days to work till Sunday.\"\n\n\"I don't see how you figure,\" said George.\n\nWhit laughed again. \"You do if you been around these big ranches much. Guy that wants to look over a ranch comes in Sat'day afternoon. He gets Sat'day night supper an' three meals on Sunday, and he can quit Monday mornin' after breakfast without turning his hand. But you come to work Friday noon. You got to put in a day an' a half no matter how you figure.\"\n\nGeorge looked at him levelly. \"We're gonna stick aroun' a while,\" he said. \"Me an' Lennie's gonna roll up a stake.\"\n\nThe door opened quietly and the stable buck put in his head; a lean negro head, lined with pain, the eyes patient. \"Mr. Slim.\"\n\nSlim took his eyes from old Candy. \"Huh? Oh! Hello, Crooks. What'a matter?\"\n\n\"You told me to warm up tar for that mule's foot. I got it warm.\"\n\n\"Oh! Sure, Crooks. I'll come right out an' put it on.\"\n\n\"I can do it if you want, Mr. Slim.\"\n\n\"No. I'll come do it myself.\" He stood up.\n\nCrooks said, \"Mr. Slim.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"That big new guy's messin' around your pups out in the barn.\"\n\n\"Well, he ain't doin' no harm. I give him one of them pups.\"\n\n\"Just thought I'd tell ya,\" said Crooks. \"He's takin' 'em outa the nest and handlin' them. That won't do them no good.\"\n\n\"He won't hurt 'em,\" said Slim. \"I'll come along with you now.\"\n\nGeorge looked up. \"If that crazy bastard's foolin' around too much, jus' kick him out, Slim.\"\n\nSlim followed the stable buck out of the room. George dealt and Whit picked up his cards and examined them. \"Seen the new kid yet?\" he asked.\n\n\"What kid?\" George asked.\n\n\"Why, Curley's new wife.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I seen her.\"\n\n\"Well, ain't she a looloo?\"\n\n\"I ain't seen that much of her,\" said George.\n\nWhit laid down his cards impressively. \"Well, stick around an' keep your eyes open. You'll see plenty. She ain't concealin' nothing. I never seen nobody like her. She got the eye goin' all the time on everybody. I bet she even gives the stable buck the eye. I don't know what the hell she wants.\"\n\nGeorge asked casually, \"Been any trouble since she got here?\"\n\nIt was obvious that Whit was not interested in his cards. He laid his hand down and George scooped it in. George laid out his deliberate solitaire hand- seven cards, and six on top, and five on top of those.\n\nWhit said, \"I see what you mean. No, they ain't been nothing yet. Curley's got yella-jackets in his drawers, but that's all so far. Ever' time the guys is around she shows up. She's lookin' for Curley, or she thought she lef' somethin' layin' around and she's lookin' for it. Seems like she can't keep away from guys. An' Curley's pants is just crawlin' with ants, but they ain't nothing come of it yet.\"\n\nGeorge said, \"She's gonna make a mess. They's gonna be a bad mess about her. She's a jail bait all set on the trigger. That Curley got his work cut out for him. Ranch with a bunch of guys on it ain't no place for a girl, specially like her.\"\n\nWhit said, \"If you got idears, you oughtta come in town with us guys\ntomorra night.\"\n\n\"Why? What's doin'?\"\n\n\"Jus' the usual thing. We go in to old Susy's place. Hell of a nice place. Old Susy's a laugh- always crackin' jokes. Like she says when we come up on the front porch las' Sat'day night. Susy opens the door and then she yells over her shoulder, 'Get yor coats on, girls, here comes the sheriff.' She never talks dirty, neither. Got five girls there.\"\n\n\"What's it set you back?\" George asked.\n\n\"Two an' a half. You can get a shot for two bits. Susy got nice chairs to set in, too. If a guy don't want a flop, why he can just set in the chairs and have a couple or three shots and pass the time of day and Susy don't give a damn. She ain't rushin' guys through and kickin' 'em out if they don't want a flop.\"\n\n\"Might go in and look the joint over,\" said George.\n\n\"Sure. Come along. It's a hell of a lot of fun- her crackin' jokes all the time. Like she says one time, she says, 'I've knew people that if they got a rag rug on the floor an' a kewpie doll lamp on the phonograph they think they're running a parlor house.' That's Clara's house she's talkin' about. An' Susy says, 'I know what you boys want,' she says. 'My girls is clean,' she says, 'an' there ain't no water in my whisky,' she says. 'If any you guys wanta look at a kewpie doll lamp an' take your own chance gettin' burned, why you know where to go.' An' she says, 'There's guys around here walkin' bow-legged 'cause they like to look at a kewpie doll lamp.'\"\n\nGeorge asked, \"Clara runs the other house, huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Whit. \"We don't never go there. Clara gets three bucks a crack and thirty-five cents a shot, and she don't crack no jokes. But Susy's place is clean and she got nice chairs. Don't let no goo-goos in, neither.\"\n\n\"Me an' Lennie's rollin' up a stake,\" said George. \"I might go in an' set and have a shot, but I ain't puttin' out no two and a half.\"\n\n\"Well, a guy got to have some fun sometime,\" said Whit.\n\nThe door opened and Lennie and Carlson came in together. Lennie crept to his bunk and sat down, trying not to attract attention. Carlson reached under his bunk and brought out his bag. He didn't look at old Candy, who still faced the wall. Carlson found a little cleaning rod in the bag and a can of oil. He laid them on his bed and then brought out the pistol, took out the magazine and snapped the loaded shell from the chamber. Then he fell to cleaning the barrel with the little rod. When the ejector snapped, Candy turned over and looked for a moment at the gun before he turned back to the wall again.\n\nCarlson said casually, \"Curley been in yet?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Whit. \"What's eatin' on Curley?\"\n\nCarlson squinted down the barrel of his gun. \"Lookin' for his old\nlady. I seen him going round and round outside.\"\n\nWhit said sarcastically, \"He spends half his time lookin' for her,\nand the rest of the time she's lookin' for him.\"\n\nCurley burst into the room excitedly. \"Any you guys seen my wife?\"\nhe demanded.\n\n\"She ain't been here,\" said Whit.\n\nCurley looked threateningly about the room. \"Where the hell's Slim?\"\n\n\"Went out in the barn,\" said George. \"He was gonna put some tar on a\nsplit hoof.\"\n\nCurley's shoulders dropped and squared. \"How long ago'd he go?\"\n\n\"Five- ten minutes.\"\n\nCurley jumped out the door and banged it after him.\n\nWhit stood up. \"I guess maybe I'd like to see this,\" he said. \"Curley's just spoilin' or he wouldn't start for Slim. An' Curley's handy, God damn handy. Got in the finals for the Golden Gloves. He got newspaper clippings about it.\" He considered. \"But jus' the same, he better leave Slim alone. Nobody don't know what Slim can do.\"\n\n\"Thinks Slim's with his wife, don't he?\" said George.\n\n\"Looks like it,\" Whit said. \"'Course Slim ain't. Least I don't think\nSlim is. But I like to see the fuss if it comes off. Come on, le's\ngo.\"\n\nGeorge said, \"I'm stayin' right here. I don't want to get mixed up\nin nothing. Lennie and me got to make a stake.\"\n\nCarlson finished the cleaning of the gun and put it in the bag and\npushed the bag under his bunk. \"I guess I'll go out and look her\nover,\" he said.\n\nOld Candy lay still, and Lennie, from his bunk, watched George cautiously. When Whit and Carlson were gone and the door closed after them, George turned to Lennie. \"What you got on your mind?\"\n\n\"I ain't done nothing, George. Slim says I better not pet them pups so much for a while. Slim says it ain't good for them; so I come right in. I been good, George.\"\n\n\"I coulda told you that,\" said George.\n\n\"Well, I wasn't hurtin' 'em none. I jus' had mine in my lap pettin' it.\"\n\nGeorge asked, \"Did you see Slim out in the barn?\"\n\n\"Sure I did. He tol' me I better not pet that pup no more.\"\n\n\"Did you see that girl?\"\n\n\"You mean Curley's girl?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Did she come in the barn?\"\n\n\"No. Anyways I never seen her.\"\n\n\"You never seen Slim talkin' to her?\"\n\n\"Uh-uh. She ain't been in the barn.\"\n\n\"O.K.,\" said George. \"I guess them guys ain't gonna see no fight. If there's any fightin', Lennie, you keep out of it.\"\n\n\"I don't want no fights,\" said Lennie. He got up from his bunk and sat down at the table, across from George. Almost automatically George shuffled the cards and laid out his solitaire hand. He used a\ndeliberate, thoughtful slowness.\n\nLennie reached for a face card and studied it, then turned it upside down and studied it. \"Both ends the same,\" he said. \"George, why is it\nboth ends the same?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said George. \"That's jus' the way they make 'em. What was Slim doin' in the barn when you seen him?\"\n\n\"Slim?\"\n\n\"Sure. You seen him in the barn, an' he tol' you not to pet the pups so much.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah. He had a can a' tar an' a paint brush. I don't know what for.\"\n\n\"You sure that girl didn't come in like she come in here today?\"\n\n\"No. She never come.\"\n\nGeorge sighed. \"You give me a good whore house every time,\" he said. \"A guy can go in an' get drunk and get ever'thing outa his system all at once, an' no messes. And he knows how much it's gonna set him back. These here jail baits is just set on the trigger of the hoosegow.\"\n\nLennie followed his words admiringly, and moved his lips a little to keep up. George continued, \"You remember Andy Cushman, Lennie? Went to grammar school?\"\n\n\"The one that his old lady used to make hot cakes for the kids?\" Lennie  asked.\n\n\"Yeah. That's the one. You can remember anything if there's anything to eat in it.\" George looked carefully at the solitaire hand. He put an ace up on his scoring rack and piled a two, three and four of diamonds on it.\n\n\"Andy's in San Quentin right now on account of a tart,\" said George.\n\nLennie drummed on the table with his fingers. \"George?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"George, how long's it gonna be till we get that little place an' live on the fatta the lan'- an' rabbits?\"\n\n\"I don't know\", said George. \"We gotta get a big stake together. I know a little place we can get cheap, but they ain't givin' it away.\"\n\nOld Candy turned slowly over. His eyes were wide open. He watched George carefully.\n\nLennie said, \"Tell about that place, George.\"\n\n\"I jus' tol' you, jus' las' night.\"\n\n\"Go on- tell again, George.\"\n\n\"Well, it's ten acres,\" said George. \"Got a little win'mill. Got a little shack on it, an' a chicken run. Got a kitchen, orchard, cherries, apples, peaches, 'cots, nuts, got a few berries. They's a place for alfalfa and plenty water to flood it. They's a pig pen-\"\n\n\"An' rabbits, George.\"\n\n\"No place for rabbits now, but I could easy build a few hutches and you could feed alfalfa to the rabbits.\"\n\n\"Damn right, I could,\" said Lennie. \"You God damn right I could.\"\n\nGeorge's hands stopped working with the cards. His voice was growing warmer.\n\n\"An' we could have a few pigs. I could build a smoke house like the one gran'pa had, an' when we kill a pig we can smoke the bacon and the hams, and make sausage an' all like that. An' when the salmon run up river we could catch a hundred of 'em an' salt 'em down or smoke 'em. We could have them for breakfast. They ain't nothing so nice as smoked salmon. When the fruit come in we could can it- and tomatoes, they're easy to can. Ever' Sunday we'd kill a chicken or a rabbit. Maybe we'd have a cow or a goat, and the cream is so God damn thick you got to cut it with a knife and take it out with a spoon.\"\n\nLennie watched him with wide eyes, and old Candy watched him too.\n\nLennie said softly, \"We could live offa the fatta the lan'.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said George. \"All kin's a vegetables in the garden, and if we want a little whisky we can sell a few eggs or something, or some milk. We'd jus' live there. We'd belong there. There wouldn't be no more runnin' round the country and gettin' fed by a Jap cook. No, sir, we'd have our own place where we belonged and not sleep in no\nbunkhouse.\"\n\n\"Tell about the house, George,\" Lennie begged.\n\n\"Sure, we'd have a little house an' a room to ourself. Little fat iron stove, an' in the winter we'd keep a fire goin' in it. It ain't enough land so we'd have to work too hard. Maybe six, seven hours a day. We wouldn't have to buck no barley eleven hours a day. An' when we put in a crop, why, we'd be there to take the crop up. We'd know what come of our planting.\"\n\n\"An' rabbits,\" Lennie said eagerly. \"An' I'd take care of 'em. Tell how I'd do that, George.\"\n\n\"Sure, you'd go out in the alfalfa patch an' you'd have a sack. You'd fill up the sack and bring it in an' put it in the rabbit cages.\"\n\n\"They'd nibble an' they'd nibble,\" said Lennie, \"the way they do. I seen 'em.\"\n\n\"Ever' six weeks or so,\" George continued, \"them does would throw a litter so we'd have plenty rabbits to eat an' to sell. An' we'd keep\na few pigeons to go flyin' around the win'mill like they done when I\nwas a kid.\" He looked raptly at the wall over Lennie's head.\n\n\"An' it'd be our own, an' nobody could can us. If we don't like a guy we can say, 'Get the hell out,' and by God he's got to do it. An' if a\nfren' come along, why we'd have an extra bunk, an' we'd say, 'Why don't you spen' the night?' an' by God he would. We'd have a setter dog and a couple stripe cats, but you gotta watch out them cats don't get the little rabbits.\"\n\nLennie breathed hard. \"You jus' let 'em try to get the rabbits. I'll\nbreak their God damn necks. I'll... I'll smash 'em with a stick.\" He\nsubsided, grumbling to himself, threatening the future cats which might dare to disturb the future rabbits.\n\nGeorge sat entranced with his own picture. When Candy spoke they both jumped as though they had been caught doing something reprehensible. Candy said, \"You know where's a place like that?\"\n\nGeorge was on guard immediately. \"S'pose I do,\" he said. \"What's that to you?\"\n\n\"You don't need to tell me where it's at. Might be any place.\"\n\n\"Sure,\" said George. \"That's right. You couldn't find it in a hundred years.\"\n\nCandy went on excitedly, \"How much they want for a place like that?\"\n\nGeorge watched him suspiciously. \"Well- I could get it for six hundred bucks. The ol' people that owns it is flat bust an' the ol' lady needs an operation. Say- what's it to you? You got nothing to do with us.\"\n\nCandy said, \"I ain't much good with on'y one hand. I lost my hand right here on this ranch. That's why they give me a job swampin'. An' they give me two hunderd an' fifty dollars 'cause I los' my hand. An' I got fifty more saved up right in the bank, right now. Tha's three hunderd, and I got fifty more comin' the end a the month. Tell you what-\"\n\nHe leaned forward eagerly. \"S'pose I went in with you guys. Tha's three hunderd an' fifty bucks I'd put in. I ain't much good, but I could cook and tend the chickens and hoe the garden some. How'd that be?\"\n\nGeorge half-closed his eyes. \"I gotta think about that. We was always gonna do it by ourselves.\"\n\nCandy interrupted him, \"I'd make a will an' leave my share to you guys in case I kick off, 'cause I ain't got no relatives nor nothing. You guys got any money? Maybe we could do her right now?\"\n\nGeorge spat on the floor disgustedly. \"We got ten bucks between us.\"\n\nThen he said thoughtfully, \"Look, if me an' Lennie work a month an' don't spen' nothing, we'll have a hunderd bucks. That'd be four fifty. I bet we could swing her for that. Then you an' Lennie could go get her started an' I'd get a job an' make up the res', an' you could sell eggs an' stuff like that.\"\n\nThey fell into a silence. They looked at one another, amazed. This thing they had never really believed in was coming true. George said reverently, \"Jesus Christ! I bet we could swing her.\" His eyes were full of wonder. \"I bet we could swing her,\" he repeated softly.\n\nCandy sat on the edge of his bunk. He scratched the stump of his wrist nervously. \"I got hurt four year ago,\" he said. \"They'll can me purty soon. Jus' as soon as I can't swamp out no bunkhouses they'll put me on the county. Maybe if I give you guys my money, you'll let me hoe in the garden even after I ain't no good at it. An' I'll wash dishes an' little chicken stuff like that. But I'll be on our own place, an' I'll be let to work on our own place.\"\n\nHe said miserably, \"You seen what they done to my dog tonight? They says he wasn't no good to himself nor nobody else. When they can me here I wisht somebody'd shoot me. But they won't do nothing like that. I won't have no place to go, an' I can't get no more jobs. I'll have thirty dollars more comin', time you guys is ready to quit.\"\n\nGeorge stood up. \"We'll do her,\" he said. \"We'll fix up that little old place an' we'll go live there.\" He sat down again. They all sat still, all bemused by the beauty of the thing, each mind was popped into the future when this lovely thing should come about.\n\n\nGeorge said wonderingly, \"S'pose they was a carnival or a circus  come to town, or a ball game, or any damn thing.\"\n\nOld Candy nodded in appreciation of the idea.\n\n\"We'd just go to her,\"  George said. \"We wouldn't ask nobody if we could. Jus' say, 'We'll go to her,' an' we would. Jus' milk the cow and sling some grain to the chickens an' go to her.\"\n\n\"An' put some grass to the rabbits,\" Lennie broke in. \"I wouldn't  never forget to feed them. When we gon'ta do it, George?\"\n\n\"In one month. Right squack in one month. Know what I'm gon'ta do? I'm gon'ta write to them old people that owns the place that we'll take it. An' Candy'll send a hunderd dollars to bind her.\"\n\n\"Sure will,\" said Candy. \"They got a good stove there?\"\n\n\"Sure, got a nice stove, burns coal or wood.\"\n\n\"I'm gonna take my pup,\" said Lennie. \"I bet by Christ he likes it  there, by Jesus.\"\n\nVoices were approaching from outside. George said quickly, \"Don't tell nobody about it. Jus' us three an' nobody else. They li'ble to can us so we can't make no stake. Jus' go on like we was gonna buck barley the rest of our lives, then all of a sudden some day we'll go get our pay an' scram outa here.\"\n\nLennie and Candy nodded, and they were grinning with delight. \"Don't tell nobody,\" Lennie said to himself.\n\nCandy said, \"George.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I ought to of shot that dog myself, George. I shouldn't ought to of let no stranger shoot my dog.\"\n\nThe door opened. Slim came in, followed by Curley and Carlson and  Whit.\n\nSlim's hands were black with tar and he was scowling. Curley hung close to his elbow.\n\nCurley said, \"Well, I didn't mean nothing, Slim. I just ast you.\"\n\nSlim said, \"Well, you been askin' me too often. I'm gettin' God damn sick of it. If you can't look after your own God damn wife, what you  expect me to do about it? You lay offa me.\"\n\n\"I'm jus' tryin' to tell you I didn't mean nothing,\" said Curley. \"I jus' thought you might of saw her.\"\n\n\"Why'n't you tell her to stay the hell home where she belongs?\" said Carlson. \"You let her hang around bunkhouses and pretty soon you're gonna have som'pin on your hands and you won't be able to do nothing about it.\"\n\nCurley whirled on Carlson. \"You keep outa this les' you wanta step outside.\"\n\nCarlson laughed. \"You God damn punk,\" he said. \"You tried to throw a scare into Slim, an' you couldn't make it stick. Slim throwed a scare into you. You're yella as a frog belly. I don't care if you're the best welter in the country. You come for me, an' I'll kick your God damn head off.\"\n\nCandy joined the attack with joy. \"Glove fulla vaseline,\" he said  disgustedly. Curley glared at him. His eyes slipped on past and lighted on Lennie; and Lennie was still smiling with delight at the memory of the ranch.\n\nCurley stepped over to Lennie like a terrier. \"What the hell you laughin' at?\"\n\nLennie looked blankly at him. \"Huh?\"\n\nThen Curley's rage exploded. \"Come on, ya big bastard. Get up on your feet. No big son-of-a-bitch is gonna laugh at me. I'll show ya who's yella.\"\n\nLennie looked helplessly at George, and then he got up and tried to retreat. Curley was balanced and poised. He slashed at Lennie with his left, and then smashed down his nose with a right. Lennie gave a cry of terror. Blood welled from his nose.\n\n\"George,\" he cried. \"Make 'um let me alone, George.\"\n\nHe backed until he was against the wall, and Curley followed, slugging him in the face. Lennie's hands remained at his sides; he was too frightened to defend himself.\nGeorge was on his feet yelling, \"Get him, Lennie. Don't let him do it.\"\nLennie covered his face with his huge paws and bleated with terror. He cried, \"Make 'um stop, George.\" Then Curley attacked his stomach and cut off his wind.\n\nSlim jumped up. \"The dirty little rat,\" he cried, \"I'll get 'um myself.\"\n\nGeorge put out his hand and grabbed Slim. \"Wait a minute,\" he shouted. He cupped his hands around his mouth and yelled, \"Get 'im, Lennie!\"  Lennie took his hands away from his face and looked about for George, and Curley slashed at his eyes. The big face was covered with blood.\n\nGeorge yelled again, \"I said get him.\"\n\nCurley's fist was swinging when Lennie reached for it. The next minute Curley was flopping like a fish on a line, and his closed fist was lost in Lennie's big hand. George ran down the room. \"Leggo of him, Lennie. Let go.\"\n\nBut Lennie watched in terror the flopping little man whom he held. Blood ran down Lennie's face, one of his eyes was cut and closed. George slapped him in the face again and again, and still Lennie held on to the closed fist. Curley was white and shrunken by now, and his struggling had become weak. He stood crying, his fist lost in Lennie's paw.\n\nGeorge shouted over and over. \"Leggo his hand, Lennie. Leggo. Slim, come help me while the guy got any hand left.\"\n\nSuddenly Lennie let go his hold. He crouched cowering against the wall.\n\n\"You tol' me to, George,\" he said miserably.\n\nCurley sat down on the floor, looking in wonder at his crushed hand. Slim and Carlson bent over him. Then Slim straightened up and regarded  Lennie with horror.\n\n\"We got to get him in to a doctor,\" he said. \"Looks to me like ever' bone in his han' is bust.\"\n\n\"I didn't wanta,\" Lennie cried. \"I didn't wanta hurt him.\"\n\nSlim said, \"Carlson, you get the candy wagon hitched up. We'll take 'um into Soledad an' get 'um fixed up.\" Carlson hurried out.\n\nSlim turned to the whimpering Lennie. \"It ain't your fault,\" he said. \"This punk sure had it comin' to him. But- Jesus! He ain't hardly got no han' left.\"\n\nSlim hurried out, and in a moment returned with a tin cup of water. He held it to Curley's lips.\n\nGeorge said, \"Slim, will we get canned now? We need the stake. Will Curley's old man can us now?\"\n\nSlim smiled wryly. He knelt down beside Curley. \"You got your senses  in hand enough to listen?\" he asked.\n\nCurley nodded. \"Well, then listen,\" Slim went on. \"I think you got your han' caught in a machine.  If you don't tell nobody what happened, we ain't going to. But you jus' tell an' try to get this guy canned and we'll tell ever'body, an' then will you get the laugh.\"\n\n\"I won't tell,\" said Curley. He avoided looking at Lennie.\n\nBuggy wheels sounded outside. Slim helped Curley up. \"Come on now. Carlson's gonna take you to a doctor.\" He helped Curley out the door.\n\nThe sound of wheels drew away. In a moment Slim came back into the bunkhouse. He looked at Lennie, still crouched fearfully against the wall.\n\n\"Le's see your hands,\" he asked.\n\nLennie stuck out his hands.\n\n\"Christ awmighty, I hate to have you mad at me,\" Slim said.\n\nGeorge broke in, \"Lennie was jus' scairt,\" he explained. \"He didn't know what to do. I told you nobody ought never to fight him. No, I guess it was Candy I told.\"\n\nCandy nodded solemnly. \"That's jus' what you done,\" he said.\n\n\"Right this morning when Curley first lit intil your fren', you says, 'He better not fool with Lennie if he knows what's good for 'um.' That's jus' what you says to me.\"\n\nGeorge turned to Lennie. \"It ain't your fault,\" he said. \"You don't need to be scairt no more. You done jus' what I tol' you to.

Tennyson", "lyrics": "The Princess LyricsPROLOGUE\n\nSir Walter Vivian all a summer's day\nGave his broad lawns until the set of sun\nUp to the people: thither flocked at noon\nHis tenants, wife and child, and thither half\nThe neighbouring borough with their Institute\nOf which he was the patron. I was there\nFrom college, visiting the son,--the son\nA Walter too,--with others of our set,\nFive others: we were seven at Vivian-place.\nAnd me that morning Walter showed the house,\nGreek, set with busts: from vases in the hall\nFlowers of all heavens, and lovelier than their names,\nGrew side by side; and on the pavement lay\nCarved stones of the Abbey-ruin in the park,\nHuge Ammonites, and the first bones of Time;\nAnd on the tables every clime and age\nJumbled together; celts and calumets,\nClaymore and snowshoe, toys in lava, fans\nOf sandal, amber, ancient rosaries,\nLaborious orient ivory sphere in sphere,\nThe cursed Malayan crease, and battle-clubs\nFrom the isles of palm: and higher on the walls,\nBetwixt the monstrous horns of elk and deer,\nHis own forefathers' arms and armour hung.\n\nAnd 'this' he said 'was Hugh's at Agincourt;\nAnd that was old Sir Ralph's at Ascalon:\nA good knight he! we keep a chronicle\nWith all about him'--which he brought, and I\nDived in a hoard of tales that dealt with knights,\nHalf-legend, half-historic, counts and kings\nWho laid about them at their wills and died;\nAnd mixt with these, a lady, one that armed\nHer own fair head, and sallying through the gate,\nHad beat her foes with slaughter from her walls.\n'O miracle of women,' said the book,\n'O noble heart who, being strait-besieged\nBy this wild king to force her to his wish,\nNor bent, nor broke, nor shunned a soldier's death,\nBut now when all was lost or seemed as lost--\nHer stature more than mortal in the burst\nOf sunrise, her arm lifted, eyes on fire--\nBrake with a blast of trumpets from the gate,\nAnd, falling on them like a thunderbolt,\nShe trampled some beneath her horses' heels,\nAnd some were whelmed with missiles of the wall,\nAnd some were pushed with lances from the rock,\nAnd part were drowned within the whirling brook:\nO miracle of noble womanhood!'\n\nSo sang the gallant glorious chronicle;\nAnd, I all rapt in this, 'Come out,' he said,\n'To the Abbey: there is Aunt Elizabeth\nAnd sister Lilia with the rest.' We went\n(I kept the book and had my finger in it)\nDown through the park: strange was the sight to me;\nFor all the sloping pasture murmured, sown\nWith happy faces and with holiday.\nThere moved the multitude, a thousand heads:\nThe patient leaders of their Institute\nTaught them with facts. One reared a font of stone\nAnd drew, from butts of water on the slope,\nThe fountain of the moment, playing, now\nA twisted snake, and now a rain of pearls,\nOr steep-up spout whereon the gilded ball\nDanced like a wisp: and somewhat lower down\nA man with knobs and wires and vials fired\nA cannon: Echo answered in her sleep\nFrom hollow fields: and here were telescopes\nFor azure views; and there a group of girls\nIn circle waited, whom the electric shock\nDislinked with shrieks and laughter: round the lake\nA little clock-work steamer paddling plied\nAnd shook the lilies: perched about the knolls\nA dozen angry models jetted steam:\nA petty railway ran: a fire-balloon\nRose gem-like up before the dusky groves\nAnd dropt a fairy parachute and past:\nAnd there through twenty posts of telegraph\nThey flashed a saucy message to and fro\nBetween the mimic stations; so that sport\nWent hand in hand with Science; otherwhere\nPure sport; a herd of boys with clamour bowled\nAnd stumped the wicket; babies rolled about\nLike tumbled fruit in grass; and men and maids\nArranged a country dance, and flew through light\nAnd shadow, while the twangling violin\nStruck up with Soldier-laddie, and overhead\nThe broad ambrosial aisles of lofty lime\nMade noise with bees and breeze from end to end.\nStrange was the sight and smacking of the time;\nAnd long we gazed, but satiated at length\nCame to the ruins. High-arched and ivy-claspt,\nOf finest Gothic lighter than a fire,\nThrough one wide chasm of time and frost they gave\nThe park, the crowd, the house; but all within\nThe sward was trim as any garden lawn:\nAnd here we lit on Aunt Elizabeth,\nAnd Lilia with the rest, and lady friends\nFrom neighbour seats: and there was Ralph himself,\nA broken statue propt against the wall,\nAs gay as any. Lilia, wild with sport,\nHalf child half woman as she was, had wound\nA scarf of orange round the stony helm,\nAnd robed the shoulders in a rosy silk,\nThat made the old warrior from his ivied nook\nGlow like a sunbeam: near his tomb a feast\nShone, silver-set; about it lay the guests,\nAnd there we joined them: then the maiden Aunt\nTook this fair day for text, and from it preached\nAn universal culture for the crowd,\nAnd all things great; but we, unworthier, told\nOf college: he had climbed across the spikes,\nAnd he had squeezed himself betwixt the bars,\nAnd he had breathed the Proctor's dogs; and one\nDiscussed his tutor, rough to common men,\nBut honeying at the whisper of a lord;\nAnd one the Master, as a rogue in grain\nVeneered with sanctimonious theory.\nBut while they talked, above their heads I saw\nThe feudal warrior lady-clad; which brought\nMy book to mind: and opening this I read\nOf old Sir Ralph a page or two that rang\nWith tilt and tourney; then the tale of her\nThat drove her foes with slaughter from her walls,\nAnd much I praised her nobleness, and 'Where,'\nAsked Walter, patting Lilia's head (she lay\nBeside him) 'lives there such a woman now?'\n\nQuick answered Lilia 'There are thousands now\nSuch women, but convention beats them down:\nIt is but bringing up; no more than that:\nYou men have done it: how I hate you all!\nAh, were I something great! I wish I were\nSome might poetess, I would shame you then,\nThat love to keep us children! O I wish\nThat I were some great princess, I would build\nFar off from men a college like a man's,\nAnd I would teach them all that men are taught;\nWe are twice as quick!' And here she shook aside\nThe hand that played the patron with her curls.\n\nAnd one said smiling 'Pretty were the sight\nIf our old halls could change their sex, and flaunt\nWith prudes for proctors, dowagers for deans,\nAnd sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair.\nI think they should not wear our rusty gowns,\nBut move as rich as Emperor-moths, or Ralph\nWho shines so in the corner; yet I fear,\nIf there were many Lilias in the brood,\nHowever deep you might embower the nest,\nSome boy would spy it.'\nAt this upon the sward\nShe tapt her tiny silken-sandaled foot:\n'That's your light way; but I would make it death\nFor any male thing but to peep at us.'\n\nPetulant she spoke, and at herself she laughed;\nA rosebud set with little wilful thorns,\nAnd sweet as English air could make her, she:\nBut Walter hailed a score of names upon her,\nAnd 'petty Ogress', and 'ungrateful Puss',\nAnd swore he longed at college, only longed,\nAll else was well, for she-society.\nThey boated and they cricketed; they talked\nAt wine, in clubs, of art, of politics;\nThey lost their weeks; they vext the souls of deans;\nThey rode; they betted; made a hundred friends,\nAnd caught the blossom of the flying terms,\nBut missed the mignonette of Vivian-place,\nThe little hearth-flower Lilia. Thus he spoke,\nPart banter, part affection.\n'True,' she said,\n'We doubt not that. O yes, you missed us much.\nI'll stake my ruby ring upon it you did.'\n\nShe held it out; and as a parrot turns\nUp through gilt wires a crafty loving eye,\nAnd takes a lady's finger with all care,\nAnd bites it for true heart and not for harm,\nSo he with Lilia's. Daintily she shrieked\nAnd wrung it. 'Doubt my word again!' he said.\n'Come, listen! here is proof that you were missed:\nWe seven stayed at Christmas up to read;\nAnd there we took one tutor as to read:\nThe hard-grained Muses of the cube and square\nWere out of season: never man, I think,\nSo mouldered in a sinecure as he:\nFor while our cloisters echoed frosty feet,\nAnd our long walks were stript as bare as brooms,\nWe did but talk you over, pledge you all\nIn wassail; often, like as many girls--\nSick for the hollies and the yews of home--\nAs many little trifling Lilias--played\nCharades and riddles as at Christmas here,\nAnd ~what's my thought~ and ~when~ and ~where~ and ~how~,\nAs here at Christmas.'\nShe remembered that:\nA pleasant game, she thought: she liked it more\nThan magic music, forfeits, all the rest.\nBut these--what kind of tales did men tell men,\nShe wondered, by themselves?\nA half-disdain\nPerched on the pouted blossom of her lips:\nAnd Walter nodded at me; '~He~ began,\nThe rest would follow, each in turn; and so\nWe forged a sevenfold story. Kind? what kind?\nChimeras, crotchets, Christmas solecisms,\nSeven-headed monsters only made to kill\nTime by the fire in winter.'\n'Kill him now,\nThe tyrant! kill him in the summer too,'\nSaid Lilia; 'Why not now?' the maiden Aunt.\n'Why not a summer's as a winter's tale?\nA tale for summer as befits the time,\nAnd something it should be to suit the place,\nHeroic, for a hero lies beneath,\nGrave, solemn!'\nWalter warped his mouth at this\nTo something so mock-solemn, that I laughed\nAnd Lilia woke with sudden-thrilling mirth\nAn echo like a ghostly woodpecker,\nHid in the ruins; till the maiden Aunt\n(A little sense of wrong had touched her face\nWith colour) turned to me with 'As you will;\nHeroic if you will, or what you will,\nOr be yourself you hero if you will.'\n\n'Take Lilia, then, for heroine' clamoured he,\n'And make her some great Princess, six feet high,\nGrand, epic, homicidal; and be you\nThe Prince to win her!'\n'Then follow me, the Prince,'\nI answered, 'each be hero in his turn!\nSeven and yet one, like shadows in a dream.--\nHeroic seems our Princess as required--\nBut something made to suit with Time and place,\nA Gothic ruin and a Grecian house,\nA talk of college and of ladies' rights,\nA feudal knight in silken masquerade,\nAnd, yonder, shrieks and strange experiments\nFor which the good Sir Ralph had burnt them all--\nThis ~were~ a medley! we should have him back\nWho told the \"Winter's tale\" to do it for us.\nNo matter: we will say whatever comes.\nAnd let the ladies sing us, if they will,\nFrom time to time, some ballad or a song\nTo give us breathing-space.'\nSo I began,\nAnd the rest followed: and the women sang\nBetween the rougher voices of the men,\nLike linnets in the pauses of the wind:\nAnd here I give the story and the songs.\n\nI\n\nA prince I was, blue-eyed, and fair in face,\nOf temper amorous, as the first of May,\nWith lengths of yellow ringlet, like a girl,\nFor on my cradle shone the Northern star.\n\nThere lived an ancient legend in our house.\nSome sorcerer, whom a far-off grandsire burnt\nBecause he cast no shadow, had foretold,\nDying, that none of all our blood should know\nThe shadow from the substance, and that one\nShould come to fight with shadows and to fall.\nFor so, my mother said, the story ran.\nAnd, truly, waking dreams were, more or less,\nAn old and strange affection of the house.\nMyself too had weird seizures, Heaven knows what:\nOn a sudden in the midst of men and day,\nAnd while I walked and talked as heretofore,\nI seemed to move among a world of ghosts,\nAnd feel myself the shadow of a dream.\nOur great court-Galen poised his gilt-head cane,\nAnd pawed his beard, and muttered 'catalepsy'.\nMy mother pitying made a thousand prayers;\nMy mother was as mild as any saint,\nHalf-canonized by all that looked on her,\nSo gracious was her tact and tenderness:\nBut my good father thought a king a king;\nHe cared not for the affection of the house;\nHe held his sceptre like a pedant's wand\nTo lash offence, and with long arms and hands\nReached out, and picked offenders from the mass\nFor judgment.\nNow it chanced that I had been,\nWhile life was yet in bud and blade, bethrothed\nTo one, a neighbouring Princess: she to me\nWas proxy-wedded with a bootless calf\nAt eight years old; and still from time to time\nCame murmurs of her beauty from the South,\nAnd of her brethren, youths of puissance;\nAnd still I wore her picture by my heart,\nAnd one dark tress; and all around them both\nSweet thoughts would swarm as bees about their queen.\n\nBut when the days drew nigh that I should wed,\nMy father sent ambassadors with furs\nAnd jewels, gifts, to fetch her: these brought back\nA present, a great labour of the loom;\nAnd therewithal an answer vague as wind:\nBesides, they saw the king; he took the gifts;\nHe said there was a compact; that was true:\nBut then she had a will; was he to blame?\nAnd maiden fancies; loved to live alone\nAmong her women; certain, would not wed.\n\nThat morning in the presence room I stood\nWith Cyril and with Florian, my two friends:\nThe first, a gentleman of broken means\n(His father's fault) but given to starts and bursts\nOf revel; and the last, my other heart,\nAnd almost my half-self, for still we moved\nTogether, twinned as horse's ear and eye.\n\nNow, while they spake, I saw my father's face\nGrow long and troubled like a rising moon,\nInflamed with wrath: he started on his feet,\nTore the king's letter, snowed it down, and rent\nThe wonder of the loom through warp and woof\nFrom skirt to skirt; and at the last he sware\nThat he would send a hundred thousand men,\nAnd bring her in a whirlwind: then he chewed\nThe thrice-turned cud of wrath, and cooked his spleen,\nCommuning with his captains of the war.\n\nAt last I spoke. 'My father, let me go.\nIt cannot be but some gross error lies\nIn this report, this answer of a king,\nWhom all men rate as kind and hospitable:\nOr, maybe, I myself, my bride once seen,\nWhate'er my grief to find her less than fame,\nMay rue the bargain made.' And Florian said:\n'I have a sister at the foreign court,\nWho moves about the Princess; she, you know,\nWho wedded with a nobleman from thence:\nHe, dying lately, left her, as I hear,\nThe lady of three castles in that land:\nThrough her this matter might be sifted clean.'\nAnd Cyril whispered: 'Take me with you too.'\nThen laughing 'what, if these weird seizures come\nUpon you in those lands, and no one near\nTo point you out the shadow from the truth!\nTake me: I'll serve you better in a strait;\nI grate on rusty hinges here:' but 'No!'\nRoared the rough king, 'you shall not; we ourself\nWill crush her pretty maiden fancies dead\nIn iron gauntlets: break the council up.'\n\nBut when the council broke, I rose and past\nThrough the wild woods that hung about the town;\nFound a still place, and plucked her likeness out;\nLaid it on flowers, and watched it lying bathed\nIn the green gleam of dewy-tasselled trees:\nWhat were those fancies? wherefore break her troth?\nProud looked the lips: but while I meditated\nA wind arose and rushed upon the South,\nAnd shook the songs, the whispers, and the shrieks\nOf the wild woods together; and a Voice\nWent with it, 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win.'\n\nThen, ere the silver sickle of that month\nBecame her golden shield, I stole from court\nWith Cyril and with Florian, unperceived,\nCat-footed through the town and half in dread\nTo hear my father's clamour at our backs\nWith Ho! from some bay-window shake the night;\nBut all was quiet: from the bastioned walls\nLike threaded spiders, one by one, we dropt,\nAnd flying reached the frontier: then we crost\nTo a livelier land; and so by tilth and grange,\nAnd vines, and blowing bosks of wilderness,\nWe gained the mother city thick with towers,\nAnd in the imperial palace found the king.\n\nHis name was Gama; cracked and small his voice,\nBut bland the smile that like a wrinkling wind\nOn glassy water drove his cheek in lines;\nA little dry old man, without a star,\nNot like a king: three days he feasted us,\nAnd on the fourth I spake of why we came,\nAnd my bethrothed. 'You do us, Prince,' he said,\nAiring a snowy hand and signet gem,\n'All honour. We remember love ourselves\nIn our sweet youth: there did a compact pass\nLong summers back, a kind of ceremony--\nI think the year in which our olives failed.\nI would you had her, Prince, with all my heart,\nWith my full heart: but there were widows here,\nTwo widows, Lady Psyche, Lady Blanche;\nThey fed her theories, in and out of place\nMaintaining that with equal husbandry\nThe woman were an equal to the man.\nThey harped on this; with this our banquets rang;\nOur dances broke and buzzed in knots of talk;\nNothing but this; my very ears were hot\nTo hear them: knowledge, so my daughter held,\nWas all in all: they had but been, she thought,\nAs children; they must lose the child, assume\nThe woman: then, Sir, awful odes she wrote,\nToo awful, sure, for what they treated of,\nBut all she is and does is awful; odes\nAbout this losing of the child; and rhymes\nAnd dismal lyrics, prophesying change\nBeyond all reason: these the women sang;\nAnd they that know such things--I sought but peace;\nNo critic I--would call them masterpieces:\nThey mastered ~me~. At last she begged a boon,\nA certain summer-palace which I have\nHard by your father's frontier: I said no,\nYet being an easy man, gave it: and there,\nAll wild to found an University\nFor maidens, on the spur she fled; and more\nWe know not,--only this: they see no men,\nNot even her brother Arac, nor the twins\nHer brethren, though they love her, look upon her\nAs on a kind of paragon; and I\n(Pardon me saying it) were much loth to breed\nDispute betwixt myself and mine: but since\n(And I confess with right) you think me bound\nIn some sort, I can give you letters to her;\nAnd yet, to speak the truth, I rate your chance\nAlmost at naked nothing.'\nThus the king;\nAnd I, though nettled that he seemed to slur\nWith garrulous ease and oily courtesies\nOur formal compact, yet, not less (all frets\nBut chafing me on fire to find my bride)\nWent forth again with both my friends. We rode\nMany a long league back to the North. At last\nFrom hills, that looked across a land of hope,\nWe dropt with evening on a rustic town\nSet in a gleaming river's crescent-curve,\nClose at the boundary of the liberties;\nThere, entered an old hostel, called mine host\nTo council, plied him with his richest wines,\nAnd showed the late-writ letters of the king.\n\nHe with a long low sibilation, stared\nAs blank as death in marble; then exclaimed\nAverring it was clear against all rules\nFor any man to go: but as his brain\nBegan to mellow, 'If the king,' he said,\n'Had given us letters, was he bound to speak?\nThe king would bear him out;' and at the last--\nThe summer of the vine in all his veins--\n'No doubt that we might make it worth his while.\nShe once had past that way; he heard her speak;\nShe scared him; life! he never saw the like;\nShe looked as grand as doomsday and as grave:\nAnd he, he reverenced his liege-lady there;\nHe always made a point to post with mares;\nHis daughter and his housemaid were the boys:\nThe land, he understood, for miles about\nWas tilled by women; all the swine were sows,\nAnd all the dogs'--\nBut while he jested thus,\nA thought flashed through me which I clothed in act,\nRemembering how we three presented Maid\nOr Nymph, or Goddess, at high tide of feast,\nIn masque or pageant at my father's court.\nWe sent mine host to purchase female gear;\nHe brought it, and himself, a sight to shake\nThe midriff of despair with laughter, holp\nTo lace us up, till, each, in maiden plumes\nWe rustled: him we gave a costly bribe\nTo guerdon silence, mounted our good steeds,\nAnd boldly ventured on the liberties.\n\nWe followed up the river as we rode,\nAnd rode till midnight when the college lights\nBegan to glitter firefly-like in copse\nAnd linden alley: then we past an arch,\nWhereon a woman-statue rose with wings\nFrom four winged horses dark against the stars;\nAnd some inscription ran along the front,\nBut deep in shadow: further on we gained\nA little street half garden and half house;\nBut scarce could hear each other speak for noise\nOf clocks and chimes, like silver hammers falling\nOn silver anvils, and the splash and stir\nOf fountains spouted up and showering down\nIn meshes of the jasmine and the rose:\nAnd all about us pealed the nightingale,\nRapt in her song, and careless of the snare.\n\nThere stood a bust of Pallas for a sign,\nBy two sphere lamps blazoned like Heaven and Earth\nWith constellation and with continent,\nAbove an entry: riding in, we called;\nA plump-armed Ostleress and a stable wench\nCame running at the call, and helped us down.\nThen stept a buxom hostess forth, and sailed,\nFull-blown, before us into rooms which gave\nUpon a pillared porch, the bases lost\nIn laurel: her we asked of that and this,\nAnd who were tutors. 'Lady Blanche' she said,\n'And Lady Psyche.' 'Which was prettiest,\nBest-natured?' 'Lady Psyche.' 'Hers are we,'\nOne voice, we cried; and I sat down and wrote,\nIn such a hand as when a field of corn\nBows all its ears before the roaring East;\n\n'Three ladies of the Northern empire pray\nYour Highness would enroll them with your own,\nAs Lady Psyche's pupils.'\nThis I sealed:\nThe seal was Cupid bent above a scroll,\nAnd o'er his head Uranian Venus hung,\nAnd raised the blinding bandage from his eyes:\nI gave the letter to be sent with dawn;\nAnd then to bed, where half in doze I seemed\nTo float about a glimmering night, and watch\nA full sea glazed with muffled moonlight, swell\nOn some dark shore just seen that it was rich.\n\nAs through the land at eve we went,\nAnd plucked the ripened ears,\nWe fell out, my wife and I,\nO we fell out I know not why,\nAnd kissed again with tears.\nAnd blessings on the falling out\nThat all the more endears,\nWhen we fall out with those we love\nAnd kiss again with tears!\nFor when we came where lies the child\nWe lost in other years,\nThere above the little grave,\nO there above the little grave,\nWe kissed again with tears.\n\nII\n\nAt break of day the College Portress came:\nShe brought us Academic silks, in hue\nThe lilac, with a silken hood to each,\nAnd zoned with gold; and now when these were on,\nAnd we as rich as moths from dusk cocoons,\nShe, curtseying her obeisance, let us know\nThe Princess Ida waited: out we paced,\nI first, and following through the porch that sang\nAll round with laurel, issued in a court\nCompact of lucid marbles, bossed with lengths\nOf classic frieze, with ample awnings gay\nBetwixt the pillars, and with great urns of flowers.\nThe Muses and the Graces, grouped in threes,\nEnringed a billowing fountain in the midst;\nAnd here and there on lattice edges lay\nOr book or lute; but hastily we past,\nAnd up a flight of stairs into the hall.\n\nThere at a board by tome and paper sat,\nWith two tame leopards couched beside her throne,\nAll beauty compassed in a female form,\nThe Princess; liker to the inhabitant\nOf some clear planet close upon the Sun,\nThan our man's earth; such eyes were in her head,\nAnd so much grace and power, breathing down\nFrom over her arched brows, with every turn\nLived through her to the tips of her long hands,\nAnd to her feet. She rose her height, and said:\n\n'We give you welcome: not without redound\nOf use and glory to yourselves ye come,\nThe first-fruits of the stranger: aftertime,\nAnd that full voice which circles round the grave,\nWill rank you nobly, mingled up with me.\nWhat! are the ladies of your land so tall?'\n'We of the court' said Cyril. 'From the court'\nShe answered, 'then ye know the Prince?' and he:\n'The climax of his age! as though there were\nOne rose in all the world, your Highness that,\nHe worships your ideal:' she replied:\n'We scarcely thought in our own hall to hear\nThis barren verbiage, current among men,\nLight coin, the tinsel clink of compliment.\nYour flight from out your bookless wilds would seem\nAs arguing love of knowledge and of power;\nYour language proves you still the child. Indeed,\nWe dream not of him: when we set our hand\nTo this great work, we purposed with ourself\nNever to wed. You likewise will do well,\nLadies, in entering here, to cast and fling\nThe tricks, which make us toys of men, that so,\nSome future time, if so indeed you will,\nYou may with those self-styled our lords ally\nYour fortunes, justlier balanced, scale with scale.'\n\nAt those high words, we conscious of ourselves,\nPerused the matting: then an officer\nRose up, and read the statutes, such as these:\nNot for three years to correspond with home;\nNot for three years to cross the liberties;\nNot for three years to speak with any men;\nAnd many more, which hastily subscribed,\nWe entered on the boards: and 'Now,' she cried,\n'Ye are green wood, see ye warp not. Look, our hall!\nOur statues!--not of those that men desire,\nSleek Odalisques, or oracles of mode,\nNor stunted squaws of West or East; but she\nThat taught the Sabine how to rule, and she\nThe foundress of the Babylonian wall,\nThe Carian Artemisia strong in war,\nThe Rhodope, that built the pyramid,\nClelia, Cornelia, with the Palmyrene\nThat fought Aurelian, and the Roman brows\nOf Agrippina. Dwell with these, and lose\nConvention, since to look on noble forms\nMakes noble through the sensuous organism\nThat which is higher. O lift your natures up:\nEmbrace our aims: work out your freedom. Girls,\nKnowledge is now no more a fountain sealed:\nDrink deep, until the habits of the slave,\nThe sins of emptiness, gossip and spite\nAnd slander, die. Better not be at all\nThan not be noble. Leave us: you may go:\nToday the Lady Psyche will harangue\nThe fresh arrivals of the week before;\nFor they press in from all the provinces,\nAnd fill the hive.'\nShe spoke, and bowing waved\nDismissal: back again we crost the court\nTo Lady Psyche's: as we entered in,\nThere sat along the forms, like morning doves\nThat sun their milky bosoms on the thatch,\nA patient range of pupils; she herself\nErect behind a desk of satin-wood,\nA quick brunette, well-moulded, falcon-eyed,\nAnd on the hither side, or so she looked,\nOf twenty summers. At her left, a child,\nIn shining draperies, headed like a star,\nHer maiden babe, a double April old,\nAgla\u00efa slept. We sat: the Lady glanced:\nThen Florian, but not livelier than the dame\nThat whispered 'Asses' ears', among the sedge,\n'My sister.' 'Comely, too, by all that's fair,'\nSaid Cyril. 'Oh hush, hush!' and she began.\n\n'This world was once a fluid haze of light,\nTill toward the centre set the starry tides,\nAnd eddied into suns, that wheeling cast\nThe planets: then the monster, then the man;\nTattooed or woaded, winter-clad in skins,\nRaw from the prime, and crushing down his mate;\nAs yet we find in barbarous isles, and here\nAmong the lowest.'\nThereupon she took\nA bird's-eye-view of all the ungracious past;\nGlanced at the legendary Amazon\nAs emblematic of a nobler age;\nAppraised the Lycian custom, spoke of those\nThat lay at wine with Lar and Lucumo;\nRan down the Persian, Grecian, Roman lines\nOf empire, and the woman's state in each,\nHow far from just; till warming with her theme\nShe fulmined out her scorn of laws Salique\nAnd little-footed China, touched on Mahomet\nWith much contempt, and came to chivalry:\nWhen some respect, however slight, was paid\nTo woman, superstition all awry:\nHowever then commenced the dawn: a beam\nHad slanted forward, falling in a land\nOf promise; fruit would follow. Deep, indeed,\nTheir debt of thanks to her who first had dared\nTo leap the rotten pales of prejudice,\nDisyoke their necks from custom, and assert\nNone lordlier than themselves but that which made\nWoman and man. She had founded; they must build.\nHere might they learn whatever men were taught:\nLet them not fear: some said their heads were less:\nSome men's were small; not they the least of men;\nFor often fineness compensated size:\nBesides the brain was like the hand, and grew\nWith using; thence the man's, if more was more;\nHe took advantage of his strength to be\nFirst in the field: some ages had been lost;\nBut woman ripened earlier, and her life\nWas longer; and albeit their glorious names\nWere fewer, scattered stars, yet since in truth\nThe highest is the measure of the man,\nAnd not the Kaffir, Hottentot, Malay,\nNor those horn-handed breakers of the glebe,\nBut Homer, Plato, Verulam; even so\nWith woman: and in arts of government\nElizabeth and others; arts of war\nThe peasant Joan and others; arts of grace\nSappho and others vied with any man:\nAnd, last not least, she who had left her place,\nAnd bowed her state to them, that they might grow\nTo use and power on this Oasis, lapt\nIn the arms of leisure, sacred from the blight\nOf ancient influence and scorn.\nAt last\nShe rose upon a wind of prophecy\nDilating on the future; 'everywhere\nWho heads in council, two beside the hearth,\nTwo in the tangled business of the world,\nTwo in the liberal offices of life,\nTwo plummets dropt for one to sound the abyss\nOf science, and the secrets of the mind:\nMusician, painter, sculptor, critic, more:\nAnd everywhere the broad and bounteous Earth\nShould bear a double growth of those rare souls,\nPoets, whose thoughts enrich the blood of the world.'\n\nShe ended here, and beckoned us: the rest\nParted; and, glowing full-faced welcome, she\nBegan to address us, and was moving on\nIn gratulation, till as when a boat\nTacks, and the slackened sail flaps, all her voice\nFaltering and fluttering in her throat, she cried\n'My brother!' 'Well, my sister.' 'O,' she said,\n'What do you here? and in this dress? and these?\nWhy who are these? a wolf within the fold!\nA pack of wolves! the Lord be gracious to me!\nA plot, a plot, a plot to ruin all!'\n'No plot, no plot,' he answered. 'Wretched boy,\nHow saw you not the inscription on the gate,\nLET NO MAN ENTER IN ON PAIN OF DEATH?'\n'And if I had,' he answered, 'who could think\nThe softer Adams of your Academe,\nO sister, Sirens though they be, were such\nAs chanted on the blanching bones of men?'\n'But you will find it otherwise' she said.\n'You jest: ill jesting with edge-tools! my vow\nBinds me to speak, and O that iron will,\nThat axelike edge unturnable, our Head,\nThe Princess.' 'Well then, Psyche, take my life,\nAnd nail me like a weasel on a grange\nFor warning: bury me beside the gate,\nAnd cut this epitaph above my bones;\n~Here lies a brother by a sister slain,\nAll for the common good of womankind.~'\n'Let me die too,' said Cyril, 'having seen\nAnd heard the Lady Psyche.'\nI struck in:\n'Albeit so masked, Madam, I love the truth;\nReceive it; and in me behold the Prince\nYour countryman, affianced years ago\nTo the Lady Ida: here, for here she was,\nAnd thus (what other way was left) I came.'\n'O Sir, O Prince, I have no country; none;\nIf any, this; but none. Whate'er I was\nDisrooted, what I am is grafted here.\nAffianced, Sir? love-whispers may not breathe\nWithin this vestal limit, and how should I,\nWho am not mine, say, live: the thunderbolt\nHangs silent; but prepare: I speak; it falls.'\n'Yet pause,' I said: 'for that inscription there,\nI think no more of deadly lurks therein,\nThan in a clapper clapping in a garth,\nTo scare the fowl from fruit: if more there be,\nIf more and acted on, what follows? war;\nYour own work marred: for this your Academe,\nWhichever side be Victor, in the halloo\nWill topple to the trumpet down, and pass\nWith all fair theories only made to gild\nA stormless summer.' 'Let the Princess judge\nOf that' she said: 'farewell, Sir--and to you.\nI shudder at the sequel, but I go.'\n\n'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I rejoined,\n'The fifth in line from that old Florian,\nYet hangs his portrait in my father's hall\n(The gaunt old Baron with his beetle brow\nSun-shaded in the heat of dusty fights)\nAs he bestrode my Grandsire, when he fell,\nAnd all else fled? we point to it, and we say,\nThe loyal warmth of Florian is not cold,\nBut branches current yet in kindred veins.'\n'Are you that Psyche,' Florian added; 'she\nWith whom I sang about the morning hills,\nFlung ball, flew kite, and raced the purple fly,\nAnd snared the squirrel of the glen? are you\nThat Psyche, won't to bind my throbbing brow,\nTo smoothe my pillow, mix the foaming draught\nOf fever, tell me pleasant tales, and read\nMy sickness down to happy dreams? are you\nThat brother-sister Psyche, both in one?\nYou were that Psyche, but what are you now?'\n'You are that Psyche,' said Cyril, 'for whom\nI would be that for ever which I seem,\nWoman, if I might sit beside your feet,\nAnd glean your scattered sapience.'\nThen once more,\n'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I began,\n'That on her bridal morn before she past\nFrom all her old companions, when the kind\nKissed her pale cheek, declared that ancient ties\nWould still be dear beyond the southern hills;\nThat were there any of our people there\nIn want or peril, there was one to hear\nAnd help them? look! for such are these and I.'\n'Are you that Psyche,' Florian asked, 'to whom,\nIn gentler days, your arrow-wounded fawn\nCame flying while you sat beside the well?\nThe creature laid his muzzle on your lap,\nAnd sobbed, and you sobbed with it, and the blood\nWas sprinkled on your kirtle, and you wept.\nThat was fawn's blood, not brother's, yet you wept.\nO by the bright head of my little niece,\nYou were that Psyche, and what are you now?'\n'You are that Psyche,' Cyril said again,\n'The mother of the sweetest little maid,\nThat ever crowed for kisses.'\n'Out upon it!'\nShe answered, 'peace! and why should I not play\nThe Spartan Mother with emotion, be\nThe Lucius Junius Brutus of my kind?\nHim you call great: he for the common weal,\nThe fading politics of mortal Rome,\nAs I might slay this child, if good need were,\nSlew both his sons: and I, shall I, on whom\nThe secular emancipation turns\nOf half this world, be swerved from right to save\nA prince, a brother? a little will I yield.\nBest so, perchance, for us, and well for you.\nO hard, when love and duty clash! I fear\nMy conscience will not count me fleckless; yet--\nHear my conditions: promise (otherwise\nYou perish) as you came, to slip away\nToday, tomorrow, soon: it shall be said,\nThese women were too barbarous, would not learn;\nThey fled, who might have shamed us: promise, all.'\n\nWhat could we else, we promised each; and she,\nLike some wild creature newly-caged, commenced\nA to-and-fro, so pacing till she paused\nBy Florian; holding out her lily arms\nTook both his hands, and smiling faintly said:\n'I knew you at the first: though you have grown\nYou scarce have altered: I am sad and glad\nTo see you, Florian. ~I~ give thee to death\nMy brother! it was duty spoke, not I.\nMy needful seeming harshness, pardon it.\nOur mother, is she well?'\nWith that she kissed\nHis forehead, then, a moment after, clung\nAbout him, and betwixt them blossomed up\nFrom out a common vein of memory\nSweet household talk, and phrases of the hearth,\nAnd far allusion, till the gracious dews\nBegan to glisten and to fall: and while\nThey stood, so rapt, we gazing, came a voice,\n'I brought a message here from Lady Blanche.'\nBack started she, and turning round we saw\nThe Lady Blanche's daughter where she stood,\nMelissa, with her hand upon the lock,\nA rosy blonde, and in a college gown,\nThat clad her like an April daffodilly\n(Her mother's colour) with her lips apart,\nAnd all her thoughts as fair within her eyes,\nAs bottom agates seen to wave and float\nIn crystal currents of clear morning seas.\n\nSo stood that same fair creature at the door.\nThen Lady Psyche, 'Ah--Melissa--you!\nYou heard us?' and Melissa, 'O pardon me\nI heard, I could not help it, did not wish:\nBut, dearest Lady, pray you fear me not,\nNor think I bear that heart within my breast,\nTo give three gallant gentlemen to death.'\n'I trust you,' said the other, 'for we two\nWere always friends, none closer, elm and vine:\nBut yet your mother's jealous temperament--\nLet not your prudence, dearest, drowse, or prove\nThe Dana\u00efd of a leaky vase, for fear\nThis whole foundation ruin, and I lose\nMy honour, these their lives.' 'Ah, fear me not'\nReplied Melissa; 'no--I would not tell,\nNo, not for all Aspasia's cleverness,\nNo, not to answer, Madam, all those hard things\nThat Sheba came to ask of Solomon.'\n'Be it so' the other, 'that we still may lead\nThe new light up, and culminate in peace,\nFor Solomon may come to Sheba yet.'\nSaid Cyril, 'Madam, he the wisest man\nFeasted the woman wisest then, in halls\nOf Lebanonian cedar: nor should you\n(Though, Madam, ~you~ should answer, ~we~ would ask)\nLess welcome find among us, if you came\nAmong us, debtors for our lives to you,\nMyself for something more.' He said not what,\nBut 'Thanks,' she answered 'Go: we have been too long\nTogether: keep your hoods about the face;\nThey do so that affect abstraction here.\nSpeak little; mix not with the rest; and hold\nYour promise: all, I trust, may yet be well.'\n\nWe turned to go, but Cyril took the child,\nAnd held her round the knees against his waist,\nAnd blew the swollen cheek of a trumpeter,\nWhile Psyche watched them, smiling, and the child\nPushed her flat hand against his face and laughed;\nAnd thus our conference closed.\nAnd then we strolled\nFor half the day through stately theatres\nBenched crescent-wise. In each we sat, we heard\nThe grave Professor. On the lecture slate\nThe circle rounded under female hands\nWith flawless demonstration: followed then\nA classic lecture, rich in sentiment,\nWith scraps of thunderous Epic lilted out\nBy violet-hooded Doctors, elegies\nAnd quoted odes, and jewels five-words-long\nThat on the stretched forefinger of all Time\nSparkle for ever: then we dipt in all\nThat treats of whatsoever is, the state,\nThe total chronicles of man, the mind,\nThe morals, something of the frame, the rock,\nThe star, the bird, the fish, the shell, the flower,\nElectric, chemic laws, and all the rest,\nAnd whatsoever can be taught and known;\nTill like three horses that have broken fence,\nAnd glutted all night long breast-deep in corn,\nWe issued gorged with knowledge, and I spoke:\n'Why, Sirs, they do all this as well as we.'\n'They hunt old trails' said Cyril 'very well;\nBut when did woman ever yet invent?'\n'Ungracious!' answered Florian; 'have you learnt\nNo more from Psyche's lecture, you that talked\nThe trash that made me sick, and almost sad?'\n'O trash' he said, 'but with a kernel in it.\nShould I not call her wise, who made me wise?\nAnd learnt? I learnt more from her in a flash,\nThan in my brainpan were an empty hull,\nAnd every Muse tumbled a science in.\nA thousand hearts lie fallow in these halls,\nAnd round these halls a thousand baby loves\nFly twanging headless arrows at the hearts,\nWhence follows many a vacant pang; but O\nWith me, Sir, entered in the bigger boy,\nThe Head of all the golden-shafted firm,\nThe long-limbed lad that had a Psyche too;\nHe cleft me through the stomacher; and now\nWhat think you of it, Florian? do I chase\nThe substance or the shadow? will it hold?\nI have no sorcerer's malison on me,\nNo ghostly hauntings like his Highness. I\nFlatter myself that always everywhere\nI know the substance when I see it. Well,\nAre castles shadows? Three of them? Is she\nThe sweet proprietress a shadow? If not,\nShall those three castles patch my tattered coat?\nFor dear are those three castles to my wants,\nAnd dear is sister Psyche to my heart,\nAnd two dear things are one of double worth,\nAnd much I might have said, but that my zone\nUnmanned me: then the Doctors! O to hear\nThe Doctors! O to watch the thirsty plants\nImbibing! once or twice I thought to roar,\nTo break my chain, to shake my mane: but thou,\nModulate me, Soul of mincing mimicry!\nMake liquid treble of that bassoon, my throat;\nAbase those eyes that ever loved to meet\nStar-sisters answering under crescent brows;\nAbate the stride, which speaks of man, and loose\nA flying charm of blushes o'er this cheek,\nWhere they like swallows coming out of time\nWill wonder why they came: but hark the bell\nFor dinner, let us go!'\nAnd in we streamed\nAmong the columns, pacing staid and still\nBy twos and threes, till all from end to end\nWith beauties every shade of brown and fair\nIn colours gayer than the morning mist,\nThe long hall glittered like a bed of flowers.\nHow might a man not wander from his wits\nPierced through with eyes, but that I kept mine own\nIntent on her, who rapt in glorious dreams,\nThe second-sight of some Astr\u00e6an age,\nSat compassed with professors: they, the while,\nDiscussed a doubt and tost it to and fro:\nA clamour thickened, mixt with inmost terms\nOf art and science: Lady Blanche alone\nOf faded form and haughtiest lineaments,\nWith all her autumn tresses falsely brown,\nShot sidelong daggers at us, a tiger-cat\nIn act to spring.\nAt last a solemn grace\nConcluded, and we sought the gardens: there\nOne walked reciting by herself, and one\nIn this hand held a volume as to read,\nAnd smoothed a petted peacock down with that:\nSome to a low song oared a shallop by,\nOr under arches of the marble bridge\nHung, shadowed from the heat: some hid and sought\nIn the orange thickets: others tost a ball\nAbove the fountain-jets, and back again\nWith laughter: others lay about the lawns,\nOf the older sort, and murmured that their May\nWas passing: what was learning unto them?\nThey wished to marry; they could rule a house;\nMen hated learned women: but we three\nSat muffled like the Fates; and often came\nMelissa hitting all we saw with shafts\nOf gentle satire, kin to charity,\nThat harmed not: then day droopt; the chapel bells\nCalled us: we left the walks; we mixt with those\nSix hundred maidens clad in purest white,\nBefore two streams of light from wall to wall,\nWhile the great organ almost burst his pipes,\nGroaning for power, and rolling through the court\nA long melodious thunder to the sound\nOf solemn psalms, and silver litanies,\nThe work of Ida, to call down from Heaven\nA blessing on her labours for the world.\n\nSweet and low, sweet and low,\nWind of the western sea,\nLow, low, breathe and blow,\nWind of the western sea!\nOver the rolling waters go,\nCome from the dying moon, and blow,\nBlow him again to me;\nWhile my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.\n\nSleep and rest, sleep and rest,\nFather will come to thee soon;\nRest, rest, on mother's breast,\nFather will come to thee soon;\nFather will come to his babe in the nest,\nSilver sails all out of the west\nUnder the silver moon:\nSleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.\n\nIII\n\nMorn in the wake of the morning star\nCame furrowing all the orient into gold.\nWe rose, and each by other drest with care\nDescended to the court that lay three parts\nIn shadow, but the Muses' heads were touched\nAbove the darkness from their native East.\n\nThere while we stood beside the fount, and watched\nOr seemed to watch the dancing bubble, approached\nMelissa, tinged with wan from lack of sleep,\nOr grief, and glowing round her dewy eyes\nThe circled Iris of a night of tears;\n'And fly,' she cried, 'O fly, while yet you may!\nMy mother knows:' and when I asked her 'how,'\n'My fault' she wept 'my fault! and yet not mine;\nYet mine in part. O hear me, pardon me.\nMy mother, 'tis her won't from night to night\nTo rail at Lady Psyche and her side.\nShe says the Princess should have been the Head,\nHerself and Lady Psyche the two arms;\nAnd so it was agreed when first they came;\nBut Lady Psyche was the right hand now,\nAnd the left, or not, or seldom used;\nHers more than half the students, all the love.\nAnd so last night she fell to canvass you:\n~Her~ countrywomen! she did not envy her.\n\"Who ever saw such wild barbarians?\nGirls?--more like men!\" and at these words the snake,\nMy secret, seemed to stir within my breast;\nAnd oh, Sirs, could I help it, but my cheek\nBegan to burn and burn, and her lynx eye\nTo fix and make me hotter, till she laughed:\n\"O marvellously modest maiden, you!\nMen! girls, like men! why, if they had been men\nYou need not set your thoughts in rubric thus\nFor wholesale comment.\" Pardon, I am shamed\nThat I must needs repeat for my excuse\nWhat looks so little graceful: \"men\" (for still\nMy mother went revolving on the word)\n\"And so they are,--very like men indeed--\nAnd with that woman closeted for hours!\"\nThen came these dreadful words out one by one,\n\"Why--these--~are~--men:\" I shuddered: \"and you know it.\"\n\"O ask me nothing,\" I said: \"And she knows too,\nAnd she conceals it.\" So my mother clutched\nThe truth at once, but with no word from me;\nAnd now thus early risen she goes to inform\nThe Princess: Lady Psyche will be crushed;\nBut you may yet be saved, and therefore fly;\nBut heal me with your pardon ere you go.'\n\n'What pardon, sweet Melissa, for a blush?'\nSaid Cyril: 'Pale one, blush again: than wear\nThose lilies, better blush our lives away.\nYet let us breathe for one hour more in Heaven'\nHe added, 'lest some classic Angel speak\nIn scorn of us, \"They mounted, Ganymedes,\nTo tumble, Vulcans, on the second morn.\"\nBut I will melt this marble into wax\nTo yield us farther furlough:' and he went.\n\nMelissa shook her doubtful curls, and thought\nHe scarce would prosper. 'Tell us,' Florian asked,\n'How grew this feud betwixt the right and left.'\n'O long ago,' she said, 'betwixt these two\nDivision smoulders hidden; 'tis my mother,\nToo jealous, often fretful as the wind\nPent in a crevice: much I bear with her:\nI never knew my father, but she says\n(God help her) she was wedded to a fool;\nAnd still she railed against the state of things.\nShe had the care of Lady Ida's youth,\nAnd from the Queen's decease she brought her up.\nBut when your sister came she won the heart\nOf Ida: they were still together, grew\n(For so they said themselves) inosculated;\nConsonant chords that shiver to one note;\nOne mind in all things: yet my mother still\nAffirms your Psyche thieved her theories,\nAnd angled with them for her pupil's love:\nShe calls her plagiarist; I know not what:\nBut I must go: I dare not tarry,' and light,\nAs flies the shadow of a bird, she fled.\n\nThen murmured Florian gazing after her,\n'An open-hearted maiden, true and pure.\nIf I could love, why this were she: how pretty\nHer blushing was, and how she blushed again,\nAs if to close with Cyril's random wish:\nNot like your Princess crammed with erring pride,\nNor like poor Psyche whom she drags in tow.'\n\n'The crane,' I said, 'may chatter of the crane,\nThe dove may murmur of the dove, but I\nAn eagle clang an eagle to the sphere.\nMy princess, O my princess! true she errs,\nBut in her own grand way: being herself\nThree times more noble than three score of men,\nShe sees herself in every woman else,\nAnd so she wears her error like a crown\nTo blind the truth and me: for her, and her,\nHebes are they to hand ambrosia, mix\nThe nectar; but--ah she--whene'er she moves\nThe Samian Her\u00e8 rises and she speaks\nA Memnon smitten with the morning Sun.'\n\nSo saying from the court we paced, and gained\nThe terrace ranged along the Northern front,\nAnd leaning there on those balusters, high\nAbove the empurpled champaign, drank the gale\nThat blown about the foliage underneath,\nAnd sated with the innumerable rose,\nBeat balm upon our eyelids. Hither came\nCyril, and yawning 'O hard task,' he cried;\n'No fighting shadows here! I forced a way\nThrough opposition crabbed and gnarled.\nBetter to clear prime forests, heave and thump\nA league of street in summer solstice down,\nThan hammer at this reverend gentlewoman.\nI knocked and, bidden, entered; found her there\nAt point to move, and settled in her eyes\nThe green malignant light of coming storm.\nSir, I was courteous, every phrase well-oiled,\nAs man's could be; yet maiden-meek I prayed\nConcealment: she demanded who we were,\nAnd why we came? I fabled nothing fair,\nBut, your example pilot, told her all.\nUp went the hushed amaze of hand and eye.\nBut when I dwelt upon your old affiance,\nShe answered sharply that I talked astray.\nI urged the fierce inscription on the gate,\nAnd our three lives. True--we had limed ourselves\nWith open eyes, and we must take the chance.\nBut such extremes, I told her, well might harm\nThe woman's cause. \"Not more than now,\" she said,\n\"So puddled as it is with favouritism.\"\nI tried the mother's heart. Shame might befall\nMelissa, knowing, saying not she knew:\nHer answer was \"Leave me to deal with that.\"\nI spoke of war to come and many deaths,\nAnd she replied, her duty was to speak,\nAnd duty duty, clear of consequences.\nI grew discouraged, Sir; but since I knew\nNo rock so hard but that a little wave\nMay beat admission in a thousand years,\nI recommenced; \"Decide not ere you pause.\nI find you here but in the second place,\nSome say the third--the authentic foundress you.\nI offer boldly: we will seat you highest:\nWink at our advent: help my prince to gain\nHis rightful bride, and here I promise you\nSome palace in our land, where you shall reign\nThe head and heart of all our fair she-world,\nAnd your great name flow on with broadening time\nFor ever.\" Well, she balanced this a little,\nAnd told me she would answer us today,\nmeantime be mute: thus much, nor more I gained.'\n\nHe ceasing, came a message from the Head.\n'That afternoon the Princess rode to take\nThe dip of certain strata to the North.\nWould we go with her? we should find the land\nWorth seeing; and the river made a fall\nOut yonder:' then she pointed on to where\nA double hill ran up his furrowy forks\nBeyond the thick-leaved platans of the vale.\n\nAgreed to, this, the day fled on through all\nIts range of duties to the appointed hour.\nThen summoned to the porch we went. She stood\nAmong her maidens, higher by the head,\nHer back against a pillar, her foot on one\nOf those tame leopards. Kittenlike he rolled\nAnd pawed about her sandal. I drew near;\nI gazed. On a sudden my strange seizure came\nUpon me, the weird vision of our house:\nThe Princess Ida seemed a hollow show,\nHer gay-furred cats a painted fantasy,\nHer college and her maidens, empty masks,\nAnd I myself the shadow of a dream,\nFor all things were and were not. Yet I felt\nMy heart beat thick with passion and with awe;\nThen from my breast the involuntary sigh\nBrake, as she smote me with the light of eyes\nThat lent my knee desire to kneel, and shook\nMy pulses, till to horse we got, and so\nWent forth in long retinue following up\nThe river as it narrowed to the hills.\n\nI rode beside her and to me she said:\n'O friend, we trust that you esteemed us not\nToo harsh to your companion yestermorn;\nUnwillingly we spake.' 'No--not to her,'\nI answered, 'but to one of whom we spake\nYour Highness might have seemed the thing you say.'\n'Again?' she cried, 'are you ambassadresses\nFrom him to me? we give you, being strange,\nA license: speak, and let the topic die.'\n\nI stammered that I knew him--could have wished--\n'Our king expects--was there no precontract?\nThere is no truer-hearted--ah, you seem\nAll he prefigured, and he could not see\nThe bird of passage flying south but longed\nTo follow: surely, if your Highness keep\nYour purport, you will shock him even to death,\nOr baser courses, children of despair.'\n\n'Poor boy,' she said, 'can he not read--no books?\nQuoit, tennis, ball--no games? nor deals in that\nWhich men delight in, martial exercise?\nTo nurse a blind ideal like a girl,\nMethinks he seems no better than a girl;\nAs girls were once, as we ourself have been:\nWe had our dreams; perhaps he mixt with them:\nWe touch on our dead self, nor shun to do it,\nBeing other--since we learnt our meaning here,\nTo lift the woman's fallen divinity\nUpon an even pedestal with man.'\n\nShe paused, and added with a haughtier smile\n'And as to precontracts, we move, my friend,\nAt no man's beck, but know ourself and thee,\nO Vashti, noble Vashti! Summoned out\nShe kept her state, and left the drunken king\nTo brawl at Shushan underneath the palms.'\n\n'Alas your Highness breathes full East,' I said,\n'On that which leans to you. I know the Prince,\nI prize his truth: and then how vast a work\nTo assail this gray pre\u00ebminence of man!\nYou grant me license; might I use it? think;\nEre half be done perchance your life may fail;\nThen comes the feebler heiress of your plan,\nAnd takes and ruins all; and thus your pains\nMay only make that footprint upon sand\nWhich old-recurring waves of prejudice\nResmooth to nothing: might I dread that you,\nWith only Fame for spouse and your great deeds\nFor issue, yet may live in vain, and miss,\nMeanwhile, what every woman counts her due,\nLove, children, happiness?'\nAnd she exclaimed,\n'Peace, you young savage of the Northern wild!\nWhat! though your Prince's love were like a God's,\nHave we not made ourself the sacrifice?\nYou are bold indeed: we are not talked to thus:\nYet will we say for children, would they grew\nLike field-flowers everywhere! we like them well:\nBut children die; and let me tell you, girl,\nHowe'er you babble, great deeds cannot die;\nThey with the sun and moon renew their light\nFor ever, blessing those that look on them.\nChildren--that men may pluck them from our hearts,\nKill us with pity, break us with ourselves--\nO--children--there is nothing upon earth\nMore miserable than she that has a son\nAnd sees him err: nor would we work for fame;\nThough she perhaps might reap the applause of Great,\nWho earns the one POU STO whence after-hands\nMay move the world, though she herself effect\nBut little: wherefore up and act, nor shrink\nFor fear our solid aim be dissipated\nBy frail successors. Would, indeed, we had been,\nIn lieu of many mortal flies, a race\nOf giants living, each, a thousand years,\nThat we might see our own work out, and watch\nThe sandy footprint harden into stone.'\n\nI answered nothing, doubtful in myself\nIf that strange Poet-princess with her grand\nImaginations might at all be won.\nAnd she broke out interpreting my thoughts:\n\n'No doubt we seem a kind of monster to you;\nWe are used to that: for women, up till this\nCramped under worse than South-sea-isle taboo,\nDwarfs of the gyn\u00e6ceum, fail so far\nIn high desire, they know not, cannot guess\nHow much their welfare is a passion to us.\nIf we could give them surer, quicker proof--\nOh if our end were less achievable\nBy slow approaches, than by single act\nOf immolation, any phase of death,\nWe were as prompt to spring against the pikes,\nOr down the fiery gulf as talk of it,\nTo compass our dear sisters' liberties.'\n\nShe bowed as if to veil a noble tear;\nAnd up we came to where the river sloped\nTo plunge in cataract, shattering on black blocks\nA breadth of thunder. O'er it shook the woods,\nAnd danced the colour, and, below, stuck out\nThe bones of some vast bulk that lived and roared\nBefore man was. She gazed awhile and said,\n'As these rude bones to us, are we to her\nThat will be.' 'Dare we dream of that,' I asked,\n'Which wrought us, as the workman and his work,\nThat practice betters?' 'How,' she cried, 'you love\nThe metaphysics! read and earn our prize,\nA golden brooch: beneath an emerald plane\nSits Diotima, teaching him that died\nOf hemlock; our device; wrought to the life;\nShe rapt upon her subject, he on her:\nFor there are schools for all.' 'And yet' I said\n'Methinks I have not found among them all\nOne anatomic.' 'Nay, we thought of that,'\nShe answered, 'but it pleased us not: in truth\nWe shudder but to dream our maids should ape\nThose monstrous males that carve the living hound,\nAnd cram him with the fragments of the grave,\nOr in the dark dissolving human heart,\nAnd holy secrets of this microcosm,\nDabbling a shameless hand with shameful jest,\nEncarnalize their spirits: yet we know\nKnowledge is knowledge, and this matter hangs:\nHowbeit ourself, foreseeing casualty,\nNor willing men should come among us, learnt,\nFor many weary moons before we came,\nThis craft of healing. Were you sick, ourself\nWould tend upon you. To your question now,\nWhich touches on the workman and his work.\nLet there be light and there was light: 'tis so:\nFor was, and is, and will be, are but is;\nAnd all creation is one act at once,\nThe birth of light: but we that are not all,\nAs parts, can see but parts, now this, now that,\nAnd live, perforce, from thought to thought, and make\nOne act a phantom of succession: thus\nOur weakness somehow shapes the shadow, Time;\nBut in the shadow will we work, and mould\nThe woman to the fuller day.'\nShe spake\nWith kindled eyes; we rode a league beyond,\nAnd, o'er a bridge of pinewood crossing, came\nOn flowery levels underneath the crag,\nFull of all beauty. 'O how sweet' I said\n(For I was half-oblivious of my mask)\n'To linger here with one that loved us.' 'Yea,'\nShe answered, 'or with fair philosophies\nThat lift the fancy; for indeed these fields\nAre lovely, lovelier not the Elysian lawns,\nWhere paced the Demigods of old, and saw\nThe soft white vapour streak the crown\u00e8d towers\nBuilt to the Sun:' then, turning to her maids,\n'Pitch our pavilion here upon the sward;\nLay out the viands.' At the word, they raised\nA tent of satin, elaborately wrought\nWith fair Corinna's triumph; here she stood,\nEngirt with many a florid maiden-cheek,\nThe woman-conqueror; woman-conquered there\nThe bearded Victor of ten-thousand hymns,\nAnd all the men mourned at his side: but we\nSet forth to climb; then, climbing, Cyril kept\nWith Psyche, with Melissa Florian, I\nWith mine affianced. Many a little hand\nGlanced like a touch of sunshine on the rocks,\nMany a light foot shone like a jewel set\nIn the dark crag: and then we turned, we wound\nAbout the cliffs, the copses, out and in,\nHammering and clinking, chattering stony names\nOf shales and hornblende, rag and trap and tuff,\nAmygdaloid and trachyte, till the Sun\nGrew broader toward his death and fell, and all\nThe rosy heights came out above the lawns.\n\nThe splendour falls on castle walls\nAnd snowy summits old in story:\nThe long light shakes across the lakes,\nAnd the wild cataract leaps in glory.\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\n\nO hark, O hear! how thin and clear,\nAnd thinner, clearer, farther going!\nO sweet and far from cliff and scar\nThe horns of Elfland faintly blowing!\nBlow, let us hear the purple glens replying:\nBlow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.\n\nO love, they die in yon rich sky,\nThey faint on hill or field or river:\nOur echoes roll from soul to soul,\nAnd grow for ever and for ever.\nBlow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,\nAnd answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.\n\nIV\n\n'There sinks the nebulous star we call the Sun,\nIf that hypothesis of theirs be sound'\nSaid Ida; 'let us down and rest;' and we\nDown from the lean and wrinkled precipices,\nBy every coppice-feathered chasm and cleft,\nDropt through the ambrosial gloom to where below\nNo bigger than a glow-worm shone the tent\nLamp-lit from the inner. Once she leaned on me,\nDescending; once or twice she lent her hand,\nAnd blissful palpitations in the blood,\nStirring a sudden transport rose and fell.\n\nBut when we planted level feet, and dipt\nBeneath the satin dome and entered in,\nThere leaning deep in broidered down we sank\nOur elbows: on a tripod in the midst\nA fragrant flame rose, and before us glowed\nFruit, blossom, viand, amber wine, and gold.\n\nThen she, 'Let some one sing to us: lightlier move\nThe minutes fledged with music:' and a maid,\nOf those beside her, smote her harp, and sang.\n\n'Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,\nTears from the depth of some divine despair\nRise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,\nIn looking on the happy Autumn-fields,\nAnd thinking of the days that are no more.\n\n'Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,\nThat brings our friends up from the underworld,\nSad as the last which reddens over one\nThat sinks with all we love below the verge;\nSo sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.\n\n'Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns\nThe earliest pipe of half-awakened birds\nTo dying ears, when unto dying eyes\nThe casement slowly grows a glimmering square;\nSo sad, so strange, the days that are no more.\n\n'Dear as remembered kisses after death,\nAnd sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned\nOn lips that are for others; deep as love,\nDeep as first love, and wild with all regret;\nO Death in Life, the days that are no more.'\n\nShe ended with such passion that the tear,\nShe sang of, shook and fell, an erring pearl\nLost in her bosom: but with some disdain\nAnswered the Princess, 'If indeed there haunt\nAbout the mouldered lodges of the Past\nSo sweet a voice and vague, fatal to men,\nWell needs it we should cram our ears with wool\nAnd so pace by: but thine are fancies hatched\nIn silken-folded idleness; nor is it\nWiser to weep a true occasion lost,\nBut trim our sails, and let old bygones be,\nWhile down the streams that float us each and all\nTo the issue, goes, like glittering bergs of ice,\nThrone after throne, and molten on the waste\nBecomes a cloud: for all things serve their time\nToward that great year of equal mights and rights,\nNor would I fight with iron laws, in the end\nFound golden: let the past be past; let be\nTheir cancelled Babels: though the rough kex break\nThe starred mosaic, and the beard-blown goat\nHang on the shaft, and the wild figtree split\nTheir monstrous idols, care not while we hear\nA trumpet in the distance pealing news\nOf better, and Hope, a poising eagle, burns\nAbove the unrisen morrow:' then to me;\n'Know you no song of your own land,' she said,\n'Not such as moans about the retrospect,\nBut deals with the other distance and the hues\nOf promise; not a death's-head at the wine.'\n\nThen I remembered one myself had made,\nWhat time I watched the swallow winging south\nFrom mine own land, part made long since, and part\nNow while I sang, and maidenlike as far\nAs I could ape their treble, did I sing.\n\n'O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South,\nFly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves,\nAnd tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.\n\n'O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,\nThat bright and fierce and fickle is the South,\nAnd dark and true and tender is the North.\n\n'O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light\nUpon her lattice, I would pipe and trill,\nAnd cheep and twitter twenty million loves.\n\n'O were I thou that she might take me in,\nAnd lay me on her bosom, and her heart\nWould rock the snowy cradle till I died.\n\n'Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,\nDelaying as the tender ash delays\nTo clothe herself, when all the woods are green?\n\n'O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown:\nSay to her, I do but wanton in the South,\nBut in the North long since my nest is made.\n\n'O tell her, brief is life but love is long,\nAnd brief the sun of summer in the North,\nAnd brief the moon of beauty in the South.\n\n'O Swallow, flying from the golden woods,\nFly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her mine,\nAnd tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.'\n\nI ceased, and all the ladies, each at each,\nLike the Ithacensian suitors in old time,\nStared with great eyes, and laughed with alien lips,\nAnd knew not what they meant; for still my voice\nRang false: but smiling 'Not for thee,' she said,\nO Bulbul, any rose of Gulistan\nShall burst her veil: marsh-divers, rather, maid,\nShall croak thee sister, or the meadow-crake\nGrate her harsh kindred in the grass: and this\nA mere love-poem! O for such, my friend,\nWe hold them slight: they mind us of the time\nWhen we made bricks in Egypt. Knaves are men,\nThat lute and flute fantastic tenderness,\nAnd dress the victim to the offering up,\nAnd paint the gates of Hell with Paradise,\nAnd play the slave to gain the tyranny.\nPoor soul! I had a maid of honour once;\nShe wept her true eyes blind for such a one,\nA rogue of canzonets and serenades.\nI loved her. Peace be with her. She is dead.\nSo they blaspheme the muse! But great is song\nUsed to great ends: ourself have often tried\nValkyrian hymns, or into rhythm have dashed\nThe passion of the prophetess; for song\nIs duer unto freedom, force and growth\nOf spirit than to junketing and love.\nLove is it? Would this same mock-love, and this\nMock-Hymen were laid up like winter bats,\nTill all men grew to rate us at our worth,\nNot vassals to be beat, nor pretty babes\nTo be dandled, no, but living wills, and sphered\nWhole in ourselves and owed to none. Enough!\nBut now to leaven play with profit, you,\nKnow you no song, the true growth of your soil,\nThat gives the manners of your country-women?'\n\nShe spoke and turned her sumptuous head with eyes\nOf shining expectation fixt on mine.\nThen while I dragged my brains for such a song,\nCyril, with whom the bell-mouthed glass had wrought,\nOr mastered by the sense of sport, began\nTo troll a careless, careless tavern-catch\nOf Moll and Meg, and strange experiences\nUnmeet for ladies. Florian nodded at him,\nI frowning; Psyche flushed and wanned and shook;\nThe lilylike Melissa drooped her brows;\n'Forbear,' the Princess cried; 'Forbear, Sir' I;\nAnd heated through and through with wrath and love,\nI smote him on the breast; he started up;\nThere rose a shriek as of a city sacked;\nMelissa clamoured 'Flee the death;' 'To horse'\nSaid Ida; 'home! to horse!' and fled, as flies\nA troop of snowy doves athwart the dusk,\nWhen some one batters at the dovecote-doors,\nDisorderly the women. Alone I stood\nWith Florian, cursing Cyril, vext at heart,\nIn the pavilion: there like parting hopes\nI heard them passing from me: hoof by hoof,\nAnd every hoof a knell to my desires,\nClanged on the bridge; and then another shriek,\n'The Head, the Head, the Princess, O the Head!'\nFor blind with rage she missed the plank, and rolled\nIn the river. Out I sprang from glow to gloom:\nThere whirled her white robe like a blossomed branch\nRapt to the horrible fall: a glance I gave,\nNo more; but woman-vested as I was\nPlunged; and the flood drew; yet I caught her; then\nOaring one arm, and bearing in my left\nThe weight of all the hopes of half the world,\nStrove to buffet to land in vain. A tree\nWas half-disrooted from his place and stooped\nTo wrench his dark locks in the gurgling wave\nMid-channel. Right on this we drove and caught,\nAnd grasping down the boughs I gained the shore.\n\nThere stood her maidens glimmeringly grouped\nIn the hollow bank. One reaching forward drew\nMy burthen from mine arms; they cried 'she lives:'\nThey bore her back into the tent: but I,\nSo much a kind of shame within me wrought,\nNot yet endured to meet her opening eyes,\nNor found my friends; but pushed alone on foot\n(For since her horse was lost I left her mine)\nAcross the woods, and less from Indian craft\nThan beelike instinct hiveward, found at length\nThe garden portals. Two great statues, Art\nAnd Science, Caryatids, lifted up\nA weight of emblem, and betwixt were valves\nOf open-work in which the hunter rued\nHis rash intrusion, manlike, but his brows\nHad sprouted, and the branches thereupon\nSpread out at top, and grimly spiked the gates.\n\nA little space was left between the horns,\nThrough which I clambered o'er at top with pain,\nDropt on the sward, and up the linden walks,\nAnd, tost on thoughts that changed from hue to hue,\nNow poring on the glowworm, now the star,\nI paced the terrace, till the Bear had wheeled\nThrough a great arc his seven slow suns.\nA step\nOf lightest echo, then a loftier form\nThan female, moving through the uncertain gloom,\nDisturbed me with the doubt 'if this were she,'\nBut it was Florian. 'Hist O Hist,' he said,\n'They seek us: out so late is out of rules.\nMoreover \"seize the strangers\" is the cry.\nHow came you here?' I told him: 'I' said he,\n'Last of the train, a moral leper, I,\nTo whom none spake, half-sick at heart, returned.\nArriving all confused among the rest\nWith hooded brows I crept into the hall,\nAnd, couched behind a Judith, underneath\nThe head of Holofernes peeped and saw.\nGirl after girl was called to trial: each\nDisclaimed all knowledge of us: last of all,\nMelissa: trust me, Sir, I pitied her.\nShe, questioned if she knew us men, at first\nWas silent; closer prest, denied it not:\nAnd then, demanded if her mother knew,\nOr Psyche, she affirmed not, or denied:\nFrom whence the Royal mind, familiar with her,\nEasily gathered either guilt. She sent\nFor Psyche, but she was not there; she called\nFor Psyche's child to cast it from the doors;\nShe sent for Blanche to accuse her face to face;\nAnd I slipt out: but whither will you now?\nAnd where are Psyche, Cyril? both are fled:\nWhat, if together? that were not so well.\nWould rather we had never come! I dread\nHis wildness, and the chances of the dark.'\n\n'And yet,' I said, 'you wrong him more than I\nThat struck him: this is proper to the clown,\nThough smocked, or furred and purpled, still the clown,\nTo harm the thing that trusts him, and to shame\nThat which he says he loves: for Cyril, howe'er\nHe deal in frolic, as tonight--the song\nMight have been worse and sinned in grosser lips\nBeyond all pardon--as it is, I hold\nThese flashes on the surface are not he.\nHe has a solid base of temperament:\nBut as the waterlily starts and slides\nUpon the level in little puffs of wind,\nThough anchored to the bottom, such is he.'\n\nScarce had I ceased when from a tamarisk near\nTwo Proctors leapt upon us, crying, 'Names:'\nHe, standing still, was clutched; but I began\nTo thrid the musky-circled mazes, wind\nAnd double in and out the boles, and race\nBy all the fountains: fleet I was of foot:\nBefore me showered the rose in flakes; behind\nI heard the puffed pursuer; at mine ear\nBubbled the nightingale and heeded not,\nAnd secret laughter tickled all my soul.\nAt last I hooked my ankle in a vine,\nThat claspt the feet of a Mnemosyne,\nAnd falling on my face was caught and known.\n\nThey haled us to the Princess where she sat\nHigh in the hall: above her drooped a lamp,\nAnd made the single jewel on her brow\nBurn like the mystic fire on a mast-head,\nProphet of storm: a handmaid on each side\nBowed toward her, combing out her long black hair\nDamp from the river; and close behind her stood\nEight daughters of the plough, stronger than men,\nHuge women blowzed with health, and wind, and rain,\nAnd labour. Each was like a Druid rock;\nOr like a spire of land that stands apart\nCleft from the main, and wailed about with mews.\n\nThen, as we came, the crowd dividing clove\nAn advent to the throne: and therebeside,\nHalf-naked as if caught at once from bed\nAnd tumbled on the purple footcloth, lay\nThe lily-shining child; and on the left,\nBowed on her palms and folded up from wrong,\nHer round white shoulder shaken with her sobs,\nMelissa knelt; but Lady Blanche erect\nStood up and spake, an affluent orator.\n\n'It was not thus, O Princess, in old days:\nYou prized my counsel, lived upon my lips:\nI led you then to all the Castalies;\nI fed you with the milk of every Muse;\nI loved you like this kneeler, and you me\nYour second mother: those were gracious times.\nThen came your new friend: you began to change--\nI saw it and grieved--to slacken and to cool;\nTill taken with her seeming openness\nYou turned your warmer currents all to her,\nTo me you froze: this was my meed for all.\nYet I bore up in part from ancient love,\nAnd partly that I hoped to win you back,\nAnd partly conscious of my own deserts,\nAnd partly that you were my civil head,\nAnd chiefly you were born for something great,\nIn which I might your fellow-worker be,\nWhen time should serve; and thus a noble scheme\nGrew up from seed we two long since had sown;\nIn us true growth, in her a Jonah's gourd,\nUp in one night and due to sudden sun:\nWe took this palace; but even from the first\nYou stood in your own light and darkened mine.\nWhat student came but that you planed her path\nTo Lady Psyche, younger, not so wise,\nA foreigner, and I your countrywoman,\nI your old friend and tried, she new in all?\nBut still her lists were swelled and mine were lean;\nYet I bore up in hope she would be known:\nThen came these wolves: ~they~ knew her: ~they~ endured,\nLong-closeted with her the yestermorn,\nTo tell her what they were, and she to hear:\nAnd me none told: not less to an eye like mine\nA lidless watcher of the public weal,\nLast night, their mask was patent, and my foot\nWas to you: but I thought again: I feared\nTo meet a cold \"We thank you, we shall hear of it\nFrom Lady Psyche:\" you had gone to her,\nShe told, perforce; and winning easy grace\nNo doubt, for slight delay, remained among us\nIn our young nursery still unknown, the stem\nLess grain than touchwood, while my honest heat\nWere all miscounted as malignant haste\nTo push my rival out of place and power.\nBut public use required she should be known;\nAnd since my oath was ta'en for public use,\nI broke the letter of it to keep the sense.\nI spoke not then at first, but watched them well,\nSaw that they kept apart, no mischief done;\nAnd yet this day (though you should hate me for it)\nI came to tell you; found that you had gone,\nRidden to the hills, she likewise: now, I thought,\nThat surely she will speak; if not, then I:\nDid she? These monsters blazoned what they were,\nAccording to the coarseness of their kind,\nFor thus I hear; and known at last (my work)\nAnd full of cowardice and guilty shame,\nI grant in her some sense of shame, she flies;\nAnd I remain on whom to wreak your rage,\nI, that have lent my life to build up yours,\nI that have wasted here health, wealth, and time,\nAnd talent, I--you know it--I will not boast:\nDismiss me, and I prophesy your plan,\nDivorced from my experience, will be chaff\nFor every gust of chance, and men will say\nWe did not know the real light, but chased\nThe wisp that flickers where no foot can tread.'\n\nShe ceased: the Princess answered coldly, 'Good:\nYour oath is broken: we dismiss you: go.\nFor this lost lamb (she pointed to the child)\nOur mind is changed: we take it to ourself.'\n\nThereat the Lady stretched a vulture throat,\nAnd shot from crooked lips a haggard smile.\n'The plan was mine. I built the nest' she said\n'To hatch the cuckoo. Rise!' and stooped to updrag\nMelissa: she, half on her mother propt,\nHalf-drooping from her, turned her face, and cast\nA liquid look on Ida, full of prayer,\nWhich melted Florian's fancy as she hung,\nA Niob\u00eban daughter, one arm out,\nAppealing to the bolts of Heaven; and while\nWe gazed upon her came a little stir\nAbout the doors, and on a sudden rushed\nAmong us, out of breath as one pursued,\nA woman-post in flying raiment. Fear\nStared in her eyes, and chalked her face, and winged\nHer transit to the throne, whereby she fell\nDelivering sealed dispatches which the Head\nTook half-amazed, and in her lion's mood\nTore open, silent we with blind surmise\nRegarding, while she read, till over brow\nAnd cheek and bosom brake the wrathful bloom\nAs of some fire against a stormy cloud,\nWhen the wild peasant rights himself, the rick\nFlames, and his anger reddens in the heavens;\nFor anger most it seemed, while now her breast,\nBeaten with some great passion at her heart,\nPalpitated, her hand shook, and we heard\nIn the dead hush the papers that she held\nRustle: at once the lost lamb at her feet\nSent out a bitter bleating for its dam;\nThe plaintive cry jarred on her ire; she crushed\nThe scrolls together, made a sudden turn\nAs if to speak, but, utterance failing her,\nShe whirled them on to me, as who should say\n'Read,' and I read--two letters--one her sire's.\n\n'Fair daughter, when we sent the Prince your way,\nWe knew not your ungracious laws, which learnt,\nWe, conscious of what temper you are built,\nCame all in haste to hinder wrong, but fell\nInto his father's hands, who has this night,\nYou lying close upon his territory,\nSlipt round and in the dark invested you,\nAnd here he keeps me hostage for his son.'\n\nThe second was my father's running thus:\n'You have our son: touch not a hair of his head:\nRender him up unscathed: give him your hand:\nCleave to your contract: though indeed we hear\nYou hold the woman is the better man;\nA rampant heresy, such as if it spread\nWould make all women kick against their Lords\nThrough all the world, and which might well deserve\nThat we this night should pluck your palace down;\nAnd we will do it, unless you send us back\nOur son, on the instant, whole.'\nSo far I read;\nAnd then stood up and spoke impetuously.\n\n'O not to pry and peer on your reserve,\nBut led by golden wishes, and a hope\nThe child of regal compact, did I break\nYour precinct; not a scorner of your sex\nBut venerator, zealous it should be\nAll that it might be: hear me, for I bear,\nThough man, yet human, whatsoe'er your wrongs,\nFrom the flaxen curl to the gray lock a life\nLess mine than yours: my nurse would tell me of you;\nI babbled for you, as babies for the moon,\nVague brightness; when a boy, you stooped to me\nFrom all high places, lived in all fair lights,\nCame in long breezes rapt from inmost south\nAnd blown to inmost north; at eve and dawn\nWith Ida, Ida, Ida, rang the woods;\nThe leader wildswan in among the stars\nWould clang it, and lapt in wreaths of glowworm light\nThe mellow breaker murmured Ida. Now,\nBecause I would have reached you, had you been\nSphered up with Cassiop\u00ebia, or the enthroned\nPersephon\u00e8 in Hades, now at length,\nThose winters of abeyance all worn out,\nA man I came to see you: but indeed,\nNot in this frequence can I lend full tongue,\nO noble Ida, to those thoughts that wait\nOn you, their centre: let me say but this,\nThat many a famous man and woman, town\nAnd landskip, have I heard of, after seen\nThe dwarfs of presage: though when known, there grew\nAnother kind of beauty in detail\nMade them worth knowing; but in your I found\nMy boyish dream involved and dazzled down\nAnd mastered, while that after-beauty makes\nSuch head from act to act, from hour to hour,\nWithin me, that except you slay me here,\nAccording to your bitter statute-book,\nI cannot cease to follow you, as they say\nThe seal does music; who desire you more\nThan growing boys their manhood; dying lips,\nWith many thousand matters left to do,\nThe breath of life; O more than poor men wealth,\nThan sick men health--yours, yours, not mine--but half\nWithout you; with you, whole; and of those halves\nYou worthiest; and howe'er you block and bar\nYour heart with system out from mine, I hold\nThat it becomes no man to nurse despair,\nBut in the teeth of clenched antagonisms\nTo follow up the worthiest till he die:\nYet that I came not all unauthorized\nBehold your father's letter.'\nOn one knee\nKneeling, I gave it, which she caught, and dashed\nUnopened at her feet: a tide of fierce\nInvective seemed to wait behind her lips,\nAs waits a river level with the dam\nReady to burst and flood the world with foam:\nAnd so she would have spoken, but there rose\nA hubbub in the court of half the maids\nGathered together: from the illumined hall\nLong lanes of splendour slanted o'er a press\nOf snowy shoulders, thick as herded ewes,\nAnd rainbow robes, and gems and gemlike eyes,\nAnd gold and golden heads; they to and fro\nFluctuated, as flowers in storm, some red, some pale,\nAll open-mouthed, all gazing to the light,\nSome crying there was an army in the land,\nAnd some that men were in the very walls,\nAnd some they cared not; till a clamour grew\nAs of a new-world Babel, woman-built,\nAnd worse-confounded: high above them stood\nThe placid marble Muses, looking peace.\n\nNot peace she looked, the Head: but rising up\nRobed in the long night of her deep hair, so\nTo the open window moved, remaining there\nFixt like a beacon-tower above the waves\nOf tempest, when the crimson-rolling eye\nGlares ruin, and the wild birds on the light\nDash themselves dead. She stretched her arms and called\nAcross the tumult and the tumult fell.\n\n'What fear ye, brawlers? am not I your Head?\nOn me, me, me, the storm first breaks: ~I~ dare\nAll these male thunderbolts: what is it ye fear?\nPeace! there are those to avenge us and they come:\nIf not,--myself were like enough, O girls,\nTo unfurl the maiden banner of our rights,\nAnd clad in iron burst the ranks of war,\nOr, falling, promartyr of our cause,\nDie: yet I blame you not so much for fear:\nSix thousand years of fear have made you that\nFrom which I would redeem you: but for those\nThat stir this hubbub--you and you--I know\nYour faces there in the crowd--tomorrow morn\nWe hold a great convention: then shall they\nThat love their voices more than duty, learn\nWith whom they deal, dismissed in shame to live\nNo wiser than their mothers, household stuff,\nLive chattels, mincers of each other's fame,\nFull of weak poison, turnspits for the clown,\nThe drunkard's football, laughing-stocks of Time,\nWhose brains are in their hands and in their heels\nBut fit to flaunt, to dress, to dance, to thrum,\nTo tramp, to scream, to burnish, and to scour,\nFor ever slaves at home and fools abroad.'\n\nShe, ending, waved her hands: thereat the crowd\nMuttering, dissolved: then with a smile, that looked\nA stroke of cruel sunshine on the cliff,\nWhen all the glens are drowned in azure gloom\nOf thunder-shower, she floated to us and said:\n\n'You have done well and like a gentleman,\nAnd like a prince: you have our thanks for all:\nAnd you look well too in your woman's dress:\nWell have you done and like a gentleman.\nYou saved our life: we owe you bitter thanks:\nBetter have died and spilt our bones in the flood--\nThen men had said--but now--What hinders me\nTo take such bloody vengeance on you both?--\nYet since our father--Wasps in our good hive,\nYou would-be quenchers of the light to be,\nBarbarians, grosser than your native bears--\nO would I had his sceptre for one hour!\nYou that have dared to break our bound, and gulled\nOur servants, wronged and lied and thwarted us--\n~I~ wed with thee! ~I~ bound by precontract\nYour bride, our bondslave! not though all the gold\nThat veins the world were packed to make your crown,\nAnd every spoken tongue should lord you. Sir,\nYour falsehood and yourself are hateful to us:\nI trample on your offers and on you:\nBegone: we will not look upon you more.\nHere, push them out at gates.'\nIn wrath she spake.\nThen those eight mighty daughters of the plough\nBent their broad faces toward us and addressed\nTheir motion: twice I sought to plead my cause,\nBut on my shoulder hung their heavy hands,\nThe weight of destiny: so from her face\nThey pushed us, down the steps, and through the court,\nAnd with grim laughter thrust us out at gates.\n\nWe crossed the street and gained a petty mound\nBeyond it, whence we saw the lights and heard the voices murmuring. While I listened, came\nOn a sudden the weird seizure and the doubt:\nI seemed to move among a world of ghosts;\nThe Princess with her monstrous woman-guard,\nThe jest and earnest working side by side,\nThe cataract and the tumult and the kings\nWere shadows; and the long fantastic night\nWith all its doings had and had not been,\nAnd all things were and were not.\nThis went by\nAs strangely as it came, and on my spirits\nSettled a gentle cloud of melancholy;\nNot long; I shook it off; for spite of doubts\nAnd sudden ghostly shadowings I was one\nTo whom the touch of all mischance but came\nAs night to him that sitting on a hill\nSees the midsummer, midnight, Norway sun\nSet into sunrise; then we moved away.\n\nThy voice is heard through rolling drums,\nThat beat to battle where he stands;\nThy face across his fancy comes,\nAnd gives the battle to his hands:\nA moment, while the trumpets blow,\nHe sees his brood about thy knee;\nThe next, like fire he meets the foe,\nAnd strikes him dead for thine and thee.\n\nSo Lilia sang: we thought her half-possessed,\nShe struck such warbling fury through the words;\nAnd, after, feigning pique at what she called\nThe raillery, or grotesque, or false sublime--\nLike one that wishes at a dance to change\nThe music--clapt her hands and cried for war,\nOr some grand fight to kill and make an end:\nAnd he that next inherited the tale\nHalf turning to the broken statue, said,\n'Sir Ralph has got your colours: if I prove\nYour knight, and fight your battle, what for me?'\nIt chanced, her empty glove upon the tomb\nLay by her like a model of her hand.\nShe took it and she flung it. 'Fight' she said,\n'And make us all we would be, great and good.'\nHe knightlike in his cap instead of casque,\nA cap of Tyrol borrowed from the hall,\nArranged the favour, and assumed the Prince.\n\nV\n\nNow, scarce three paces measured from the mound,\nWe stumbled on a stationary voice,\nAnd 'Stand, who goes?' 'Two from the palace' I.\n'The second two: they wait,' he said, 'pass on;\nHis Highness wakes:' and one, that clashed in arms,\nBy glimmering lanes and walls of canvas led\nThreading the soldier-city, till we heard\nThe drowsy folds of our great ensign shake\nFrom blazoned lions o'er the imperial tent\nWhispers of war.\nEntering, the sudden light\nDazed me half-blind: I stood and seemed to hear,\nAs in a poplar grove when a light wind wakes\nA lisping of the innumerous leaf and dies,\nEach hissing in his neighbour's ear; and then\nA strangled titter, out of which there brake\nOn all sides, clamouring etiquette to death,\nUnmeasured mirth; while now the two old kings\nBegan to wag their baldness up and down,\nThe fresh young captains flashed their glittering teeth,\nThe huge bush-bearded Barons heaved and blew,\nAnd slain with laughter rolled the gilded Squire.\n\nAt length my Sire, his rough cheek wet with tears,\nPanted from weary sides 'King, you are free!\nWe did but keep you surety for our son,\nIf this be he,--or a dragged mawkin, thou,\nThat tends to her bristled grunters in the sludge:'\nFor I was drenched with ooze, and torn with briers,\nMore crumpled than a poppy from the sheath,\nAnd all one rag, disprinced from head to heel.\nThen some one sent beneath his vaulted palm\nA whispered jest to some one near him, 'Look,\nHe has been among his shadows.' 'Satan take\nThe old women and their shadows! (thus the King\nRoared) make yourself a man to fight with men.\nGo: Cyril told us all.'\nAs boys that slink\nFrom ferule and the trespass-chiding eye,\nAway we stole, and transient in a trice\nFrom what was left of faded woman-slough\nTo sheathing splendours and the golden scale\nOf harness, issued in the sun, that now\nLeapt from the dewy shoulders of the Earth,\nAnd hit the Northern hills. Here Cyril met us.\nA little shy at first, but by and by\nWe twain, with mutual pardon asked and given\nFor stroke and song, resoldered peace, whereon\nFollowed his tale. Amazed he fled away\nThrough the dark land, and later in the night\nHad come on Psyche weeping: 'then we fell\nInto your father's hand, and there she lies,\nBut will not speak, or stir.'\nHe showed a tent\nA stone-shot off: we entered in, and there\nAmong piled arms and rough accoutrements,\nPitiful sight, wrapped in a soldier's cloak,\nLike some sweet sculpture draped from head to foot,\nAnd pushed by rude hands from its pedestal,\nAll her fair length upon the ground she lay:\nAnd at her head a follower of the camp,\nA charred and wrinkled piece of womanhood,\nSat watching like the watcher by the dead.\n\nThen Florian knelt, and 'Come' he whispered to her,\n'Lift up your head, sweet sister: lie not thus.\nWhat have you done but right? you could not slay\nMe, nor your prince: look up: be comforted:\nSweet is it to have done the thing one ought,\nWhen fallen in darker ways.' And likewise I:\n'Be comforted: have I not lost her too,\nIn whose least act abides the nameless charm\nThat none has else for me?' She heard, she moved,\nShe moaned, a folded voice; and up she sat,\nAnd raised the cloak from brows as pale and smooth\nAs those that mourn half-shrouded over death\nIn deathless marble. 'Her,' she said, 'my friend--\nParted from her--betrayed her cause and mine--\nWhere shall I breathe? why kept ye not your faith?\nO base and bad! what comfort? none for me!'\nTo whom remorseful Cyril, 'Yet I pray\nTake comfort: live, dear lady, for your child!'\nAt which she lifted up her voice and cried.\n\n'Ah me, my babe, my blossom, ah, my child,\nMy one sweet child, whom I shall see no more!\nFor now will cruel Ida keep her back;\nAnd either she will die from want of care,\nOr sicken with ill-usage, when they say\nThe child is hers--for every little fault,\nThe child is hers; and they will beat my girl\nRemembering her mother: O my flower!\nOr they will take her, they will make her hard,\nAnd she will pass me by in after-life\nWith some cold reverence worse than were she dead.\nIll mother that I was to leave her there,\nTo lag behind, scared by the cry they made,\nThe horror of the shame among them all:\nBut I will go and sit beside the doors,\nAnd make a wild petition night and day,\nUntil they hate to hear me like a wind\nWailing for ever, till they open to me,\nAnd lay my little blossom at my feet,\nMy babe, my sweet Agla\u00efa, my one child:\nAnd I will take her up and go my way,\nAnd satisfy my soul with kissing her:\nAh! what might that man not deserve of me\nWho gave me back my child?' 'Be comforted,'\nSaid Cyril, 'you shall have it:' but again\nShe veiled her brows, and prone she sank, and so\nLike tender things that being caught feign death,\nSpoke not, nor stirred.\nBy this a murmur ran\nThrough all the camp and inward raced the scouts\nWith rumour of Prince Arab hard at hand.\nWe left her by the woman, and without\nFound the gray kings at parle: and 'Look you' cried\nMy father 'that our compact be fulfilled:\nYou have spoilt this child; she laughs at you and man:\nShe wrongs herself, her sex, and me, and him:\nBut red-faced war has rods of steel and fire;\nShe yields, or war.'\nThen Gama turned to me:\n'We fear, indeed, you spent a stormy time\nWith our strange girl: and yet they say that still\nYou love her. Give us, then, your mind at large:\nHow say you, war or not?'\n'Not war, if possible,\nO king,' I said, 'lest from the abuse of war,\nThe desecrated shrine, the trampled year,\nThe smouldering homestead, and the household flower\nTorn from the lintel--all the common wrong--\nA smoke go up through which I loom to her\nThree times a monster: now she lightens scorn\nAt him that mars her plan, but then would hate\n(And every voice she talked with ratify it,\nAnd every face she looked on justify it)\nThe general foe. More soluble is this knot,\nBy gentleness than war. I want her love.\nWhat were I nigher this although we dashed\nYour cities into shards with catapults,\nShe would not love;--or brought her chained, a slave,\nThe lifting of whose eyelash is my lord,\nNot ever would she love; but brooding turn\nThe book of scorn, till all my flitting chance\nWere caught within the record of her wrongs,\nAnd crushed to death: and rather, Sire, than this\nI would the old God of war himself were dead,\nForgotten, rusting on his iron hills,\nRotting on some wild shore with ribs of wreck,\nOr like an old-world mammoth bulked in ice,\nNot to be molten out.'\nAnd roughly spake\nMy father, 'Tut, you know them not, the girls.\nBoy, when I hear you prate I almost think\nThat idiot legend credible. Look you, Sir!\nMan is the hunter; woman is his game:\nThe sleek and shining creatures of the chase,\nWe hunt them for the beauty of their skins;\nThey love us for it, and we ride them down.\nWheedling and siding with them! Out! for shame!\nBoy, there's no rose that's half so dear to them\nAs he that does the thing they dare not do,\nBreathing and sounding beauteous battle, comes\nWith the air of the trumpet round him, and leaps in\nAmong the women, snares them by the score\nFlattered and flustered, wins, though dashed with death\nHe reddens what he kisses: thus I won\nYou mother, a good mother, a good wife,\nWorth winning; but this firebrand--gentleness\nTo such as her! if Cyril spake her true,\nTo catch a dragon in a cherry net,\nTo trip a tigress with a gossamer\nWere wisdom to it.'\n'Yea but Sire,' I cried,\n'Wild natures need wise curbs. The soldier? No:\nWhat dares not Ida do that she should prize\nThe soldier? I beheld her, when she rose\nThe yesternight, and storming in extremes,\nStood for her cause, and flung defiance down\nGagelike to man, and had not shunned the death,\nNo, not the soldier's: yet I hold her, king,\nTrue woman: you clash them all in one,\nThat have as many differences as we.\nThe violet varies from the lily as far\nAs oak from elm: one loves the soldier, one\nThe silken priest of peace, one this, one that,\nAnd some unworthily; their sinless faith,\nA maiden moon that sparkles on a sty,\nGlorifying clown and satyr; whence they need\nMore breadth of culture: is not Ida right?\nThey worth it? truer to the law within?\nSeverer in the logic of a life?\nTwice as magnetic to sweet influences\nOf earth and heaven? and she of whom you speak,\nMy mother, looks as whole as some serene\nCreation minted in the golden moods\nOf sovereign artists; not a thought, a touch,\nBut pure as lines of green that streak the white\nOf the first snowdrop's inner leaves; I say,\nNot like the piebald miscellany, man,\nBursts of great heart and slips in sensual mire,\nBut whole and one: and take them all-in-all,\nWere we ourselves but half as good, as kind,\nAs truthful, much that Ida claims as right\nHad ne'er been mooted, but as frankly theirs\nAs dues of Nature. To our point: not war:\nLest I lose all.'\n'Nay, nay, you spake but sense'\nSaid Gama. 'We remember love ourself\nIn our sweet youth; we did not rate him then\nThis red-hot iron to be shaped with blows.\nYou talk almost like Ida: ~she~ can talk;\nAnd there is something in it as you say:\nBut you talk kindlier: we esteem you for it.--\nHe seems a gracious and a gallant Prince,\nI would he had our daughter: for the rest,\nOur own detention, why, the causes weighed,\nFatherly fears--you used us courteously--\nWe would do much to gratify your Prince--\nWe pardon it; and for your ingress here\nUpon the skirt and fringe of our fair land,\nyou did but come as goblins in the night,\nNor in the furrow broke the ploughman's head,\nNor burnt the grange, nor bussed the milking-maid,\nNor robbed the farmer of his bowl of cream:\nBut let your Prince (our royal word upon it,\nHe comes back safe) ride with us to our lines,\nAnd speak with Arac: Arac's word is thrice\nAs ours with Ida: something may be done--\nI know not what--and ours shall see us friends.\nYou, likewise, our late guests, if so you will,\nFollow us: who knows? we four may build some plan\nFoursquare to opposition.'\nHere he reached\nWhite hands of farewell to my sire, who growled\nAn answer which, half-muffled in his beard,\nLet so much out as gave us leave to go.\n\nThen rode we with the old king across the lawns\nBeneath huge trees, a thousand rings of Spring\nIn every bole, a song on every spray\nOf birds that piped their Valentines, and woke\nDesire in me to infuse my tale of love\nIn the old king's ears, who promised help, and oozed\nAll o'er with honeyed answer as we rode\nAnd blossom-fragrant slipt the heavy dews\nGathered by night and peace, with each light air\nOn our mailed heads: but other thoughts than Peace\nBurnt in us, when we saw the embattled squares,\nAnd squadrons of the Prince, trampling the flowers\nWith clamour: for among them rose a cry\nAs if to greet the king; they made a halt;\nThe horses yelled; they clashed their arms; the drum\nBeat; merrily-blowing shrilled the martial fife;\nAnd in the blast and bray of the long horn\nAnd serpent-throated bugle, undulated\nThe banner: anon to meet us lightly pranced\nThree captains out; nor ever had I seen\nSuch thews of men: the midmost and the highest\nWas Arac: all about his motion clung\nThe shadow of his sister, as the beam\nOf the East, that played upon them, made them glance\nLike those three stars of the airy Giant's zone,\nThat glitter burnished by the frosty dark;\nAnd as the fiery Sirius alters hue,\nAnd bickers into red and emerald, shone\nTheir morions, washed with morning, as they came.\n\nAnd I that prated peace, when first I heard\nWar-music, felt the blind wildbeast of force,\nWhose home is in the sinews of a man,\nStir in me as to strike: then took the king\nHis three broad sons; with now a wandering hand\nAnd now a pointed finger, told them all:\nA common light of smiles at our disguise\nBroke from their lips, and, ere the windy jest\nHad laboured down within his ample lungs,\nThe genial giant, Arac, rolled himself\nThrice in the saddle, then burst out in words.\n\n'Our land invaded, 'sdeath! and he himself\nYour captive, yet my father wills not war:\nAnd, 'sdeath! myself, what care I, war or no?\nbut then this question of your troth remains:\nAnd there's a downright honest meaning in her;\nShe flies too high, she flies too high! and yet\nShe asked but space and fairplay for her scheme;\nShe prest and prest it on me--I myself,\nWhat know I of these things? but, life and soul!\nI thought her half-right talking of her wrongs;\nI say she flies too high, 'sdeath! what of that?\nI take her for the flower of womankind,\nAnd so I often told her, right or wrong,\nAnd, Prince, she can be sweet to those she loves,\nAnd, right or wrong, I care not: this is all,\nI stand upon her side: she made me swear it--\n'Sdeath--and with solemn rites by candle-light--\nSwear by St something--I forget her name--\nHer that talked down the fifty wisest men;\n~She~ was a princess too; and so I swore.\nCome, this is all; she will not: waive your claim:\nIf not, the foughten field, what else, at once\nDecides it, 'sdeath! against my father's will.'\n\nI lagged in answer loth to render up\nMy precontract, and loth by brainless war\nTo cleave the rift of difference deeper yet;\nTill one of those two brothers, half aside\nAnd fingering at the hair about his lip,\nTo prick us on to combat 'Like to like!\nThe woman's garment hid the woman's heart.'\nA taunt that clenched his purpose like a blow!\nFor fiery-short was Cyril's counter-scoff,\nAnd sharp I answered, touched upon the point\nWhere idle boys are cowards to their shame,\n'Decide it here: why not? we are three to three.'\n\nThen spake the third 'But three to three? no more?\nNo more, and in our noble sister's cause?\nMore, more, for honour: every captain waits\nHungry for honour, angry for his king.\nMore, more some fifty on a side, that each\nMay breathe himself, and quick! by overthrow\nOf these or those, the question settled die.'\n\n'Yea,' answered I, 'for this wreath of air,\nThis flake of rainbow flying on the highest\nFoam of men's deeds--this honour, if ye will.\nIt needs must be for honour if at all:\nSince, what decision? if we fail, we fail,\nAnd if we win, we fail: she would not keep\nHer compact.' ''Sdeath! but we will send to her,'\nSaid Arac, 'worthy reasons why she should\nBide by this issue: let our missive through,\nAnd you shall have her answer by the word.'\n\n'Boys!' shrieked the old king, but vainlier than a hen\nTo her false daughters in the pool; for none\nRegarded; neither seemed there more to say:\nBack rode we to my father's camp, and found\nHe thrice had sent a herald to the gates,\nTo learn if Ida yet would cede our claim,\nOr by denial flush her babbling wells\nWith her own people's life: three times he went:\nThe first, he blew and blew, but none appeared:\nHe battered at the doors; none came: the next,\nAn awful voice within had warned him thence:\nThe third, and those eight daughters of the plough\nCame sallying through the gates, and caught his hair,\nAnd so belaboured him on rib and cheek\nThey made him wild: not less one glance he caught\nThrough open doors of Ida stationed there\nUnshaken, clinging to her purpose, firm\nThough compassed by two armies and the noise\nOf arms; and standing like a stately Pine\nSet in a cataract on an island-crag,\nWhen storm is on the heights, and right and left\nSucked from the dark heart of the long hills roll\nThe torrents, dashed to the vale: and yet her will\nBred will in me to overcome it or fall.\n\nBut when I told the king that I was pledged\nTo fight in tourney for my bride, he clashed\nHis iron palms together with a cry;\nHimself would tilt it out among the lads:\nBut overborne by all his bearded lords\nWith reasons drawn from age and state, perforce\nHe yielded, wroth and red, with fierce demur:\nAnd many a bold knight started up in heat,\nAnd sware to combat for my claim till death.\n\nAll on this side the palace ran the field\nFlat to the garden-wall: and likewise here,\nAbove the garden's glowing blossom-belts,\nA columned entry shone and marble stairs,\nAnd great bronze valves, embossed with Tomyris\nAnd what she did to Cyrus after fight,\nBut now fast barred: so here upon the flat\nAll that long morn the lists were hammered up,\nAnd all that morn the heralds to and fro,\nWith message and defiance, went and came;\nLast, Ida's answer, in a royal hand,\nBut shaken here and there, and rolling words\nOration-like. I kissed it and I read.\n\n'O brother, you have known the pangs we felt,\nWhat heats of indignation when we heard\nOf those that iron-cramped their women's feet;\nOf lands in which at the altar the poor bride\nGives her harsh groom for bridal-gift a scourge;\nOf living hearts that crack within the fire\nWhere smoulder their dead despots; and of those,--\nMothers,--that, with all prophetic pity, fling\nTheir pretty maids in the running flood, and swoops\nThe vulture, beak and talon, at the heart\nMade for all noble motion: and I saw\nThat equal baseness lived in sleeker times\nWith smoother men: the old leaven leavened all:\nMillions of throats would bawl for civil rights,\nNo woman named: therefore I set my face\nAgainst all men, and lived but for mine own.\nFar off from men I built a fold for them:\nI stored it full of rich memorial:\nI fenced it round with gallant institutes,\nAnd biting laws to scare the beasts of prey\nAnd prospered; till a rout of saucy boys\nBrake on us at our books, and marred our peace,\nMasked like our maids, blustering I know not what\nOf insolence and love, some pretext held\nOf baby troth, invalid, since my will\nSealed not the bond--the striplings! for their sport!--\nI tamed my leopards: shall I not tame these?\nOr you? or I? for since you think me touched\nIn honour--what, I would not aught of false--\nIs not our case pure? and whereas I know\nYour prowess, Arac, and what mother's blood\nYou draw from, fight; you failing, I abide\nWhat end soever: fail you will not. Still\nTake not his life: he risked it for my own;\nHis mother lives: yet whatsoe'er you do,\nFight and fight well; strike and strike him. O dear\nBrothers, the woman's Angel guards you, you\nThe sole men to be mingled with our cause,\nThe sole men we shall prize in the after-time,\nYour very armour hallowed, and your statues\nReared, sung to, when, this gad-fly brushed aside,\nWe plant a solid foot into the Time,\nAnd mould a generation strong to move\nWith claim on claim from right to right, till she\nWhose name is yoked with children's, know herself;\nAnd Knowledge in our own land make her free,\nAnd, ever following those two crown\u00e8d twins,\nCommerce and conquest, shower the fiery grain\nOf freedom broadcast over all the orbs\nBetween the Northern and the Southern morn.'\n\nThen came a postscript dashed across the rest.\nSee that there be no traitors in your camp:\nWe seem a nest of traitors--none to trust\nSince our arms failed--this Egypt-plague of men!\nAlmost our maids were better at their homes,\nThan thus man-girdled here: indeed I think\nOur chiefest comfort is the little child\nOf one unworthy mother; which she left:\nShe shall not have it back: the child shall grow\nTo prize the authentic mother of her mind.\nI took it for an hour in mine own bed\nThis morning: there the tender orphan hands\nFelt at my heart, and seemed to charm from thence\nThe wrath I nursed against the world: farewell.'\n\nI ceased; he said, 'Stubborn, but she may sit\nUpon a king's right hand in thunder-storms,\nAnd breed up warriors! See now, though yourself\nBe dazzled by the wildfire Love to sloughs\nThat swallow common sense, the spindling king,\nThis Gama swamped in lazy tolerance.\nWhen the man wants weight, the woman takes it up,\nAnd topples down the scales; but this is fixt\nAs are the roots of earth and base of all;\nMan for the field and woman for the hearth:\nMan for the sword and for the needle she:\nMan with the head and woman with the heart:\nMan to command and woman to obey;\nAll else confusion. Look you! the gray mare\nIs ill to live with, when her whinny shrills\nFrom tile to scullery, and her small goodman\nShrinks in his arm-chair while the fires of Hell\nMix with his hearth: but you--she's yet a colt--\nTake, break her: strongly groomed and straitly curbed\nShe might not rank with those detestable\nThat let the bantling scald at home, and brawl\nTheir rights and wrongs like potherbs in the street.\nThey say she's comely; there's the fairer chance:\n~I~ like her none the less for rating at her!\nBesides, the woman wed is not as we,\nBut suffers change of frame. A lusty brace\nOf twins may weed her of her folly. Boy,\nThe bearing and the training of a child\nIs woman's wisdom.'\nThus the hard old king:\nI took my leave, for it was nearly noon:\nI pored upon her letter which I held,\nAnd on the little clause 'take not his life:'\nI mused on that wild morning in the woods,\nAnd on the 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win:'\nI thought on all the wrathful king had said,\nAnd how the strange betrothment was to end:\nThen I remembered that burnt sorcerer's curse\nThat one should fight with shadows and should fall;\nAnd like a flash the weird affection came:\nKing, camp and college turned to hollow shows;\nI seemed to move in old memorial tilts,\nAnd doing battle with forgotten ghosts,\nTo dream myself the shadow of a dream:\nAnd ere I woke it was the point of noon,\nThe lists were ready. Empanoplied and plumed\nWe entered in, and waited, fifty there\nOpposed to fifty, till the trumpet blared\nAt the barrier like a wild horn in a land\nOf echoes, and a moment, and once more\nThe trumpet, and again: at which the storm\nOf galloping hoofs bare on the ridge of spears\nAnd riders front to front, until they closed\nIn conflict with the crash of shivering points,\nAnd thunder. Yet it seemed a dream, I dreamed\nOf fighting. On his haunches rose the steed,\nAnd into fiery splinters leapt the lance,\nAnd out of stricken helmets sprang the fire.\nPart sat like rocks: part reeled but kept their seats:\nPart rolled on the earth and rose again and drew:\nPart stumbled mixt with floundering horses. Down\nFrom those two bulks at Arac's side, and down\nFrom Arac's arm, as from a giant's flail,\nThe large blows rained, as here and everywhere\nHe rode the mellay, lord of the ringing lists,\nAnd all the plain,--brand, mace, and shaft, and shield--\nShocked, like an iron-clanging anvil banged\nWith hammers; till I thought, can this be he\nFrom Gama's dwarfish loins? if this be so,\nThe mother makes us most--and in my dream\nI glanced aside, and saw the palace-front\nAlive with fluttering scarfs and ladies' eyes,\nAnd highest, among the statues, statuelike,\nBetween a cymballed Miriam and a Jael,\nWith Psyche's babe, was Ida watching us,\nA single band of gold about her hair,\nLike a Saint's glory up in heaven: but she\nNo saint--inexorable--no tenderness--\nToo hard, too cruel: yet she sees me fight,\nYea, let her see me fall! and with that I drave\nAmong the thickest and bore down a Prince,\nAnd Cyril, one. Yea, let me make my dream\nAll that I would. But that large-moulded man,\nHis visage all agrin as at a wake,\nMade at me through the press, and, staggering back\nWith stroke on stroke the horse and horseman, came\nAs comes a pillar of electric cloud,\nFlaying the roofs and sucking up the drains,\nAnd shadowing down the champaign till it strikes\nOn a wood, and takes, and breaks, and cracks, and splits,\nAnd twists the grain with such a roar that Earth\nReels, and the herdsmen cry; for everything\nGame way before him: only Florian, he\nThat loved me closer than his own right eye,\nThrust in between; but Arac rode him down:\nAnd Cyril seeing it, pushed against the Prince,\nWith Psyche's colour round his helmet, tough,\nStrong, supple, sinew-corded, apt at arms;\nBut tougher, heavier, stronger, he that smote\nAnd threw him: last I spurred; I felt my veins\nStretch with fierce heat; a moment hand to hand,\nAnd sword to sword, and horse to horse we hung,\nTill I struck out and shouted; the blade glanced,\nI did but shear a feather, and dream and truth\nFlowed from me; darkness closed me; and I fell.\n\nHome they brought her warrior dead:\nShe nor swooned, nor uttered cry:\nAll her maidens, watching, said,\n'She must weep or she will die.'\n\nThen they praised him, soft and low,\nCalled him worthy to be loved,\nTruest friend and noblest foe;\nYet she neither spoke nor moved.\n\nStole a maiden from her place,\nLightly to the warrior stept,\nTook the face-cloth from the face;\nYet she neither moved nor wept.\n\nRose a nurse of ninety years,\nSet his child upon her knee--\nLike summer tempest came her tears--\n'Sweet my child, I live for thee.'\n\nVI\n\nMy dream had never died or lived again.\nAs in some mystic middle state I lay;\nSeeing I saw not, hearing not I heard:\nThough, if I saw not, yet they told me all\nSo often that I speak as having seen.\n\nFor so it seemed, or so they said to me,\nThat all things grew more tragic and more strange;\nThat when our side was vanquished and my cause\nFor ever lost, there went up a great cry,\nThe Prince is slain. My father heard and ran\nIn on the lists, and there unlaced my casque\nAnd grovelled on my body, and after him\nCame Psyche, sorrowing for Agla\u00efa.\nBut high upon the palace Ida stood\nWith Psyche's babe in arm: there on the roofs\nLike that great dame of Lapidoth she sang.\n\n'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: the seed,\nThe little seed they laughed at in the dark,\nHas risen and cleft the soil, and grown a bulk\nOf spanless girth, that lays on every side\nA thousand arms and rushes to the Sun.\n\n'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: they came;\nThe leaves were wet with women's tears: they heard\nA noise of songs they would not understand:\nThey marked it with the red cross to the fall,\nAnd would have strown it, and are fallen themselves.\n\n'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: they came,\nThe woodmen with their axes: lo the tree!\nBut we will make it faggots for the hearth,\nAnd shape it plank and beam for roof and floor,\nAnd boats and bridges for the use of men.\n\n'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen: they struck;\nWith their own blows they hurt themselves, nor knew\nThere dwelt an iron nature in the grain:\nThe glittering axe was broken in their arms,\nTheir arms were shattered to the shoulder blade.\n\n'Our enemies have fallen, but this shall grow\nA night of Summer from the heat, a breadth\nOf Autumn, dropping fruits of power: and rolled\nWith music in the growing breeze of Time,\nThe tops shall strike from star to star, the fangs\nShall move the stony bases of the world.\n\n'And now, O maids, behold our sanctuary\nIs violate, our laws broken: fear we not\nTo break them more in their behoof, whose arms\nChampioned our cause and won it with a day\nBlanched in our annals, and perpetual feast,\nWhen dames and heroines of the golden year\nShall strip a hundred hollows bare of Spring,\nTo rain an April of ovation round\nTheir statues, borne aloft, the three: but come,\nWe will be liberal, since our rights are won.\nLet them not lie in the tents with coarse mankind,\nIll nurses; but descend, and proffer these\nThe brethren of our blood and cause, that there\nLie bruised and maimed, the tender ministries\nOf female hands and hospitality.'\n\nShe spoke, and with the babe yet in her arms,\nDescending, burst the great bronze valves, and led\nA hundred maids in train across the Park.\nSome cowled, and some bare-headed, on they came,\nTheir feet in flowers, her loveliest: by them went\nThe enamoured air sighing, and on their curls\nFrom the high tree the blossom wavering fell,\nAnd over them the tremulous isles of light\nSlided, they moving under shade: but Blanche\nAt distance followed: so they came: anon\nThrough open field into the lists they wound\nTimorously; and as the leader of the herd\nThat holds a stately fretwork to the Sun,\nAnd followed up by a hundred airy does,\nSteps with a tender foot, light as on air,\nThe lovely, lordly creature floated on\nTo where her wounded brethren lay; there stayed;\nKnelt on one knee,--the child on one,--and prest\nTheir hands, and called them dear deliverers,\nAnd happy warriors, and immortal names,\nAnd said 'You shall not lie in the tents but here,\nAnd nursed by those for whom you fought, and served\nWith female hands and hospitality.'\n\nThen, whether moved by this, or was it chance,\nShe past my way. Up started from my side\nThe old lion, glaring with his whelpless eye,\nSilent; but when she saw me lying stark,\nDishelmed and mute, and motionlessly pale,\nCold even to her, she sighed; and when she saw\nThe haggard father's face and reverend beard\nOf grisly twine, all dabbled with the blood\nOf his own son, shuddered, a twitch of pain\nTortured her mouth, and o'er her forehead past\nA shadow, and her hue changed, and she said:\n'He saved my life: my brother slew him for it.'\nNo more: at which the king in bitter scorn\nDrew from my neck the painting and the tress,\nAnd held them up: she saw them, and a day\nRose from the distance on her memory,\nWhen the good Queen, her mother, shore the tress\nWith kisses, ere the days of Lady Blanche:\nAnd then once more she looked at my pale face:\nTill understanding all the foolish work\nOf Fancy, and the bitter close of all,\nHer iron will was broken in her mind;\nHer noble heart was molten in her breast;\nShe bowed, she set the child on the earth; she laid\nA feeling finger on my brows, and presently\n'O Sire,' she said, 'he lives: he is not dead:\nO let me have him with my brethren here\nIn our own palace: we will tend on him\nLike one of these; if so, by any means,\nTo lighten this great clog of thanks, that make\nOur progress falter to the woman's goal.'\n\nShe said: but at the happy word 'he lives'\nMy father stooped, re-fathered o'er my wounds.\nSo those two foes above my fallen life,\nWith brow to brow like night and evening mixt\nTheir dark and gray, while Psyche ever stole\nA little nearer, till the babe that by us,\nHalf-lapt in glowing gauze and golden brede,\nLay like a new-fallen meteor on the grass,\nUncared for, spied its mother and began\nA blind and babbling laughter, and to dance\nIts body, and reach its fatling innocent arms\nAnd lazy lingering fingers. She the appeal\nBrooked not, but clamouring out 'Mine--mine--not yours,\nIt is not yours, but mine: give me the child'\nCeased all on tremble: piteous was the cry:\nSo stood the unhappy mother open-mouthed,\nAnd turned each face her way: wan was her cheek\nWith hollow watch, her blooming mantle torn,\nRed grief and mother's hunger in her eye,\nAnd down dead-heavy sank her curls, and half\nThe sacred mother's bosom, panting, burst\nThe laces toward her babe; but she nor cared\nNor knew it, clamouring on, till Ida heard,\nLooked up, and rising slowly from me, stood\nErect and silent, striking with her glance\nThe mother, me, the child; but he that lay\nBeside us, Cyril, battered as he was,\nTrailed himself up on one knee: then he drew\nHer robe to meet his lips, and down she looked\nAt the armed man sideways, pitying as it seemed,\nOr self-involved; but when she learnt his face,\nRemembering his ill-omened song, arose\nOnce more through all her height, and o'er him grew\nTall as a figure lengthened on the sand\nWhen the tide ebbs in sunshine, and he said:\n\n'O fair and strong and terrible! Lioness\nThat with your long locks play the Lion's mane!\nBut Love and Nature, these are two more terrible\nAnd stronger. See, your foot is on our necks,\nWe vanquished, you the Victor of your will.\nWhat would you more? Give her the child! remain\nOrbed in your isolation: he is dead,\nOr all as dead: henceforth we let you be:\nWin you the hearts of women; and beware\nLest, where you seek the common love of these,\nThe common hate with the revolving wheel\nShould drag you down, and some great Nemesis\nBreak from a darkened future, crowned with fire,\nAnd tread you out for ever: but howso'er\nFixed in yourself, never in your own arms\nTo hold your own, deny not hers to her,\nGive her the child! O if, I say, you keep\nOne pulse that beats true woman, if you loved\nThe breast that fed or arm that dandled you,\nOr own one port of sense not flint to prayer,\nGive her the child! or if you scorn to lay it,\nYourself, in hands so lately claspt with yours,\nOr speak to her, your dearest, her one fault,\nThe tenderness, not yours, that could not kill,\nGive ~me~ it: ~I~ will give it her.\nHe said:\nAt first her eye with slow dilation rolled\nDry flame, she listening; after sank and sank\nAnd, into mournful twilight mellowing, dwelt\nFull on the child; she took it: 'Pretty bud!\nLily of the vale! half opened bell of the woods!\nSole comfort of my dark hour, when a world\nOf traitorous friend and broken system made\nNo purple in the distance, mystery,\nPledge of a love not to be mine, farewell;\nThese men are hard upon us as of old,\nWe two must part: and yet how fain was I\nTo dream thy cause embraced in mine, to think\nI might be something to thee, when I felt\nThy helpless warmth about my barren breast\nIn the dead prime: but may thy mother prove\nAs true to thee as false, false, false to me!\nAnd, if thou needs must needs bear the yoke, I wish it\nGentle as freedom'--here she kissed it: then--\n'All good go with thee! take it Sir,' and so\nLaid the soft babe in his hard-mail\u00e8d hands,\nWho turned half-round to Psyche as she sprang\nTo meet it, with an eye that swum in thanks;\nThen felt it sound and whole from head to foot,\nAnd hugged and never hugged it close enough,\nAnd in her hunger mouthed and mumbled it,\nAnd hid her bosom with it; after that\nPut on more calm and added suppliantly:\n\n'We two were friends: I go to mine own land\nFor ever: find some other: as for me\nI scarce am fit for your great plans: yet speak to me,\nSay one soft word and let me part forgiven.'\n\nBut Ida spoke not, rapt upon the child.\nThen Arac. 'Ida--'sdeath! you blame the man;\nYou wrong yourselves--the woman is so hard\nUpon the woman. Come, a grace to me!\nI am your warrior: I and mine have fought\nYour battle: kiss her; take her hand, she weeps:\n'Sdeath! I would sooner fight thrice o'er than see it.'\n\nBut Ida spoke not, gazing on the ground,\nAnd reddening in the furrows of his chin,\nAnd moved beyond his custom, Gama said:\n\n'I've heard that there is iron in the blood,\nAnd I believe it. Not one word? not one?\nWhence drew you this steel temper? not from me,\nNot from your mother, now a saint with saints.\nShe said you had a heart--I heard her say it--\n\"Our Ida has a heart\"--just ere she died--\n\"But see that some on with authority\nBe near her still\" and I--I sought for one--\nAll people said she had authority--\nThe Lady Blanche: much profit! Not one word;\nNo! though your father sues: see how you stand\nStiff as Lot's wife, and all the good knights maimed,\nI trust that there is no one hurt to death,\nFor our wild whim: and was it then for this,\nWas it for this we gave our palace up,\nWhere we withdrew from summer heats and state,\nAnd had our wine and chess beneath the planes,\nAnd many a pleasant hour with her that's gone,\nEre you were born to vex us? Is it kind?\nSpeak to her I say: is this not she of whom,\nWhen first she came, all flushed you said to me\nNow had you got a friend of your own age,\nNow could you share your thought; now should men see\nTwo women faster welded in one love\nThan pairs of wedlock; she you walked with, she\nYou talked with, whole nights long, up in the tower,\nOf sine and arc, sphero\u00efd and azimuth,\nAnd right ascension, Heaven knows what; and now\nA word, but one, one little kindly word,\nNot one to spare her: out upon you, flint!\nYou love nor her, nor me, nor any; nay,\nYou shame your mother's judgment too. Not one?\nYou will not? well--no heart have you, or such\nAs fancies like the vermin in a nut\nHave fretted all to dust and bitterness.'\nSo said the small king moved beyond his won't.\n\nBut Ida stood nor spoke, drained of her force\nBy many a varying influence and so long.\nDown through her limbs a drooping languor wept:\nHer head a little bent; and on her mouth\nA doubtful smile dwelt like a clouded moon\nIn a still water: then brake out my sire,\nLifted his grim head from my wounds. 'O you,\nWoman, whom we thought woman even now,\nAnd were half fooled to let you tend our son,\nBecause he might have wished it--but we see,\nThe accomplice of your madness unforgiven,\nAnd think that you might mix his draught with death,\nWhen your skies change again: the rougher hand\nIs safer: on to the tents: take up the Prince.'\n\nHe rose, and while each ear was pricked to attend\nA tempest, through the cloud that dimmed her broke\nA genial warmth and light once more, and shone\nThrough glittering drops on her sad friend.\n'Come hither.\nO Psyche,' she cried out, 'embrace me, come,\nQuick while I melt; make reconcilement sure\nWith one that cannot keep her mind an hour:\nCome to the hollow hear they slander so!\nKiss and be friends, like children being chid!\n~I~ seem no more: ~I~ want forgiveness too:\nI should have had to do with none but maids,\nThat have no links with men. Ah false but dear,\nDear traitor, too much loved, why?--why?--Yet see,\nBefore these kings we embrace you yet once more\nWith all forgiveness, all oblivion,\nAnd trust, not love, you less.\nAnd now, O sire,\nGrant me your son, to nurse, to wait upon him,\nLike mine own brother. For my debt to him,\nThis nightmare weight of gratitude, I know it;\nTaunt me no more: yourself and yours shall have\nFree adit; we will scatter all our maids\nTill happier times each to her proper hearth:\nWhat use to keep them here--now? grant my prayer.\nHelp, father, brother, help; speak to the king:\nThaw this male nature to some touch of that\nWhich kills me with myself, and drags me down\nFrom my fixt height to mob me up with all\nThe soft and milky rabble of womankind,\nPoor weakling even as they are.'\nPassionate tears\nFollowed: the king replied not: Cyril said:\n'Your brother, Lady,--Florian,--ask for him\nOf your great head--for he is wounded too--\nThat you may tend upon him with the prince.'\n'Ay so,' said Ida with a bitter smile,\n'Our laws are broken: let him enter too.'\nThen Violet, she that sang the mournful song,\nAnd had a cousin tumbled on the plain,\nPetitioned too for him. 'Ay so,' she said,\n'I stagger in the stream: I cannot keep\nMy heart an eddy from the brawling hour:\nWe break our laws with ease, but let it be.'\n'Ay so?' said Blanche: 'Amazed am I to her\nYour Highness: but your Highness breaks with ease\nThe law your Highness did not make: 'twas I.\nI had been wedded wife, I knew mankind,\nAnd blocked them out; but these men came to woo\nYour Highness--verily I think to win.'\n\nSo she, and turned askance a wintry eye:\nBut Ida with a voice, that like a bell\nTolled by an earthquake in a trembling tower,\nRang ruin, answered full of grief and scorn.\n\n'Fling our doors wide! all, all, not one, but all,\nNot only he, but by my mother's soul,\nWhatever man lies wounded, friend or foe,\nShall enter, if he will. Let our girls flit,\nTill the storm die! but had you stood by us,\nThe roar that breaks the Pharos from his base\nHad left us rock. She fain would sting us too,\nBut shall not. Pass, and mingle with your likes.\nWe brook no further insult but are gone.'\nShe turned; the very nape of her white neck\nWas rosed with indignation: but the Prince\nHer brother came; the king her father charmed\nHer wounded soul with words: nor did mine own\nRefuse her proffer, lastly gave his hand.\n\nThen us they lifted up, dead weights, and bare\nStraight to the doors: to them the doors gave way\nGroaning, and in the Vestal entry shrieked\nThe virgin marble under iron heels:\nAnd on they moved and gained the hall, and there\nRested: but great the crush was, and each base,\nTo left and right, of those tall columns drowned\nIn silken fluctuation and the swarm\nOf female whisperers: at the further end\nWas Ida by the throne, the two great cats\nClose by her, like supporters on a shield,\nBow-backed with fear: but in the centre stood\nThe common men with rolling eyes; amazed\nThey glared upon the women, and aghast\nThe women stared at these, all silent, save\nWhen armour clashed or jingled, while the day,\nDescending, struck athwart the hall, and shot\nA flying splendour out of brass and steel,\nThat o'er the statues leapt from head to head,\nNow fired an angry Pallas on the helm,\nNow set a wrathful Dian's moon on flame,\nAnd now and then an echo started up,\nAnd shuddering fled from room to room, and died\nOf fright in far apartments.\nThen the voice\nOf Ida sounded, issuing ordinance:\nAnd me they bore up the broad stairs, and through\nThe long-laid galleries past a hundred doors\nTo one deep chamber shut from sound, and due\nTo languid limbs and sickness; left me in it;\nAnd others otherwhere they laid; and all\nThat afternoon a sound arose of hoof\nAnd chariot, many a maiden passing home\nTill happier times; but some were left of those\nHeld sagest, and the great lords out and in,\nFrom those two hosts that lay beside the walls,\nWalked at their will, and everything was changed.\n\nAsk me no more: the moon may draw the sea;\nThe cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape\nWith fold to fold, of mountain or of cape;\nBut O too fond, when have I answered thee?\nAsk me no more.\n\nAsk me no more: what answer should I give?\nI love not hollow cheek or faded eye:\nYet, O my friend, I will not have thee die!\nAsk me no more, lest I should bid thee live;\nAsk me no more.\n\nAsk me no more: thy fate and mine are sealed:\nI strove against the stream and all in vain:\nLet the great river take me to the main:\nNo more, dear love, for at a touch I yield;\nAsk me no more.\n\nVII\n\nSo was their sanctuary violated,\nSo their fair college turned to hospital;\nAt first with all confusion: by and by\nSweet order lived again with other laws:\nA kindlier influence reigned; and everywhere\nLow voices with the ministering hand\nHung round the sick: the maidens came, they talked,\nThey sang, they read: till she not fair began\nTo gather light, and she that was, became\nHer former beauty treble; and to and fro\nWith books, with flowers, with Angel offices,\nLike creatures native unto gracious act,\nAnd in their own clear element, they moved.\n\nBut sadness on the soul of Ida fell,\nAnd hatred of her weakness, blent with shame.\nOld studies failed; seldom she spoke: but oft\nClomb to the roofs, and gazed alone for hours\nOn that disastrous leaguer, swarms of men\nDarkening her female field: void was her use,\nAnd she as one that climbs a peak to gaze\nO'er land and main, and sees a great black cloud\nDrag inward from the deeps, a wall of night,\nBlot out the slope of sea from verge to shore,\nAnd suck the blinding splendour from the sand,\nAnd quenching lake by lake and tarn by tarn\nExpunge the world: so fared she gazing there;\nSo blackened all her world in secret, blank\nAnd waste it seemed and vain; till down she came,\nAnd found fair peace once more among the sick.\n\nAnd twilight dawned; and morn by morn the lark\nShot up and shrilled in flickering gyres, but I\nLay silent in the muffled cage of life:\nAnd twilight gloomed; and broader-grown the bowers\nDrew the great night into themselves, and Heaven,\nStar after Star, arose and fell; but I,\nDeeper than those weird doubts could reach me, lay\nQuite sundered from the moving Universe,\nNor knew what eye was on me, nor the hand\nThat nursed me, more than infants in their sleep.\n\nBut Psyche tended Florian: with her oft,\nMelissa came; for Blanche had gone, but left\nHer child among us, willing she should keep\nCourt-favour: here and there the small bright head,\nA light of healing, glanced about the couch,\nOr through the parted silks the tender face\nPeeped, shining in upon the wounded man\nWith blush and smile, a medicine in themselves\nTo wile the length from languorous hours, and draw\nThe sting from pain; nor seemed it strange that soon\nHe rose up whole, and those fair charities\nJoined at her side; nor stranger seemed that hears\nSo gentle, so employed, should close in love,\nThan when two dewdrops on the petals shake\nTo the same sweet air, and tremble deeper down,\nAnd slip at once all-fragrant into one.\n\nLess prosperously the second suit obtained\nAt first with Psyche. Not though Blanche had sworn\nThat after that dark night among the fields\nShe needs must wed him for her own good name;\nNot though he built upon the babe restored;\nNor though she liked him, yielded she, but feared\nTo incense the Head once more; till on a day\nWhen Cyril pleaded, Ida came behind\nSeen but of Psyche: on her foot she hung\nA moment, and she heard, at which her face\nA little flushed, and she past on; but each\nAssumed from thence a half-consent involved\nIn stillness, plighted troth, and were at peace.\n\nNor only these: Love in the sacred halls\nHeld carnival at will, and flying struck\nWith showers of random sweet on maid and man.\nNor did her father cease to press my claim,\nNor did mine own, now reconciled; nor yet\nDid those twin-brothers, risen again and whole;\nNor Arac, satiate with his victory.\n\nBut I lay still, and with me oft she sat:\nThen came a change; for sometimes I would catch\nHer hand in wild delirium, gripe it hard,\nAnd fling it like a viper off, and shriek\n'You are not Ida;' clasp it once again,\nAnd call her Ida, though I knew her not,\nAnd call her sweet, as if in irony,\nAnd call her hard and cold which seemed a truth:\nAnd still she feared that I should lose my mind,\nAnd often she believed that I should die:\nTill out of long frustration of her care,\nAnd pensive tendance in the all-weary noons,\nAnd watches in the dead, the dark, when clocks\nThrobbed thunder through the palace floors, or called\nOn flying Time from all their silver tongues--\nAnd out of memories of her kindlier days,\nAnd sidelong glances at my father's grief,\nAnd at the happy lovers heart in heart--\nAnd out of hauntings of my spoken love,\nAnd lonely listenings to my muttered dream,\nAnd often feeling of the helpless hands,\nAnd wordless broodings on the wasted cheek--\nFrom all a closer interest flourished up,\nTenderness touch by touch, and last, to these,\nLove, like an Alpine harebell hung with tears\nBy some cold morning glacier; frail at first\nAnd feeble, all unconscious of itself,\nBut such as gathered colour day by day.\n\nLast I woke sane, but well-nigh close to death\nFor weakness: it was evening: silent light\nSlept on the painted walls, wherein were wrought\nTwo grand designs; for on one side arose\nThe women up in wild revolt, and stormed\nAt the Oppian Law. Titanic shapes, they crammed\nThe forum, and half-crushed among the rest\nA dwarf-like Cato cowered. On the other side\nHortensia spoke against the tax; behind,\nA train of dames: by axe and eagle sat,\nWith all their foreheads drawn in Roman scowls,\nAnd half the wolf's-milk curdled in their veins,\nThe fierce triumvirs; and before them paused\nHortensia pleading: angry was her face.\n\nI saw the forms: I knew not where I was:\nThey did but look like hollow shows; nor more\nSweet Ida: palm to palm she sat: the dew\nDwelt in her eyes, and softer all her shape\nAnd rounder seemed: I moved: I sighed: a touch\nCame round my wrist, and tears upon my hand:\nThen all for languor and self-pity ran\nMine down my face, and with what life I had,\nAnd like a flower that cannot all unfold,\nSo drenched it is with tempest, to the sun,\nYet, as it may, turns toward him, I on her\nFixt my faint eyes, and uttered whisperingly:\n\n'If you be, what I think you, some sweet dream,\nI would but ask you to fulfil yourself:\nBut if you be that Ida whom I knew,\nI ask you nothing: only, if a dream,\nSweet dream, be perfect. I shall die tonight.\nStoop down and seem to kiss me ere I die.'\n\nI could no more, but lay like one in trance,\nThat hears his burial talked of by his friends,\nAnd cannot speak, nor move, nor make one sign,\nBut lies and dreads his doom. She turned; she paused;\nShe stooped; and out of languor leapt a cry;\nLeapt fiery Passion from the brinks of death;\nAnd I believed that in the living world\nMy spirit closed with Ida's at the lips;\nTill back I fell, and from mine arms she rose\nGlowing all over noble shame; and all\nHer falser self slipt from her like a robe,\nAnd left her woman, lovelier in her mood\nThan in her mould that other, when she came\nFrom barren deeps to conquer all with love;\nAnd down the streaming crystal dropt; and she\nFar-fleeted by the purple island-sides,\nNaked, a double light in air and wave,\nTo meet her Graces, where they decked her out\nFor worship without end; nor end of mine,\nStateliest, for thee! but mute she glided forth,\nNor glanced behind her, and I sank and slept,\nFilled through and through with Love, a happy sleep.\n\nDeep in the night I woke: she, near me, held\nA volume of the Poets of her land:\nThere to herself, all in low tones, she read.\n\n'Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;\nNor waves the cypress in the palace walk;\nNor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font:\nThe fire-fly wakens: wake thou with me.\n\nNow droops the milkwhite peacock like a ghost,\nAnd like a ghost she glimmers on to me.\n\nNow lies the Earth all Dana\u00eb to the stars,\nAnd all thy heart lies open unto me.\n\nNow lies the silent meteor on, and leaves\nA shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.\n\nNow folds the lily all her sweetness up,\nAnd slips into the bosom of the lake:\nSo fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip\nInto my bosom and be lost in me.'\n\nI heard her turn the page; she found a small\nSweet Idyl, and once more, as low, she read:\n\n'Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height:\nWhat pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang)\nIn height and cold, the splendour of the hills?\nBut cease to move so near the Heavens, and cease\nTo glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,\nTo sit a star upon the sparkling spire;\nAnd come, for love is of the valley, come,\nFor love is of the valley, come thou down\nAnd find him; by the happy threshold, he,\nOr hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,\nOr red with spirted purple of the vats,\nOr foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk\nWith Death and Morning on the silver horns,\nNor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,\nNor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,\nThat huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls\nTo roll the torrent out of dusky doors:\nBut follow; let the torrent dance thee down\nTo find him in the valley; let the wild\nLean-headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave\nThe monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill\nTheir thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,\nThat like a broken purpose waste in air:\nSo waste not thou; but come; for all the vales\nAwait thee; azure pillars of the hearth\nArise to thee; the children call, and I\nThy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound,\nSweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;\nMyriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,\nThe moan of doves in immemorial elms,\nAnd murmuring of innumerable bees.'\n\nSo she low-toned; while with shut eyes I lay\nListening; then looked. Pale was the perfect face;\nThe bosom with long sighs laboured; and meek\nSeemed the full lips, and mild the luminous eyes,\nAnd the voice trembled and the hand. She said\nBrokenly, that she knew it, she had failed\nIn sweet humility; had failed in all;\nThat all her labour was but as a block\nLeft in the quarry; but she still were loth,\nShe still were loth to yield herself to one\nThat wholly scorned to help their equal rights\nAgainst the sons of men, and barbarous laws.\nShe prayed me not to judge their cause from her\nThat wronged it, sought far less for truth than power\nIn knowledge: something wild within her breast,\nA greater than all knowledge, beat her down.\nAnd she had nursed me there from week to week:\nMuch had she learnt in little time. In part\nIt was ill counsel had misled the girl\nTo vex true hearts: yet was she but a girl--\n'Ah fool, and made myself a Queen of farce!\nWhen comes another such? never, I think,\nTill the Sun drop, dead, from the signs.'\nHer voice\nchoked, and her forehead sank upon her hands,\nAnd her great heart through all the faultful Past\nWent sorrowing in a pause I dared not break;\nTill notice of a change in the dark world\nWas lispt about the acacias, and a bird,\nThat early woke to feed her little ones,\nSent from a dewy breast a cry for light:\nShe moved, and at her feet the volume fell.\n\n'Blame not thyself too much,' I said, 'nor blame\nToo much the sons of men and barbarous laws;\nThese were the rough ways of the world till now.\nHenceforth thou hast a helper, me, that know\nThe woman's cause is man's: they rise or sink\nTogether, dwarfed or godlike, bond or free:\nFor she that out of Lethe scales with man\nThe shining steps of Nature, shares with man\nHis nights, his days, moves with him to one goal,\nStays all the fair young planet in her hands--\nIf she be small, slight-natured, miserable,\nHow shall men grow? but work no more alone!\nOur place is much: as far as in us lies\nWe two will serve them both in aiding her--\nWill clear away the parasitic forms\nThat seem to keep her up but drag her down--\nWill leave her space to burgeon out of all\nWithin her--let her make herself her own\nTo give or keep, to live and learn and be\nAll that not harms distinctive womanhood.\nFor woman is not undevelopt man,\nBut diverse: could we make her as the man,\nSweet Love were slain: his dearest bond is this,\nNot like to like, but like in difference.\nYet in the long years liker must they grow;\nThe man be more of woman, she of man;\nHe gain in sweetness and in moral height,\nNor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;\nShe mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,\nNor lose the childlike in the larger mind;\nTill at the last she set herself to man,\nLike perfect music unto noble words;\nAnd so these twain, upon the skirts of Time,\nSit side by side, full-summed in all their powers,\nDispensing harvest, sowing the To-be,\nSelf-reverent each and reverencing each,\nDistinct in individualities,\nBut like each other even as those who love.\nThen comes the statelier Eden back to men:\nThen reign the world's great bridals, chaste and calm:\nThen springs the crowning race of humankind.\nMay these things be!'\nSighing she spoke 'I fear\nThey will not.'\n'Dear, but let us type them now\nIn our own lives, and this proud watchword rest\nOf equal; seeing either sex alone\nIs half itself, and in true marriage lies\nNor equal, nor unequal: each fulfils\nDefect in each, and always thought in thought,\nPurpose in purpose, will in will, they grow,\nThe single pure and perfect animal,\nThe two-celled heart beating, with one full stroke,\nLife.'\nAnd again sighing she spoke: 'A dream\nThat once was mind! what woman taught you this?'\n\n'Alone,' I said, 'from earlier than I know,\nImmersed in rich foreshadowings of the world,\nI loved the woman: he, that doth not, lives\nA drowning life, besotted in sweet self,\nOr pines in sad experience worse than death,\nOr keeps his winged affections clipt with crime:\nYet was there one through whom I loved her, one\nNot learn\u00e8d, save in gracious household ways,\nNot perfect, nay, but full of tender wants,\nNo Angel, but a dearer being, all dipt\nIn Angel instincts, breathing Paradise,\nInterpreter between the Gods and men,\nWho looked all native to her place, and yet\nOn tiptoe seemed to touch upon a sphere\nToo gross to tread, and all male minds perforce\nSwayed to her from their orbits as they moved,\nAnd girdled her with music. Happy he\nWith such a mother! faith in womankind\nBeats with his blood, and trust in all things high\nComes easy to him, and though he trip and fall\nHe shall not blind his soul with clay.'\n'But I,'\nSaid Ida, tremulously, 'so all unlike--\nIt seems you love to cheat yourself with words:\nThis mother is your model. I have heard\nof your strange doubts: they well might be: I seem\nA mockery to my own self. Never, Prince;\nYou cannot love me.'\n'Nay but thee' I said\n'From yearlong poring on thy pictured eyes,\nEre seen I loved, and loved thee seen, and saw\nThee woman through the crust of iron moods\nThat masked thee from men's reverence up, and forced\nSweet love on pranks of saucy boyhood: now,\nGiven back to life, to life indeed, through thee,\nIndeed I love: the new day comes, the light\nDearer for night, as dearer thou for faults\nLived over: lift thine eyes; my doubts are dead,\nMy haunting sense of hollow shows: the change,\nThis truthful change in thee has killed it. Dear,\nLook up, and let thy nature strike on mine,\nLike yonder morning on the blind half-world;\nApproach and fear not; breathe upon my brows;\nIn that fine air I tremble, all the past\nMelts mist-like into this bright hour, and this\nIs morn to more, and all the rich to-come\nReels, as the golden Autumn woodland reels\nAthwart the smoke of burning weeds. Forgive me,\nI waste my heart in signs: let be. My bride,\nMy wife, my life. O we will walk this world,\nYoked in all exercise of noble end,\nAnd so through those dark gates across the wild\nThat no man knows. Indeed I love thee: come,\nYield thyself up: my hopes and thine are one:\nAccomplish thou my manhood and thyself;\nLay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me.'\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nSo closed our tale, of which I give you all\nThe random scheme as wildly as it rose:\nThe words are mostly mine; for when we ceased\nThere came a minute's pause, and Walter said,\n'I wish she had not yielded!' then to me,\n'What, if you drest it up poetically?'\nSo prayed the men, the women: I gave assent:\nYet how to bind the scattered scheme of seven\nTogether in one sheaf? What style could suit?\nThe men required that I should give throughout\nThe sort of mock-heroic gigantesque,\nWith which we bantered little Lilia first:\nThe women--and perhaps they felt their power,\nFor something in the ballads which they sang,\nOr in their silent influence as they sat,\nHad ever seemed to wrestle with burlesque,\nAnd drove us, last, to quite a solemn close--\nThey hated banter, wished for something real,\nA gallant fight, a noble princess--why\nNot make her true-heroic--true-sublime?\nOr all, they said, as earnest as the close?\nWhich yet with such a framework scarce could be.\nThen rose a little feud betwixt the two,\nBetwixt the mockers and the realists:\nAnd I, betwixt them both, to please them both,\nAnd yet to give the story as it rose,\nI moved as in a strange diagonal,\nAnd maybe neither pleased myself nor them.\n\nBut Lilia pleased me, for she took no part\nIn our dispute: the sequel of the tale\nHad touched her; and she sat, she plucked the grass,\nShe flung it from her, thinking: last, she fixt\nA showery glance upon her aunt, and said,\n'You--tell us what we are' who might have told,\nFor she was crammed with theories out of books,\nBut that there rose a shout: the gates were closed\nAt sunset, and the crowd were swarming now,\nTo take their leave, about the garden rails.\n\nSo I and some went out to these: we climbed\nThe slope to Vivian-place, and turning saw\nThe happy valleys, half in light, and half\nFar-shadowing from the west, a land of peace;\nGray halls alone among their massive groves;\nTrim hamlets; here and there a rustic tower\nHalf-lost in belts of hop and breadths of wheat;\nThe shimmering glimpses of a stream; the seas;\nA red sail, or a white; and far beyond,\nImagined more than seen, the skirts of France.\n\n'Look there, a garden!' said my college friend,\nThe Tory member's elder son, 'and there!\nGod bless the narrow sea which keeps her off,\nAnd keeps our Britain, whole within herself,\nA nation yet, the rulers and the ruled--\nSome sense of duty, something of a faith,\nSome reverence for the laws ourselves have made,\nSome patient force to change them when we will,\nSome civic manhood firm against the crowd--\nBut yonder, whiff! there comes a sudden heat,\nThe gravest citizen seems to lose his head,\nThe king is scared, the soldier will not fight,\nThe little boys begin to shoot and stab,\nA kingdom topples over with a shriek\nLike an old woman, and down rolls the world\nIn mock heroics stranger than our own;\nRevolts, republics, revolutions, most\nNo graver than a schoolboys' barring out;\nToo comic for the serious things they are,\nToo solemn for the comic touches in them,\nLike our wild Princess with as wise a dream\nAs some of theirs--God bless the narrow seas!\nI wish they were a whole Atlantic broad.'\n\n'Have patience,' I replied, 'ourselves are full\nOf social wrong; and maybe wildest dreams\nAre but the needful preludes of the truth:\nFor me, the genial day, the happy crowd,\nThe sport half-science, fill me with a faith.\nThis fine old world of ours is but a child\nYet in the go-cart. Patience! Give it time\nTo learn its limbs: there is a hand that guides.'\n\nIn such discourse we gained the garden rails,\nAnd there we saw Sir Walter where he stood,\nBefore a tower of crimson holly-hoaks,\nAmong six boys, head under head, and looked\nNo little lily-handed Baronet he,\nA great broad-shouldered genial Englishman,\nA lord of fat prize-oxen and of sheep,\nA raiser of huge melons and of pine,\nA patron of some thirty charities,\nA pamphleteer on guano and on grain,\nA quarter-sessions chairman, abler none;\nFair-haired and redder than a windy morn;\nNow shaking hands with him, now him, of those\nThat stood the nearest--now addressed to speech--\nWho spoke few words and pithy, such as closed\nWelcome, farewell, and welcome for the year\nTo follow: a shout rose again, and made\nThe long line of the approaching rookery swerve\nFrom the elms, and shook the branches of the deer\nFrom slope to slope through distant ferns, and rang\nBeyond the bourn of sunset; O, a shout\nMore joyful than the city-roar that hails\nPremier or king! Why should not these great Sirs\nGive up their parks some dozen times a year\nTo let the people breathe? So thrice they cried,\nI likewise, and in groups they streamed away.\n\nBut we went back to the Abbey, and sat on,\nSo much the gathering darkness charmed: we sat\nBut spoke not, rapt in nameless reverie,\nPerchance upon the future man: the walls\nBlackened about us, bats wheeled, and owls whooped,\nAnd gradually the powers of the night,\nThat range above the region of the wind,\nDeepening the courts of twilight broke them up\nThrough all the silent spaces of the worlds,\nBeyond all thought into the Heaven of Heavens.\n\nLast little Lilia, rising quietly,\nDisrobed the glimmering statue of Sir Ralph\nFrom those rich silks, and home well-pleased we went.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/2506862", "artist_names": "Country Genius", "full_title": "Songs of the South: Tennessee - p.3 by\u00a0Country\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b702cf36c9070c63362dfac8180bdb90.300x180x1.gif", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b702cf36c9070c63362dfac8180bdb90.550x330x1.gif", "id": 2506862, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1217557, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1476630707, "path": "/Country-genius-songs-of-the-south-tennessee-p3-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Country-genius-songs-of-the-south-tennessee-p3-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2016, "month": 10, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "October 1, 2016", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Oct. 1, 2016", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/1c0fb6ccd7bc0e3ca70358319505d021.300x227x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/1c0fb6ccd7bc0e3ca70358319505d021.768x580x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Songs of the South: Tennessee - p.3", "title_with_featured": "Songs of the South: Tennessee - p.3", "updated_by_human_at": 1527887516, "url": "https://genius.com/Country-genius-songs-of-the-south-tennessee-p3-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/214055", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/203e2cc1a4dc29cbd97e5c7e3aeced47.1000x563x1.jpg", "id": 214055, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ba89ed3a929e3e3c527598501a230e84.542x374x1.jpg", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Country Genius", "slug": "Country-genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Country-genius"}, "artist": "Country Genius", "lyrics": "Songs of the South: Tennessee - p.3 LyricsCumberland Plateau, Tennessee Valley and\nUnaka Mountains Region -\nBluegrass and String Band Music\n\nBluegrass and string band music has one of the most fiercely loyal audiences in American music.  Followers don't look at it so much as entertainment as they do a way of life.  You'll frequently see the makeup of these bands are family members, and many make it their life's work.  That kind of devotion says a lot about the values they see in the music. Whether it's history and tradition they hear, or that they hear it as a true expression of Americana, the performers and their audiences are passionate. You'll find a great presentation of this in a thesis by Leslie Blake Price entitled Bluegrass Nation: A Historical and Cultural Analysis of America's Truest Music.\n\nAny discussion of country or bluegrass music must acknow-ledge the contributions of the Carter Family.  They were one of the most influential groups in country music history, and they moved the emphasis from hillbilly instrumentals to \"folk stories in song\".  The original group consisted of A.P., his wife Sara, and her sister Maybelle.  They influenced all that followed in country and folk music, from Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Doc Watson all the way up to Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris and Ketch Secor.\n\nIt's unlikely that bluegrass music would exist today without the Carter Family's contributions. A.P. collected hundreds of Appalachian folk songs and rearranged them into the classics we have today.  They recorded hundreds of songs. but \"Will the Circle Be Unbroken\", \"Wildwood Flower\", and \"Keep on the Sunny Side\" will give you a good sense of what their music did to build the folk tradition in country music.\n\nThat foundation work was built-up by those who followed.  In bluegrass, there are no better examples of where we are today today than Earl Skruggs' \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\", the Foggy Mountain Boys' \"Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arms\" or the Osborne Brothers' \"Rocky Top\", but here is a short list of more recent (and also great) examples of bluegrass and string music:Old Crow Medicine Show's \"Sweet Amarillo\"The SteelDrivers' \"Wearin' a Hole\"The Grascals' \"Old Friend of Mine\"Dailey & Vincent's \"Take Me Back (And Leave Me There)\"Aly Bain, Jerry Douglas and Russ Barenberg's\n\"St. Anne's Reel\"Wilson Banjo Company's \"95 Years\"Yonder Mountain String Band's \"Alison\"Top Ten Music Shrines in Tennessee\nIf you're into music and history, here are some great places to visit when you're in Tennessee:In the Coastal Plains region:Graceland - Memphis\nElvis promised his parents he'd build them the finest house in town, and put an end to years of struggle. Graceland was the fulfillment of that dream.Sun Studios - Memphis\nJohhny Cash, Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis recorded here - all at the same time.Stax American Soul Music Museum - Memphis\nStax made hit soul music in the 50s and 60s, and this is one of only a few museums dedicated to soul.In the Nashville Basin region:Country Music Hall of Fame - Nashville\nThe museum\u2019s core exhibition is \"Sing Me Back Home: A Journey Through Country Music\". It's a full-immersion experience.Ryman Auditorium - Nashville\nThe first Grand Ole Opry started here in 1925. It's almost like being in a cathedral.Johnny Cash Museum - Nashville\nIt's captivating, real and raw - just like Cash himself.Jack Daniel's Distillery - Lynchburg\nWhat, you ask, does Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 have to do with Tennessee music?In the Cumberland/TN Valley/Unaka Mtns region:Cumberland Caverns - McMinnville\nBluegrass concerts are presented every month in the Volcano Room of Cumberland Caverns. They've been featured on NBC and PBS.Dollywood - Pigeon Forge\nThink of it as Disneyland with a bluegrass soundtrack.Birthplace of Country Music Museum - Bristol\nTells the story of the 1927 Bristol Sessions recordings that included the Carter Family and Jimmie RodgersTennessee Artists:Here's a list of some of the most famous musicians that were born in Tennessee or made the state their home. Each artist is listed with one - three songs to give you a sampler of their music. The list is long, but not comprehensive. Think of it as a primer. (With apologies to our Texas readers for the inclusion of Townes Van Zandt and other sons of the republic.

Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)\n\n(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)\n\nLONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.\n\n(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!\n\nJOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

Down with Bloom!\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut.

Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear.

He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah!

Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O!

Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls.

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop!

A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.)

The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!\n\n(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements.

Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead.

Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 10, "api_path": "/songs/71983", "artist_names": "Funkadelic", "full_title": "You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks by\u00a0Funkadelic", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/74a75abb9ec3dd1db901b73121b29ef9.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/74a75abb9ec3dd1db901b73121b29ef9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 71983, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 21564, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1663470989, "path": "/Funkadelic-you-and-your-folks-me-and-my-folks-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Funkadelic-you-and-your-folks-me-and-my-folks-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1971, "month": 7, "day": 12}, "release_date_for_display": "July 12, 1971", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 12, 1971", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/74a75abb9ec3dd1db901b73121b29ef9.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/74a75abb9ec3dd1db901b73121b29ef9.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false, "pageviews": 14833}, "title": "You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks", "title_with_featured": "You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks", "updated_by_human_at": 1663462074, "url": "https://genius.com/Funkadelic-you-and-your-folks-me-and-my-folks-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/18087", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/8039eaafeb7e7f7596098c054a946f24.300x300x1.png", "id": 18087, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3af150bfbfd01671a64a1e8fdd4e2f90.516x516x1.jpg", "index_character": "f", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Funkadelic", "slug": "Funkadelic", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Funkadelic"}, "artist": "Funkadelic", "lyrics": "You and Your Folks, Me and My Folks Lyrics[Intro: Billy Bass Nelson]\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nLet me hear you say\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nLet me hear you say\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n[Chorus]\nIf you and your folks love me and my folks\nLike me and my folks love you and your folks\nIf there ever was folks\nThat ever ever was poor, yeah\nIf you and your thing dig me and my thing\nLike me and my thing dig you and your thing\nThen we all got a thing\nYeah, and it's a very good thing\n\n[Verse 1]\nHa, but if in our fears, we don't learn to trust each other\nAnd if in our tears, we don't learn to share with your brother\nYou know that hate is gonna keep on multiplying\nAnd you know that man is gonna keep right on dying\nYeah\nYeah, yeah\n\n[Refrain]\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nYeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nThe rich got a big piece of this and that (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nThe poor got a big piece of roaches and rats (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nCan you get to that?

EXT. NEW YORK - LIBERTY ISLAND - DAY\nThe STATUE OF LIBERTY stands watch at the mouth of the Hudson.  Over\nscene, we SUPER TITLE:\n\nNEW YORK CITY - JULY 1976\n\n2. JERSEY CITY PIER - DAY\nA live news update.  Network correspondent CINDY CHAN stands at the\nedge of the  dock, the statue plainly visible in the distance behind\nher.\nCINDY\n-- insist that the situation is under control.  Authorities have just\nagreed to the release of nine Radical Front prisoners in hopes of\nfreeing the hostages.\n(adjusting her hair)\nWe repeat: terrorists have taken Liberty Island, and are holding some\nforty hostages -- including tourists and maintenance workers --\ncaptive in the Statue of Liberty itself.\n\n3. FERRYBOAT - DAY\nThe ferry -- one of six anchored a half-mile off Liberty Island --\nhas been commandeered by a fully-armed SWAT TEAM.  The SWAT CAPTAIN,\nwho's in charge of negotiations, speaks to the terrorists via\nwalkie-talkie.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nYour demands have been met.  The prisoners and the money are on their\nway.  If you tune your TV to Channel 4 you'll see the copters\npreparing for takeoff.\n\n4. INT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT\nThe screen of a portable TV shows THREE HELICOPTERS lifting off from\nLaguardia.  We're in the OBSERVATION ROOM inside the statue's head.\nA TERRORIST holds a crowd of SQUEALING TOURISTS -- men, women,\nschoolchildren -- at bay with an automatic rifle.  Two others stand\nby the windows, scanning the harbor for signs of a double-cross; and\na fourth, the RINGLEADER, speaks into a walkie-talkie.\nRINGLEADER\nGood.  We got forty innocent people here.  One false move . . . and\nwe blow her brains out.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)\n(filter; from walkie-talkie)\nBlow whose brains out?\n\n5. EXT. STATUE - THAT MOMENT\nTIGHT on the ring of OBSERVATION WINDOWS situated just below the\njutting spikes of the CROWN.  CAMERA PULLS BACK rapidly to take in\nthe whole of the statue's head.\n\nRINGLEADER (O.S.)\n(a nasty laugh)\nLady Liberty, my friend.  Lady Liberty's brains!\n\n6. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nMOUNTING TENSION among the SWAT TEAM on deck.\n\nSWAT COP\nSons of bitches.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nRelax.  We'll nail 'em on the transfer.  Let's get those hostages out\nfirst.\nSWAT COP II\nCaptain . . . what the hell is that?\n\nAll eyes turn upward.  In the distance, a TINY SPECK descends from\nthe clouds and drops, in a perfectly vertical line, toward the head\nof the statue.  The SWAT CAPTAIN hoists a pair of binoculars:\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nShit.  Shit fire!!\n\nSWAT COP\nSir!  What is it?\n\n7. POV SHOT - THROUGH BINOCULARS\nA magnified view of the SPECK, which turns out to be a futuristic,\nblimplike HOVERCRAFT -- the OWLSHIP.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN (O.S.)\nChrist almighty, it's the goddamned Watchmen!\n\n8. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nIn the cabin we find THREE COSTUMED SUPERHEROES: the red-and-gold\nsuited CAPTAIN METROPOLIS; RORSCHACH, whose face is a shifting\ninkblot mask; and NIGHT OWL, who's manning the instrument panel.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nOkay, Adrian, we're in position.  What now?\n\nHe looks up at a monitor mounted over the controls.  ADRIAN VEIDT,\nblond scientific wizard, answers pensively from Watchmen HQ:\n\nVEIDT\n(on monitor)\nLet's take out their communications.  Drop the scrambler.\n\n9. EXT. HEAD OF STATUE - DAY\nA line drops from the OWLSHIP, and an ELECTRONIC DEVICE lands with a\nthud on the dome of Lady Liberty's crown.\n\n10. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nTERRORISTS staring at the portable TV screen; suddenly, it shows\nnothing but snow.  The RINGLEADER, suspicious, lifts his\nwalkie-talkie:\n\nRINGLEADER\nHey.  We got a problem here --\n\nHe releases the button.  No reply -- only loud, hissing STATIC.\n\nRINGLEADER\nCome in.  Do you read me?  Don't play around with us,\nGoddammit !\n\n11. EXT. FERRY - THAT MOMENT\nThe SWAT CAPTAIN curses at his useless walkie-talkie.  Teeth bared,\nhe glowers up at the OWLSHIP and paces the deck in a psychotic\nfrenzy.\n\nSWAT COP\nIgnorant bastards!  They've jammed us!\n\nSWAT COP II\nWhat do we do now?\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nWe sit here with our thumbs up our butts.  As usual.\n\n12. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nA HULKING FIGURE, outfitted in SCUBA GEAR, emerges from the water.\nThere's an evil-looking RIFLE slung over his shoulder.  As he\nswaggers toward the base of the statue, he peels off his wetsuit to\nreveal yet another gaudy COSTUME underneath.\n\nSuperhero #4: THE COMEDIAN.  He pins a BADGE to his leather\nbreastplate; incongruously, it's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON -- and it\nmatches his own nasty SMILE as he marches forward into battle.\n\n13. INT. BASE OF STATUE - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nA TRIO OF TERRORISTS standing guard near the entrance in the base of\nthe statue.  They're holding a JANITOR at gunpoint.  One of them is\nfumbling with his walkie-talkie, which has inexplicably gone\nhaywire.\n\nTERRORIST I\nBase to head.  Base to head.  Come in!\n(flustered)\nI can't get shit!\n\nTERRORIST II\nWhat the hell is going on??\n\nThere's a sudden metallic CLANG behind them.  They turn in unison --\njust as the COMEDIAN struts into frame, assault rifle in hand.\n\nPanic.  The three TERRORISTS fall into a tight cluster at the base of\na long metal stairway.  One of them grabs the JANITOR, holds a gun to\nhis head.\n\nTERRORIST I\nI'M NOT JOKING!!\n\nThe COMEDIAN shrugs: okay.  He lifts his rifle and fires TWO SILENCED\nSHOTS directly into the JANITOR's gut.  The old man's body jerks twice\nand he slumps to the floor, stone dead.\n\nThe TERRORISTS stand there aghast.  For an instant they're too\nstunned to shoot.  The COMEDIAN breaks into a dopey grin --\n\nCOMEDIAN\nThe joke's on you.\n\n-- and opens fire with a look of VICIOUS PLEASURE on his face.  As\nthe saying goes . . . it's nice to see a man who enjoys his work.\n\n14. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nRORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS stand over an open hatch in the floor\nof the cabin.  At the console, NIGHT OWL hits a button.  Then --\n\n15. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nA sudden BOOM.  A FLASH OF COLOR.  The startled TERRORISTS turn to\nthe nearest window, and see a spectacular display of BICENTENNIAL\nFIREWORKS bursting above the harbor a short distance away.\n\nWhile the TERRORISTS are distracted, our attention shifts to a point\nbehind them.  Through an OBSERVATION WINDOW we see CAPT. METROPOLIS\nand RORSCHACH sliding down a thin metal cable and LANDING on the\nstatue's upraised TORCH.\n\nThe TERRORISTS turn back just as the superheroes disappear around the\nfar side of the torch.\n\nRINGLEADER\nI don't like this.  Go downstairs and see what's up.\n\n16. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nRORSCHACH and CAPT. METROPOLIS pry open a metal door on the torch.\n\nRORSCHACH\nGot your flashgun?\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS nods.  He puts on a pair of IONIZED SUNGLASSES and\ngoes through the door, into the torch.  RORSCHACH waits\nbehind.\n\n17. INT. BASE OF STATUE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nThe COMEDIAN is wandering around with a MAP of the statue's layout.\nHe spots what looks like a MANHOLE COVER set in the concrete floor,\nthen strolls over and jimmies it open.\n\nANOTHER FIGURE in scuba gear climbs out.  But this one's different.\nThis one's a WOMAN.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nAbout time.  It stinks down there.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nB-team's upstairs.  We gotta find that bomb.\n\nAs the COMEDIAN saunters off, she strips out of her slime-drenched\nwetsuit.  You guessed it -- a garish (and kinda skimpy) COSTUME\nunderneath.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nWhy do I get all the glamour jobs?\n\nCOMEDIAN\nA woman's work is never done.\n\n18. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT - DAY\nThe TERRORISTS tense up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS.  A moment later,\nCAPT. METROPOLIS appears on the stairs.  The TERRORISTS train their\nguns on him -- all but the RINGLEADER, who grabs a\nTEN-YEAR-OLD-GIRL.\n\nRINGLEADER\nI don't know who you are pal, but you just killed a little girl.\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS\nPlease.  There's something I'd like you to see first.\n\nHe holds up what looks like an old-fashioned photographer's flash.\nAll at once, the ROOM GOES WHITE -- and by the time the blinding\nlight has dimmed, TERRORISTS and HOSTAGES alike are toppling to the\nfloor, their nervous systems temporarily FRIED.\n\nAll except CAPT. METROPOLIS, who's wearing his special sunglasses.\nHe pockets the shades and swiftly goes to work.\n\n19. INT. STATUE - NEAR BASE - A MOMENT LATER\nAn edgy TERRORIST all alone, standing watch.  Suddenly he's grabbed\nfrom behind -- and THE COMEDIAN is holding the point of a BAYONET at\nhis throat.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nOkay, Abdul.  Where's the bomb?\n\n20. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nEveryone's slowly coming around.  By now CAPT. METROPOLIS has the\nTERRORISTS tied up; he's consoling a squawling THREE-YEAR-OLD.\n\nCAPT. METROPOLIS\nDon't cry, little one.  You're in good hands.\n(standing; to the crowd)\nNow everyone.  Listen carefully.  We're going out through the torch.\n\nHe goes to a window, gives the thumbs-up sign to RORSCHACH out on the\ntorch.  RORSCHACH signals the OWLSHIP.\n\n21. EXT. STATUE - ON TORCH - A MOMENT LATER\nA METAL LADDER descends from the belly of the OWLSHIP.  RORSCHACH\nsecures it to the tip of the torch.\n\n22.  INT. STATUE - MIDSECTION - THAT MOMENT\nSILK SPECTRE and THE COMEDIAN marching up a long metal stairway.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nShould be just overhead.  We have to distract them somehow . . .\n\nCOMEDIAN\nJust barge in.  While they're staring at your tits we'll blow their\nballs off.\n\nThey look up.  A TERRORIST is peering down at them from an overhead\nlanding.  The COMEDIAN lifts his rifle: thwip.  Before the terrorist\nhits the floor, the COMEDIAN has lobbed a GAS GRENADE onto the\nlanding.\n\n23. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - A MOMENT LATER\nGas everywhere.  The TERRORISTS' BOMB, and it's a big fat one, sits\nin a complicated housing at the center of the landing, with\nUNCONSCIOUS TERRORISTS sprawled all around it.  SILK SPECTRE and the\nCOMEDIAN, in gas masks, march up the stairs to scope things out:\n\nCOMEDIAN\nWell.  They look distracted.\n(turning to face her)\nDon't suppose you know how to disarm one of these babies . . . ?\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nEddie -- !\n\nSuddenly panicked, she grabs his shoulder, points behind him.  He\nturns.\n\nOne of the TERRORISTS still has some life in him.  He drags himself\nover to the bomb and -- with his last ounce of strength -- FLIPS A\nSWITCH on the housing.\n\nA TIMER begins to count down.  Thirty seconds.  Twenty-nine.\n\nCOMEDIAN\nSHIT!\n\nHe hits a trigger on his belt, and a RED SIGNAL LIGHT begins to\nblink.  He spots an elevator door, runs over, and pries it open.  An\nempty shaft; the car is some twenty stories below them.\n\nSILK SPECTRE\nWhat about the --\n\nCOMEDIAN\nFUCK 'EM!\n\nThere's a mountain-climber's CARABINER on his belt; he fastens it\naround the ELEVATOR CABLE -- and DROPS.  SILK SPECTRE hesitates only\na second before following suit.\n\n24. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nCAPT. METROPOLIS is herding HOSTAGES down the stairway.  All at once,\nhe FREEZES.  There's a red SIGNAL LIGHT flashing on his belt as\nwell.\n\n25. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nYET ANOTHER RED LIGHT is flashing on NIGHT OWL's instrument panel.\nHe looks up at VEIDT on the monitor.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nAdrian!\n\nVEIDT\nYeah, I see it.  Mission aborted.\n\nNIGHT OWL\nWell, good God, we can't just --\n\nVEIDT\nMission aborted, Daniel!\n\nNIGHT OWL reluctantly agrees.  He lets out the throttle.\n\n26. INT. STATUE - STAIRWAY LANDING - THAT MOMENT\nOn the BOMB.  The timer shows ten seconds to go.\n\n27. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - A MOMENT LATER\nThe COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE plummet downward, their BELT CLASPS\nthrowing off sparks against the cable.\n\n28. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nCAPT. METROPOLIS at the window, petrified with fear, his hands\npressed to the glass.  He watches as the OWLSHIP flies away -- and\nRORSCHACH, who's hanging onto the metal ladder, is YANKED BODILY off\nthe torch.\n\n29. INT. STATUE - ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT\nTHE COMEDIAN makes a hard landing on the roof of a car.  SILK SPECTRE\ntouches down behind him just as he manages to pry a set of elevator\ndoors open, and the two of them dive through.\n\n30. AERIAL SHOT - MOVING OVER HARBOR - A MOMENT LATER\nRORSCHACH clings desperately to the metal ladder as the OWLSHIP\nstreaks across the harbor.  Behind him is the rapidly receding figure\nof Lady Liberty.\n\nThree beats later, a GAPING HOLE blows open in her midsection.\n\n31.  INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nA heartsick NIGHT OWL pounds the control panel in frustration.  On an\noverhead monitor, the upper portion of the statue is TOPPLING.\n\n32. INT. STATUE - A MOMENT LATER\nSmoke everywhere.  The COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE are pressed flat\nagainst a CONCRETE BULKHEAD.  An overhang protects them from falling\nDEBRIS -- which is raining down in copious amounts.\n\n33. EXT. FERRY - A MOMENT LATER\nThe furious SWAT CAPTAIN watches in astonishment as the top half of\nthe statue disintegrates into RUBBLE and tumbles to the ground.  He\nturns away from the sight, shaking his head in vehement disgust.\n\nSWAT CAPTAIN\nThat's it.  I quit.\n\nThe water stirs.  The boat begins to ROCK.  On deck, all eyes turn --\n\n34. EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - THAT MOMENT - DAY\n-- as a LUMINOUS BLUE-SKINNED GIANT, SIXTY FEET TALL, wades through\nthe harbor and steps up onto the island.  He stares in dismay at the\ndemolished statue . . . like a modern-day Colossus of Rhodes\nwondering what the hell happened to his date.\n\nMeet the last -- and most powerful -- member of our happy band: DR.\nMANHATTAN.\n\nDown below, THE COMEDIAN and SILK SPECTRE -- battered but intact --\nare crawling out of the wreckage.  The COMEDIAN looks up at the huge\nblue figure looming over them, and shakes a gnat-sized fist:\n\nCOMEDIAN\nASSHOLE!  WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?!?\n\nCUT TO:\n\n35. INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT\nThe Channel 4 Newsroom, with anchors SHEILA SHEA and JIM BRADLEY.\n\nSHEILA\nIn the face of mounting public pressure, the city of New York has\nrevoked its contract with Adrian Veidt's super-team.  Local police\nhave threatened a city-wide walkout if criminal charges against the\nWatchmen are dropped.\n\nOn the bluescreen behind them, red circles with diagonal crossbars\nsurround SIX HEAD SHOTS of the individual WATCHMEN.\n\nJIM\nAnd in Washington today, the Senate introduced legislation which\nwould ban all costumed adventurers nationwide.  Easy passage\nis expected.\n(shuffling his papers)\nWell, Sheila, it looks like the age of the superhero is officially\nhistory.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n36.  CREDITS SEQUENCE\nTIMEPIECES of every description -- pocket watches, grandfather\nclocks, travel alarms, all perfectly synchronized -- DRIFT UPWARD\nthrough a vast black void, ticking off the seconds.  At the stroke of\nmidnight, GONGS sound, BUZZERS buzz, BELLS tinkle -- and without\nwarning the clocks EXPLODE.  As gears and coils and crystals cascade\ndownward through the void, we SUPER TITLE:\n\nWATCHMEN\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n37. EXT. HIGH-RISE - NIGHT\nDarkened windows glow with the dim fire of reflected neon as we TILT\nUP the towering facade of a forty-story apartment building.  A BLIMP\ndrifts lazily through distant clouds; the sounds of traffic echo\nfaint and dreamlike in the wind as we reach the penthouse -- where\nheavy curtains flutter behind the ragged matte of a SHATTERED\nPLATE-GLASS WINDOW.  SUPER TITLE:\n\nNEW YORK CITY - TEN YEARS LATER\n\n38. EXT. STREET BELOW - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA ramshackle NEWS KIOSK.  The OWNER, fat and stubbly, sits framed by\nthe garish covers of comic books and nudie mags, staring at the\nhigh-rise across the street.  THREE POLICE CARS -- oddly truncated\nbubble-shaped vehicles, recognizable from the flashing red beacons on\ntheir roofs -- sit on the curb amid a throng of ONLOOKERS.\n\nA CUSTOMER picks up a copy of the New York Gazette: \"NEW SKIRMISH ON\nAFGHAN BORDER.  RUSSKIES WALK OUT ON PEACE POWWOW.\"\n\nCUSTOMER\nCrazy reds don't know who they're messing with.\n(indicating the cop cars)\nWhat happened over there?\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nSome guy went sidewalk divin'  Twenny-five cents.\n\n39. EXT. HIGH-RISE - STREET LEVEL - NIGHT\nA riot of noise and color.  A plainclothes COP takes a statement from\nthe DOORMAN as PEDESTRIANS, clustered around an NYPD cordon, stare\nwith sickened expressions at a gruesome mess on the sidewalk.\n\nPATROLMAN\nSTAND BACK!  MOVE ALONG!\n\nWe are not in New York as we know it; in this strange offshoot of\nreality, everything -- the clothes, the cars, the very look of the\ncity -- seems just a touch off.  The PATROLMAN, for instance:\nhis standard-issue uniform consists of full riot gear, and his\nplastisteel breastplate is festooned with heavy artillery.  He clears\na path for a squad of PARAMEDICS, who load a bloody parcel into the\nback of a waiting ambulance.\n\nDET. LT. BURNS climbs out of his car, squeezes through the crowd and\nbuttonholes his colleague, HYDE, the cop in charge of the\ninvestigation.\n\nBURNS\nHad a lot of blood in him.\n\nHYDE\nYou oughta see upstairs.  It's a slaughterhouse.\n\nBURNS\nNo idea who's behind this?\n\nHYDE\nSmall army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.\n\nBURNS nods once and stares up toward the penthouse window.\n\nBURNS\nHe would -- You might as well know.  It's gonna get messy.  We got a\ncall from Washington.\n\nHYDE\nWashington?\n\nBURNS\nThey want in.  Seems our friend here was hardcore CTU.\n\nHYDE, suddenly wide-eyed at this new development, stares off after\nthe ambulance as it merges with the northbound traffic.\n\n40. EXT. STREET - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\n\nTIGHT ON a large placard: \"THE END IS NIGH.\"  The bearer of the sign,\na hunched STREET CRAZY in a ratty raincoat, plods up the sidewalk\nspreading his message of cheer; his back is to us, but we can make\nout an unruly shock of bright RED HAIR.\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR eyes him suspiciously as he passes, then turns up his\ncollar and looks pointedly away.  A SMALL BLACK KID, leaning against\nthe kiosk with a comic book, spots him too, and makes a quick,\ncross-eyed face.  The STREET CRAZY lets out a low, hissing GROWL in\nresponse and plugs on.\n\nAt the high-rise, a sanitation crew has just arrived to hose down the\nsidewalks; RIVULETS OF WATER crisscross the street.  As the STREET\nCRAZY wanders along,  he spots something unusual snagged in the rain\ngrate.\n\nIt's a HAPPY-FACE BUTTON.  A tiny diagonal fleck of BLOOD stains its\nsurface, like the hand of a clock poised at twelve minutes to\nmidnight.\n\nThe STREET CRAZY bends to retrieve it.  He stares off at the\nshattered window some forty stories above.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n41. INT. HIGH-RISE - HALLWAY - NIGHT\nCAMERA DRIFTS from the penthouse elevator down a long, plush-carpeted\ncorridor.  The hallway is cordoned with thin plastic strips reading\n\"POLICE LINE -- DO NOT CROSS.\"  At the far end is a single door,\nSEALED OFF.\n\n42. INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - NIGHT\nMOONLIGHT SHINES on an obstacle course of broken chairs and\noverturned tables as we move inexorably toward the shattered picture\nwindow.  At this altitude, the wind is fierce, and the curtains are\nflapping wildly.\n\nA ROPE drops into view.  A DARK SILHOUETTE lands on the ledge outside.\n\nSHARDS OF GLASS crunch underfoot as this strange INTRUDER steps\ninside.  He wears a slouch hat, a heavy trenchcoat; his face is\ninvisible to us as he snaps on a flashlight and sweeps it around the\nroom.\n\nThe apartment is, as promised, a slaughterhouse: smashed art prints,\ngaping holes in the wallboard, and gallons of BLOOD everywhere.  The\nflashlight beam shines on the front door, where THREE DEADBOLT LOCKS\nand an electronic alarm system are still in place, undisturbed.\n\nThe INTRUDER turns suddenly.  His beam strikes the splintered remains\nof a full-length WALL MIRROR -- and there, in the cracked and spiky\nglass, we get our first good look at his face.  Or what passes for\nhis face.\n\nHe has no eyes, no nose, no mouth, nothing but a strange and\never-shifting series of symmetrical patterns where his face should\nbe. . .a living, crawling inkblot on a luminescent field of white.\n\nWe've met him before.  He goes by the name of RORSCHACH.\n\n43. INT. PENTHOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH'S BEAM falls on the kitchen table.  HUNGRY FLIES walk\ndainty-legged through a sticky puddle of congealing blood.\nOffhandedly, he brushes the flies away; then he spots a SUGAR BOWL.\nHe tips it over, scoops up a handful of cubes, deposits them in his\ntrenchcoat pocket.\n\n44. INT. PENTHOUSE - BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nThe beam shines across rumpled bedclothes, searches around the walls,\nand settles finally on the half-open door to a walk-in closet.\nRORSCHACH steps inside, examines rack upon rack of expensive\nsuits.\n\nHe shoves the suits aside.  Then, mysteriously, he begins to POUND on\nthe wall with his fist, moving left, right, up, down: THUMP.  THUMP.\nTHUMP.\n\nHe pauses.  He's found a hollow section.  He feels his way carefully\nalong the seams of the wall and floorboard until he discovers a\nCONCEALED TRIGGER.  He presses it and a panel slides back, revealing\na SECOND, SECRET CLOSET, hidden inside the first.\n\nHe reaches up, flicks on a light.  Inside the secret closet: a\nbizarre UNIFORM -- helmet, mask and gloves, a gaudy-colored bodysuit,\nrows of exotic weaponry.  On the wall nearby hangs a dusty framed\nPHOTOGRAPH.\n\nRORSCHACH examines the photo.  It's a group shot, six men, one woman,\nall dressed in similarly garish uniforms.  The man in the center is\nwearing the costume on the wall before us. . .the COMEDIAN's\ncostume.\n\nThey're all there, all the Watchmen: NIGHT OWL.  SILK SPECTRE.  CAPT.\nMETROPOLIS.  DR. MANHATTAN.  ADRIAN VEIDT.  And of course, RORSCHACH\nhimself.  As he eyes this quirky memento of days gone by, we\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n45. EXT. STREET CORNER - BROOKLYN - NIGHT\nA LIGHT RAIN is falling as a weary figure emerges from a corner\nstore.  DANIEL DREIBERG, 44, thickset and bespectacled, walks with\nthe heavy gait of an athlete gone to seed.  He seems meek, defeated\n-- old before his time.\n\nHe holds a hand to the skies, sets down his grocery bags long enough\nto open an umbrella.  Then he turns down a deserted access street.\n\n46. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT\nIn an alleyway just off the access street, there's a MUGGING in\nprogress: two young street toughs, their tinted hair tied up in\nknot-tops, rolling a middle-aged man.  Across the street, DREIBERG\nsees what's happening; it takes some effort, but he makes a conscious\ndecision to move on.  Then --\n\nVOICE\nHold up, papa-san!\n\nThe KNOT-TOPS have emerged from the alleyway with their loot, and\nspotted DREIBERG -- an unwanted witness.  Menace in their eyes, they\nmarch toward him.  He sets his bags down and turns to face them,\nalmost welcoming the challenge; and suddenly, without warning, we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n47.

But whatever the\ngimmick, it should suggest that the events we're watching take place\nin a stylized dream-time, midway between flashback and fantasy.\n\nIt's out old friend NIGHT OWL, duking it out with a gang of HOODS in\nan alleyway not unlike the one we've just left.  There's a flurry of\nfists; the HOODS topple, in quick succession--\n\n-- and all at once a burst of BLINDING LIGHT BLEACHES OUT THE FRAME,\ntransporting us back to:\n\n48. EXT. ACCESS STREET - NIGHT\nReal-time again.  Our reverie's been interrupted by a SHAFT OF\nWHITE-HOT LIGHT sweeping across the street, past DREIBERG, toward the\nalley.\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nHALT!  DO NOT TRY TO RESIST --\n\nThe KNOT-TOPS run for it.  DREIBERG shields his eyes against the\nLIGHT -- which emanates from a POLICE HOVERCRAFT hanging in midair\nsome forty feet above his head.  The craft swoops off in pursuit of\nthe kids.\n\nDREIBERG bends to retrieve his things and crosses to the mouth of the\nalleyway.  He finds the old man slumped against a wall, obviously past\nhelp.\n\n49. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nTHREE DEADBOLT LOCKS slide back as DREIBERG lets himself in.  The\nsecurity system is almost as impressive as the one in the COMEDIAN's\napartment, but the decor is considerably less plush.\n\nDREIBERG sets his bags on the floor, removes his raincoat, and hangs\nit carefully in a closet.  Then he gathers his groceries, heads for\nthe kitchen -- and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS, confronted with a most\npeculiar sight:\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Rorschach.\n\n50. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\nLeaning back in a chair, his feet propped up on the kitchen table, is\nthe aforementioned RORSCHACH.  His inkblot mask is rolled partway up,\nexposing a mouthful of bad teeth, and he's calmly eating a plate of\nbaked beans.\n\nDREIBERG\nHow did you get in here?\n\nIgnoring the question, RORSCHACH greets him in a soft, rasping,\nutterly emotionless whisper:\n\nRORSCHACH\nHiya, pardner.  Long time no see.\n\nDREIBERG\nDid anybody follow you?  See you come here?\n\nDREIBERG is mildly panicked.  RORSCHACH -- who couldn't care less --\nemits his trademark hissing GROWL.  He spoons more beans from a can\nonto his plate, tops it all off with a generous squirt of ketchup\nfrom a squeeze bottle.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nI can't believe you're back on the streets.  Good God, man, you're\nwanted on fourteen counts of murder.\n\nRORSCHACH\nAt least six of those are trumped-up.  -- Here.\n\nHe reaches into his pocket, finds the HAPPY-FACE button, and flips it\nto DREIBERG.  DREIBERG eyes it for a moment, automatically uses his\nfingernail to scrape at the small red STAIN on its surface.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nLook familiar?\n\nDREIBERG\nSure.  You got some kind of -- bean juice on it.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHuman bean juice.\n(beat)\nThe Comedian is dead.\n\nDREIBERG stares down at the button, suddenly getting the picture.\nHis jaw goes slack.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nHad a real nice place -- penthouse suite, forty stories up --\nbeautiful view.\nHope he enjoyed it on the way down.\n\nDREIBERG\nJesus.  What.  A burglar . . . ?\n\nRORSCHACH snorts: the possibility is too comical to consider.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nWell, God, he'd been working with the CTU for almost a decade -- he\nmust've had enemies.\n\nRORSCHACH\nSo do I.  So do you.\n\nDREIBERG\nRorschach, that was a long time ago.  I mean, that -- that's just\nparanoia.\n\nRORSCHACH's head jerks violently at the sound of the word.  DREIBERG\nblinks involuntarily, half-expecting some kind of reprisal.  But\nRORSCHACH merely stands, adjusts his mask, and starts toward the\nfront door.\n\nRORSCHACH\nMaybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with\na grudge.\n(pause)\nThought you might want to spread the word.\n\nDREIBERG\nHey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?\n\nRORSCHACH growls, shakes his head in disgust -- but complies.  He\nopens the back door, pauses, turns to DREIBERG.\n\nRORSCHACH\nYou the sentimental type, Daniel?  -- Brought you a souvenir.\n\nHe reaches into his trenchcoat and hands DREIBERG the framed photo\nfrom the COMEDIAN's wall.  A moment later, he's gone.\n\nDREIBERG sits down, unnerved.  As he reaches for the wall phone,\nCAMERA ZEROES IN on a face from the photo: a blonde man, in a purple\ntunic and mask . . .\n\n51. INT. OFFICE SUITE - DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT\nA GREAT SHADOWY JUNGLE CAT pads across acres of carpet.  The cat is\nfar from its natural habitat; in back of it is a glass-and-chrome\ndesk outfitted with a computer terminal, and at the terminal is\nADRIAN VEIDT, the brains behind the Watchmen.  Although he's\nDREIBERG's age, his face is serene and unlined by worry.  Blond and\npale, he looks thirty.  When he's sixty he'll look forty.\n\nVEIDT -- millionaire industrialist, and holder of over forty basic\npatents -- is also something of an Egyptologist, and the decor of his\noffice reflects it: ancient vases sarcophagi, busts of Anubis, and the\nlike.  He keys a string of figures into the computer; the PHONE\nRINGS.\n\nVEIDT\nVeidt here.\n\n52. INTERCUT DREIBERG AND VEIDT\nDREIBERG\nAdrian?  Listen, it's Dreiberg.  I just had a visit from Rorschach.\nI had to call you before he --\n\nVEIDT\nDaniel, slow down.  What's this about Rorschach?\n\nDREIBERG\nThe Comedian.  He's dead.  Murdered.  That's all I know.\n\nVEIDT\nMy God.  Murdered?  -- What's this have to do with Rorschach?\n\nDREIBERG\nIt's -- he's got some kind of conspiracy theory.  He thinks someone's\n. . . I don't know, stalking us.\n\nVEIDT\nUs.  You mean the Watchmen.\n\nThe big CAT purrs; it's a mutant lynx, genetically tailored, with red\nfur and long, tufted, antenna-like ears.  VEIDT tosses the lynx a\nchunk of raw meat from a platter on his deak while he ponders\nDREIBERG's words.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nDaniel, Rorschach is insane.\n\nDREIBERG\nI know, I know, it's just -- he's back on the street, he smells\nblood.\n\nVEIDT\nYou know how he is.  He goes on these binges, kills a couple of thugs\n-- then he's satisfied.  It blows over.\n\nDREIBERG\nHe's bound to get caught.  I don't want my name coming out.  Not at\nthis late date.\n\nVEIDT\nIf he comes here, I'll handle him.  Remember -- I've always protected\nyou.  Haven't I?\n(slight pause)\nDo you need money?\n\nDREIBERG\nNo.  I just wanted you to --\n\nVEIDT\nYou did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good\nnight.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood night.\n\nVEIDT leans back in his chair, reaches for a gold case and extracts a\ncigarette.  It's \"matchless\"; you ignite it guy striking the tip of\nthe cigarette against the edge of the case.  He lights up and takes a\nlong, slow drag.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n53. EXT.  MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nBarbed wire, armed GUARDS everywhere.  A vehicle waits at the\ncheckpoint; the GUARDS wave it through, and a huge cast-iron GATE\nrolls into place behind it.  On the gate is a small, tasteful sign\nwhich reads \"ROCKEFELLER MILITARY RESEARCH CENTER.\"\n\n54. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nADRIAN VEIDT walks down a long, greenish corridor flanked by ARMED\nESCORT TROOPS.  At the end of the hallway is a foot-thick metal door\nwith a KEYPAD off to one side; one of the TROOPS punches in a\nsix-digit access code, and the door slides back to reveal . . .\n\n. . . another door, this one outfitted with a simple\ndoorbell.  The TROOPS ring the bell, stand rigidly at attention, and\nwait -- to VEIDT's great amusement.\n\nThe inner door slides open.  Peering out is an attractive, big-boned\nwoman in her mid-thirties: LAURIE JUSPECZYK -- aka the SILK\nSPECTRE.\n\nLAURIE\nAdrian.\n\nVEIDT\nLaurie!  Good to see you.\n\nShe gives him a warm hug.  The ESCORT TROOPS march back down the hall\nin perfect lockstep as the giant metal doors ease shut behind them.\n\nLAURIE escorts VEIDT into a huge laboratory space: great oversized\nmachines, blinking computer terminals, advanced scientific\nparaphernalia of every description.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nNice.  Who's your decorator -- Edward Teller?\n\nLAURIE\nDon't rub it in.  I live here.\n\nVEIDT\nAnd how's life with the walking H-bomb?\n\nLAURIE\nHe's in by the superaccelerator.  -- Let me take your coat.\n\nShe takes his coat and vanishes into the living quarters.  VEIDT\nwanders through the lab with an envious eye.  Suddenly he stops.  A\nSMILE crosses his face as he gazes up at the ceiling:\n\nVEIDT\nHi, Jon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (O.S.)\n(a deep, booming voice)\nHello, Adrian.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN -- Jon Osterman to his friends -- is a big guy under\nany circumstances, but at the moment he's downright gargantuan.\nForty feet tall, bright blue and buck naked, he's calmly adjusting a\ncalibration atop his particle accelerator.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nI think I'm about to detect a gluino.\n\nIn case you were wondering, this blue-skinned superman can do just\nabout anything.  He can manipulate matter effortlessly; the\nphysical universe is his plaything.  When it comes to the laws of\ntime and space, DR. MANHATTAN is a chronic offender.\n\nAny government would be glad to have him.\n\nVEIDT\nSupersymmetrical theory, hmm?  Say, I understand old Schwartzmann\ncaught a decaying proton in that German mineshaft . . .\n\nLAURIE, who's just reappeared, shakes her head and groans.\n\nLAURIE\nPlease, you guys, no shop talk.\n(to DR. MANHATTAN)\nJon, you're being rude.  Why don't you shrivel on down and join us?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN shrugs and shrinks down to a somewhat more manageable\nsix-foot-five.  A pair of BLACK TRUNKS materializes about his waist\n-- preserving his modesty.  Satisfied, LAURIE turns to VEIDT:\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nGood to see you, Adrian.  What's the occasion?\n\nHe tosses a casual glance around the lab.  A number of VIDEO\nSURVEILLANCE CAMERAS are mounted on the walls.\n\nVEIDT\n. . . Are we being monitored?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN looks at each of the cameras in turn.  One by one, the\nlittle red \"ON\" lights wink out.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe bearer of bad news.\n\nVEIDT\nWe've lost a colleague.  The Comedian is dead.\n\nLAURIE\nBlake?  Dead?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the\nfuneral as a matter of protocol.\n\nLAURIE shoots an irritated look at DR. MANHATTAN.  This is the first\nshe's heard about it.\n\nVEIDT\nRorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to\nthink that someone is \"stalking\" the Watchmen.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nOh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.\n\nVEIDT\nWhat's your theory?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nLife and death are unquantifiable abstracts.  They don't concern\nme.\n\nVEIDT peeks at LAURIE, cocks an eyebrow: same old Jon.  But LAURIE is\nconsiderably less amused.\n\nLAURIE\nI could use a drink.  How about you, Adrian?\n\nVEIDT nods yes.  DR. MANHATTAN, meanwhile, has moved off to another\npart of the lab.  He stands before a vast bank of machinery -- and as\nwe watch, a panel detaches itself from the front of the console and\nfloats off to one side.\n\nA module of circuit boards, chips, and pin connectors slides out of\nthe hole.  Individual components detach themselves and HANG in\nmidair.  DR. MANHATTAN hasn't lifted a finger; he's dismantling and\nreassembling his equipment through sheer force of mind.\n\nVEIDT has seen these parlor tricks before.  He ambles up and resumes\nthe conversation without missing a beat:\n\nVEIDT\nI guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYou mean Afghanistan?\n(beat)\nIt won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more\ninteresting.\n\nThe module, now fully reconstructed, slides back into place.  The\ncover panel rises off the floor, settles over the hatch, and screws\nitself shut.\n\nVEIDT\nWell . . . I wanted to bring you the news about Blake, but -- as\nusual -- I can't tell you anything you don't already know.  Goodbye,\nJon.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN nods -- just barely.  VEIDT heads for the door, finds\nhis coat where LAURIE put it.  He's just about to leave when she\narrives with two stiff drinks in hand.\n\nLAURIE\nAdrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --\n\nVEIDT\nI'll take a raincheck, Laurie.\n\nLAURIE\nPlease.\n\nThere's a note of desperation in her voice.  VEIDT glances over his\nshoulder at DR. MANHATTAN -- who's forty feet tall again, playing\nwith his superaccelerator.\n\nVEIDT\nHe's a little farther gone every time.\n\nLAURIE\nStay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to\nsomeone human.\n(beat)\nHe doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I\nmean -- he even scares the research teams.\n\nVEIDT\nLaurie -- he's the most powerful man who's ever lived.  He's changed\nthe world.\n\nLAURIE\n(embarrassed)\nI know.  I shouldn't be saying this.  He's happy, he's content, he's\ndoing his work --\n\nVEIDT\nWhat about you?\n\nLAURIE\nI suppose I'm serving my purpose, aren't I.\n(pause)\nI'll ring for the guards.\n\nShe goes to the steel door, hits a buzzer.  VEIDT watches her,\nconcerned.  She COUGHS, violently, and he reaches into his vest\npocket for a cigarette case:\n\nVEIDT\nNasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.\n(handing her a cigarette)\nDarling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give\nDaniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.\n\nLAURIE\nMaybe I'll do that.\n\nVEIDT\nI'm sorry about Blake.\n\nHe pats her on the shoulder.  The door slides open and the TROOPS\nappear to escort VEIDT back down the hallway.\n\nLAURIE takes a long pull on her drink and gazes up at her superhuman\nlover.  He tinkers with his equipment; then, satisfied, he turns and\nWALKS THROUGH A SOLID BRICK WALL -- as if it weren't there.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n55. EXT. HAPPY HARRY'S - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT\nA decrepit waterfront bar in a particularly rough neighborhood,\npopular with denizens of the underworld, accessible by a narrow\nstairway which dips well below street level.\n\n56. INT. HAPPY HARRY'S - NIGHT\nThe usual crowd, living it up.  HOOKERS line the bar.  DRUG DEALERS\nhover at the entrance to the men's room.  ASSORTED GOONS AND THUGS\nstand clustered at the pool table, watching a TOPLESS DANCER bump and\ngrind.  Suddenly there's a terrible RACKET, and everyone TURNS.\n\nOver by the entrance, RORSCHACH is hard at work ripping a PAY PHONE\noff the wall.  Once he has it on the floor, he gives it a couple of\nvicious licks with a crowbar; then he strides casually over to the\nbar -- where the proprietor, HAPPY HARRY, is nervously polishing\nglasses.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHarry.\n\nHARRY\n(petrified)\nR-Rorschach.\n\nRORSCHACH\nPhone's out of order.  Mind if I use yours?\n\nHe reaches under the counter, sets a phone on the bar.  RORSCHACH\npicks it up and FLINGS IT at a nearby table, scattering the PATRONS\nand yanking the cord cleanly out of the wall.\n\nHe turns and faces the assembled multitudes:\n\nRORSCHACH\nEdward Blake.  Friend of mine.  Fell through a window.  Might've had\nhelp.\n(wandering through the room)\nThought maybe you could fill me in.\n\nENORMOUS TOUGHS sit riveted to their chairs, staring up in horror as\nRORSCHACH strolls past.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nYou.  Gideon.  Whoremonger.  Nothing?\n(moving on)\nJohnny Gobs.  What's new at the schoolyard?\n\nBehind RORSCHACH's back, a shadowy figure is slinking furtively\ntoward the exit.  RORSCHACH pivots suddenly, grabs him by the collar,\nyanks him off his feet and slams him into a wall.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nNicky the Jap.  In a hurry?  You keeping secrets, Nicky?\n\nNICKY sits slumped against the wall, quaking with fear.  RORSCHACH\nextends a hand to help him up.  He reaches out hesitantly --\n\n-- and RORSCHACH grabs him by the wrist, pulling him off balance.  He\ncloses a gloved fist around NICKY's pinky finger, twists it back and\nSNAPS IT.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nEdward Blake.  Who killed him?\n\nNo answer forthcoming.  NICKY lets out a horrible moan as RORSCHACH\ngrabs his index finger and repeats the process.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nWho killed Edward Blake?\n\nNICKY passes out.  RORSCHACH releases his grip, lets NICKY sink to\nthe floor, and reaches for his crowbar.  He's standing poised to let\nfly at NICKY's ribs when a VOICE IN THE CROWD shouts out.\n\nVOICE\nJESUS!  HE'S IN SHOCK!!\n\nRORSCHACH\nTHE COMEDIAN.  WHO KILLED HIM?\n\nBy now HARRY's pulled a sawed-off shotgun from underneath the bar.\nWithout looking up, RORSCHACH spins and HEAVES THE CROWBAR.  It\ncatches HARRY in the jaw, pitching him back into a rack of\nglassware.  The SHOTGUN discharges TWO HARMLESS BLASTS into the\nceiling.\n\nSILENCE in the bar as the ONLOOKERS await RORSCHACH's next move.  He\nlooks at the bleeding HARRY, shakes his head in disgust:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nSo many vermin . . . so little time.\n\nHe bends, pulls a topcoat off NICKY's quivering frame, and tosses it\ncontemptuously at the NUDE DANCER.  Then he turns to go, pausing long\nenough to HISS at the crowd:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nGo back to your heroin and your child pornography.  I'll be\naround.\n\n\nCUT TO:\n\n57. INT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - LIVING QUARTERS - PRE-DAWN\nThe bedroom which LAURIE shares with DR. MANHATTAN at the Rockefeller\nresearch complex.  It's not quite six A.M., still dark outside, and\nLAURIE is asleep.  She tosses around under the covers, reaches over\nto where DR. MANHATTAN should be -- but his side of the bed is\nempty.\n\nLAURIE\n(muttering; groggy)\nJon . . . ?\n\nA LUMINOUS BLUE HAND enters frame, strokes her cheek gently.  LAURIE\ncloses her eyes and sighs.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm here, Laurie.\n\nLAURIE\nIs it time?  D'you have to leave for the funeral?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nNot yet, there's plenty of time.\n\nA SECOND BLUE HAND strokes her hair.  LAURIE stretches luxuriantly.\nDR. MANHATTAN kisses her softly on the throat.\n\nLAURIE\nMmm.  You feel so good.  Do you have to go?\n\nThe BLUE HAND runs down the length of LAURIE's shoulder and arm,\ntoward her hip.  She sighs dreamily.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWould you like me to stay?\n\nLAURIE\nMm hmm.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI could stay and go.\n\nLAURIE\n. . . And just how would you manage that?\n\nShe leans up to kiss him.  The SECOND BLUE HAND continues its\ndownward progress, almost colliding with a THIRD blue hand, which is\nmassaging LAURIE's thigh.\n\nThird blue hand?  Wait a minute.  LAURIE's eyes go suddenly\nwide.  She sits bolt upright in bed.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN is stretched out beside her.  He is also sitting at the\nfoot of the bed.  There seem to be two of him.\n\nLAURIE\nAAAAAAAAAA!!\n\nDR. MANHATTAN I\nLaurie?  Are you --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN II\nDon't be upset.\n\nThis unique menage a trois proves a bit much for LAURIE's\nfragile nerves.  She climbs angrily out of bed and reaches for a\ndressing gown.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, please.  I don't enjoy these tricks.  Just -- be one\nperson again, please?\n\nThe big blue twins stand up, spreading their hands in identical\ngestures of apology as LAURIE stalks past.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN I\nLaurie, I did it to please you.  I thought --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN II\n-- you would find it erotic.\n\nLAURIE\nAll right, all right.  It's just -- my nerves, I'm going stir-crazy\nin this place, I --\n\nWhile fumbling in her purse for a cigarette, LAURIE happens to glance\nthrough a doorway, into the lab outside.  To her utter astonishment,\nshe sees a THIRD DR. MANHATTAN out there, calmly running an\nexperiment on one of his oversized toys.  She marches angrily through\nthe door . . .\n\n58. INT. LAB - A MOMENT LATER\n. . . to confront DR. MANHATTAN number three:\n\nLAURIE\nYou've been out here all along, haven't you?  Running one of your\nstupid experiments --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN III\nYes, I thought I could finish up before I leave for Washington.\n\nLAURIE\nSo you sent your, your proxies in there to -- Jon, really, how\ncould you do this?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN III\nYou seem to feel I've been neglecting you.  Isn't that the case?\n(pause)\nI thought I'd solved the problem quite elegantly.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's all it is to you, isn't it?  Just another problem you\ncan --\n\nShe doesn't see the other two DR. MANHATTANS, who have just entered\nthe room behind her.  They speak in perfect unison:\n\nDR. MANHATTANS I & II\nLaurie, please --\n\nLAURIE pivots, lets out a little squeal of shock.  She turns back\nslowly, steadies herself on a lab table.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- just go to Washington, all right?  And take them with you.  I\ncould really use the time alone.\n\nShe storms back into the living quarters, past DR. MANHATTANS I &\nII -- who pop out of existence as soon as she passes.  The original\nDR. MANHATTAN cocks an eyebrow, sighs, and returns to his\nequipment.\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n1. INT. ROOFTOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nA pricey joint in midtown.  DREIBERG and LAURIE, well-fed, are hard\nat work on their second bottle of wine.  She looks amazingly\nbeautiful in full makeup and low-cut evening gown -- but it's largely\nwasted on her preoccupied date.\n\nAt the moment, she's filling him in on life with Dr. Manhattan:\n\nLAURIE\nThe government's really worried.  He gets so flaky sometimes.  I\nguess it's no picnic being the world's only superhuman.\n(mock-macho)\nI have to keep him in line.\n\nShe flexes her bicep and holds the pose, waiting for DREIBERG to\nlaugh.  He doesn't.  In fact, he barely even notices; his gaze has\nwandered off into a far corner of the room.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nExcuse me -- where exactly are you tonight?\n\nDREIBERG\nSorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think\nanyone's out to get us -- do you?\n\nLAURIE\nDan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no\nMother Teresa.\n\nDREIBERG\nPsychotic pig.  He had it coming.  Mr. CTU . . .\n\nLAURIE\nNow wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the\ngovernment or do time.\n\nDREIBERG\nFine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty\ntricks -- political assassinations --\n\nNow he's got LAURIE nervous.  She scans the restaurant quickly, then\nleans forward and speaks, in hushed tones:\n\nLAURIE\nOkay, okay.  You made your choice.  You went underground.  Some of us\nmade other choices.\n\nDREIBERG\n(shaking his head in disgust)\n\nYeah.  That pig Blake gets buried at Arlington, full military honors\n. . . and I'm still in the psycho file with Rorschach.\n\nLAURIE looks at him a moment.  She starts to chuckle.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nWhat's so funny?  Have I got food in my teeth?\n\nLAURIE\nI'm just wondering what you would've said ten years ago if you could\nsee yourself right now.\n(raising her glass)\nWell, here's to the Comedian.  'Cause the fact is, he's dead . . .\nand we're not.\n\nDREIBERG makes a face -- and smiles despite himself.\n\n1. EXT. ROOFTOP OUTSIDE RESTAURANT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE have repaired to the romantic rooftop terrace,\nwhich overlooks the Manhattan skyline.  They're holding big snifters\nof brandy, and they're both pretty well drunk.\n\nDREIBERG\nThe pisser is, nobody ever remembers all the good shit we did.  I\nmean, we were heroes!\n\nLAURIE\nDamn straight.\n\nDREIBERG\nDamn straight!  We were heroes.\n\nLAURIE\nOf course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.\n\nDREIBERG\nWell, that was Adrian's idea.  I know he's the smartest man in the\nworld and all that, but -- talk about publicity hounds . . .\n\nLAURIE\n(smiling)\nHey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma?\nWhat was his name . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nOh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd\nbeat him up?\n\nLAURIE\nThat's the one.  Whatever happened to him?\n\nDREIBERG\n(deadpan)\nHe pulled it on Rorschach . . . and Rorschach dropped him down an\nelevator shaft.\n\nLAURIE looks aghast for a second and a half.  Then her hand goes to\nher mouth -- and like DREIBERG she's GIGGLING helplessly.  CAMERA\nPULLS UP AND AWAY, isolating them on the rooftop, and we hear a\nstentorian VOICE over scene:\n\nCHAPLAIN (V.O.)\nIn the midst of life we are in death . . .\n\nCUT TO:\n\n59. EXT. ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - DAY\nAN AMERICAN FLAG lies across the coffin of Edward Blake.\n\nCHAPLAIN\n. . . and so we commend our brother Edward Blake unto God, who shall\nchange our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body --\n\nTIGHT ON DR. MANHATTAN, standing at graveside amid a tight know of\nmourners.  There's no weeping, no gnashing of teeth;  most of the\nattendees are bureaucrats or military men, obviously here for reasons\nof protocol.  Nearby is a cadre of riflemen, ready to send Blake off\nwith the traditional twenty-one gun salute.\n\nCHAPLAIN (cont.)\n-- according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all\nthings unto himself.\n\nA light rain begins to fall; umbrellas open all around.  DR.\nMANHATTAN, of course, doesn't need one -- the raindrops vanish\nmiraculously before they strike him.  CAR HORNS sound in the\ndistance, and he glances off at:\n\n60. EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CEMETERY - THAT MOMENT\nSENTRIES stand at attention.  They've blocked off the part of the\ncemetery where the funeral is taking place, but the good Doctor has\nbeen spotted nonetheless, and word of his presence is spreading like\nwildfire.\n\nMOURNERS and TOURISTS are rushing in from every corner of the\ncemetery to get a look at the bright blue superman.  With all due\nrespect for the dead, Arlington National's turning into a zoo:\ngawkers are lined up three or four deep.  The sentries have their\nhands full managing the crowd.\n\nA KID breaks free from his parents and sprints across the graves to\njoin the excited throng.  As he does, our attention settles on the\nVIETNAM WAR MEMORIAL.\n\nIt's not the familiar stark black wall.  It is, bizarrely, a chiseled\nmarble representation of DR. MANHATTAN; his eyes are turned skyward,\nand he's cradling a WOUNDED AMERICAN GRUNT in his massive arms,\nPieta-style.  On the pedestal beneath it, a bronze\nplaque bears the inscription:\n\nIN MEMORY OF THE BRAVE AMERICANS\nWHO GAVE THEIR LIVES\nTO ACHIEVE VICTORY IN VIETNAM\n\nBelow it are the names of the American dead.  There are almost four\nhundred of them.\n\n61. EXT. MILITARY INSTALLATION - NIGHT\nThe Rockefeller Military Research Center -- LAURIE's home sweet\nhome.  Her car pulls up to the guard's booth and he waves her\nthrough.  As soon as the chain-link gate rolls back into place behind\nher, the GUARD picks up a phone and punches in a number.\n\n62. EXT. RESEARCH CENTER - NIGHT\nLAURIE strides up a concrete walkway at the entrance to the complex,\nfumbling in her purse for a mag-striped ACCESS CARD.  She inserts the\ncard into a slot at the door.  Nothing happens.\n\nShe tries again.  Still no luck.  Just then, a long black car pulls\nup behind her -- and a uniformed officer, MAJOR ADAMSON, steps\nout.\n\nLAURIE\nMajor Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.\n\nADAMSON\nLaurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.\n\nLAURIE\nWhy?  What's the problem?\n\nADAMSON\nI can't tell you that.  It is quite urgent.\n\nLAURIE\n(chuckling)\nI would like to use the bathroom --\n\nAs she speaks, TWO ARMED GUARDS come marching up the walkway.\n\nADAMSON\nThe access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat?!\n\nADAMSON\nPlease.\n\nThe major puts a firm hand on her elbow and leads her off.  The\nGUARDS stand at attention, then fall in behind them as they pass.\n\nADAMSON holds the car door open.  LAURIE's climbing inside when she\nsees something which turns her confusion into outright panic.\n\nThe entrance to the research center has just opened -- and emerging\nfrom it, onto the walkway, are a half-dozen men in FULL RADIATION\nSUITS.\n\n63. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT\nLAURIE enters with full military escort.  The troops hand her off to\na team of DOCTORS and LAB TECHNICIANS, then drop back to stand guard\nat the door.  A brusque NURSE presents her with a short white\ngown:\n\nNURSE\nMiss Juspeczyk.  Put this on, if you would.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat -- ?\n\nDOCTOR\nDrink this.\n\nThe DOCTOR hands LAURIE a glass full of iridescent green fluid.  She\nstares at it, still somewhat nonplussed.\n\nDOCTOR\nDrink it.\n\n64. INT. MEDICAL LAB - ANTEROOM - NIGHT\nTECHNICIANS monitor a series of computer screens.  On the screens are\nshifting, multicolored GRAPHICS PATTERNS representing the interior of\na human body as seen from a variety of angles.  A leaded window opens\non:\n\n65. INT. MEDICAL LAB - NIGHT\nWe're watching what looks like an electronic sarcophagus.  A\ndonut-shaped housing traverses its length repeatedly, head to foot,\nfoot to head, sending a three-dimensional readout telemetrically to\nthe anteroom.\n\nThrough a glass panel in the sarcophagus we see LAURIE, he head\nwedged into a fixed metal brace, eyes darting fitfully left and right\nas she wonders just what the hell is going on.\n\n66. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT\nA MAN'S HAND slides a photograph across a table.\n\nLAURIE (O.S.)\nThat's Col. Brent Dabbs.  Jon's military liaison.\n\nLAURIE, still dressed in the white gown, is seated at a table\nsurrounded by GOVERNMENT AGENTS in three-piece suits.  Chief Agent\nSCHMIDT nods at his cronies and replaces the photo with another taken\nfrom a thick sheaf.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nDr. Candelaria.  He works on one of Jon's research teams.  The\nquantum-whatever.\n\nSCHMIDT lays a third photo before her.  It's a group shot of the\nWatchmen -- the same picture that hung in BLAKE's closet.  LAURIE\nhesitates.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nThat's Jon.  Obviously.  And me.  Adrian Veidt.\n(long pause)\nRorschach . . .\n\nSCHMIDT\nTheir real names, please.\n\nLAURIE\nI don't know their real names.\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're lying, Miss Juspeczyk.\n\nLAURIE\nI don't know their real names!\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're not \"protecting\" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on\nthe answers you give.\n(holding up the sheaf of photos)\nThese are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --\n\nLAURIE\nThen why don't you ask him?!?\n\nFurious, she pushes herself away from the table and moves to a nearby\nwindow.  The AGENTS exhange cool glances.  Like all experienced\ntorturers, they understand the value of patience.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nI want to get dressed.  -- And I'd like a cigarette.\n\nOne of the AGENTS pulls a pack from his coat, shakes a cigarette out\nfor LAURIE.  As he's lighting it -- a perfect gentleman -- the door\nopens and a LAB TECHNICIAN enters with a clipboard.\n\nHe passes the clipboard to SCHMIDT, who examines its contents -- and\ntilts an eyebrow.  LAURIE, looking on, is about to burst with\ncuriosity:\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nSomeone had better tell me what's going on here!\n\nSCHMIDT\nSit down, Miss Juspeczyk.  As I mentioned, the people in this file\nare all close associates of Dr. Manhattan.  They have something else\nin common as well.\n(beat)\nThey've all developed a fairly . . . exotic form of lymphatic cancer.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat are you saying?  That Jon is radioactive?\n\nAll at once, the obvious hits home -- and LAURIE's face goes\nbone-white.  SCHMIDT nudges the clipboard toward her.  Trembling, she\ntakes it. . .then sets it down, staggered by what she's read.\n\nSCHMIDT\nI'm terribly sorry.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat does this mean?  What does it --\n\nSCHMIDT\nSix to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can\nsee why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible\njoke to make me --\n\nShe scans the room.  No one's laughing.  SCHMIDT gets up, signals to\nhis comrades, and heads for the door.\n\nSCHMIDT\nTake a day or two.  If you \"remember\" any names . . . do give us a\ncall.\n\nThe AGENTS leave, and LAURIE sits alone in the office.  She reaches\nfor the clipboard and takes another long hard look.  Then, quaking,\nshe buries her face in her hands.\n\n67. INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nA darkened room just off the office; LAURIE is visible through a\ntwo-way mirror.  The door opens, and MAJOR ADAMSON -- who's been\nwatching all along -- is joined by SCHMIDT.\n\nADAMSON\nPoor kid.\n\nSCHMIDT\nWe'll keep her in isolation awhile.  She'll give us some names.\n\nADAMSON\nTo hell with those costumed idiots.  I'm worried about Doc\nManhattan.\n\nSCHMIDT\nWhat do you mean?\n\nADAMSON\nShe's his last link to humanity.  Once she's gone . . . God knows\nwhich way he'll jump.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n68. INT. HOTEL ROOM - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY\nDR. MANHATTAN stands in front of a full-length mirror.  He's wearing\na navy-blue double-breasted suit, a white shirt, and a maroon necktie\nwith an irregular mauve pattern.\n\nThe tie doesn't quite suit him.  His brow wrinkles, and the tie\nmagically transmutes into a more sedate wide-red job with diagonal\ngold stripes.\n\nToo staid.  DR. MANHATTAN frowns, and the tie transforms itself into\na handsome royal-blue number with tiny hydrogen atoms for\ndecoration.\n\nIt does nice things for his complexion.  Satisfied, he turns from the\nmirror, starts for the door, and DEMATERIALIZES.\n\n69. INT. TELEVISION STUDIOS - DAY\nTECHNICIANS running to and fro.  A harried DIRECTOR checks the green\nroom, where the STAFF is beginning to panic.\n\nDIRECTOR\nWe're on the air in five minutes.  Where the hell is\nthat big blue son of a --\n\nHe stops, wisely, in mid-sentence.  DR. MANHATTAN has just\nrematerialized inside the studio, two feet from the DIRECTOR's\nface.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm sorry.  Am I late?\n\nDIRECTOR\nNo problem.  We'll have to head straight for the set.  -- Oh, I'm\nKent Turner, the director. . .\n\nThe DIRECTOR shakes DR. MANHATTAN's hand and marches him down a\nhallway.  Within seconds they're joined by a GOVERNMENT LIAISON.\n\nLIAISON\nDr. Osterman.  I've got a list of taboo areas here we'd like you to\nsteer clear of.  Obviously, Afghanistan will come up, but if you'll\njust play it cool --\n\nDIRECTOR\nDoc, that blue of yours tends to wash out on camera.  Could you give\nus something a little darker . . . ?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN pauses briefly.  His skin tone darkens two shades.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWill this do?\n\nDIRECTOR\nPerfect.\n\nLIAISON\nNow Doc, please -- on this Afghanistan thing --\n\nBut the good doctor is already at the edge of the set, surrounded by\na cluster of SOUND MEN, PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS, etc., who are\nhurriedly prepping him for the telecast.  The frustrated LIAISON\nhangs back and glances up at an OVERHEAD MONITOR.  The \"ABC NEWS\nSPECIAL REPORT\" graphic is already onscreen, with THEME MUSIC\nunderneath.\n\n70. INSERT - TV MONITOR\nStock footage.  We open on a shot of terrified Viet Cong racing for\ntheir lives through a dense jungle; the camera WHIP PANS to the right\nand takes in an extraordinary sight.\n\nA towering, ninety-foot tall DR. MANHATTAN strides blithely through\nthe jungle, occasionally directing a blast from his fingertips at the\ngreenery below.  AMERICAN HUEYS hover behind him, spitting out bursts\nof automatic fire, performing mop-up duty as this one-man defoliation\ncrew does his apocalypse thing.  A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads:\n\"VIETNAM.  1965.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O.)\nDr. Manhattan: the nuclear titan spawned in a freak scientific\nmishap.  For more than twenty years the \"Manhattan Option\" has been\nthe linchpin of America's conventional strategy --\n\nWe CUT to PRAGUE, where RUSSIAN TANKS are rolling through a broad\nthoroughfare.  DR. MANHATTAN, only forty feet tall this time, rounds\na corner and emerges from behind a municipal building.\n\nHis EYES gleam eerily, and the lead tank begins to HEAT UP, the grey\ngunmetal turning red before our eyes.  The hatch springs open, STEAM\nhisses, and TERRIFIED RUSSIAN SOLDIERS clamber out -- only to be met\nwith a barrage of ROCKS thrown by the local citizenry.  Title reads:\n\"CZECHOSLOVAKIA.  1968.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)\n-- in trouble spots from Vietnam to Czechoslovakia to Nicaragua: a\none-man cavalry coming to the aid of our democratic allies, holding\nthe Communist menace in check.\n\nDANIEL ORTEGA, in Sandinista drabs, sits at a table across from\nAmerican Secretary of State G. Gordon Liddy.  The two men shake\nhands, hold up a signed treaty for the camera.  DR. MANHATTAN, in a\nthree-piece suit, stands behind them, presiding over this historic\naccord.  Title: \"NICARAGUA.  1979.\"\n\nANNOUNCER (V.O., cont.)\nIn the famous words of General William Westmoreland, \"Yes, Virginia,\nthere is a Superman -- and thank God, he's American.\"\n\n71. INT. SOUNDSTAGE - A MOMENT LATER - DAY\nA sparse, businesslike talk-show set: two chairs, a table, a backdrop\nof the Washington monument, and a gallery full of MEDIA PEOPLE.  Jaded\nnews vet DAVID BRINKLEY is manning the host's chair:\n\nBRINKLEY\nFor this live question-and-answer session we'll be joined by\ncorrespondents from all three networks.  But since I am moderating,\nI'll ask you to keep your questions short and snappy.\n(turning)\nNow let's welcome our special guest, Jonathan Osterman . . . better\nknown to the world as Dr. Manhattan.\n\nApplause from the crowd.  ANGLE WIDENS to include Doctor M, seated at\nBRINKLEY's right.  He nods in acknowledgement.\n\nBRINKLEY (cont.)\nI suppose the topic on everyone's mind this week is Afghanistan,\nwhere Russian tanks appear to be poised for a massive invasion.  Now\nsince you've dealt successfully with similar situations in the past .\n. . I'll ask you point-blank: has the administration requested that\nyou intervene?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI will not intervene in Afghanistan.\n\nA HUBBUB goes up among the crowd.\n\n72. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\nLooking on from offstage.  He rolls his eyes in frustration.\n\n73. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN\nHANDS are already shooting up among the NEWSMEN in the audience.\nBRINKLEY ignores them:\n\nBRINKLEY\nYou're saying you would refuse a direct request?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThere will be no request.  I will not intervene.\n\nBRINKLEY\nWell, Doctor, it's widely understood, or rumored, that you can\nactually see the future.  Does you answer indicate that the\nhostilities in Afghanistan will blow over?\n\n74. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\nHe's steamed, but like everyone else in the studio he's hanging on\nDR. MANHATTAN's every word.  He turns apprehensively to a COLLEAGUE\nin the shadows behind him -- and snaps his fingers once:\n\nLIAISON\nI want a phone line to the booth.  Now.\n\n75. ANGLE ON BRINKLEY AND DR. MANHATTAN\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI see the future only as it relates to me.  I have no control over it.\n(long pause)\nI can only repeat . . . that there will be no request. . .and I will\nnot intervene.\n\nHe sits there like a big blue Buddha.  BRINKLEY shrugs and presses on.\n\nBRINKLEY\nWell, then -- I hope we can take that as an optimistic sign.  I'll\nopen up the floor to questions now.  Doug?\n\nREPORTER\nDr. Osterman, I'm Doug Roth of Nova Express.  I'd like to read\nyou some names:  Col. Brent Dabbs, Dr. J. M. Candelaria, Wallace M.\nWeaver . . . do these names have any meaning to you?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nAll friends, yes.  Associates of mine.\n\nROTH\nLet me go on.  Stephanie Boris, William Charles Batts, Susan White.\nAre you aware that these \"friends\" and \"associates\" of yours have all\nbeen diagnosed with terminal cancer?\n\nThe CROWD NOISE begins to build.  Even BRINKLEY's taken aback.  He\ngapes at DR. MANHATTAN -- who sits there silently, his inhuman face\nan unreadable mask.\n\n76. ANGLE ON MILITARY LIAISON\neyes wide, hand cupped over the in-house telephone\n\nLIAISON\nOh Jesus.\n(barking into phone)\nI want this broadcast killed.  I'll run out on that goddamn set if I\nhave to!\n\n77. ANGLE ON SET - BRINKLEY, ROTH, DR. MANHATTAN\nROTH\nI have here an official list of sixteen names, all similarly\ndiagnosed.  Now, for the record, Doctor -- is there a\nconnection?\n\nBy now, the crowd is about to erupt -- ROTH is shouting to make\nhimself heard over the din.  BRINKLEY, who's just gotten a message\nfrom the booth, touches his headset and announces:\n\nBRINKLEY\nI'm told it's time for a break.  We'll be back after this brief\nmessage --\n\nWithin seconds the MILITARY LIAISON has rushed out onto the set,\nflanked by two COLLEAGUES in mirrorshades.\n\nLIAISON\nTHAT DOES IT!  NO MORE QUESTIONS!  SHOW'S OVER!!\n\nThe three of them all but yank DR. MANHATTAN out of his seat.  Then,\nPANDEMONIUM breaks loose as eager NEWSMEN bolt the gallery and MOB\nTHE SET.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nDr. Manhattan!  Are these allegations true?  Do you cause\ncancer??\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't wish to answer any questions.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nYou see the future!  Did you know in advance --\n\nLIAISON\nThe Doctor will not answer your questions.  Now STEP\nASIDE!!\n\nThe LIAISON and his boys form a wedge in front of DR. MANHATTAN, but\nthe mass of bodies and microphones is all but impenetrable.\n\nRANDOM NEWSMEN\nHow long have you known -- why is the government concealing this\ninformation --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nPlease get out of my way.\n\nThe LIAISON throws an elbow, knocking a REPORTER to the floor.\nSCUFFLING breaks out.  Just as it's getting vicious, DR. MANHATTAN\nlets out a THUNDEROUS SHOUT:\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI said LEAVE ME ALONE!!\n\nIn the wink of an eye, the soundstage is EMPTY -- no newsmen, no\nmicrophones, no cameras -- nothing but the lone figure of DR.\nMANHATTAN and, still sitting in the chair behind him, BRINKLEY.\n\nBRINKLEY swallows hard and fidgets with his necktie.  A moment later,\nthere's an ANGRY FLASH of WHITE LIGHT -- and DR. MANHATTAN VANISHES,\nleaving BRINKLEY alone on the deserted set.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n78. INT. RESEARCH CENTER - LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT\nThe place has been pretty well torn apart; MAJOR ADAMSON is\noverseeing a crew of technicians in white suits as they post\nquarantine notices at the entrances.  He's not altogether surprised\nwhen DR. MANHATTAN rematerializes at his side.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWhere's Laurie?\n\nADAMSON backs off slightly.  He's not wearing a radiation suit, and\nhe's understandably reluctant to get any closer than absolutely\nnecessary.\n\nADAMSON\nShe's been relocated, Jon.  It's strictly precautionary . . .\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThere's no need to lie.  I assume she's been tested.  Were the\nresults positive?\n\nADAMSON hesitates the briefest of seconds.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nDon't bother.  I already know what you'll say.\n\nHe watches impassively as what's left of his home is dismantled.  His\nmind is already a million miles away.\n\nADAMSON\nJon, I know this is presumptuous, but . . . if you wanted to . . .\ncould you cure her?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't know.  I only know that I won't.\n(long pause)\nThere'd be no point.  It's finally begun.\n\nADAMSON\n\"Begun?\"  What's begun?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI've seen this day.  It's the day I've been dreading all these years.\n(pause)\nYou see, Major Adamson, Laurie Juspeczyk was the only human being I\ncared for . . .\n\nADAMSON doesn't know what he's talking about, but a chill runs down\nhis spine nonetheless.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMy work here is finished.  God be with you, Major.\n\nAnd with that, he VANISHES.  His double-breasted suit he leaves\nbehind; it hangs in midair for a moment, then crumples into a pile at\nthe Major's feet.\n\nADAMSON\nGood Lord --\n\nCUT TO:\n\n79. EXT. OUTER SPACE\n-- and it's about as exterior as you can get.  We're a few\nhundred miles above Earth; the curvature of the globe is readily\napparent from this height, and the surface looks placid and eerily\nbeautiful\n-- oceans and continents overlaid by a pattern of shifting white\nclouds.  From frame right, a BLUE FIGURE swings into view, eclipsing\nour planetary vista and disappearing again off frame left.\n\nIt's DR. MANHATTAN.  He's in a lotus position, sitting on\nnothingness, calmly scanning the globe from his orbital vantage.\nStars twinkle behind him as he looks down on the planet he's about to\nleave, his normally-inscrutable features tinged with regret.\n\n80. EXT. ARIZONA DESERT - NIGHT\nBlack sky hangs over an empty stretch of desert -- so desolate, so\nbarren and otherworldly that it could pass for Mars.  Could, that is,\nuntil we see the residue of man's presence on the landscape: ruined\nquonset huts, roofless, long since abandoned to the elements,\nhalf-buried in drifts of sand; military vehicles, little more than\nhusks now, rusty and gutted; and a sign, dangling awkwardly from a\nrotted upright -- GILA FLATS TEST BASE.\n\nA gecko skitters across the sand and pauses.  Above it, a sudden\nRUPTURE appears in the night sky, bathing the sands in blinding blue\nlight.  The gecko runs wildly as DR. MANHATTAN steps through the rift\nin the sky and descends gently to earth.\n\nThe rupture heals itself, and the desert is dark and peaceful once\nmore as DR. MANHATTAN trudges through the sands toward the ghost town\nof Gila Flats.  He wanders through the ravaged doorway of what was\nonce a canteen: tables are overturned, bottles broken, but the long\nmahogany bar, though pitted and scarred, stands intact.\n\nA desert rat scurries down its length as DR. MANHATTAN looks on.  We\nMOVE IN on his emotionless glowing EYES and\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n81. INT. CANTEEN (FLASHBACK) - DAY\nIt's twenty-odd years ago, and we're looking at DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN\n-- a big, boyish, clean-cut guy of twenty-six, dressed in a necktie\nand a white lab coat.  He's at a table sipping a mug of beer, wearing\na dopey smile as he gazes out of frame at his lunch companion:\n\nJANEY SLATER (O.S.)\nNineteen million for the intrinsic field disruptor.  You'd think they\ncould at least make us a decent hamburger.\n\nJON laughs, looks sheepishly down at his hands.  He's utterly smitten\nwith DR. JANEY SLATER, his colleague at the test base; she's a couple\nof years older than he, and pretty, in a heavily-coiffed way -- just\nclose enough to LAURIE that you'd notice the resemblance.  And she's\nprobably the only one in the room who can't see just how bad a crush\nJON has on her.\n\nJON\nI'll say.  If we ever get off this looney-tune project, I'm gonna\nhead straight for civilization and buy me a big thick steak.\n\nJANEY\nWith lots of ketchup?\n\nSmiling, she indicates JON's plate.  He's emptied at least half a\nbottle on his french fries.\n\nJON\nNothing wrong with ketchup.\n\nJANEY\nJon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug\nlike you doing in a place like this?\n\nJON\nAnything for science, I guess.\n(long, hesitant pause)\nJaney, there's something --\n\nJANEY\n(simultaneously)\nWe should get back --\n(realizing she's cut him off)\nWhat?\n\nJON\nNothing.  What were you going to say?\n\nJANEY\nWe should get back to the lab.\n(staring at him; chuckling)\nYou okay, Jon?\n\nHe stares at his hands, afraid to meet her eyes.  After a moment he\npipes up:\n\nJON\nOh, yeah.  You go ahead.  I'll be right behind you.\n\nThe lad seems a little screwy today.  JANEY shrugs, gets up and heads\nfor the door.  JON takes a moment to collect himself, then looks after\nJANEY.  She's paused in the doorway to unbuckle her wristwatch.\n\nHis face goes a little pale.  He screws up his courage, rushes up\nbehind her.\n\nJANEY\nStupid watch.  Stopped again.  Do you have the --\n\nJON\n(blurting it out)\nJaney, will you marry me?\n\nShe turns and looks him squarely in the face.  He's wearing the\npained expression of a convicted murderer waiting to hear the\nverdict.\n\nJANEY\nJon -- what?\n\nJON swallows hard, and the two of them stare at each other, eyes\nlocked.  For a moment it's as if they're the only souls in the\ncanteen.  But just then two SCIENTISTS come bustling through the\ndoor, clipboards in hand, deep in a conversation of their own; and\none of them -- DR. WALLY WEAVER -- walks smack into the startled\nJANEY, causing her to drop her wristwatch.\n\nThere's a loud CRUNCH.  JON and JANEY snap out of their private\ntrance as WALLY bends to retrieve the watch.\n\nWALLY\nChrist, Janey, I think I stepped on your watch.\n\nJANEY\nOh Wally, don't feel bad.  It was cheap, it never worked anyway --\n\nJON\nI can fix it.\n\nJANEY\n-- What?\n\nJON\nMy dad's a watchmaker.  I'll put it back together for you.  Better\nthan ever.\n\nHe holds out his hand.  Their eyes meet for a long moment.\n\nWALLY\nTake him up on it.  It'd make me feel better.\n\nChuckling, WALLY and his colleague head off to find a table.  JANEY\nhands JON the watch; his hands close around her, and he gazes at her\nwith basset-hound eyes.  She realizes he's still waiting for his\nanswer.\n\nBut before she can speak, JON produces a small BOX from his pocket.\nHe thrusts it abruptly into JANEY's hands --\n\nJON\nHere.  I'll trade you.\n\n-- and hustles off.  She opens the box, finds an ENGAGEMENT RING.\nWith a little smile she tries it on, and turns to show JON -- but\nhe's already gone.\n\nShe stares at the ring.  Her smile broadens.\n\n82. INT. LABORATORY - DAY\nJON's at a lab table, papers stacked all around him.  In the center\nof the table is a piece of black velvet strewn with JEWELER'S\nTOOLS.\n\nIt's his lunch hour, and he's fixing JANEY's watch.  He tightens the\ncentral screw which holds the hands in place, then fits the crystal\ninto its housing and gives it a light tap.\n\nWith a big, childlike grin of satisfaction -- the boy's in love,\nremember -- he gets up and starts for the door.  The lab is jammed\nwith oversized, arcane machinery; the centerpiece is a concrete TEST\nCHAMBER with two-foot-thick metal walls.  Mounted on either side of\nit are PARTICLE CANNONS -- great bulky devices which look like\nanti-aircraft guns encircled by huge plexiglass coils.\n\nHe stops, spots his lab coat hanging on a peg in the corner, and\nwalks over to grab it.  As he's putting it on, he hears a tiny SQUEAK\nfrom the direction of the test chamber.\n\nMounted above the chamber is a DIGITAL CLOCK -- hours, minutes,\nseconds, tenths of seconds.  Just now it's 13:58 and change.  JON\neyes the clock, hesitates briefly, then grabs a broom and steps to\nthe reinforced steel door of the chamber.\n\nInside, the chamber is empty but for a concrete block mounted on a\nlow platform -- and a MOUSE, which scurries into the corner when it\nhears JON coming.  He steps inside, sets JANEY's watch on the\nconcrete block, and swings the broom at the mouse.\n\nJON\nC'mon, little guy, outta here . . .\n\nThe mouse legs it out the door.  JON follows, smiling, broom in\nhand.\n\nJON (cont.)\n. . . don't wanna screw up a million-dollar experiment.\n\nHe stops.  Feels around in his pocket.  Realizes he's left the watch\ninside.\n\nHe looks at the overhead clock again -- 13:59:30 and counting.\nAgitated now, he races back toward the chamber, pauses in the\ndoorway, spots the watch resting where he left it on the far side of\nthe concrete block.  He dashes inside, circles around the concrete\nblock, reaches for the watch --\n\n-- and FREEZES at the sound of THREE WARNING BEEPS behind him.\n\nWhite-faced, he snatches at the watch and ducks around the concrete\nblock -- too quickly.  He nicks his shin on the projecting edge of\nthe support platform and tumbles to the floor of the chamber.\n\nBefore his eyes, a MASSIVE STEEL DOOR is sliding into place --\nTRAPPING HIM INSIDE.\n\nHe LURCHES toward the door, gets a hand through.  The door keeps\nsliding.  He jerks his hand back a half-second before the door slams\nshut.\n\n83. INT. LAB - ENTRY - THAT MOMENT\n1300 hours sharp.  A half-dozen SCIENTISTS stroll into the lab.  One\nof them is passing out goggles -- to his colleagues and a pair of\nMILITARY BIGWIGS who are obviously on a walking tour of the\nfacilities.\n\nSCIENTIST\n-- actually, we don't know what happens when you disrupt the\nintrinsic field.  All we've managed to do so far is blow a few\nconcrete blocks all to hell.\n\nGENERAL\n(joking, but worried)\nNo danger of . . . fallout, is there?\n\nSCIENTIST\nNo sir.  The chamber's radiation-proof once it's sealed.  That's why\nwe waited outside.\n\nThe translucent coils on the particle cannons have begun to glow a\ndull red.\n\nThe crowd draws closer, goggles in place.  There's a dim, distant\nTHUMPING.\n\nThe SCIENTISTS look at the chamber -- and go slackjawed in perfect\nunison.\n\nGENERAL\nWhat's the matter?\n\nSCIENTIST\nSweet Jesus -- !\n\nWe DOLLY IN rapidly on the observation panel mounted inthe wall of\nthe test chamber -- leaded glass, two feet thick.  Behind it is the\nterrified face of JON OSTERMAN -- pounding frantically on the glass,\nscreaming soundlessly.\n\nPandemonium in the lab as the SCIENTISTS rush right and left,\npunching buttons, twisting knobs -- to no avail.  The GENERAL comes\nto a belated and painfully obvious realization:\n\nGENERAL\nSay, there's a man in there!!\n\nThe coils on the cannons have gone from red to bright yellow.  One\nSCIENTIST stands at the observation window and SHOUTS --\n\nSCIENTIST I\nStay calm, Jon!  We'll try and kill the power!\n\n-- while another barks furiously into a wall phone:\n\nSCIENTIST II\nBuilding six!  Kill the power!  Osterman's trapped in the I.F.\nchamber!!\n\nThe GENERAL stands there looking rather nonplussed.\n\nGENERAL\nWell -- why doesn't someone let him out??\n\nSCIENTIST III\nIt's a timelock.  It can't be opened once the sequence\nstarts.\n(to SCIENTIST II)\nWhat's the word?\n\nSCIENTIST II\n(covering the phone)\nThey're sending a crew to the generator building --\n\nSCIENTIST IV\nTWENTY SECONDS!\n\nIn a glass box on the wall is a fire ax -- with the instructions \"IN\nCASE OF FIRE BREAK GLASS.\"  WALLY WEAVER, Jon's friend from the\ncanteen, wraps his lab coat around his forearm, punches through the\nglass, and grabs the ax.\n\nSCIENTIST I\nWally!  What are you doing?\n\nWALLY\nThe power cables!!\n\nAnd now another figure enters the lab -- the unsuspecting JANEY\nSLATER.\n\nJANEY\nAm I late for the --\n\nShe stops in midsentence at the sight of the frenzied action in the\nlab.  SCIENTIST III spots her, grabs her, tries to push her back\nthrough the door.\n\nSCIENTIST III\nJaney!  Get her out of here.  Get out!\n\nBut she resists.  She's just spotted WALLY with his ax, poised to\ntake a swing at a thick black cable on the floor.  The cannon coils\nhave just gone from yellow to a brilliant, luminous white.\n\nJANEY\nWhat in the name of -- where's Jon?\n\nSCIENTIST III\nJaney!  Please!  Go!!\n\nWALLY strikes at the cable.  Nothing.  He takes another whack, and a\nsudden jolt of current knocks him off his feet and throws him into a\nwall.\n\nSparks fly, but the process continues.  The room is full of white\nlight.  JANEY, fighting her way past the SCIENTIST, gets a good look\nat the observation panel -- and the blood drains from her face.\n\nJANEY\nJon.\n\n84. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON backs away from the glass panel, a look of disbelief on his\nface.  He blinks; his hands fall limply at his sides; the watch,\nwhich he's been holding all along, falls on the floor and shatters .\n. .\n\n. . . and everything in the room goes blue.\n\n85. INT. LAB - THAT MOMENT\nThe SCIENTISTS slowly cluster around the observation panel, unable to\ntear their eyes away.  JANEY, past hope, wanders up unsteadily behind\nthem.\n\nJANEY\nJon . . .\n(shrieking)\nJON!!!\n\n86. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON's back is arched.  His arms go up.  His face is a mask of\nunbelievable agony.\n\nA moment later, his skin is gone.  A black skeleton -- like a\nphotographic negative -- stands in his place.\n\nThen the skeleton BURSTS. . . into its constituent atoms.  The\niridescent blue light has quite literally taken Jon Osterman to\npieces.\n\nAnd then, the test chamber is empty.  The blue light begins to dim,\nand we're looking through the window panel at the stagger faces of\nthe SCIENTISTS.  One by one, they back away . . . leaving only JANEY,\nwho gazes into the chamber with a blank, soulless stare.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n87. INT. RUINED CANTEEN (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT\nThe desert rat chitters on the bar.  On the partially collapsed wall\nbehind it hangs a broken clock, which stopped some twenty years ago\nat 11:48 PM.\n\nFor a moment DR. MANHATTAN, even more abstracted than usual, watches\nthe rat.  Then he turns and walks through more drifted sand out the\ndoor of the canteen.\n\n88. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN walks aimlessly through the rubble of the compound.\n\n89. INT. MEN'S ROOM (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nTWO SCIENTISTS washing their hands at the sinks.  They glance up into\nthe mirror simultaneously, and BLANCH.  Behind them, a hideous\nthing is coalescing in midair -- a brain, eyes, a dangling spinal\ncord, wriggling neurons -- a gruesome, disembodied central nervous\nsystem.\n\nThey pivot, shrieking, just in time to see the creature evaporate in\na haze of shimmering blue light.\n\n90. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.\n\n91. EXT. TEST BASE (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nHORRIFIED SENTRIES fire their rifles, then turn and run.  A\npartially-muscled skeleton stands by the perimeter fence and SCREAMS\nfor several seconds before vanishing altogether.\n\n92. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN keeps on walking.\n\n93. INT. GILA FLATS MESS HALL (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT\nDinnertime.  JANEY and WALLY at a table.\n\nJANEY\nI can't help it.  I'm going to quit this place.  It feels . . . it\nfeels haunted.\n\nWALLY\nIt'll be all right, Janey.  You need time, that's all.\n(tugging at his ear)\nDo you hear some kind of -- whistling?\n\nIndeed she does, and within moments it builds to a deafening whine.\nOdder yet, WALLY's hair is standing on end -- and so is JANEY's.\nEveryone in the mess hall seems to be experiencing the same freakish\nphenomenon.\n\nUTENSILS rise from tables and drift magically into the air.  Without\nwarning, the overhead lights blow out -- and a BRILLIANT BLUE GLOW\nsuffuses the room.  All eyes turn toward the source of the glow . . .\n\n. . . the fully formed figure of DR. MANHATTAN, floating above them,\nnude, hands spread like some majestic blue messiah.  Metal trays and\nutensils hover in midair around him, throwing off sparks.\n\nJANEY gapes at his face.  She recognizes it instantly.  Her hands go\nto her mouth and she lets out a horrible, endless shriek.\n\nJANEY\nJON-N-N-N!!!\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n94. EXT. DESERT - NIGHT\nTHE SHRIEK DIES as DR. MANHATTAN stares up into space.  He turns,\nstares at the ground.  Nothing but sand.  He stoops nonetheless and\nbegins to dig.\n\nA couple of inches down, he finds what he's looking for: an ancient,\ntattered photograph, faded almost beyond recognition.  Young Jon, and\nJaney Slater.  She's holding up her hand, showing off her brand-new\nengagement ring.\n\nHis fist close around the snapshot.  His eyes slowly shut.\n\n95. SERIES OF SHOTS\nQuick, almost subliminal visions of the past and future:\n\n-- JON's black skeleton, bursting to atoms in the test chamber;\n\n-- JANEY shrieking in the mess hall, her face bathed in blue\nlight;\n\n-- LAURIE at a breakfast table, drinking coffee, reading the paper.\nThere's a sudden flash of light; the windows shatter inward; a\nterrible blast of heat chars the skin off her bones . . .\n\n-- A CITY demolished by a nuclear blast, the inevitable mushroom\ncloud rising swiftly, blotting out the sky.\n\n96. EXT. DESERT - ON DR. MANHATTAN\nFists still clenched, he stands -- grimacing, distraught, alone in\nthe ghostly calm of the desert.  He rises into the air, slowly at\nfirst, then faster . . . finally disappearing in a sudden blue\nstarburst a mile above the ground.\n\n97. EXT. OUTER SPACE\nAll at once, we're back in the starry void, hurtling away from Earth\nat unimagined speeds . . . through empty space, past the moon, on\ntoward Mars.\n\nThe red planet looms larger and larger, finally dominating the frame\nas we descend toward the chaotic terrain of the Martian surface.\nIndividual features of the landscape grow gradually more distinct:\nvast canyons, oceans of fog, volcanoes the size of Missouri.\nHerschel's famous canali.  And finally, the argyre\nplanitia, an enormous shallow crater, its rocky rim encircling\ntwo jutting blue mountains and, to the south, a ragged, semicircular\nridge.\n\nTwo eyes, a big broad smile.  It looks uncannily like a\nhappy-face.\n\nMany miles below us, a tiny rupture opens in the Martian\natmosphere.  BLUE LIGHT spills out an instant before we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n98. INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN\nThe late news, with highlights of DR. MANHATTAN's press conference.\nAs the throng of REPORTERS shove microphones at him, we ZOOM IN on\nhis angered face:\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI said leave me alone!!\n\nThen there's a sudden CUT.  We see the same REPORTERS, in the same\npositions, only DR. MANHATTAN is gone -- and they're all standing on\nthe White House lawn, in the midst of a torrential downpour.\n\nPULL BACK TO:\n\n99. INT. ROOM - GOVT. SECURITY COMPLEX - NIGHT\nA restless LAURIE watching the broadcast from an overstuffed chair.\nShe's in a big open room with a bed and kitchenette; except for the\nbig metal door and the bars on the windows, it could pass for a comfy\nfurnished studio.\n\nTV ANCHORWOMAN (O.S.)\n-- in Washington, where an irate Dr. Manhattan teleported\na crew of reporters into the midst of a rainstorm on Pennsylvania\nAvenue!\n\nTV ANCHORMAN (O.S.)\nWell, Katie, I know some politicians who'd like to learn that trick --\n\nLAURIE turns at the sound of keys in the door.  A moment later,\nSCHMIDT enters, followed by a pair of FEDERAL AGENTS.\n\nSCHMIDT\nAll right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.\n\nLAURIE\nAm I free to go?\n\nSCHMIDT\nYou're free to do whatever you goddamn well please.  Let's move\nit.\n\nLAURIE\n(fed up; exploding)\nI don't know why you've been keeping me here, but you're in deep shit\n--\n\nSCHMIDT\nOh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan\nborder this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living\nsoul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic\nweapons has finally flipped out.\n\nLAURIE\nJon??  You mean he's --\n\nSCHMIDT\nThat's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard\nhas apparently left the planet.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n100. EXT. NEWSTAND - DAY\nThe same headlines scream from every edition on the rack:\n\nDR. MANHATTAN LEAVES EARTH\nRussian Tanks Advance\nPresident Vows \"Maximum Force\"\nWHERE IS DR. MANHATTAN?\n\nAnd on the street, tensions are running high.  The familiar NEWS\nVENDOR is engaged in a heated exchange with one of his CUSTOMERS:\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nI'll tell you what the problem is.  We shoulda been building tanks,\nbombs, ICBM's!  Instead we been relying on that big blue son of a\nbitch --\n\nCUSTOMER\nAnyone ever tell you you're full of shit?\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nKiss my ass, buddy!  Keep your goddamn quarter!\n\nVOICE\nNew Frontiersman, please.\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR turns suddenly, finds himself confronted by an old\nfriend: the red-haired STREET CRAZY with the end-of-the-world sign.\nHe rolls his eyes -- this is all I need -- and reaches under\nthe counter.\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nHere you go, pal.  Two bucks.\n(beat)\nWell, I see the world ain't ended yet.\n\nThe STREET CRAZY eyes the lurid cover of his magazine.  \"EXPOSED: RED\nPLOT TO FRAME DR. MANHATTAN!\"\n\nSTREET CRAZY\n. . . How do you know?\n\nCUT TO:\n\n101. EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT\nA row of decayed walk-ups in a fringe neighborhood downtown.  A\nDRUNKEN COUPLE -- a gaunt, middle-aged MAN and a blowsy, overweight\nWOMAN -- totter down the street arm in arm.  NEON SIGNS blink on and\noff as they mount the front steps of a seedy building, exchanging\ntipsy giggles.\n\n102. INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT\nA three-room hellhole, decor by Goodwill.  A door opens, and the MAN\nushers his date inside with exaggerated formality.  Her name is LUCY;\nhis is Edgar William Jacobi, but -- for reasons soon to be revealed --\nwe'll call him MOLOCH.\n\nMOLOCH\nNow.  What was milady drinking?\n\nLUCY\nGin.  Straight up --\n(mock-ladylike)\n\n-- with a little twist of lime.\n\nShe laughs convulsively, as if she's just told the world's funniest\njoke.  MOLOCH lifts a single finger and starts toward the kitchen:\n\nMOLOCH\nI think I can oblige.\n\n103. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nMOLOCH FREEZES in the doorway, his face taut with apprehension.  The\ncontents of his refrigerator have been strewn all over the kitchen\nfloor -- overturns milk cartons, broken eggs, the like.  It's a\ndisaster area.  As he steps inside to investigate, LUCY appears in\nthe doorway behind him -- and SNORTS.\n\nLUCY\nJeez, honey!  You got some kind of animal in here?\n\nOn cue, the refrigerator door KICKS OPEN -- and out pops RORSCHACH.\nHe grabs MOLOCH by the lapels, pins him back against the kitchen\ntable.\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch.  Did you miss me?\n\nLUCY\nWillie!  Jesus!  What's going on?\n\nRORSCHACH\n(glancing up)\nWho's the welfare mother?\n\nMOLOCH\nI don't know who you are buddy, but I swear to God, you got the wrong\nguy.\n\nRORSCHACH\nEdgar William Jacobi, aka William Edgar Bright, a.k.a. Moloch.\n\nMOLOCH\nYou're making a big --\n\nRORSCHACH lifts MOLOCH up slightly, then slams him down hard against\nthe table -- repeatedly, to the beat.\n\nRORSCHACH\nTerrorist.  Radical agitator.  Stool pigeon.\n\nMOLOCH\nALL RIGHT!  ALL RIGHT!!  -- How'd you find me?\n\nLUCY\nWillie, what's he talking about?\n\nRORSCHACH backs off, allowing MOLOCH to slump to the floor.\nRORSCHACH kneels beside him.\n\nMOLOCH\nLook, I don't know what you want, but I been a private citizen for\nten years.  I --\n\nRORSCHACH cups one gloved hand under MOLOCH's chin and pulls him\nclose.  Then, for LUCY's benefit, he explains:\n\nRORSCHACH\nTurned state's witness in '75.  Earned himself a brand-new face.\n(twisting MOLOCH's head to one side, for a better look)\nHnnrh.  Butt-ugly then . . . butt-ugly now.\n\nHe shoves MOLOCH back onto the floor, then stands.  There's a sugar\nbowl on the table; RORSCHACH spots it and pockets a few cubes as\nMOLOCH gets up to dust himself off.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nComedian dead.  Dr. Manhattan in exile.  Obvious connection.  Who's\nbehind it?\n\nMOLOCH\nRorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with\n--\n\nRORSCHACH\nWorked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.\n\nMOLOCH\nCTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --\n\nRORSCHACH\nDon't know.  Ask around.  I'll be back.\n\nLUCY, still unsettled, crosses to MOLOCH's side and grips his arm as\nRORSCHACH opens a rear window.  He's climbing through the frame when\nhe stops suddenly and points a finger at the frightened pair:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nWord of advice for the lady . . . stock up on penicillin.\n\n-- and he's out on the fire escape and GONE.  LUCY looks suspiciously\nat MOLOCH, who shrugs, embarrassed: I don't know what he's talking\nabout.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n104. INT. PENTAGON - WAR ROOM - DAY\nThe familiar set from Dr. Strangelove: top brass seated at a\nbig round table, with a huge Mercator-projection map of the world\nlooming in BG.  The Afghan-Pakistani border is highlighted in red; a\nMILITARY ANALYST paces in front of the big board with a penlight\nPOINTER,\nhighlighting areas of strategic importance.\n\nANALYST\nOur projections show Pakistan falling within the week.  From there\nit's sixty percent certain they'll try to take Western Europe.\n\nGENERAL\nRespectfully, sir, out NATO allies are getting itchy.  They're\nquizzing us about the possibility of a first strike.\n\nMOVE IN on a tall chair at the head of the table -- the back of which\nbears the seal of the President of the United States.\n\nPRESIDENT\nFirst strike.\n(long pause)\nI'd like to view the simulation.\n\nThe ANALYST hits a button on a remote control device.\n\nANALYST\nOptimally . . . we could expect to wipe out some eighty percent of\ntheir retaliatory capability before they knew what hit 'em.\n\nOn the big board, BLUE ARROWS emanate from selected points in the\nPacific and the Arctic Circle and veer toward Russian turf --\nblossoming in yellow-and-black RADIATION\nSYMBOLS as they strike their targets.\n\nPRESIDENT\nWhat about our end?\n\nANALYST\nWell, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that\ntwenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.\n\nOn the board, RED ARROWS inch westward from Mother Russia.\n\nANALYST (cont.)\nBritain down -- Germany down --\n\nPRESIDENT\nWhat kind of time frame are we talking about?\n\nANALYST\nThirty minutes maximum.  Of course, I assume we'd be in the fortified\ncommand bunker at the time of the launch order.\n\nRADIATION SYMBOLS sprout over New York, Baltimore, Washington,\nDenver, Los Angeles, San Francisco.\n\nPRESIDENT\n. . . Of course.\n\nBy now, both coasts are pretty well blotted out.  The ANALYST, a\ndedicated optimist, turns to announce:\n\nANALYST\nAs you can see, we may be able to salvage a good-sized chunk of the\nfarm belt.\n\nPRESIDENT\nWhat about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . \"nuclear winter\"\ntheory?\n\nANALYST\nWe don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . .\nmay depend on a quirk of the weather.\n\nPRESIDENT\nThe weather.  I see.\n(pause)\nKeep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum\nstrike conditions.\n\nThe SECRETARY OF STATE -- our old pal G. Gordon Liddy -- pipes up:\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY\nDick, before we act hastily, we should consider . . . Dr. Manhattan\nmay decide to return.\n\nWith a heavy heart, the Chief Executive pushes himself away from the\ntable -- and we get our first good look at him.  His face is lined\nand tired, his hair is flecked with white, but he's none other than\nthat beloved statesman RICHARD M. NIXON -- still vital and robust at\n74.\n\nPRESIDENT (cont.)\nGood God.  At times like this I wish I'd never come out of\nretirement.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n105. INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - RECEPTION ROOM - DAY\nA private practice in midtown Manhattan.  LAURIE emerges from an\nexamination room, grim and hollow-eyed; the DOCTOR hangs back in the\ndoorway.\n\nDOCTOR\nI'm sorry, Miss Juspecyzk.\n\nLAURIE\nNot at all, Doctor.  I appreciate your honesty.\n\n106. INT. GUNGA DINER - DUSK\nA greasy Indian restaurant in a Village storefront.  In a booth near\nthe entrance we find LAURIE and DREIBERG munching on chicken\ntandoori.\n\nDREIBERG\nChrist yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a\ncouple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .\n(pause)\nHow about you, Laurie?\n\nLAURIE\n(lying -- with forced cheer)\nOh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the\nhell out.\n(shrugging)\nNo expense account.  No place to live.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou'll find something.  -- I should go.  You and me, seeing each\nother, someone might put two and two together . . .\n\nLAURIE shakes her head and laughs -- mirthlessly.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're not following me, Dan.  I mean -- Jon's gone, we're\nright on the brink of World War III.  Nobody cares about the\nWatchmen.\n\nDREIBERG\nMaybe not, but why take chances?\n\nLAURIE\nDan, what are you so scared of?  I mean, me, I've spent\nall these years keeping Jon together, and now that it's over I feel --\nI feel glad.  I'm finally free to, to go out and live my own\nlife, and --\n\n-- and she's dying of cancer.  The irony of it hits home, throws a\ndamper on her little burst of optimism.  Depressed again, she starts\nto get up.\n\nLAURIE\nI'm just running on, Dan.  Thanks for dinner.  I'd better go find\nmyself a cheap room.\n\nDREIBERG watches on, paralyzed by indecision, as LAURIE heads for the\ndoor of the restaurant.  Then, submitting to impulse, he gets up and\nchases her down:\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . .\n.\nLAURIE\nOh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --\n\nDREIBERG\nNo, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely\nright.  -- I'd love to have you stay.\n\nLAURIE\nYou're sure?\n\nHe nods.  She smiles and takes his arm as they walk out of the\nrestaurant.\n\nTHROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby booth we watch them passing on the\nstreet outside.  The OCCUPANT of the booth, whose face is out of\nframe, fidgets restlessly with a menu and a squeeze bottle of\nketchup.\n\nHe inverts the ketchup over the menu, squirts out an upside-down\nquestion mark, then closes the menu and mashes it shut.  When he\nopens it again, he's got a makeshift RORSCHACH BLOT.\n\n107. EXT. ALLEY BEHIND GUNGA DINER - SUNSET\nA SHORT-ORDER COOK empties garbage into a can outside the restaurant,\nthen disappears inside.  Two beats later, a DARK SILHOUETTE strolls\ncasually down the alleyway.\n\nHe moves a garbage can, finds a sheet of plywood tacked to the\ncrumbling brick wall behind it.  He pries the plywood loose, finds a\nsmall recess in the wall, then extracts a SLOUCH HAT . . . and a\nshifting INKBLOT MASK.\n\n108. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nThe guest bedroom is furnished in a somewhat grandmotherly style:\nflowered wallpaper, an old brass bed with a frilly comforter, etc.\nIt's small but cozy, and LAURIE lets out an appreciative \"aah\" as\nDREIBERG ushers her in.\n\nLAURIE\nThis is so nice of you, Daniel.  I really do appreciate it.\n\nDREIBERG's lugging her suitcases.  He sets them on the bed and stands\nthere for a moment, looking vaguely expectant.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nAre you . . . waiting for a tip?\n\nDREIBERG\nOh.  No.  Sorry.  I'll be right down the hall if you want me . . . I\nmean, if you need some aspirin, or --\n\nLAURIE\nI'm gonna take a warm bath and sack out.  -- You've been really\nsweet.  Sleep tight, okay?\n\nShe gives him a sisterly peck on the cheek, then returns to her\nunpacking.  DREIBERG watches her for a second, then turns to go.\n\n109. INT. HALLWAY - ON DREIBERG\nAs he closes the door, he get a quick glimpse, from behind, of LAURIE\nunbuttoning her shirt.  He quickly averts his gaze and pulls the door\nshut.\n\n110. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\nDREIBERG, in pajamas, climbs into bed and kills the light.  He folds\nhis hands behind his head and stares up at the ceiling.\n\n111. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE\nAnother quick glimpse of derring-do.  This time it's SILK SPECTRE --\nLAURIE -- in the midst of a gang of thugs.  She fights them off\nvaliantly, but she's heavily outnumbered.  She turns and runs.\n\nAn oblong shadow falls across the ground, and NIGHT OWL swings into\nframe; he's clinging to a rope ladder which hangs from his AIRSHIP\noverhead.  In one smooth motion he swoops into LAURIE's path and\nsnatches her into the air, safe from the clutches of her pursuers.\n\n112. INT. BEDROOM - ON DREIBERG.\nHis head turns at the sound of WATER running in the bathroom\nadjacent.  He's going to be awake half the night thinking of\nLAURIE.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n113. EXT. STREET - DAY\nEarly morning.  Across the street from us is a BUBBLE CAR parked in\nan alley.  Its occupants: MOLOCH, and a straitlaced guy in a suit and\ncrewcut.  He's got a definite CTU look about him.\n\nMOLOCH gets out, scans the street, and crosses toward the GUNGA\nDINER.\n\n114. INT. GUNGA DINER - REST ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nA twitchy MOLOCH locks himself in a stall, sits on the throne, and\npulls out a bundle of WHITE POWDER.  He takes a couple of hits up the\nnose, then dips his finger in the stuff and rubs it around the edges\nof his EYELIDS.\n\nHis eyes water.  He sniffles.  He reaches for some toilet paper;\nbizarrely, a small BUSINESS CARD falls out of the roll.  He picks it\nup . . .\n\nThere's a hand-scrawled RORSCHACH BLOT on its face.\n\nA low, hissing GROWL from overhead.  MOLOCH looks up suddenly -- and\nsees RORSCHACH peering at him over the stall partition.\n\nHe GASPS and lunges for the door.  RORSCHACH's arm snakes out and\nholds the stall door shut.\n\nRORSCHACH\nTwo things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational\ndrugs.\n\nMOLOCH\nNo, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got\nsomething for you.\n\nA long pause.  RORSCHACH GROWLS again: let's have it.\n\nMOLOCH (cont.)\nThere's a big bunch of research scientists -- missing.  Blake was on\na case, trying to track 'em down.\n(beat)\nIt's big, Rorschach.  Something to do with Doc Manhattan.  That's all\nI've been able to find out.\n\nRORSCHACH\nDrug habit.  Highly illegal.  Hnrrh.\n(snarling)\nLet it go time.  In future -- just say no.\n\nWith that he disappears over the edge of the stall.  MOLOCH sits\nthere a moment.  He reaches for the stall door, rattles it.

VEIDT'S PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY\nA plush RECEPTION ROOM in his Veidt Industries pyramid; it's\ndecorated in the same Egyptian motifs as his office.  VEIDT sits in\nan overstuffed chair, surrounded by VIDEO CAMERAS; he's in the\nprocess of charming JUSTINE JAMES, a fawning Barbara Walters-figure\nwho's prepping a segment for her next celebrity-chat special.\n\nJUSTINE\nNow Adrian, I guess there's one thing everyone wants to know.\nAre you the world's smartest man?\n\nVEIDT\nOh my, yes.  And the best-dressed.\n\nA round of chuckles from the video CREW.  Wotta smoothie!\n\nJUSTINE\nYou're certainly one of the richest.  Holder of over forty\nbasic patents -- including products that have changed our everyday\nlives.\n(pause)\nIf you had one achievement you were proudest of -- what would that be?\n\nVEIDT ponders for a second, then reaches into his jacket and pulls\nout his gold cigarette case.\n\nVEIDT\nSphinx brand.\n(opening the case)\nWhen I got out of weapons design, I wanted to move into a more . . .\nhumanitarian area.  I was thinking: what would do some good\nin the world?  And I thought: why not a genetically-altered tobacco,\nthat no only doesn't cause cancer -- but cleans out your lungs\nas you smoke it?\n(lighting up)\nIn fact I think I'll have one now.  Care to join me?\n\nJUSTINE\nThanks, no.  But it's a wonderful product.  Now Adrian -- your\nold colleague Dr. Manhattan has just left the planet amid rumors --\n\nVEIDT\n(bristling)\nNo.  No.  Cut.  -- Justine, we agreed.  No questions about the\nWatchmen.\n\nJUSTINE\nOh sweetheart, just a quick one.\n\nVEIDT\nNo.  We laid out very careful ground rules --\n\nVEIDT is interrupted by a GROWLING NOISE from his office adjacent.\nHe glances quickly over his shoulder, then gets back to business.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\n-- we agreed specifically --\n\nMORE GROWLING from the next room over.  The CAMERA CREW's getting\ncurious.  VEIDT gets up from his chair.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nExcuse me a second.\n\nHe goes to the office door and slips inside.  The usually-smiley\nJUSTINE shoots a look of disgust at her CREW: what a prick.\n\n116. INT. VEIDT'S OFFICE - DAY\nVEIDT is shocked to find RORSCHACH down on the carpet, wrestling with\nhis mutant LYNX.  He CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE:\n\nVEIDT\nKITTY!!\n\nOne last nip, and the cat backs off.  RORSCHACH gets to his feet --\nno visible signs of damage, except for a severe bruise to his\ndignity.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nHow the hell did you get in here?\n\nThe curtains are flapping; a BREEZE hits VEIDT across the face.  He\nlooks up, sees a NEAT ROUND HOLE cut out of his plate-glass\nwindow.\n\nRORSCHACH\nNew information.\n\nVEIDT\n(pointing to the telephone)\nEver see one of these before?\n\nRORSCHACH\nToo important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked\nup.\n\nVEIDT\nWhat is that ungodly smell?\n\nRORSCHACH, abashed, lets out a timid version of his trademark\nHISS.\n\nRORSCHACH\nBigger than I thought.  CTU involved . . .\n\nVEIDT\nYeah, I've heard all about your conspiracy theories.  Now I've got a\nroomful of cameras in there.  I want you out.  Now.\n(beat)\nAnd whatever you're doing, knock it off.  You're making us\nall look bad.\n\nRORSCHACH\nFate of the world at stake, Adrian.  Can't get too worked up over bad\npress.\n\nHe makes for the window.  VEIDT frowns, adjusts his tie and exits.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n117. INT. DREIBERG'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE cooking dinner.  DREIBERG burns his fingers on a\nbroiling pan, which prompts a sudden round of stamping and\ncursing.\n\nLAURIE watches for a minute, then shakes her head.  She pours a full\nglass of wine and thrusts it at him.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel -- drink this.  Immediately.\n(smiling)\nI swear, you are acting like a kid on a date.\n\nSucking on his burnt fingers, he reluctantly takes the wineglass.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay, I'm nervous.  It's an odd sensation.  I've always had to think\nof you as Dr. Manhattan's --\n\nHe catches himself -- too late.  LAURIE glowers at him.\n\nLAURIE\nHis what?\n\nDREIBERG\nHis . . . whatever.\n\nLAURIE\nI'm not his . . . whatever.  Okay?\n\nShe spears a couple of steaks, drops them on plates, and heads toward\nthe dining room.\n\nLAURIE\nLook, I just want to eat dinner and get drunk.

DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nA DINING ROOM TABLE littered with crumpled napkins and dirty\ndishes.  DREIBERG and LAURIE have just finished dinner.  He stares in\ndismay at the TV screen as he opens a fresh bottle of wine.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood Lord.  With Jon out of the picture it's a whole new ball\ngame.\n\nLAURIE's already a little tipsy, and the broadcast doesn't much\ninterest her.  Wine glass in hand, she's wandered over to the stereo\ncabinet.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's right, Daniel.  A whole new ball game.\n(smiling)\nGod!  I haven't seen on of these in fifteen years.\n\nShe's referring to DREIBERG's ancient TURNTABLE.  Shelved beneath it\nare row upon row of LP's -- these days, they're obsolete collector's\nitems.\n\nDREIBERG\nI told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I\nlisten to -- it never came out on crystal.\n\nLAURIE\nI'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.\n(flipping through records)\nNellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these\npeople.\n\nDREIBERG\nPlay one.  Educate yourself.\n\nLAURIE chuckles.  Her head turns at the sound of a familiar\nCOMMERCIAL THEME.  On the TV, a young woman sits at her vanity and\ngazes lovingly at a WEDDING PICTURE framed in silver.\n\nLAURIE\nOh look.  It's Adrian's ad.\n\nTV CHORUS\n\"Oh my darling, it's incredible,\nThat someone so unforgettable . . .\"\n\n120. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT\nMOLOCH's apartment.  THE SAME COMMERCIAL is blaring from the TV as\nRORSCHACH lets himself in.\n\nTV CHORUS\n\". . . Should think I am unforgettable too.\"\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch?\n\nNo reply from MOLOCH, who sits in an easy chair, his back to camera,\nseemingly glued to the tube.  RORSCHACH casts a cautious glance\naround the room and advances stealthily toward the chair.  Onscreen,\nthe WOMAN at the vanity opens a jar and smear LIME-GREEN GOO on her\nface:\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\nThe years melt away with NOSTALGIA.  Use it once a week -- and\nwrinkles vanish overnight.  Medically tested, non-habit-forming\nNOSTALGIA is the patented beauty cream that actually reverses\nthe aging process . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nMoloch?\n\nHe creeps up behind MOLOCH, lays a hand on his shoulder.\n\n121. REVERSE ANGLE - ON MOLOCH\nstaring at the TV screen with sightless eyes.  There's a NEAT ROUND\nBULLET-HOLE in the center of his forehead.  RORSCHACH sees it and\nspins on his heels, anticipating an ambush --\n\nTV ANNOUNCER (O.S.)\nFor the smooth young face he'll never forget --\n\n122. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE is still flipping through records.  DREIBERG chuckles at the\nTV ad.\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\n-- turn back the clock with NOSTALGIA . . . from Veidt Industries.\n\nDREIBERG\nNo wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?\n\nLAURIE\nSure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm\nthirty-eight years old!\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't mind getting older.  I'm obsolete anyway.  Why try to hide\nit?\n\nLAURIE\nI like the way you look.\n(beat)\nIt's strange with Jon.  He doesn't age.  His face doesn't change.\nBut you, Daniel, you look . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nOld?\n\nLAURIE\nNot at all.  You look very -- dashing.\n(standing up)\nHere, you pick one.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . What?\n\nLAURIE\nPick a record.  I feel like dancing.\n\nHer tone is unmistakably flirtatious.  DREIBERG hesitates -- then,\nwith a noncommittal smile, he moves to the record cabinet.\n\n123. INT. TENEMENT FLAT - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH making a hasty exit.  An AMPLIFIED VOICE booms out:\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nRORSCHACH!  THIS IS THE CIVIL TERRORISM UNIT.  YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE TO\nCOME OUT.\n\nHe goes to the window and peeks through the blinds.  On the street\noutside, BUBBLE CARS are massing, blocking off the intersection.  A\nCTU SWAT TEAM prepares to raid the building.\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nYOU WON'T BE HARMED.  COME OUT.  IT'S ALL OVER!\n\nHe's walked into a trap.  As he lets the blinds fall, ALL SOUND DIES\n-- and a bouncy, tinkling PIANO THEME comes up underneath.\n\n124. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nThe PIANO MUSIC emanates from DREIBERG's stereo: an old Fats Waller\ntune, \"S'posin'.\"  He's slow dancing with LAURIE, their faces\nilluminated by the cold blue flicker of the television.  With a smile\nshe reaches up to remove his glasses, then deposits them in his shirt\npocket.\n\nDreamily, she rests her hand on his shoulder.  Her nearness is making\nhim nervous.  She pauses in mid-step and takes his face in her\nhands.  He tries to look away, but she pulls his face around -- so\nthat he can't avoid her gaze any longer -- and plants a soft kiss on\nhis mouth.\n\nThe PIANO INTRO ends, and Fats' teasing vocal begins:\n\n\"S'posin' I should fall in love with you . . .\nDo you think that you could love me too . . .\"\n\n125. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nSONG CONTINUES UNDERNEATH, cheerful soundtrack accompaniment to a\nhorrific silent movie.  RORSCHACH races out of the bathroom carrying\na plastic MOP BUCKET, plus an armload of bottles and aerosol cans --\nordinary household supplies.  He enters the kitchen, rummages around\nunder the sink, finds another handful of bottles: cleaning fluid,\nrubbing alcohol, Drano.\n\nAlmost as an afterthough he moves to the gas stove, turns on all the\nburners -- and BLOWS OUT THE FLAMES.\n\n\"S'posin' I should hug you and caress you . . .\nWould it impress you . . .\"\n\n126.

TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT (MOS)\nRORSCHACH dousing the living room carpet with charcoal lighter and\nrubbing alcohol.  There's a pile of bottles -- only half-emptied --\nresting next to the front door.  The CTU COPS are pounding on the\nfront door, trying to break it down.  RORSCHACH crouches in the\nhallway just outside the living room.\n\nThe door finally gives way, and the COPS tumble in.  RORSCHACH\nstrikes a match and holds it to the nozzle of an AEROSOL CAN --\ncreating a minature FLAMETHROWER.  The COPS heads swivel just as the\npuddle on the carpet catches -- and a moment later, the PILE OF\nBOTTLES EXPLODES, engulfing the doorway in flame.\n\n\"S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .\n(Yeah I yearn.  Sure I do.)\nWould you think I'm speaking out of turn? . . .\"\n\n128. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE horizontal on the sofa, their clothes in\ndisarray.  LAURIE kisses him hungrily -- but he's distant, panicky,\nunable to respond.  It's been a long time for him.  It's not going\nwell.\n\n\"S'posin' I declare it\nWould you take my love and share it?\nI'm not s'posin', I'm in love with you . . .\"\n\nHe wriggles beneath her.  She takes his hand, presses it onto her\nbreast.\n\n129. INT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nINSTRUMENTAL BRIDGE continues UNDERNEATH as RORSCHACH backs through\nthe kitchen with his bucket.  SMOKE billows in from the living room.\n\nHe empties TWO BOTTLES OF COOKING OIL on the linoleum floor.  Then he\nducks through a door into the BACK STAIRWELL.\n\n130. INT. STAIRWELL LANDING - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)\nRORSCHACH opens a bottle of CLEANING FLUID, stuffs a wad of newspaper\ninto its neck.  The first wave of COPS -- coughing and hacking from\nthe smoke -- makes it into the kitchen just as he IGNITES his molotov\ncocktail and TOSSES IT INSIDE.\n\nThe COPS pitch backward as the bottle blows up.  By the time they hit\nthe floor, the COOKING OIL has burst into flame.\n\nRORSCHACH bolts up the stairs; by now, another squad of CTU MEN is\ncoming up with back way behind him.\n\n131. INT. KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER (MOS)\nCharred COPS, leaping FLAMES.  CAMERA ZEROES IN on the GAS STOVE.\n\n132. EXT. TENEMENT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT (MOS)\nA GAPING HOLE blows open in the front of the building.  FIERY RUBBLE\nhails down on the CTU units outside.  Re-enter Fats on vocals:\n\n\"S'posin' I should hug you and caress you? . . .\nWould it impress you? . . .\"\n\n133. INT. DREIBERG'S APARTMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE is fumbling with DREIBERG's pants.  Finally he can't stand it\nanymore -- and with a pained, stricken look he pushes her away and\nsits up on the sofa.  His head sinks into his hands.  At first she\ndoesn't understand; then her face softens, and she moves to his side,\nembracing his shoulders, gently stroking his hair.\n\n\". . . Or would it distress you?\"\n\n134. INT. TENEMENT - BACK STAIRWELL - THAT MOMENT (MOS)\nRORSCHACH huddled on the uppermost landing, just below roof level.\nBy now the whole building is ablaze.  Two flights down, a pair of CTU\nCOPS are fighting their way through the inferno, still on his tail.\n\nHe still has his mop bucket; it's half-full of water.  He reaches for\nhis last can -- a can of DRANO -- and empties it into the bucket,\nwhere it begins to HISS and SIZZLE.\n\n\"S'posin' I should say for you I yearn . . .\nWould you think I'm speaking out of turn . . .\"\n\nThe COPS are almost on him, racing upward two steps at a time.  He\nsteps out in front of them, and -- before they can hoist their\nweapons -- HEAVES THE BUCKETFUL OF BOILING DRANO into their faces.\n\nThe COPS SHRIEK SOUNDLESSLY and topple backwards into the flames as\nRORSCHACH turns tail and bursts through the door to the roof.\n\n135. EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH emerges -- and a BLINDING LIGHT catches him full in the\nface.  Hovering not twenty feet overhead is a POLICE AIRSHIP -- a\nblimp-like craft of the sort we saw earlier.  A spray of MACHINE-GUN\nFIRE peppers the roof.\n\n\"S'posin' I declare it.\nWould you take my love and share it? . . .\"\n\nRORSCHACH scuttles along the edge of the roof, finds a rickety FIRE\nESCAPE, and dives over.  Unfortunately, he's now exposed on the front\nof the building -- pinned to the wall by gunfire from the SWAT TEAM on\nthe street.  TONGUES OF FLAME dart from nearby windows.  He turns and\ntries to climb back upward, but more COPS -- frm the just-landed\nAIRSHIP -- are already spilling over the edge of the roof.\n\n\"I ain't s'posin', I'm in love with you.\"\n\nThe song ends.  And on the last note, RORSCHACH emits an ungodly HOWL\nOF FURY -- diving over the metal railing, PLUNGING to the street\nbelow.\n\n136. EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT\nThree stories down, he crashes into a cluster of garbage cans -- and\nlies there, spent, twisted, wracked with pain.  The CTU COPS are on\nhim instantly, kicking him, pummeling him with billy clubs and rifle\nbutts.\n\nCOPS\nGET HIM!  GET HIS MASK!  LET'S SEE THE LITTLE FUCKER'S FACE!!\n\nRORSCHACH\nGNAAAAHH!!  NO!! NO!!\n\nIn seconds the inkblot mask is off -- revealing a pocked, doughy face\ntopped off with a shock of MATTED RED HAIR.  It's a familiar\nface . . . the face of the STREET CRAZY who haunts the newsstand\nwith his placards announcing the end of the world.\n\nCOP\nChrist.  He's got five-inch heels.  The fuckin' runt wears\nelevator shoes!\n\nRORSCHACH\nNO!!  NO!!

That ugly little zero.\n\nRORSCHACH\nGIVE ME BACK MY FACE!!!\n\nThe van doors slam shut on RORSCHACH -- just as the first FIRE TRUCKS\narrive to turn their hoses on the flaming skeleton of the tenement.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n137.

DREIBERG, distracted, pours a glass of wine and gets up to\npace the room.\n\nLAURIE\nI just realized.  I'd never seen his face.\n(beat)\nI guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel?\nWhat's wrong?\n\nDREIBERG\nThe Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.\n\nHe stares at her, obviously wondering: who's next?\n\n138. EXT. NEWS KIOSK - EVENING\nThe familiar NEWS VENDOR peddling papers.  A feisty little BLACK KID\n-- the same one who made a face at RORSCHACH -- sits on the pavement\nnearby, reading a comic book.\n\nThe NEWS VENDOR nudges him, indicates the comic book: a patriotic\nlittle number entitled \"COLONEL NORTH AND HIS HOWLING COMMANDOS.\"\n\nNEWS VENDOR\nHey, this ain't a lending library.  I expect you to pay me for\nthat.\n\nKID\nNo way.  This one sucks.\n\nA CUSTOMER -- 50, black, on the tubby side -- stops at the\nnewsstand.  His name is DR. MALCOLM LONG.\n\nDR.

LONG, who happens to be a police psychiatrist, sits at a big desk\nwith a vast heap of paperwork -- which includes a mug sheet of\nRORSCHACH (minus the mask) and a neatly-typed arrest report from the\nNYPD:\n\nNAME: Kovacs, Walter Joseph\nADDRESS: Transient\nBORN: 3/21/43\nMOTHER'S NAME: Kovacs, Sylvia J.

You know, these vigilantes,\nthese \"Watchmen\" -- there's never been a systematic study to find out\njust what makes them do it.\n\nSYLVIA\nMalcolm, don't get too -- overwhelmed by all this.\n\nSYLVIA picks up a blurry xerox of a child's drawing: TWO HIDEOUS\nFIGURES, male and female, with wild eyes, fangs, and matted hair.\nThey're conjoined like Siamese twins at the mouth, belly, and\ncrotch.  This twisted vision of coitus bears the crayoned title \"MY\nDREAM by W.J. Kovacs, Age 13.\"\n\nIt's too strong to look at for long.  She sets it down with a\nshiver.\n\nSYLVIA (cont.)\nWhy don't you come to bed?\n\nDR. LONG\n(totally engrossed)\nI'd like to get my hands on some of the others.

When they told him, he had one\nword of comment: \"Good.\"\n\nSYLVIA shoots him a hard look, shakes her head almost imperceptibly,\nand gives up.  She turns and pads silently out of the room.  LONG\ngoes right on talking, unaware that his audience has left.\n\nDR. LONG (cont.)\nStill, he's not stupid.  In some ways he's got an\nextraordinary mind.

LONG\nNow, Walter, you obviously know what these are.  I want you to look\nat each card in turn and tell me what it reminds you of.  All\nright?\n\nRORSCHACH's face is bruised, bloodied, and blank.

RORSCHACH stares at it for a long moment.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nA doggy.  A big old floppy-eared dog.\n\nHe shows the hint of a smile.  DR. LONG heaves a sigh of\nfrustration.\n\nDR. LONG\nWalter --\n\nRORSCHACH\nDon't call me that.\n\nDR. LONG\nWalter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to\nhear.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWrong answers?\n\nDR. LONG\nThere's no right or wrong.  But if you don't give me an honest\nresponse, I can't help you.\n(pause)\nI want to help you.  I want to know all about you.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHnnrr.  -- Like to masturbate.  Shit once a day.\n\nLONG knows the standard procedure for intransigent cases like this.\nHe shrugs indifferently, reaches for his briefcase, then gropes under\nthe table and presses a buzzer to summon the guards.\n\nDR. LONG\nWell, then.  Have it your way, Walter.  Let me know when you decide\nto cooperate.\n\nTWO PRISON GUARDS enter through a steel door.  RORSCHACH gets up to\nleave.

Adrian!  Can you give us a comment of Rorschach?\n\nHe's not at all happy to see her.  His FLUNKIES -- bodyguards and\nsecretaries -- form a wedge around him as he tries to push past the\ncameras.\n\nVEIDT\nNo comment.\n\nJUSTINE\nDid you know he was back on the streets?\n\nVEIDT\nI did not.  Now get out of my way!\n\nJUSTINE\nIsn't it true that you --\n\nHe keeps walking, with JUSTINE in hot pursuit.  Then, wide-eyed, he\nSTOPS IN HIS TRACKS.  An ARMED GUNMAN has stepped out from behind a\npillar -- directly into VEIDT's path.\n\nASSASSIN\nVEIDT!\n\nVEIDT DIVES.  The ASSASSIN'S BULLET catches JUSTINE in the gut and\ncomes out the other side in a spray of blood.  With a gymnast's\nagility VEIDT rolls to the right -- and comes up with a BRASS ASHTRAY\nin his hands.\n\nHe swings it into the ASSASSIN'S RIBS, knocking him backward into a\nFOUNTAIN.  The GUN skitters off across the marble floor.\n\nAs the SECURITY STAFF races up, VEIDT steps INTO THE FOUNTAIN and\nslams the dazed ASSASSIN'S HEAD into a decorative bust of King\nTut.\n\nVEIDT\nSon of a bitch.  Who sent you?\n\nArms flying, the two men grapple.  VEIDT grabs hold of a ASSASSIN's\nhair and thrusts a HAND into his MOUTH.\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nStand back, Mr. Veidt!  We'll handle it!\n\nVEIDT\nHe's got some kind of poison capsule.  Don't bite down, you\nscum, I want to know who sent you!\n\nThe ASSASSIN gags -- and GOES LIMP.  His lifeless body slumps down\ninto the water.  VEIDT steps out, shaken and breathless.\n\nVEIDT\nGoddammit . . .\n\nSECURITY GUARD\nWho'd wanna kill you, Mr. Veidt?\n\nVEIDT\nI don't know.  I don't know.  -- Get an ambulance for Miss James.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n142. INT. DREIBERG'S BEDROOM - DUSK\nTIGHT ON a portable TV tuned to the evening news.\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- third day of rioting in major European capitals amid escalating\nfears of nuclear war.  In London, six people were trampled outside\nSt. Paul's cathedral when overflow crowds were turned away from\nmorning Mass --\n\nA PHONE RINGS.  DREIBERG, who's sprawled on his bed watching the TV,\nreaches for the receiver.\n\nDREIBERG\nYeah.\n(beat)\nAdrian!  What's up?\n\n143. INTERCUT VEIDT AND DREIBERG\nVEIDT\nIn have something to tell you.  I wanted to call before you heard it\non the news.\n(beat)\nSomeone tried to kill me today.\n\nFor a moment DREIBERG says nothing.  He's not altogether\nsurprised.\n\nDREIBERG\nWho?\n\nVEIDT\nI don't know, but . . . in the wake of all that's happened, I'm\nstarting to think Rorschach may have been right.  Is Laurie okay?\n\nDREIBERG\nShe's with me.\n\nVEIDT\nGood.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.\n(beat)\nLook, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until\nall this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.\n\nDREIBERG\nThanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.\n\nHe hangs up and weighs his options while he stares at the box.\nLAURIE enters from the hallway, dressed in a bathrobe, toweling off\nher hair.\n\nLAURIE\nOhh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?\n\nDREIBERG\nOne more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.\n(beat)\n. . . First time I've ever heard him scared.\n\nHe doesn't say any more than that.  He doesn't have to.  LAURIE picks\nup on the implications immediately.  She exhales sharply, turns away\nfrom him and steadies herself against a bureau.\n\nDREIBERG\n-- What is it.\n\nLAURIE\nI know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't\naround.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie --\n\nLAURIE\nI'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --\n\nDREIBERG\nWith any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.\n\nHis sour wisecrack starts her trembling -- almost crying.  DREIBERG,\nfed up with his own pessimism, climbs out of bed and walks over\nbehind her.\n\nLAURIE\nI shouldn't be here anyway, Daniel.  There's something I haven't told\nyou --\n\nBut before she does he shushes her, wraps his arms around her from\nbehind.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie, I'm not afraid.  I want you with me.  I want it more than\nanything else in the world.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n144. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT\nCONVICTS lined up with metal trays at a long cafeteria-style serving\narea.  RORSCHACH enters in prison greys.  As he makes his way toward\nthe dinner line, we PICK UP a chorus of comments from the nearby\ntables:\n\nVOICE\nHey Rorschach.  You dead, man.  Just a matter of time now --\n\nVOICE II\nRorschach.  Better put some meat on that pretty ass of yours --\n\nLow, threatening CHUCKLES all around as an expressionless RORSCHACH\npicks up his tray.  A TRIO OF GOONS falls in behind him.  The\nsmallest of them outweighs him by a good forty pounds.\n\nGOON I\nDidn't know he was such a tiny little thing.\n\nGOON II\nLittle?  Naw, he's a big man.  Big man.\n\nRORSCHACH'S FACE shows no emotion.  He moves forward in the line.  A\nSERVER drops a gristly chunk of meat on his tin plate.\n\nGOON III\nI'd like to get his autograph.  I got my autograph book right here. .\n.\n\nGOON III reaches into his pocket and withdraws an ICEPICK.\n\nGOON III (cont.)\nNotched up some big names over the years.\n\nSuddenly RORSCHACH spins, catching GOON III's head with the edge of\nhis dinner tray.  The icepick clatters to the floor.  GOON III\nfollows.\n\nThe others are on him in an instant, PINNING HIM against the serving\ncounter.  Instead of resisting, RORSCHACH vaults backward.  He brings\na KNEE up into GOON II's chine, grabs a fistful of GOON I's hair, and\ntumbles back OVER THE COUNTER -- dragging GOON I's head, face down,\ninto a steam tray full of bubbling SOUP.\n\nLanding on his feet, keeping his grip on GOON I's hair, RORSCHACH\nuses his free hand to bury a FORK in a CAFETERIA WORKER's gut.  GOON\nII lunges at him across the counter.  He grabs a VAT off a nearby\nburner and, with a single sweep of the arm, DOUSES both GOONS -- with\nHOT COOKING FAT.\n\nAll this has taken five seconds maximum.  WHISTLES shriek as the two\ndisfigured GOONS writhe on the floor in hideous agony, faces cracked\nand smoking.  CAFETERIA WORKERS clear a path as PRISON GUARDS rush in\nwith billy clubs drawn.\n\nAs the GUARDS haul him off, RORSCHACH emits a ferocious HISS.  It\nsounds uncannily like the sizzle of boiling oil on human flesh.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n145. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY WING - NIGHT\nA prison TRUSTY wheels a cart down a long, empty corridor --\ndelivering dinner to the prisoners in solitary confinement.  Some of\nthe cells are visible, through ordinary barred entries; others are\ntotally sealed off, with sliding service trays mounted in solid metal\ndoors.\n\nAt a cell of the latter kind, the TRUSTY knocks once on the door,\nthen throws back a small panel to reveal the impassive face of\nRORSCHACH.\n\nTRUSTY\nHey Rorschach.  Those cats you threw the grease on -- they're dyin'\nman.\n(beat)\nTheir friends are talkin' 'bout it.  Say if those two go under . . .\nthis whole place blows.\n\nRORSCHACH emits his trademark HISS and turns from the door.  The\nTRUSTY chuckles in anticipation.\n\nTRUSTY (cont.)\nI'd hate to be you, man.  Locked in here with the likes of --\n\nRORSCHACH\nI'm not locked in here with them.  They're locked in here with me.\n\nWith that, the panel slides suddenly SHUT in the TRUSTY's face.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n146. INT. PRISON INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nLONG and RORSCHACH have changed rooms.  The new room -- two chairs, a\nsquare table -- is identical to the first, except for the REINFORCED\nWIRE MESH which spans its width, separating doctor from patient.\n\nThrough a narrow opening in the wire, DR. LONG slides a card across\nthe table for RORSCHACH's inspection.  It's the same series of\ninkblots as before, the \"butterfly\" leading off.  But this time, the\nsubject has decided to cooperate:\n\nRORSCHACH\nA whore fucking.\n\nDR. LONG\nWho is she?  Do you know her?\n\nToo obvious; no response.  LONG moves on to card #2 -- the \"nice\nflowers\":\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nMan's guts.  Falling out of his shirt.\n\nLONG clears his throat almost imperceptibly and nods.  Card #3:\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nDoggy.  Big old floppy-eared dog --\n(pause; then, smiling)\n-- with his skull split open.\n\nDR. LONG\nAnd what -- split -- the dog's skull open?\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhy, doctor.  I did.\n(beat)\nHe was a bad dog.\n\nRORSCHACH is toying with him now.  DR. LONG gets down to brass\ntacks.\n\nDR. LONG\nWalter.  This compulsion of yours -- to punish transgressors.  In\nyour mind . . . what gives you the right to judge?\n\nRORSCHACH\nGod isn't there to do it.\n\nDR. LONG\nWe don't know that.\n\nRORSCHACH eyes him for a moment, then nods sagely: oh yes we do.\n\nDR. LONG\nSo the rest of the world is wrong, and you're right.  Is that it?\n(no response)\nYou tried to help people once.  What turned you around?  -- Why\nwould you want to kill a dog?\n\nWith LONG firmly on the hook, RORSCHACH settles back to elucidate:\n\nRORSCHACH\nOne night I opened my eyes -- saw the world.\n\n147. EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nRuined buildings, broken windows.  The streets are silent except for\nthe distant sound of dogs BARKING.  RORSCHACH'S NARRATION continues\nOVER SCENE:\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O.)\n'75.  Kidnap case, the little Franco girl.  Weeks dragged by -- no\nword.  Thought of little child, alone, frightened . . . decided to\nintervene.\n\nThe lone figure of RORSCHACH emerges from the shadows and turns up\nhis collar.  He strides deliberately down the sidewalk past a\nramshackle wooden storm fence covered with obscene graffiti.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nGot a tip.  Abandoned dress factory in Brooklyn.\n\nHe peers through a broken slat in the fence.  In a side yard, TWO\nHUGE GERMAN SHEPHERDS growl playfully, fighting over some unseen\nobject.\n\n148. INT. DRESS FACTORY - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nA DOOR swings open and RORSCHACH enters.  He pockets a metal file,\nflicks on a flashlight.\n\nMannequins, decrepit sewing machines, rolls of rotting fabric.  The\nlight shines on a small, dank cot in the corner.  RORSCHACH wanders\nover.  He finds opened tins of food, an overturned water glass -- and\non the floor, a ROPE.\n\nThere's a pot-bellied stove nearby.  RORSCHACH crouches beside it,\nsticks a hand inside, and sifts through the ashes; he pulls out a\ncharred scrap of FABRIC from a child's pajamas, decorated with\nballoons and teddy bears.\n\nHe stands.  In the opposite corner of the room is a big wooden\nCHOPPING BLOCK.  RORSCHACH wanders over and examines the surrounding\nparaphernalia: a cleaver, a bone saw, an assortment of butcher's\nknives.  He stands there a moment, then moves to a wire-mesh\nWINDOW.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nDogs wouldn't shut up.  That's when I knew where the little girl had\ngone.\n\n149. HIS POV - THE YARD OUTSIDE - DUSK (FLASHBACK)\nThe German shepherds romp in the dying light.  We CLOSE IN ON the\ndogs until we see what it is they're tussling over: A BIG BLOODY KNOB\nOF BONE.\n\nRORSCHACH (V.O., cont.)\nDecided to wait for the owner . . .\n\n150. INT. FACTORY - ENTRY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\nKeys in the lock.  A moment later, the door swings wide;  a FAT MAN\nenters and whistles to the dogs.\n\nFAT MAN\nFred?  Barney?  Dinnerti--\n\nRORSCHACH steps out of the shadows and BASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD.\n\n151. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nRORSCHACH, master of suspense, decides to take a break in the\nstory.  He leans back in his chair.  Finally DR. LONG, dreading his\nreply, asks:\n\nDR. LONG\nThen what happened?\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . Made a little trip to the butcher store.  Locked up tight.  Had\nto break in.\n\n152. INT. FACTORY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)\nThe FAT MAN squirms on the floor, a gag in his mouth.  He's\nhandcuffed to an exposed pipe.  RORSCHACH strides into frame with a\nGROCERY SACK.\n\nHe kneels beside the FAT MAN and loosens his gag.  Then he peels off\nhis glove and reaches into the sack.\n\nFAT MAN\nWhat -- what are you d--\n\nRORSCHACH silences the FAT MAN by cramming a fistful of RAW HAMBURGER\ninto his open mouth.  He's got several pounds of the stuff, and he\nspends the next few seconds SMEARING IT all over the FAT MAN's face,\nthroat, and hands, stuffing the leftovers down his shirt.  When he's\ndone, he reaches into the sack for a big plastic bag full of STEER\nBLOOD . . . and EMPTIES IT over the FAT MAN's head.\n\nFRANTIC SCRATCHING from outside.  RORSCHACH strolls over to the door,\nand -- as the FAT MAN wriggles in helpless terror -- lets the dogs\ninside.\n\nThen he stands back and enjoys the carnage.\n\n153. INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY\nDR. LONG looks on goggle-eyed as RORSCHACH cheerfully wraps things\nup.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhen they finished eating, picked up a cleaver . . .  split their\nskulls.  Died happy.  Full bellies.\n(leaning forward)\nSee, God didn't kill the little girl.  Or the man that killed\nher . . . or the dogs, or me.  If God saw what any of us did,\nhe did't seem to mind.\n\nDR. LONG\nThat man, then, he was the first.  The first you --\n\nRORSCHACH\nSaw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make\nit that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.\n(slight smile)\nWhat else can I illuminate?\n\nLONG's had enough.  He reaches for the concealed buzzer and the\nPRISON GUARDS file in.  RORSCHACH gets up; before he turns to go, he\npoints a finger at LONG's inkblot.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nNo right and wrong, Doc.  You said so.  Maybe not a dog.  Maybe . . .\njust a man's face.\n(pause)\nSee it now?\n\nThe GUARDS drag RORSCHACH out.  DR. LONG, still queasy, empties a\ncouple of pills from a bottle and gulps them down dry.  After a\nsecond he reaches for his briefcase; as he's gathering his cards, he\nSTOPS suddenly -- his gaze riveted to the random, symmetrical pattern\non top of the stack.  Its seems to SHIFT before his eyes.\n\nLONG blinks, swallows hard.  We MOVE IN tighter and tighter on the\nRorschach blot, INKY BLACKNESS filling the screen as we.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n154. EXT. BARN - TOWARD DUSK\nA rural tree-lined area outside the city.  A COMPACT BUBBLE-CAR pulls\nup outside a big ramshackle barn and stops; DREIBERG gets out, goes to\nthe padlocked doors, fumbles in his pocket for a key.\n\nAfter a moment, LAURIE wanders up beside him.\n\nLAURIE\nEnough is enough, Daniel.  Where exactly are we?\n\nDREIBERG\nMemory lane.\n\nHe opens the padlock, ushers LAURIE inside.\n\n155. INT. BARN - A MOMENT LATER\nInside the barn is a HUGE OBLONG SHAPE covered with a TARPAULIN.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nGimme a hand with the tarp, would you?  You take that side.\n\nShe goes around and bends to unfasten the tarp.  The two of them pull\nit back to reveal . . .\n\nTHE OWLSHIP -- NIGHT OWL's high-tech HOVERCRAFT.  It's a bit\ntarnished from years of disuse, but it's still an impressive sight.\nDREIBERG stands back to admire it; an impressed LAURIE wanders around\nto join him, wearing an ear-to-ear grin.\n\nLAURIE\nThe Owlship.  I can't believe it.\n\nDREIBERG\n-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.\n\n156. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe two of them enter.  DREIBERG sits at the controls and turns on\nthe electrical system while LAURIE wanders through the cabin,\nreliving days gone by.\n\nLAURIE\nWow, this brings back some memories.  Does it still fly?\n\nDREIBERG\nI took her out a couple of summers back.  Scared the hell out of some\ncows.  -- I wonder if she'd make it down to Antarctica.\n\nLAURIE\nAntarctica??\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come\nalong.\n(pause)\nI've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a\nbad place to sit out a war.\n\nLAURIE\nWould you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be\nleft.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou and me.\n\nHe looks directly at her.  Suddenly uncomfortable, she averts her\ngaze, gets up, and begins rummaging around in the back of the\ncabin.  DREIBERG turns back to the control panel, feeling subtly\nrejected.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Yeah, you're right.  Probably wouldn't make it down there\nanyway.\n\nBehind him, LAURIE lets out a little SQUEAL of delight.  She's just\nopened a compartment door; inside it are a handful of GAUDY COSTUMES\n-- their old superhero togs.\n\nLAURIE\nDan!  The spare costumes!  I can't believe you kept them.\n\nDREIBERG\nMe neither.  Mine barely even fits.\n(chuckling)\nThe thing is, I try to remember why we did it, and I can't.  Helping\npeople, or righting wrongs, or trying to save the world . . . I don't\nknow.  It all seems so abstract.\n\nLAURIE's holding her old costume up against her shoulders, eyeing\nherself in a small mirror above a sink.\n\nLAURIE\nGod, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat are you up to?\n\nLAURIE\nDon't look.  Turn around.\n\nSmirking, he complies.  LAURIE begins to undress in the back of the\ncabin.\n\nDREIBERG\nThis'd better not be what I think it is.\n\nLAURIE\nOkay!\n\nDREIBERG turns around.  LAURIE's in full costume, looking quite\nimposing and, in a perverse way, quite beautiful.  He feigns\nshock:\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nMy God, it's the Silk Spectre -- scourge of the underworld, defender\nof the weak!\n\nLAURIE\nIn the flesh.\n\nShe ambles over to the control panel, embraces DREIBERG from behind,\nand strokes his thinning hair.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nPoor Daniel.  You really miss it all, don't you.\n\nDREIBERG\nSaving the world?  I guess I do.\n(smiling)\nMaybe we can still save ourselves . . .\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n157. EXT. SOUTH STREET SEAPORT - DUSK\nA massive PEACE RALLY downtown.  Thousands of citizens have turned\nout; PLACARDS and PROTEST SIGNS are everywhere.  Each remark is met\nby CHEERS and CHANTS, by raucous\nBOOS as well . . . and while the crowd is split between pacifists and\nhawks, they're all frightened as hell.\n\nThings are much the same in London, Berlin -- possibly even Moscow.\nThe end is nigh, and passions flare.  It's anarchy waiting to\nhappen.\n\nMAN ON STAGE\nYou know what the Joint Chiefs of Staff are doing right now?  They're\nsitting in the Pentagon talking about a first strike.  That's right --\na first strike!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD\nYou think the reds ain't doing the same thing?\n\nMAN ON STAGE\nThen for the love of God let's negotiate.  We can start a war.  But\nwe can't stop it!!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD II\nIt's pinko simps like you that drove Dr. Manhattan to Mars!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD III\nDr. Manhattan was an inhuman fascist!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD IV\nIt's God's judgment!  Jesus is the way!\n\nA HECKLER fights his way onstage and lunges for the microphone:\n\nHECKLER\nRussia's just been waiting for an opening.  They won't show us\nno mercy.  I say NUKE 'EM NOW!!\n\nMAN ON STAGE\nYou think this is some kind of grudge match??  We're talking the\nend of the world!!\n\nThe two of them grapple at the mike, and the HECKLER falls off the\nstage.  On cue, the crowd ERUPTS.  FIGHTS break out; COPS start\nswinging rifle butts.\n\nAs PRO-NUKERS swarm the stage, our gaze turns upward.  A trio of\nHOVERCRAFT hangs in the air above the seaport.  Their undersides --\noutfitted with heavy artillery on turrets -- bear the initials\n\"CTU\"\n\n158. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK\nCTU MEN watch the nascent riot through a plexiglass canopy.\n\nCTU CAPTAIN\nI've had it with these a-holes.  Drop the gas.\n\n159. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK\nPANIC amongs the crowds as TEAR GAS CANISTERS explode in their\nmidst.  The CTU ships descend ever closer to the ground.\n\nLOUDSPEAKER\nCEASE AND DESIST AT ONCE.  WE WILL NOT HESITATE TO USE FORCE.\n\nA couple of COPS go down in the melee.  RIOTERS grab their rifles,\nturn them on the CTU ships overhead.  OTHERS in the crowd fling\nrocks, brickbats -- whatever's handy.  HYSTERIA RULES.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n160. INT. BARN - DUSK\nDREIBERG walks around to the front of the Owlship with a TOOLKIT,\nwiping his hands on an oily rag.  He calls inside to LAURIE:\n\nDREIBERG\nGuess that ought to do it.  Let's shut her down --  Laurie?\n\nNo reply.  Curious, he climbs aboard.\n\n161. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nLAURIE's standing by the monitor over the instrument console.  Her\nface is distraught, agonized.\n\nLAURIE\nDaniel, you ought to take a look at this.\n\nOnscreen, it's total screaming chaos.  CANNONS on the bellies of the\nCTU HOVERCRAFT swivel randomly, spitting AUTOMATIC FIRE at the mobs\nbelow.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat the hell -- ?\n\nLAURIE\nIt's a peace rally.  The CTU's just opened fire on the crowd.\n\nDREIBERG\nOh, Laurie.  Jesus.  No.\n\nHe turns away, paralyzed with horror.  LAURIE watches awestruck.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're just mowing 'em down.\n(pause)\nThis is it.  The end of the world.  This is what it looks like.\n\nCAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on DREIBERG's stricken face as we\n\nCUT TO:\n\n162. FLASHBACK - PROCESSED FOOTAGE>\nWe're back in slo-mo sepia land, the Golden Age of Superheroes.  THE\nOWLSHIP emerges from a fogbank and rises majestically into frame,\nlike the Seventh Cavalry arriving to save the day.  As it draws\ncloser, the perspex canopy coming into view, we can just make out\nNIGHT OWL at the helm, with SILK SPECTRE riding shotgun.\n\nThere's a FRENZIED MOB below, racing right and left, their aimless\nmotions stylized and surreal.  They're beset by a sudden WINDSTORM as\nthe Owlship's powerful BLOWERS clear the TEAR GAS from this fantasy\nequivalent of the seaport plaza.  Faces turn skyward; fingers point --\n\n-- and suddenly, the footage we're watching undergoes a SUBTLE\nTRANSFORMATION.  COLORS bleed in; SOUND comes up; the pace of the\naction QUICKENS.  And when we cut back to the ship overhead, we're in\nfull-color and real-time --\n\n163. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\n-- because the Owlship is really there . . . and by God, the\nWatchmen are back in action a quarter-mile above the South St.\nSeaport!\n\n164. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe three CTU SHIPS are now visible through the cockpit dome.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay Laurie, let's see if we've still got what it takes.\n\nOn the panel, a COMPUTER TARGETING DEVICE homes in on a CTU SHIP.\n\n165. INT. CTU HOVERCRAFT - THAT MOMENT\nA RADAR MAN stares at his console in puzzlement.\n\nCTU RADAR MAN\nSir, we've got an odd blip off starboard . . .\n\nThe ship ROCKS VIOLENTLY as a sudden EXPLOSION --\n\n166. AERIAL SHOT - ON CTU HOVERCRAFT\n-- BLOWS THE CANNON MOUNT CLEANLY OFF ITS UNDERSIDE!!  The ruptured\nship WOBBLES, trying to right itself, but to no avail; jets\nsputtering, it lurches toward the harbor and SLAPS DOWN HARD against\nthe water.\n\n167. ANGLE ON CROWD\npointing at the skies in disbelief.\n\nVOICE IN CROWD\nLOOK!  UP THERE!\n\nVOICE IN CROWD II\nOh my God, it's --\n\n\n168. INT. OWLSHIP - ON DREIBERG\nHe barks into a microphone:\n\nDREIBERG\nAttention CTU!  Cease fire immediately --\n\n169. EXT. SEAPORT - THAT MOMENT - DUSK\nGround level.  From the midst of the bewildered CROWD we watch as the\nOWLSHIP and the CTU talk some serious trash:\n\nOWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER\n-- or we'll BLOW YOUR ASSES OUT OF THE SKY!\n\nCTU LOUDSPEAKER\nUNREGISTERED CRAFT.  IDENTIFY YOURSELF.\n\nOWLSHIP LOUDSPEAKER\nBABY . . . WE'RE A BLAST FROM THE PAST.\n\nThe crowd's in a frenzy.  Most of them are taking it on the lam.  But\na dozen hardy souls are standing stock-still, transfixed by the\nstrange sight overhead.\n\nVOICE IN CROWD\n. . . IT'S THE WATCHMEN!!\n\nEXCITEMENT RIPPLES through the CROWD as the CTU SHIPS bob in the air,\nclumsily turning to face their attacker.  Soon the ships are hanging\nimmobile in midair, squaring off face-to-face, a Wild West\nshowdown.  On the prows of all three craft, MISSILE LAUNCHERS rotate\ninto position.\n\n170. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG with his hand poised on the throttle.\n\nDREIBERG\nWe're gonna have to shave this one close.\n\nAn instant before the CTU rockets FIRE, DREIBERG shoves the throttle\nFULL-FORWARD.\n\n171. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\nWith a burst of flame, the Owlship BLASTS OFF.  The TWO ROCKETS\nCONVERGE on the point where the OWLSHIP was hovering a millisecond\nbefore -- and COLLIDE.  BOOM.  The OWLSHIP, meanwhile, HURTLES\nFORWARD -- slicing DIRECTLY BETWEEN the two CTU SHIPS.  The CROWD\nCHEERS.\n\n172. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nDREIBERG rides the JOYSTICK.  LAURIE watches a monitor showing the\naft view from the ship.\n\nLAURIE\nThey're following us.\n\nDREIBERG\nAll right.  Mission accomplished.\n\nHe's no sooner said it than MACHINE-GUN FIRE peppers the rear of the\nship.  He arcs hard left and DROPS, taking evasive action.\n\n173. EXT. WORLD TRADE CENTER - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaks between the twin towers.  A second later, the CTU\nSHIPS rip past on either side.\n\n174. EXT. STREET - NIGHT\nASTONISHED PEDESTRIANS GAPE at the bizarre DOGFIGHT above them.  The\nOWLSHIP doglegs around a darkened office building.  A CTU MISSILE\nblows a HOLE in its facade.\n\n175. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP\nfiring TWO MISSILES aftward at the pursuing craft.\n\n176. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG exhilarated.  LAURIE, worried, checking the radar\nreadout:\n\nLAURIE\nMissed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.\n\nLAURIE\n(checking the monitor)\nThey're practically on us . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nThat Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.\n\nHe punches a button on the dash.  It's labelled \"TURBO.\"\n\n177. AERIAL SHOT - ON AIRSHIP\nThe turbojets kick in and the Owlship ACCELERATES to 400 mph, leaving\nthe CTU craft in the dust.\n\n178. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT\nA line of TRAFFIC enters the tunnel.  The Owlship SWOOPS suddenly,\nand -- just clearing the arch -- ENTERS ABOVE THEM.\n\nA moment later, the LEAD CTU SHIP tries to follow.  Bad move.  The\nless-maneuverable craft rams into the LIP of the arch -- and\nEXPLODES\n\nThe SECOND CTU SHIP hurtles toward a similar fate.  But at the last\nmoment -- retro-jets blasting at full force -- it manages to STOP\nITSELF.  It backs up slightly, edges up OVER the tunnel, and settles\nfor the airborne route.\n\n179. INT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER\nThe OWLSHIP zooms through the tunnel, mere feet above the tops of the\ncars.  HORNS HONK.  BRAKES SCREECH.\n\nThere's an oversized TRUCK directly in its path.  The OWLSHIP nudges\nUP slightly -- and clears the truck by INCHES, throwing off SPARKS\nagainst the roof of the tunnel.\n\n180. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe end of the tunnel is coming up fast.\n\nDREIBERG\nFog blowers on.  Activate radar shields.\n\n181. EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - OPPOSITE END - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP emerges from the tunnel and noses UPWARD at an\nalmost-vertical angle, spewing DENSE CLOUDS OF BILLOWING FOG in its\nwake.  A few seconds later, the lone remaining CTU ship arrives --\nbut, seeing only FOG and no trace of the OWLSHIP, it pushes forward\non a horizontal course and disappears into the darkness beyond the\nwater.\n\n182. INT. OWLSHIP - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nThey're in the middle of a cloudbank.  DREIBERG is wearing a look of\nintense satisfaction as LAURIE nervously checks the radar.\n\nLAURIE\nWe lost him.\n\nHe flashes her a smug little smile.  LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, she\nshakes her head and buries her faces in her hands.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nOh, Daniel . . . we are in deep shit now.\n\nFADE THROUGH TO:\n\n183. INT. PRISON MESS HALL - NIGHT\nThe usual assortment of jailbirds lined up with trays in the serving\nline.  A PRISON TRUSTY, in hospital-orderly whites, enters the hall\nand falls in at the end of the line.  He nudges the CON in front of\nhim.\n\nTRUSTY\nJust left the infirmary.  Lost Otis about twenty minutes ago.\n\nThe CON nods, and whispers to the man in front of him.  The news goes\nthrough the serving line like wildfire.  Within a matter of seconds,\nit's reached the jailbird at the front of the line -- a hulk named\nT-BONE.\n\nCON IN LINE\nOtis went down.\n\nT-BONE nods and carries his tray to a nearby table, where a cadre of\nSIX ENORMOUS THUGS are munching away.  Presiding over them is the\nbiggest man in the pen -- who happens, ironically, to be a MIDGET:\nLITTLE BIGGER.\n\nT-BONE\nJust heard, boss.  Otis bought it.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nFuckin' Rorschach.\n(nodding to himself)\nThis joint goes up.  Tonight.\n\n184. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nDrifting lazily through a cloudbank.  The blunt prow of the owlship\nemerges gradually from a shroud of fog and catches a shaft of pale\nblue moonlight.\n\n185. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nThrough the cockpit window the distant city skyline glimmers, then\ndisappears again behind wisps of cloud.  We're taking a dreamy tour\nof the stratosphere, slow and elegant.  Somewhere, Billie Holiday is\nsinging \"You're My Thrill.\"\n\nInstruments blink and peep on the panel.  No one's at the\ncontrols.\n\nThe ship lurches.  A wine bottle tips and rolls noisily across the\nwidth of the cabin floor.  A woman's hand reaches for it, sets it\nright.\n\nIt's LAURIE, who's midway through a two-minute kiss with DREIBERG.\nThe pair of them are locking in a tight, post-coital embrace on the\ncabin floor, their clothing in heaps around them.\n\nLAURIE\nBetter.  Much better.\n\nDREIBERG starts to say something, settles back with a serene smile\ninstead.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nI bet I know what made the difference this time.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat?\n\nLAURIE\n(smirking)\nThe costumes.  Am I right?\n\nDREIBERG seems mildly shocked by the proposition.  Then, despite\nhimself, he starts to chortle.  She pokes him playfully on the arm.\n\nLAURIE (cont.)\nCome on.  Admit it!\n\nDREIBERG\nNo way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.\n\nLAURIE\nYes you are.\n\nDREIBERG\n(drily)\nNo offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.\n(pause; then, seriously)\nTonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.\n\nLAURIE\nThat's because --\n\nDREIBERG\nIt's because there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.  The world's\nabout to end.\n(a weird smile)\nI feel like I could save it.\n\nHe grabs his cloak, wraps it around him, and moves purposefully to\nthe instrument panel.  He throws a few switches, arcs the Owlship\nhard right.\n\nLAURIE\nYou're full of yourself.  What are you doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nLong as we're on the subject of perverts . . .\n(turning to face her)\nI miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.\n\nLAURIE\n. . . What??\n\nDREIBERG -- rejuvenated, exhilarated, smiling ear-to-ear -- reaches\nfor the throttle and kicks the ship in to overdrive.\n\n186. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT\nAFTERBURNERS belch flame as the Owlship accelerates, ripping through\nthe clouds above the city.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n187. SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PRISON\n-- and as Sly Stone once said, there's a riot goin' on.  SIRENS HOWL\nas we get several quick glimpses of gleeful CONVICTS running wild:\ndisabling guards, overrunning cell blocks, liberating weapons,\nthrowing food.\n\n188. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE, back in full costume.  DREIBERG's eyes are\nriveted to a monitor over the controls:\n\nDREIBERG\nI think we're just a trifle late.\n\nLAURIE\nJesus, Dan.  Out of the frying pan . . .\n\nThe MONITOR shows a magnified view of the PRISON COMPLEX below\nthem.  The prisoners have taken the quad, and are exchanging fire\nwith the guards in the watchtower.  It's an ugly, bloody mess.\n\nDREIBERG\nI know he's totally bugfuck, but he saved my life a half a dozen\ntimes.\n\n189. INT. CELL - NIGHT\nSIRENS BLARING everywhere.  RORSCHACH sits on his bunk, his legs\ndrawn up before him, his eyes darting swiftly around the cell.\n\n190. INT. MAXIMUM SECURITY BLOCK - NIGHT\nSmoke and confusion; ESCAPED CONVICTS racing to and fro past\nsprawled, unconscious GUARDS.  In the midst of all the chaos, FOUR\nMENACING FIGURES stride purposefully through the cellblock.  It's the\npsychotic midget LITTLE BIGGER, with his three henchmen CARLOS, RAFE,\nand T-BONE.\n\nWheeling an oversized ELECTRICAL ARC WELDER before them, they stop\noutside RORSCHACH's cell and GRIN in anticipation.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nFind an outlet for this thing\n(shouting)\nRorschach?  I did fifteen years because of you.  It's payback time!\n\nRAFE finds an outlet and plugs in the arc welder.  CARLOS is carrying\na big nasty MEAT CLEAVER; he slides back the panel in RORSCHACH's\ndoor, rattles the cleaver noisily in the frame.\n\nCARLOS\nSee this, runt?  We're gonna take your puny little balls off . . .\nand pickle 'em!!\n(chortling)\nAww!  I think he just wet his pants!\n\nHILARITY all around.  T-BONE shoves CARLOS aside and takes his place\nat the panel in the door:\n\nT-BONE\nLemme see.  Lemme see!\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nRelax, boys.  Everybody gets a slice of turkey -- but I get to carve.\n(to T-BONE)\nWhat's he doin' now?\n\nNo response from T-BONE, who stands there with his face pressed\ntightly to the panel.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER (cont.)\nYou deaf?  I said, what's he --\n\nHe gives T-BONE a nudge.  T-BONE's legs buckle and he topples over\nbackwards, landing flat as a board on the floor.  A SOUP SPOON\nquivers ion the air, its sharpened handle buried deep in his eye\nsocket.\n\nRAFE\nBOSS!  JESUS!\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nSon of a bitch! -- WE'RE COMING RORSCHACH.  WE'RE GONNA PEEL YOU LIKE\nA GRAPE.\n(to RAFE)\nLight the torch.\n\nRAFE ignites the arc welder and the boys go to work on the lock of\nRORSCHACH's cage.\n\n191. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT\nRORSCHACH waiting patiently on his bunk.  The metal lock on the\ninside of the cell door is beginning to glow a dull red.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n192. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG hands LAURIE what looks like a pair of electronic\nEARMUFFS.\n\nDREIBERG\nOkay, I'm turning on the screamers.  We'll have to hit the roof\nrunning . . .\n\nHe throws a switch on the control panel.\n\n193. EXT. PRISON COMPLEX - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nWINDOWS SHATTER in the guard towers as a WAILING ULTRASONIC SCREECH\nsplits the air.  On the roof of the complex, PARALYZED GUARDS drop\ntheir weapons; ESCAPED PRISONERS clutch at their burst eardrums as\nthe Owlship descends and gently touches down. . .\n\n194. INT. RORSCHACH'S CELL - THAT MOMENT\nThe LOCK is bright red and smoking.  Over on the bunk, RORSCHACH'S\nFACE is lined with exertion.  His back is wedged tight against the\nwall of the cell, his legs straining against the lip of his\nTOILET.\n\nGrunting and groaning, he manages to knock the TOILET off its\nmounting.  The PIPES SPEW.  Within seconds, the FLOOR of the cell is\nFLOODED.\n\n195. INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE DOOR - A MOMENT LATER\nRAFE kills the arc welder and stands back.\n\nRAFE\nOkay, boss, that oughta do it.\n\nThey give the door a shove.  It swings inward, and GALLONS OF WATER\ncome gushing out.  LITTLE BIGGER steps back in disgust.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER\nWHAT THE --\n\nRAFE and CARLOS gape into the cell.  They see the broken toilet, but\nthere's no trace of RORSCHACH.\n\nCARLOS\nRorschach.  Company's calling . . .\n\nRAFE\nWhere is the fuckin' runt?\n\nCARLOS advances cautiously toward the cell, the CLEAVER in his\nfist.\n\n196. INT. CELL - THAT MOMENT\nIn answer to RAFE's question, RORSCHACH is hiding behind the door.\nHe SLAMS IT SHUT on CARLO's outstretched hand; the red-hot metal of\nthe LOCK catches CARLO'S WRIST; he shrieks and drops the cleaver. . .\n\n. . . giving RORSCHACH just enough time to SNATCH IT UP.  He JUMPS,\nmonkey-like, and STANDS POISED ON HIS BUNK as the door swings wide\nand an enraged CARLOS charges in, clutching his scorched forearm.\n\nCARLOS\nYOU'RE MINE NOW, YOU LITTLE --\n\nFrom the bunk, RORSCHACH FLINGS the cleaver.  It strikes the floor\nBETWEEN RAFE and CARLOS --\n\n-- NEATLY SEVERING THE POWER CORD of the ARC WELDER --\n\n-- which is SITTING in an INCH OF STANDING WATER.  RAFE and CARLOS do\na herky-jerky DANCE as 20,000 VOLTS course through their bodies --\n\n-- and PITCH face-down into the water.  All lights in the cellblock\nDIM and DIE.\n\nLITTLE BIGGER backs off in gibbering horror as RORSCHACH climbs down\noff his bunk, emerges from the cell and calmly steps over the bodies\nof the dead.\n\nRORSCHACH\nYour move . . . runt.\n\nThe midget kingpin lets out a SCREAM and tears off down the corridor\nas fast as his stubby little legs will carry him.\n\n197. INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER\nDREIBERG and LAURIE move down a dark, abandoned corridor, trying to\nget their bearings.\n\nLAURIE\nWhere are we?  What happened to the lights?\n\nDREIBERG\nGenerators'll kick on in a minute.  We should be close to solitary .\n. .\n\nTheir heads turn toward the end of the passage, where a SECOND\nCORRIDOR crosses the one they're standing in.  As they watch, a\nSCREAMING MIDGET sprints past -- and disappears.\n\nDREIBERG and LAURIE blink in disbelief: huh?  A moment later, a\nfamiliar figure with BRIGHT RED HAIR strides past.\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . Rorschach??\n\nRORSCHACH pauses.  He stares at his costumed colleagues for a second\nand a half -- then keeps on walking.\n\n198. INT. PRISON - CROSS CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER\nThe terrified LITTLE BIGGER realizes he's just hit a dead end.  He\nthrows a glance over his shoulder, sees RORSCHACH moving up on him.\nDesperate, he ducks into a MEN'S ROOM.\n\nRORSCHACH follows, his pace measured and deliberate.  Behind him,\nLAURIE and DREIBERG have just rounded the corner into the cross\ncorridor.\n\nLAURIE\nRorschach!  Is that you??\n\nHe turns and holds up a finger: one moment, please.  Then, calm and\ndispassionate, he enters the MEN's room.  DREIBERG and LAURIE stand\nat the end of the corridor, mildly boggled.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat's he doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nI think he's going to the john.\n\nLAURIE\nMy God!  We bust him out of jail, in the middle of a riot, and\nhe stops to take a --\n\nBefore she can finish, RORSCHACH reemerges, wiping his hands on a\npaper towel.  He wanders up to join them without so much as a\n\"howdy.\"\n\nDREIBERG\n. . . That was quick.\n\nRORSCHACH\nToilet clogged.  Short fat turd.\n(beat)\nLet's get out of here.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n199. EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT\nA well-concealed RUNWAY somewhere in the heart of the Rocky\nMountains.  LIGHTS sweep the sky as GROUND CREWS run to and fro.\n\nAir Force One is coming in for a landing.\n\n200. INT. UNDERGROUND COMMAND BUNKER - A MOMENT LATER\nLots of activity: armed troops, top brass, and technicians milling\nabout.  Flashing panels on the walls read DEFCON 2.\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE LIDDY watches as a METAL DOOR clangs shut, and\nwhat looks like a GOLF CART comes toodling around a long metal\nramp.  PRESIDENT NIXON's in the passenger seat, and there's an\nimposing pile of LUGGAGE in the back.  He appears to be contemplating\na long stay.\n\nPRESIDENT NIXON\nHello, Gordon.  Have you seen Pat?\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY\nShe's all settled in.  They want you down in the command room right\naway.\n\nLIDDY hops aboard, and the golf cart turns down a seemingly endless\ncorridor which leads deep into the bowels of the Rockies.\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY (cont.)\nWeatherman says we're lookin' good.  We've got a fourteen-hour\nwindow.\n\nPRESIDENT NIXON\nFourteen hours, huh?\n\nSECRETARY LIDDY\nFourteen hours.  Unless of course the reds decide to hit us first.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n201. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nLAURIE's following the Watchmen press coverage on an overhead screen\n. . .\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- in a daring midnight jailbreak.  Earlier eyewitness reports place\nthe one-time superheroes at a peace rally in --\n\n. . . while DREIBERG and RORSCHACH sit side-by-side at the control\nconsole, occupied by other matters.\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't know if you heard.  A hired gunman tried to off Adrian.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's a fool.  Tried to warn him about new information.  Sicced his\nmangy cat on me.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat new information?\n\nRORSCHACH\nBlake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan\nsomehow involved . . .\n(scratching his chin)\n\nStrange that no one's tried to attack you, Daniel.\n\nThere's an unmistakable tone of suspicion in his voice.  DREIBERG,\nhighly offended, shoots him a look of supreme resentment.\n\nDREIBERG\nI beg your pardon . . . ?  Some gratitude.\n\nLAURIE\nWill you two lovebirds keep it down?\n\nStill grumbling at each other, DREIBERG and RORSCHACH glance up at\nthe monitor LAURIE's watching.  The face of ADRIAN VEIDT fills the\nscreen:\n\nNEWSCASTER\n. . . The man behind the Watchmen, high-tech wizard Adrian Veidt, was\nunavailable for comment.  A spokesman claimed he had left for the\nAntarctic to study a mysterious hole in the ozone layer.\n\nRORSCHACH\n\"Ozone layer\"?\n\nDREIBERG\n(rolling his eyes)\nChrist.  Couldn't he just admit that he's scared??\n\nCUT TO:\n\n202. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT\nThe last rays of sunlight bleed toward endless frozen plains of\npristine white.  A private AIRCRAFT descends toward an incongrous\nstrip of black, part of a massive complex of buildings centered\naround what looks like a NUCLEAR POWER PLANT.  (In fact, it is\none.)  This is Karnak -- VEIDT's Antarctic retreat.\n\n203. INT. KARNAK - NIGHT\nThe entry hall is vast and lavish, appointed in the same Egyptian\nstyle as his urban pyramid -- but on a grander scale.  A fur-clad\nfigure enters in a flurry of SNOW, followed by a genetically-altered\nLYNX on the end of a leash; FOUR ASIAN LACKEYS appear to greet him.\nOne of them takes his parka; a second serves him hot coffee from a\nsilver tray; a third takes the leash, and brushes snow from the back\nof the lynx.  Number four is in charge of protocol.\n\nLACKEY\nWelcome, sir.  We did not expect you so soon.\n\nVEIDT\nFeed Bubastis.  I'll have dinner when I've looked in on the world.\n\nThey hear and obey.  Two of them fall in behind VEIDT and follow him\nto:\n\n204. INT. INFORMATION CENTER - NIGHT\nThe room is empty but for a single chair, with a complicated\nREMOTE-CONTROL KEYPAD mounted on the armrest.  Across from the chair,\nRED VELVET CURTAINS hang from ceiling to floor.\n\nVEIDT takes a seat, and his LACKEYS draw back the curtains to reveal\na towering WALL OF TELEVISIONS -- 200 monitors in a 10x20 grid,\npicking up transmissions from all over the world.  It's far more\ninformational than the human mind could possibly digest at one gulp,\na hectic jumble of color and motion.  VEIDT loves it.  He settles in\nand his eyes begin to rove.\n\n205. ANGLE ON VIDEO WALL\nPANNING across transmissions of every variety -- commercials,\nsitcoms, sportscasts -- we settle on a screen labelled \"LONDON.\"\nVEIDT hits the volume button on his remote, and a NEWSCASTER'S VOICE\ncomes up.  On the wall behind her is a civil defense\nlogo . . .\n\nBBC NEWSCASTER\n-- best situated in a cellar room, as far away from windows as\npossible.  Cinderblock walls are preferred, but a makeshift shelter\ncan be constructed of sandbags, or of boxes filled with --\n\nFLICK, and the sound dies.  VEIDT's gaze drifts several screens to\nthe right, to the monitor labelled \"WASHINGTON D.C.\"  Sound up:\n\nNEWSCASTER\n-- amid rumors that top-ranking officials and military personnel have\nalready been relocated to underground bunkers.  White House spokesmen\ninsist that no such precautions have yet been taken and that ongoing\nnegotiations --\n\nFLICK: sound down.  Now we shift to a closed-circuit monitor at the\nbottom right of the bank -- an exterior view of VEIDT's antarctic\nretreat as seen by a surveillance camera.  FLICK: same subject, new\nangle.  FLICK: a RADAR SCREEN, which shows no activity; the skies are\nclear.  FLICK --\n\n-- and now things get downright weird.  Because all at once we're\nwatching DR. JONATHAN OSTERMAN, the earnest you scientist from\ntwenty-some years ago; he's sitting at a table in the Gila Flas\ncanteen, across from JANEY SLATER, and he's getting ready to\npropose.\n\n206. REVERSE ANGLE - ON VEIDT\neyeing young Osterman with a strange, grave smile.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n207. EXT. AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT\nLOW ANGLE on the Owlship as it descends slowly through the clouds.\nOn its underbelly, a VIDEO CAMERA grinds and rotates.\n\n208. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nDREIBERG and LAURIE watch a monitor which shows an overhead view of\nthe city.  He punches up a series of PROGRESSIVE MAGNIFICATIONS,\ngradually zeroing in on a single city block.  It's been cordoned off,\nPOLICE BUBBLE-CARS are parked up and down its length.\n\nDREIBERG\nThey've got my building surrounded.\n(looking up at her)\nThey must've been following you all along.\n\nShe stares at him.  The ship LURCHES as DREIBERG kicks in the\naccelerator jets and takes off into the clouds.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nSo much for Dan Dreiberg, ordinary citizen.\n\nLAURIE\nWelcome back, Night Owl.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?\n\nRORSCHACH\nCTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat do you mean, frame-up?\n\nRORSCHACH\nObvious pattern -- all ties in --\n\nDREIBERG\nAre you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to\nget back at us?\n(spreading his hands)\nWhat about all those poor shits with cancer?\n\nTIGHT ON LAURIE, who's listening to all this with mounting\ndistress.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHow do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive\npropaganda scheme . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nCome on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --\n\nLAURIE\n(interrupting him)\nIt's not.\n\nRORSCHACH\nNot what?\n\nLAURIE\nNot \"propaganda.\"\n(pause; then, blurting it out --)\nChrist, I'm one of them!  I've got it.\n\nDREIBERG swivels abruptly in his chair and gapes at LAURIE, his face\nbone-white.  She stares at the floor, afraid to meet his eyes, her\ngrim secret revealed.  For an awkward moment neither of them can\nthink of anything to say.\n\nThen RORSCHACH, his mind already back on the \"case,\" breaks the\nsilence.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHnrrr -- changes everything.  Let's get moving.\n\n209. EXT. WATERFRONT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT\nRORSCHACH is crouched beside an exterior wall of the warehouse; he\npries off a couple of loose slats and digs around, swatting angrily\nat a RAT which scampers out of the hole.  The OWLSHIP hovers\nabove.\n\n210. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nDREIBERG, disconsolate, holds LAURIE gently by the shoulders.\n\nLAURIE\nI should've told you, Dan.  I'm sorry.  I just wanted things between\nus to be -- happy.  For a while.  I --\n\nDREIBERG\nIt doesn't change a thing, Laurie.  I love you.\n\nHe tries to pull her close but she turns away, her eyes welling up\nwith tears.\n\nLAURIE\nI love you too, Dan, I -- why don't you give me a minute to get\nmyself together, okay?\n\n211. EXT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA distraught DREIBERG descends the rope ladder from the OWLSHIP.\nRORSCHACH has uncovered a spare blot-mask; with a hiss of\nsatisfaction he pulls it on over his head.  When he turns, he sees\nDREIBERG staring slack-jawed at an inexplicable sight.\n\nAbove their heads, the OWLSHIP has begun to glow -- BRIGHT BLUE.\n\n212. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nLAURIE backs against the control panel as an iridescent blue corona\nresolves itself into the figure of DR. MANHATTAN.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  What are you doing here?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.\n\nLAURIE\nCollect me?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIn the immediate future we're on Mars.  I'm telling you goodbye.\nYou're trying to convince me to cure your illness . . .\n\nLAURIE\nJon, no -- I can't --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIt will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us\ncan do anything to change it.\n\nDREIBERG's frantically climbing the ladder.  He pokes his head inside\nthe cockpit just in time to see LAURIE reaching out for DR.\nMANHATTAN's hand.\n\nDREIBERG\nLAURIE!  DON'T --\n\nHands touch.  A shimmering blue halo surrounds DR. MANHATTAN and\nLAURIE, and the two of them DISSOLVE.\n\nStunned, DREIBERG clambers aboard.  There's obviously nothing he can\ndo.  RORSCHACH is only a second or two behind them.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhere's Laurie?\n\nDREIBERG\nI don't think she's coming with us.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n213. EXT. MARS - NIGHT\nA BLUE SLIT opens in the sky, mere inches above the Martian\nsurface;  DR. MANHATTAN steps placidly through, and a moment later\nLAURIE tumbles out behind him.  She takes a couple of halting steps,\nthen GASPS SOUNDLESSLY -- and PITCHES FORWARD onto the shifting red\nsands.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN's gone several paces before he realizes there's a\nproblem.  Eventually, though, he turns -- and spots LAURIE clawing at\nthe air, trying and failing to draw a breath.  He walks patiently back\nand extends his hand;  LAURIE grabs it, and is magically surrounded by\na HALO OF OXYGEN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe atmosphere.  I'm sorry.  These things slip my mind.\n\nLAURIE\nJesus, Jon, I nearly choked to -- where are we --\n\nIgnoring her, he turns.  She hurries to keep pace with him.  Then she\nstops in her tracks.\n\nBefore her, in the distance, looms DR. MANHATTAN's new abode: a\nPALACE OF GLASS, vast and resplendent, towering over the barren\nsands.  At its heart stands a gargantuan, ruby-colored HOURGLASS,\nsurrounded by an intricate system of gears and ratchets, spires and\npendulums . . . the guts of a clock, transfigured into a shimmering\ncrystalline castle.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI live here now.\n\nHe strides placidly forward.  LAURIE, boggled, stumbles along after\nhim.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n214. INT. OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nTIGHT ON the distraught DREIBERG, his pained face illuminated by the\nglow of the instrument panel.  RORSCHACH sits calmly behind him.\n\nRORSCHACH\nHeading south.  What's the plan?\n\nDREIBERG\nWe're running, Rorschach.  We've got no place to go.  We're\nhightailing it down to Adrian's.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's assassin.  Leads to follow.  Can't just --\n\nDREIBERG\n(exploding)\nCases, leads -- they don't matter, Rorschach.  The world's about to\nend.  If someone is trying to kill us, it doesn't\nmatter.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCoward.  Giving up.\n\nDREIBERG\nSHUT UP, Rorschach.\n\nRORSCHACH settles back, lets out a soft, thoughtful HISS.\n\nRORSCHACH\nSorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.\n(pause)\nSorry about Laurie.\n\nDREIBERG\n(choked voice)\nOkay, let's just . . . thank you.\n\nFor a few moments they fly on in silence.  RORSCHACH can't leave well\nenough alone.  Deep in thought, he scratches his chin.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt's not stupid.  Could have angle.  -- Might be good move.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n215. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT\nLAURIE follows DR. MANHATTAN up a ruby-crystal stairway which spirals\naround the exterior of his great glass castle.  Off to her side, the\nenormous gears and ratchets which rim its core are SHIFTING, MESHING\n-- like the quartz movement of a fine Swiss watch.\n\nLAURIE\nThis whole place is ticking.  Does it -- keep time?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes.  In about . . . thirty seconds, for example, you'll tell me\nyou're sleeping with Dreiberg.\n\nLAURIE\nYou -- you know about me and Dan?\n\nHe gives her a cryptic smile and marches up to the next level.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nTime is the key, Laurie.  If I can unlock the origins of time, I'll\nfinally be able to reconcile quantum physics and relativity.\n\nLAURIE looks at him crosseyed -- and heaves a sigh.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, does anybody know what the hell you're talking about?\n(flustered)\nDan's just an ordinary guy, but he talks to me.  When he looks\nat me he's seeing something more than just a -- a collection of\natoms.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\n(startled)\nThen you're sleeping with Dreiberg?\n\nLAURIE\nWell, I just, you just said -- don't act surprised.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThat's how time works, Laurie.  Everything is preordained . . . even\nmy responses.\n(nodding)\nWe're all puppets.  I'm just a puppet who can see the strings.  --\nThirty seconds.\n\nShe GROANS in frustration as they reach a balcony near the pinnacle\nof the huge glass tower.  The Martian plains spread out for miles\nbelow them; above, the stars stretch to infinity.  A chill, violent\nWIND whips across their faces.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'll be here for the next year or so.  Then I'm going to work my way\nout toward the edge of the universe.\n(staring out at the landscape)\nUtterly uncorrupted by man.  Isn't it beautiful?\n\nShe moves to the edge of the balcony, gazes off at the bleak and\nfissured Martian surface.  Suddenly she feels very alone -- and\nfrightened.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- there's something I have to know.  Did you love me\nonce?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYes, I loved you.  I left the earth when I lost you.\n\nLAURIE\nYet you must've known all along that you'd give me cancer.  Just be\nbeing with me.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't\nknow what did.\n\nLAURIE\nBut you knew that I'd -- die.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMemories of the future are just like any others.  I've tried not to\ndwell on the unpleasant ones . . .\n(pause)\nYou won't die of cancer, Laurie.  There won't be time for that.\n\nLAURIE's blood runs cold as she realizes what he's telling her.\n\nLAURIE\nThen it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've\nalways known.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\n(nodding)\nAlways.  Ever since the day I died.\n\nHe walks a few paces up the crystalline steps and surveys the\nforbidding Martian landscape.  Behind him, LAURIE buries her face in\nher hands.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN (cont.)\nDo you understand me, Laurie?  Do you see what it's been like for me\nthese last years?  Knowing that everything I knew and loved would be\ndestroyed . . . and that by leaving Earth, I would be the helpless\nagent of its destruction?\n\nLAURIE\n(sobbing)\nThen why don't you . . . do something about it!\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nBecause --\n\nLAURIE\nBecause you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.\n(angrily)\nJon.  This, this \"script\" you're following . . . who writes it?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI don't know yet.  I should be able to tell you in -- roughly six\nhundred years.\n\nThat about tears it for LAURIE.  She storms over and grabs him by the\nshoulders:\n\nLAURIE\nI can't stand any more of this.  I want to go back.  If I'm going to\ndie I want to be with -- other people.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nPlease, Laurie.  Not yet.  I've got eons stretching before me, a\nuniverse to explore.  I'll be alone.\n(reaching for her hand)\nYou're the last human being I'll ever see.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n216. AERIAL SHOT - ON OWLSHIP - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaking through the icy stratosphere above the south\nAtlantic.  Suddenly it BOUNCES in midair -- JERKS to the right -- and\nbegins to SPIRAL DOWNWARD into the clouds . . .\n\n217. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nDREIBERG is frantically throwing switches as they lurch to and fro.\nFinally he manages to get the ship righted.  RORSCHACH's taken a bad\ntumble; he picks himself up off the cabin floor and asks:\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhat happened?\n\nDREIBERG\nThe guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some\nkind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.\n\nRORSCHACH\nWhat caused it?\n\nDREIBERG\nDon't know.  Nothing I can think of --\n(apprehensively)\n-- outside of a nuclear blast.\n\nDISSOLVE TO:\n\n218. EXT. ANTARCTICA - KARNAK - NIGHT\nVEIDT'S VAST COMPLEX is little more than a DIM GLOW, barely visible\nthrough a SWIRLING BLIZZARD.\n\n219. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nVEIDT sits before his VIDEO WALL, sipping mulled wine from a goblet.  Almost simultaneously, two SCREENS -- labeled \u00b3MOSCOW\u00b2 and \u00b3WASHINGTON, D.C.\u00b2 -- go to SUDDEN BLINDING WHITE.\n\nA second later, the screens show nothing but RANDOM VIDEO NOISE.  VEIDT leans back in his chair and cocks an eyebrow, seemingly unperturbed.\n\n220. EXT. ANTARCTICA - NIGHT\nThe OWLSHIP streaks downward through a TOTAL WHITEOUT.\n\n221. INT. OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThrough the cockpit, KARNAK\u00b9s visible -- for an instant.  Then, it\u00b9s lost in the snows again.\n\nDREIBERG\nI\u00b9m taking her down.\n(frantically throwing switches)\nRadar\u00b9s blown.  I\u00b9ll have to wing it.  Strap in, Rorschach --\n\nThe SHIP ROCKS with the force of a premature IMPACT.\n\n222. EXT. ANTARCTICA - ON OWLSHIP - THAT MOMENT\nThe OWLSHIP takes a HARD BOUNCE against the snow.  The hull CRUMPLES as the craft TIPS SIDEWAYS and plows into a DEEP DRIFT.\n\nA HATCH springs open, and DREIBERG and RORSCHACH dig their way out.  They\u00b9re slightly underdressed for the weather.  Spotting the lights of KARNAK in the distance, they turn up their collars and PRESS ON.\n\n223. INT. KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nVEIDT\u00b9s eyeing the closed-circuit SECURITY MONITOR which shows the exterior of the complex.  He spots TWO TINY FIGURES slogging through the blizzard.\n\nAs he watches, the screens for \u00b3LONDON\u00b2 and \u00b3PARIS\u00b2 go WHITE.\n\n224. EXT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER\nDREIBERG and RORSCHACH, half-frozen and covered in frost, make it to the great metal entry doors -- and START BANGING.  A VIDEO CAMERA mounted over the door rotates into position.  A soothing, computerized WOMAN\u00b9S VOICE announces:\n\nVOICE\nWelcome to Karnak.  Please identify yourself.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian!  It\u00b9s Dreiberg.  For God\u00b9s sake open the doors.\n\nNothing happens.  DREIBERG POUNDS against the doors.\n\nDREIBERG (cont.)\nAdrian!  We\u00b9re freezing to death out here!\n\nHe slumps to the ground exhausted, barely able to draw a breath.  The snow lies in FOUR-FOOT DRIFTS against the door.\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . He\u00b9s not coming, Daniel.\n\n225. INT KARNAK - INFORMATION ROOM - THAT MOMENT\nOn the surveillance monitor, RORSCHACH and DREIBERG shamble off.  VEIDT stands, hits his remote.  The picture dies -- leaving a mere 199 screens in operation.\n\nThe wall is now checkerboarded with monitors showing nothing but VIDEO SNOW.  As VEIDT strides calmly out of the room, \u00b3PRAGUE\u00b2 goes white.\n\n226. EXT. KARNAK - NIGHT\nDREIBERG on his knees, half-buried in snow.  He topples forward, unable to go on.  A PAIR OF GLOVED HANDS enter frame and YANK HIM UPWARD.\n\nDREIBERG\nCan\u00b9t move . . . we\u00b9re done for.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCome on.  Found an exhaust vent.\n\nRORSCHACH drags the helpless DREIBERG around the side of the complex, where SNOW blows in flurries at the mouth of a TUNNEL-LIKE STRUCTURE.\n\nRORSCHACH (cont.)\nVeidt.  It\u00b9s been Veidt all along.  He\u00b9ll pay for this.\n\n227. INT. KARNAK - DINING HALL - NIGHT\nVEIDT alone at a long table in his cavernous dining hall, coolly eating dinner.  Behind him, above the mammoth entry doors, hangs a TAPESTRY -- Alexander slicing through the Gordian Knot.\n\nTWO BATTERED FIGURES creep silently into the hall.\n\nVEIDT sits calmly, betraying nothing.  At his side, the MUTANT LYNX\ngrowls.  His hand closes tightly around the scruff of the animal's\nneck: quiet, girl.\n\nRORSCHACH reaches into his trenchcoat and pulls out a RHODOPSIN\nFLASHER -- the same weapon CAPT. METROPOLIS used in the opening\nscene.  Suddenly . . .\n\nRORSCHACH\nVEIDT!\n\nVEIDT WHIRLS.  He flings a PLATTER, Frisbee-style, across the hall;\nit catches RORSCHACH on the chin and sends him sprawling.  DREIBERG\nbacks against a wall in horror as the LYNX comes sprinting toward\nhim, TEETH BARED.\n\nVEIDT claps his hands twice, and the CAT relents.  He reaches for a\nfuturistic STUN GUN, which has been lying on the table all along --\npart of the place setting -- and advances on his old colleagues.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?\n\nRORSCHACH\nHe's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian -- you?  You killed Blake, and --\n\nVEIDT\nYeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of\ncourse . . .\n\nDREIBERG\nThe missing scientists.\n\nVEIDT\nUh huh.  You might recognize the names.  Quite a few of them worked\nat Gila Flats.\n\nRORSCHACH\nGila Flats -- place where Jon turned into . . .\n\nVEIDT\nDr. Manhattan, right.  Now if you boys care to join me, we'll go save\nthe world.\n\n228. INT. KARNAK - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT\nGun in hand, VEIDT marches them through the halls of Karnak.\nRORSCHACH throws an occasional glance behind him; the LYNX is nipping\nat his heels.\n\nVEIDT\nBlake thought the Russians were trying to spirit off our researchers\n-- to create their own nuclear superman.  It wasn't Russia.\n(tapping his chest)\nIt was me.  When he figured that out, of course I had to kill\nhim.  The rest of it -- Rorschach's capture, my \"assassination\" --\nthat was just to keep you busy.  All that really mattered was getting\nrid of Dr. Manhattan.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat??\n\nVEIDT\nI couldn't let him interfere with my project.\n\nRORSCHACH\nVeidt.  You're the one who started World War III.\n\nVEIDT\nNo.  I just hastened the inevitable.\n(smiling)\nHe's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a\nlittle push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates\ncancer.\n\nDREIBERG\nLaurie?  You're responsible for --\n\nVEIDT reaches into his pocket for his gold cigarette case.  He pulls\nout a smoke and strikes it against the box.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nOne thing I've learned about cancer -- it's much easier to generate\nthan it is to cure.\n\nDREIBERG, enraged, CHARGES at him.  The LYNX roars.  VEIDT swings the\nstun gun across DREIBERG's face, knocking him to the floor -- and\nLEVELS the futuristic weapon DIRECTLY AT HIS HEAD.\n\nVEIDT\nLet's get something straight.  If you try that again, I'll kill you\nwithout a moment's thought.\n\nThey've reached the entrance to VEIDT's information room.  200\nSCREENS blink and flicker as he waves the gun, gesturing them\ninside.\n\nRORSCHACH\nCall off the cat and I'll kill you, Veidt.\n\nVEIDT\nBefore you do that, you might want to look at what I've been looking\nat.\n\n229. INT. INFORMATION ROOM - A MOMENT LATER\nVEIDT points them over to the monitor in the bottom right-hand\ncorner.  Onscreen, the young JON OSTERMAN sits in a lab at Gila\nFlats, reassembling a WATCH.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat is this?  It looks like Jon.\n\nVEIDT\nIt is  Jon.  Twenty-four years ago.  Before he turned into Dr.\nManhattan.\n\nDREIBERG\nGood Lord.  How'd you get it on tape?\n\nVEIDT\nIt's not on tape.  It's live.  We're watching it happen.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n230. EXT. MARS - DR. MANHATTAN'S PALACE - NIGHT\nDR. MANHATTAN peers off the edge of a balcony while, behind him,\nLAURIE dines at a sumptuously appointed table.  She feels as if she's\nhit the jackpot in some freakish contest -- Win A Dream Date On\nMars.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI almost envy you, Laurie.  In my present form I can't die.  It's a\nmystery I'd like to penetrate.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, I do not want to hear it.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI'm sorry.  Look -- there's a gas storm on the Valles Marineris . . .\n\nLAURIE\n(shaking her head)\nOh God.  I'm no more than a bug on a windshield to you.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nYou're the only human being I care for.\n\nLAURIE\nThen do me a favor.  If the world's going to end, it shouldn't matter\na bit.\n(pause)\nI want you to cure me.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI won't do that.\n\nLAURIE\nYou have the power to do it.  I want you to do it.  Please.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI explained this.  I can't.  That's not the way it happens.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  If you ever loved me -- if there's anything human left in you\n-- then do it.\n\nEyes wild, she GRABS his great blue HAND -- and THRUSTS IT into her\nchest, where it DISAPPEARS UP TO THE WRIST.\n\nHer fingers tighten around his forearm.  Their GAZES LOCK.  DR.\nMANHATTAN shuts his eyes and grimaces, as if he's got to make the\nhardest decision of his life.  And then . . .\n\nA BRILLIANT BLUE AURA engulfs them both.  It SPREADS and GROWS IN\nINTENSITY, suffusing the sky, finally BLOTTING OUT the vast Martian\nlandscape altogether.\n\nWith a sudden POP the aura begins to die.  For a split-second we see\nthe figures of LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN suspended against a great\nwhite VOID.  Then colors begin to appear; the crystal castle and the\nMartian desert gradually materialize around them.\n\nThe two of them stumble back from each other and stand there like\nstatues, awestruck.  Neither one seems quite sure what's happened.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat -- am I --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nCured, yes.\n\nUtterly spent, he staggers to the edge of the balcony, grabs a\nhandrail for support.  He looks like a man who's just had a heart\nattack.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, what is it?  What's the matter?\n\nWhen he looks up at her, he's DESOLATE -- his face filled with\nDREAD.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nSomething. . .incomprehensible has happened.  It's all gone blank on\nme.  -- I can't remember the future.\n\nSlowly -- very slowly -- she draws near and puts her arms around\nhim.\n\nLAURIE\nJon.  Let's go back to Earth.\n\nCUT TO:\n\n231. INT. KARNAK - LAB AREA - NIGHT\nVEIDT, DREIBERG, and RORSCHACH enter a lab space which puts the I.F.\nroom at Gila Flats to shame.  In the midst of the massive whirring\nmachinery sits a GLOWING BLUE DOME -- a BUBBLE of PURE ENERGY.\n\nInside its shimmering contours is a little corner of GILA FLATS.  JON\nOSTERMAN tightens a screw, and sets the movement of JANEY's watch into\nits brass housing -- totally oblivious to the strange trio watching\nhim from twenty-four years in the future.\n\nVEIDT\nGentlemen, the past.  Unfolding before your eyes.\n(pause)\nStand back from the field.  It'll blow you to bits.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat is it?  How does it work?\n\nVEIDT\nIt's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow\nbackward in time.\n(smiling)\nThere are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing\nparallel to our own --\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian -- you've lost it.\n\nVEIDT\n(pointing at the tachyon bubble)\nI've seen them!  I've seen them in there.\n(pause)\n\nIn some of them -- only a few -- the human race survives.  And it\nsurvives because Dr. Manhattan never existed.\n\nHe draws closer to the tachyon bubble.  Off to one side is the CAMERA which feeds the monitor in the VIDEO ROOM -- and beside it, mounted on a tripod, is a HIGH-POWERED TELESCOPIC RIFLE.\n\nVEIDT (cont.)\nThe creation of Dr. Manhattan was a flashpoint in history.  He threw the world balance of power totally out of whack.  And his absence -- for even a week -- virtually guaranteed a catastrophic war.\n(wild-eyed)\nDo you understand now?  Do you see what I\u00b9m going to do?  I\u00b9m going to change the past!\n\n232. EXT. OUTER SPACE - THAT MOMENT\nDR. MANHATTAN and LAURIE materialize in orbit around the earth, enveloped in a BUBBLE OF OXYGEN.  Far below, the nuclear birds are already aloft; TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT flash over New York and San Francisco.\n\nLAURIE\nWe\u00b9re too late.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nIt\u00b9s very strange.  Time\u00b9s flowing backwards . . .\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- what??\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThe south pole.  Time\u00b9s flowing backwards.\n\n233. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\nInside the tachyon chamber, JON OSTERMAN fits the glass crystal back into place on JANEY\u00b9s watch.  VEIDT looks on in fascination.\n\nVEIDT\nAt first we could only watch the past.  Now we can reach out and touch it.\n\nHe steps over to the rifle, peers through the telescopic sight.\n\nVEIDT\nIt ate up enough megawatts to light the eastern seaboard for a year and a half -- but last week I managed to open a dime-sized hole for almost three seconds.\n(turning to face them)\nIn a minute I\u00b9ll do it again.  And if my aim is true, I\u00b9ll put a bullet through Jon Osterman\u00b9s heart . . . and Dr. Manhattan will never be born.\n\nDREIBERG and RORSCHACH trade looks of disbelief.\n\nRORSCHACH\n. . . And they call me a fucking nut.\n\nDREIBERG\nAdrian.  It\u00b9s too late.  The world is blowing up as we stand here.\n\nVEIDT\nDon\u00b9t be obtuse, Daniel.  If I kill Jon in the past, none of this will happen.  We won\u00b9t even be here, will we?\n\nDREIBERG\nAnd what if you\u00b9re wrong?\n\nVEIDT\nI\u00b9m not.\n\nDREIBERG\nWhat if you\u00b9re wrong??\n\nVEIDT\nThen I\u00b9ve been a very bad boy and you\u00b9ll have to spank me.  Christ!\n(shouting)\nI\u00b9m doing what I have to do to save the godforsaken human race!!\n\n234. EXT. ANTARCTICA - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT\nA POCKET OF BLUE HAZE materializes in the snow-swept skies above KARNAK.  Inside it: LAURIE and DR. MANHATTAN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nThat\u00b9s it.  That\u00b9s the source of the time disturbance.\n\nLAURIE\nJon, where are we?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nVeidt\u00b9s complex.\n\n235. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\n\nTwenty-four years ago, JON OSTERMAN is packing his jeweler\u00b9s tools, folding his swatch of black velvet.  In the present, VEIDT is raving:\n\nVEIDT\nYour problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years\nchasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . .\nas if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.\n\nDREIBERG\nYou ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist\nbullshit is going to save the world?\n\nVEIDT\nWe'd better hope so.  -- It's almost time.\n\nHe kicks a floor switch.  GIANT NUCLEAR GENERATORS begin to hum.\nThen he bends over the rifle and peers through the sight.\n\n236. VEIDT'S POV - THROUGH CROSSHAIRS\nIn the past, JON OSTERMAN is reaching for his lab coat when he hears\na SQUEAK.  He picks up a broom . . .\n\n237. INT. KARNAK - LAB - THAT MOMENT\nA LUMINESCENT WHITE SPOT appears on the surface of the tachyon\nbubble.  There's a hideous WHINE as a tiny HOLE begins to open up\n--  DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF VEIDT'S RIFLE.  His finger closes around the\ntrigger . . .\n\n. . . and with a TERRIBLE CRASH, the LAB WALL COLLAPSES BEHIND HIM.\nVEIDT DIVES BACKWARD, DODGING RUBBLE . . .\n\n. . . as a BLUE GIANT, THIRTY FEET TALL, steps into the lab -- with\nLAURIE at his side.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nWHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?\n\nVEIDT\nJon!  Get back!  You don't understand.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN stares down at the TACHYON BUBBLE and sees\nhimself -- his former self -- chasing a MOUSE out of\nthe I.F. chamber at Gila Flats.  His eyes go wide.  Even he's\nsurprised.\n\nIn the ensuing panic, DREIBERG dives at VEIDT.  VEIDT manages to\nsidestep him, frantically trying to get to his rifle.  The HOLE IN\nTHE BUBBLE has grown to the size of a quarter.\n\nVEIDT lunges toward the rifle.  LAURIE's directly in his path.  He\nshoves her aside; they grapple; he flings her to the ground and\npoints his STUN GUN directly at her --\n\n-- and a millisecond later, he\u00b9s aiming at NOTHING.  DR. MANHATTAN has instantaneously TELEPORTED LAURIE across the room, out of his line of fire.\n\nVEIDT looks up in horror, just in time to see a BLUE BOLT OF LIGHTNING launching itself from DR. MANHATTAN\u00b9s outstretched finger --\n\nVEIDT\nNO!!!!\n\n-- and in the wink of an eye, he\u00b9s VAPORIZED.  All that\u00b9s left is a pair of CHARRED BOOTS, still standing upright.\n\nDREIBERG rushes over to LAURIE, takes her in his arms.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat was he doing?\n\nDREIBERG\nTrying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN stares at the TACHYON BUBBLE, mesmerized.  Inside, the door to the I.F. chamber has just swung SHUT on a terrified JON OSTERMAN.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nHe was right.\n\nRORSCHACH, LAURIE, and DREIBERG stare up at the blue behemoth in puzzlement.  DR. MANHATTAN begins to shrink to normal size.  He runs his hand over the surface of the tachyon bubble; BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS shoot off in all directions.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nHe did it.  Veidt broke the code.  It\u00b9s so elegant.  It\u00b9s so obvious.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\u00b9s off in another world, as usual.  He wears a BEATIFIC SMILE as he watches his own imminent destruction in the tachyon chamber.\n\nLAURIE\nJon --\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nSpace and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.\n\nLAURIE\nJon -- for God\u00b9s sake, what do you see?\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nI see what the watchmaker made.  I see the universe!\n\nHe lifts his arms; PARTICLES OF LIGHT appear from nowhere and whiz\naround his body like superaccelerated fireflies.  The lights in the\nroom dim; it's as if DR. MANHATTAN is absorbing all the power of the\nworld into his own massive frame.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nMy work here is finished . . .\n\nThe others cower.  They sense that something large is about to\nhappen.  In the past, JON OSTERMAN is pounding on the glass of the\ntest chamber; in the present, DR. MANHATTAN reaches out to touch the\ntiny\nhole in time.\n\nHe does, and in a BLAZE of BLINDING BLUE LIGHT the tiny rift EXPANDS\ninto a SHIMMERING FISSURE.  DR. MANHATTAN PEELS BACK ITS EDGES AND\nSTEPS THROUGH . . . INTO THE PAST.\n\n238. INT. TEST CHAMBER - THAT MOMENT\nJON OSTERMAN turns away from the observation panel.  To his utter\nbewilderment, a HUGE BLUE FIGURE -- surrounded by sparks and smiling\ngloriously -- has materialized in the chamber behind him.\n\nDR. MANHATTAN\nDon't be afraid, Jon.  I'll be here with you.\n\nA second before the particle cannons kick in, DR. MANHATTAN steps\nforward -- and FUSES WITH JON, their bodies becoming one.\n\nFor a moment JON is still visible, with DR. MANHATTAN's frame\nsurrounding him, like a translucent shield of pure energy; then DR.\nMANHATTAN coalesces into a solid protective HUSK around him.  As the\nchamber begins to glow, a network of HAIRLINE CRACKS spreads across\nthe shell of his body.  BLUE LIGHT spills through the seams; he\nspreads his hands -- no in pain, but in triumph; and with a blinding\nFLASH, DR. MANHATTAN explodes outward, a million fragments merging\nwith nothingness . . .\n\n. . . to expose a dumbstruck JON OSTERMAN in his place.  The blue\nlight dims and the chamber reverts to normal.  Miraculously, he's\nalive -- astonished, but perfectly intact.\n\n239. INT. GILA FLATS TEST LAB - A MOMENT LATER\nThe timelocked door pops open and JON staggers out into the midst of\nhis awed colleagues, who've seen everything through the observation\npanel.\n\nSCIENTIST\nWhat in the name of God . . .\n\nThe SCIENTISTS advance cautiously toward the chamber.  JANEY,\nsobbing, rushes forward and throws her arms around the dazed JON.  As\nshe clings to him, her face pressed tightly against his chest, he\nlooks down at his hands; his fist is still closed around . . .\n\nJON\nYour watch, Janey.  I fixed your watch --\n\nSCIENTIST II\nLOOK!!\n\nThe SCIENTIST is staring wide-eyed at the rear wall of the chamber .\n. . which isn't there.  Instead, there's a rippling, irregular\nRUPTURE -- a pulsating HOLE IN TIME -- and visible beyond it are\nthree odd-looking and very frightened figures: DREIBERG, LAURIE, and\nRORSCHACH.\n\n240. REVERSE ANGLE - VEIDT'S LAB - THE PRESENT\nDREIBERG, LAURIE, and RORSCHACH stare THROUGH the rupture at the\nastounded SCIENTISTS.\n\nLAURIE\nWhat happened -- ?\n\nDREIBERG\nHe saved himself.  He changed the past.\n\nLAURIE\nWhere did he go?\n\nBefore DREIBERG can suggest an answer, the cleft in time begins to\nTHROB and SHIMMER, slowly SEALING ITSELF OFF before their eyes.  For\na moment everything's back to normal --\n\n-- and then, to their mounting horror, the room they're in begins to\nDISSOLVE AROUND THEM . . . FADING AWAY INTO A BLANK WHITE VOID.\n\nA sudden percussive POP.  The white void seems to shrivel around\nthem, collapsing into a protective bubble of force as they plunge\ninto . . .\n\n241. EXT.

Life is uncertain, as the preacher tells us; and what will the world say if kind, humane, and benevolent Ben.  Franklin should leave his friends and the world deprived of so pleasing and profitable a work; a work which would be useful and entertaining not only to a few, but to millions?  The influence writings under that class have on the minds of youth is very great, and has nowhere appeared to me so plain, as in our public friend's journals.  It almost insensibly leads the youth into the resolution of endeavoring to become as good and eminent as the journalist.  Should thine, for instance, when published (and I think it could not fail of it), lead the youth to equal the industry and temperance of thy early youth, what a blessing with that class would such a work be!  I know of no character living, nor many of them put together, who has so much in his power as thyself to promote a greater spirit of industry and early attention to business, frugality, and temperance with the American youth.  Not that I think the work would have no other merit and use in the world, far from it; but the first is of such vast importance that I know nothing that can equal it.\"\n\n\nThe foregoing letter and the minutes accompanying it being shown to a friend, I received from him the following:\nLetter from Mr. Benjamin Vaughan.\n\"PARIS, January 31, 1783.\n\n\"My DEAREST SIR:  When I had read over your sheets of minutes of the principal incidents of your life, recovered for you by your Quaker acquaintance, I told you I would send you a letter expressing my reasons why I thought it would be useful to complete and publish it as he desired.  Various concerns have for some time past prevented this letter being written, and I do not know whether it was worth any expectation; happening to be at leisure, however, at present, I shall by writing, at least interest and instruct myself; but as the terms I am inclined to use may tend to offend a person of your manners, I shall only tell you how I would address any other person, who was as good and as great as yourself, but less diffident.  I would say to him, Sir, I solicit the history of your life from the following motives:  Your history is so remarkable, that if you do not give it, somebody else will certainly give it; and perhaps so as nearly to do as much harm, as\nyour own management of the thing might do good.  It will moreover present a table of the internal circumstances of your country, which will very much tend to invite to it settlers of virtuous and manly minds.  And considering the eagerness with which such information is sought by them, and the extent of your reputation, I do not know of a more efficacious advertisement than your biography would give.  All that has happened to you is also connected with the detail of the manners and situation of a rising people; and in this respect I do not think that the writings of Caesar and Tacitus can be more interesting to a true judge of human nature and society.  But these, sir, are small reasons, in my opinion, compared with the chance which your life will give for the forming of future great men; and in conjunction with your Art of Virtue (which you design to publish) of improving the features\nof private character, and consequently of aiding all happiness, both\npublic and domestic.  The two works I allude to, sir, will in\nparticular give a noble rule and example of self-education. School and other education constantly proceed upon false principles, and show a clumsy apparatus pointed at a false mark; but your apparatus is simple, and the mark a true one; and while parents and young persons are left destitute of other just means of estimating and becoming prepared for a reasonable course in life, your discovery that the thing is in many a man's private power, will be invaluable!  Influence upon the private character, late in life, is not only an influence late in life, but a weak influence.  It is in youth that we plant our chief habits and prejudices; it is in youth that we take our party as to profession, pursuits and matrimony.  In youth, therefore, the turn is given; in youth the education even of the next generation is given; in youth the private and public character is determined; and the term of life extending but from youth to age, life ought to begin well from youth, and more especially before we take our party as to our principal objects.  But your biography will not merely teach self-education, but the education of a wise man; and the wisest man will receive lights and improve his progress, by seeing detailed the conduct of another wise man.  And why are weaker men to be deprived of such helps, when we see our race has been blundering on in the dark, almost without a guide in\nthis particular, from the farthest trace of time?  Show then, sir, how\nmuch is to be done, both to sons and fathers; and invite all wise men to become like yourself, and other men to become wise. When we see how cruel statesmen and warriors can be to the human race, and how absurd distinguished men can be to their acquaintance, it will be instructive to observe the instances multiply of pacific, acquiescing manners; and to find how compatible it is to be great and domestic, enviable and yet\ngood-humored.\n\n\"The little private incidents which you will also have to relate, will\nhave considerable use, as we want, above all things, rules of prudence in ordinary affairs; and it will be curious to see how you have acted in these.  It will be so far a sort of key to life, and explain many things that all men ought to have once explained to them, to give, them a chance of becoming wise by foresight.  The nearest thing to having experience of one's own, is to have other people's affairs brought before us in a shape that is interesting; this is sure to happen from your pen; our affairs and management will have an air of simplicity or importance that will not fail to strike; and I am convinced you have conducted them with as much originality as if you had been conducting discussions in politics or philosophy; and what more worthy of experiments and system (its importance and its errors considered) than human life?\n\n\"Some men have been virtuous blindly, others have speculated\nfantastically, and others have been shrewd to bad purposes; but you, sir, I am sure, will give under your hand, nothing but what is at the same moment, wise, practical and good, your account of yourself (for I suppose the parallel I am drawing for Dr. Franklin, will hold not only in point of character, but of private history) will show that you are ashamed of no origin; a thing the more important, as you prove how little necessary all origin is to happiness, virtue, or greatness.  As no end likewise happens without a means, so we shall find, sir, that even you yourself framed a plan by which you became considerable; but at the same time we may see that though the event is flattering, the means are as simple as wisdom could make them; that is, depending upon\nnature, virtue, thought and habit. Another thing demonstrated will be the propriety of everyman's waiting for his time for appearing upon the stage of the world.  Our sensations being very much fixed to the moment, we are apt to forget that more moments are to follow the first, and consequently that man should arrange his conduct so as to suit the whole of a life.  Your attribution appears to have been applied to your life, and the passing moments of it have been enlivened with content and enjoyment instead of being tormented with foolish impatience or regrets.  Such a conduct is easy for those who make virtue and themselves in countenance by examples of other truly great men, of whom patience is so often the characteristic.  Your Quaker correspondent, sir (for here again I will suppose the subject of my letter resembling Dr. Franklin), praised your frugality, diligence and temperance, which\nhe considered as a pattern for all youth; but it is singular that he\nshould have forgotten your modesty and your disinterestedness, without which you never could have waited for your advancement, or found your situation in the mean time comfortable; which is a strong lesson to show the poverty of glory and the importance of regulating our minds. If this correspondent had known the nature of your reputation as well as I do, he would have said, Your former writings and measures would secure attention to your Biography, and Art of Virtue; and your Biography and Art of Virtue, in return, would secure attention to them. This is an advantage attendant upon a various character, and which brings all that belongs to it into greater play; and it is the more useful, as perhaps more persons are at a loss for the means of improving their minds and characters, than they are for the time or the inclination to do it.  But there is one concluding reflection, sir, that will shew the use of your life as a mere piece of biography.  This style of writing seems a little gone out of vogue, and yet it is a very useful one; and your specimen of it may be particularly serviceable, as it will make a subject of comparison with the lives of various public\ncutthroats and intriguers, and with absurd monastic self-tormentors or vain literary triflers.  If it encourages more writings of the same kind with your own, and induces more men to spend lives fit to be written, it will be worth all Plutarch's Lives put together.  But being tired of figuring to myself a character of which every feature suits only one man in the world, without giving him the praise of it, I shall end my letter, my dear Dr. Franklin, with a personal application to your proper self.  I am earnestly desirous, then, my dear sir, that you should let the world into the traits of your genuine character, as civil broils may otherwise tend to disguise or traduce it.  Considering your great age, the caution of your character, and your peculiar style of thinking, it is not likely that any one besides yourself can be sufficiently master of the facts of your life, or the intentions of your mind.  Besides all this, the immense revolution of the present period, will necessarily turn our attention towards the author of it, and when virtuous principles have been pretended in it, it will be highly important to shew that such have really influenced; and, as your own character will be the principal one to receive a scrutiny, it is proper (even for its effects upon your vast and rising country, as well as upon England and upon Europe) that it should stand respectable and\neternal.  For the furtherance of human happiness, I have always\nmaintained that it is necessary to prove that man is not even at\npresent a vicious and detestable animal; and still more to prove that good management may greatly amend him; and it is for much the same reason, that I am anxious to see the opinion established, that there are fair characters existing among the individuals of the race; for the moment that all men, without exception, shall be conceived abandoned, good people will cease efforts deemed to be hopeless, and perhaps think of taking their share in the scramble of life, or at least of making it comfortable principally for themselves.  Take then, my dear sir, this work most speedily into hand:  shew yourself good as you are good; temperate as you are temperate; and above all things, prove yourself as one, who from your infancy have loved justice, liberty and concord, in a way that has made it natural and consistent for you to have acted, as we have seen you act in the last seventeen years of your life.  Let Englishmen be made not only to respect, but even to love you.  When they think well of individuals in your native country, they will go nearer to thinking well of your country; and when your countrymen see themselves well thought of by Englishmen, they will go nearer to thinking well of England.  Extend your views even further; do not stop at those who speak the English tongue, but after having settled so many points in nature and politics, think of bettering the whole race of men.  As I have not read any part of the life in question, but know only the character that lived it, I write somewhat at hazard.  I am sure, however, that the life and the treatise I allude to (on the Art of Virtue) will necessarily fulfil the chief of my expectations; and still more so if you take up the measure of suiting these performances to the several views above stated.  Should they even prove unsuccessful in all that a sanguine admirer of yours hopes from them, you will at least have framed pieces to interest the human mind; and whoever gives a feeling of pleasure that is innocent to man, has added so much to the fair side of a life otherwise too much darkened by anxiety and too much injured by pain.  In the hope, therefore, that you will listen to the prayer addressed to you in this letter, I beg to subscribe myself, my dearest sir, etc., etc.,\n\n\"Signed, BENJ. VAUGHAN.\"\nContinuation of the Account of my Life, begun at Passy, near Paris,\n1784.\n\nIt is some time since I receiv'd the above letters, but I have been too busy till now to think of complying with the request they contain. It might, too, be much better done if I were at home among my papers, which would aid my memory, and help to ascertain dates; but my return being uncertain, and having just now a little leisure, I will endeavour to recollect and write what I can; if I live to get home, it may there be corrected and improv'd.\n\nNot having any copy here of what is already written, I know not whether an account is given of the means I used to establish the Philadelphia public library, which, from a small beginning, is now become so considerable, though I remember to have come down to near the time of that transaction (1730). I will therefore begin here with an account of it, which may be struck out if found to have been already given.\n\nAt the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston. In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they sold only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books. Those who lov'd reading were obliged to send for their books from England; the members of the Junto had each a few. We had left the alehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in. I propos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room, where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences, but become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wish'd to read at home. This was accordingly done, and for some time contented us.\n\nFinding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to render the benefit from books more common, by commencing a public subscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by which each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them. So few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to find more than fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for this purpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum. On this little fund we began. The books were imported; the library was opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers, on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned. The institution soon manifested its utility, was imitated by other towns, and in other provinces. The libraries were augmented by donations; reading became fashionable; and our people, having no publick amusements to divert their attention from study, became better acquainted with books, and in a few years were observ'd by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other countries.\n\nWhen we were about to sign the above mentioned articles, which were to be binding on us, our heirs, etc., for fifty years, Mr. Brockden, the scrivener, said to us, \"You are young men, but it is scarcely probable that any of you will live to see the expiration of the term fix'd in the instrument.\" A number of us, however, are yet living; but the instrument was after a few years rendered null by a charter that incorporated and gave perpetuity to the company.\n\nThe objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the subscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's self as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to raise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's neighbours, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practis'd it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can heartily recommend it. The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid. If it remains a while uncertain to whom the merit belongs, someone more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them to their right owner.\n\nThis library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study, for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me. Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself. I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in my business continu'd as indefatigable as it was necessary. I was indebted for my printing-house; I had a young family coming on to be educated, and I had to contend with for business two printers, who were established in the place before me. My circumstances, however, grew daily easier. My original habits of frugality continuing, and my father having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently repeated a proverb of Solomon, \"Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean men,\" I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction, which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I should ever literally stand before kings, which, however, has since happened; for I have stood before five, and even had the honor of sitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.\n\nWe have an English proverb that says, \"He that would thrive, must ask his wife.\" It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd to industry and frugality as myself. She assisted me chearfully in my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old linen rags for the paper-makers, etc., etc. We kept no idle servants, our table was plain and simple, our furniture of the cheapest. For instance, my breakfast was a long time break and milk (no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer, with a pewter spoon. But mark how luxury will enter families, and make a progress, in spite of principle: being call'd one morning to breakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver! They had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife, and had cost her the enormous sum of three-and-twenty shillings, for which she had no other excuse or apology to make, but that she thought her husband deserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as well as any of his neighbors. This was the first appearance of plate and China in our house, which afterward, in a course of years, as our wealth increas'd, augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value.\n\nI had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and though some of the dogmas of that persuasion, such as the eternal decrees of God, election, reprobation, etc., appeared to me unintelligible, others doubtful, and I early absented myself from the public assemblies of the sect, Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that he made the world, and govern'd it by his Providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter. These I esteem'd the essentials of every religion; and, being to be found in all the religions we had in our country, I respected them all, tho' with different degrees of respect, as I found them more or less mix'd with other articles, which, without any tendency to inspire, promote, or confirm morality, serv'd principally to divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another. This respect to all, with an opinion that the worst had some good effects, induc'd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his own religion; and as our province increas'd in people, and new places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary contribution, my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect, was never refused.\n\nTho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinion of its propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted, and I regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only Presbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia. He us'd to visit me sometimes as a friend, and admonished me to attend his administrations, and I was now and then prevail'd on to do so, once for five Sundays successively. Had he been in my opinion a good preacher, perhaps I might have continued,[65] notwithstanding the occasion I had for the Sunday's leisure in my course of study; but his discourses were chiefly either polemic arguments, or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our sect, and were all to me very dry, uninteresting, and unedifying, since not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforc'd, their aim seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than good citizens.\n\nAt length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of Philippians, \"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, or any praise, think on these things.\" And I imagin'd, in a sermon on such a text, we could not miss of having some morality. But he confin'd himself to five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1. Keeping holy the Sabbath day. 2. Being diligent in reading the holy Scriptures. 3. Attending duly the publick worship. 4. Partaking of the Sacrament. 5. Paying a due respect to God's ministers. These might be all good things; but, as they were not the kind of good things that I expected from that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them from any other, was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more. I had some years before compos'd a little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for my own private use (viz., in 1728), entitled, Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion. I return'd to the use of this, and went no more to the public assemblies. My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it, without attempting further to excuse it; my present purpose being to relate facts, and not to make apologies for them.\n\nIX\nPLAN FOR ATTAINING MORAL PERFECTION\n\nblock-IT was about this time I conceived the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection. I wish'd to live without committing any fault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into. As I knew, or thought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the one and avoid the other. But I soon found I had undertaken a task of more difficulty than I had imagined.[66] While my care was employ'd in guarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another; habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination was sometimes too strong for reason. I concluded, at length, that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely virtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping; and that the contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired and established, before we can have any dependence on a steady, uniform rectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived the following method.\n\nIn the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in my reading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name. Temperance, for example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while by others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure, appetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our avarice and ambition. I propos'd to myself, for the sake of clearness, to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a few names with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr'd to me as necessary or desirable, and annexed to each a short precept, which fully express'd the extent I gave to its meaning.\n\nThese names of virtues, with their precepts, were:\n\n1. Temperance\n\nEat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.\n\n2. Silence.\n\nSpeak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.\n\n3. Order.\n\nLet all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.\n\n4. Resolution.\n\nResolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.\n\n5. Frugality.\n\nMake no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i. e., waste nothing.\n\n6. Industry.\n\nLose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.\n\n7. Sincerity.\n\nUse no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly; and, if you speak, speak accordingly.\n\n8. Justice.\n\nWrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.\n\n9. Moderation.\n\nAvoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.\n\n10. Cleanliness.\n\nTolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.\n\n11. Tranquillity.\n\nBe not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.\n\n12. Chastity.\n13. Humility.\n\nImitate Jesus and Socrates.\n\nMy intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I judg'd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arrang'd them with that view, as they stand above. Temperance first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up, and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits, and the force of perpetual temptations. This being acquir'd and establish'd, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that I improv'd in virtue, and considering that in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking, which only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave Silence the second place. This and the next, Order, I expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my studies. Resolution, once become habitual, would keep me firm in my endeavours to obtain all the subsequent virtues; Frugality and Industry freeing me from my remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence, would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., etc. Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras[67] in his Golden Verses, daily examination would be necessary, I contrived the following method for conducting that examination.\n\nI made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues.[68] I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the day. I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day.\n\nForm of the pages.\nTEMPERANCE.\nEAT NOT TO DULLNESS\nDRINK NOT TO ELEVATION.\nS.\tM.\tT.\tW.\tT.\tF.\tS.\nT.\nS.\t*\t*\t \t*\t \t*\nO.\t*  *\t*\t*\t \t*\t*\t*\nR.\t \t \t*\t \t \t*\nF.\t \t*\t \t \t*\nI.\t \t \t*\nS.\nJ.\nM.\nC.\nT.\nC.\nH.\nJ.\nI determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the virtues successively. Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid every the least offense against Temperance, leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance, only marking every evening the faults of the day. Thus, if in the first week I could keep my first line, marked T, clear of spots, I suppos'd the habit of that virtue so much strengthen'd, and its opposite weaken'd, that I might venture extending my attention to include the next, and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots. Proceeding thus to the last, I could go thro' a course compleat in thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year. And like him who, having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplish'd the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, I hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I made in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses, I should be happy in viewing a clean book, after a thirteen weeks' daily examination.\n\nThis my little book had for its motto these lines from Addison's Cato:\n\n\"Here will I hold. If there's a power above us\n(And that there is, all nature cries aloud\nThro' all her works), He must delight in virtue;\nAnd that which he delights in must be happy.\"\nAnother from Cicero,\n\n\"O vit\u00e6 Philosophia dux! O virtutum indagatrix expultrixque vitiorum! Unus dies, bene et ex pr\u00e6ceptis tuis actus, peccanti immortalitati est anteponendus.\"[69]\n\nAnother from the Proverbs of Solomon, speaking of wisdom or virtue:\n\n\"Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and honour. Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.\" iii. 16, 17.\n\nAnd conceiving God to be the fountain of wisdom, I thought it right and necessary to solicit his assistance for obtaining it; to this end I formed the following little prayer, which was prefix'd to my tables of examination, for daily use.\n\n\"O powerful Goodness! bountiful Father! merciful Guide! Increase in me that wisdom which discovers my truest interest. Strengthen my resolutions to perform what that wisdom dictates. Accept my kind offices to thy other children as the only return in my power for thy continual favours to me.\"\n\nI used also sometimes a little prayer which I took from Thomson's Poems, viz.:\n\n\"Father of light and life, thou Good Supreme!\nO teach me what is good; teach me Thyself!\nSave me from folly, vanity, and vice,\nFrom every low pursuit; and fill my soul\nWith knowledge, conscious peace, and virtue pure;\nSacred, substantial, never-fading bliss!\"\nThe precept of Order requiring that every part of my business should have its allotted time, one page in my little book contain'd the following scheme of employment for the twenty-four hours of a natural day.\n\nThe Morning.\nQuestion What good shall I do this day?\tpara\t5\tpara\t  Rise, wash, and address Powerfull Goodness! Contrive day's business, and take the resolution of the day: prosecute the present study, and breakfast.\n6\n\n\n\n\n7\n8\tpara\t  Work.\n9\n10\n11\nNoon.\tpara\t12\tpara\t  Read, or overlook my accounts, and dine.\n1\n2\tpara\t  Work.\n3\n4\n5\nEvening\nQuestion.

Music or diversion, or conversation.Examination of the day.\n7\n8\n9\nNight\tpara\t10\tpara\t  Sleep.\n11\n12\n1\n2\n3\n4\nI enter'd upon the execution of this plan for self-examination, and continu'd it with occasional intermissions for some time. I was surpris'd to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined; but I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish. To avoid the trouble of renewing now and then my little book, which, by scraping out the marks on the paper of old faults to make room for new ones in a new course, became full of holes, I transferr'd my tables and precepts to the ivory leaves of a memorandum book, on which the lines were drawn with red ink, that made a durable stain, and on those lines I mark'd my faults with a black-lead pencil, which marks I could easily wipe out with a wet sponge. After a while I went thro' one course only in a year, and afterward only one in several years, till at length I omitted them entirely, being employ'd in voyages and business abroad, with a multiplicity of affairs that interfered; but I always carried my little book with me.\n\nMy scheme of Order gave me the most trouble;[70] and I found that, tho' it might be practicable where a man's business was such as to leave him the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, for instance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master, who must mix with the world, and often receive people of business at their own hours. Order, too, with regard to places for things, papers, etc., I found extreamly difficult to acquire. I had not been early accustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory, I was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method. This article, therefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and had such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up the attempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect, like the man who, in buying an ax of a smith, my neighbour, desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge. The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel; he turn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing. The man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went on, and at length would take his ax as it was, without farther grinding. \"No,\" said the smith, \"turn on, turn on; we shall have it bright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled.\" \"Yes,\" says the man, \"but I think I like a speckled ax best.\" And I believe this may have been the case with many, who, having, for want of some such means as I employ'd, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded that \"a speckled ax was best\"; for something, that pretended to be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals, which, if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that a perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself, to keep his friends in countenance.\n\nThe smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel\nIn truth, I found myself incorrigible with respect to Order; and now I am grown old, and my memory bad, I feel very sensibly the want of it. But, on the whole, tho' I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it; as those who aim at perfect writing by imitating the engraved copies, tho' they never reach the wish'd-for excellence of those copies, their hand is mended by the endeavour, and is tolerable while it continues fair and legible.\n\nIt may be well my posterity should be informed that to this little artifice, with the blessing of God, their ancestor ow'd the constant felicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written. What reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence; but, if they arrive, the reflection on past happiness enjoy'd ought to help his bearing them with more resignation. To Temperance he ascribes his long-continued health, and what is still left to him of a good constitution; to Industry and Frugality, the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune, with all that knowledge that enabled him to be a useful citizen, and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the learned; to Sincerity and Justice, the confidence of his country, and the honorable employs it conferred upon him; and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues,[71] even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them, all that evenness of temper, and that cheerfulness in conversation, which makes his company still sought for, and agreeable even to his younger acquaintance. I hope, therefore, that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit.\n\nIt will be remark'd that, tho' my scheme was not wholly without religion, there was in it no mark of any of the distinguishing tenets of any particular sect. I had purposely avoided them; for, being fully persuaded of the utility and excellency of my method, and that it might be serviceable to people in all religions, and intending some time or other to publish it, I would not have anything in it that should prejudice anyone, of any sect, against it. I purposed writing a little comment on each virtue, in which I would have shown the advantages of possessing it, and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice; and I should have called my book The Art of Virtue,[72] because it would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which would have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good, that does not instruct and indicate the means, but is like the apostle's man of verbal charity, who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals, exhorted them to be fed and clothed.\u2014James ii. 15, 16.\n\nBut it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this comment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to time, put down short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made use of in it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary close attention to private business in the earlier part of my life, and public business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project, that required the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my attending to, it has hitherto remain'd unfinish'd.\n\nIn this piece it was my design to explain and enforce this doctrine, that vicious actions are not hurtful because they are forbidden, but forbidden because they are hurtful, the nature of man alone considered; that it was, therefore, everyone's interest to be virtuous who wish'd to be happy even in this world; and I should, from this circumstance (there being always in the world a number of rich merchants, nobility, states, and princes, who have need of honest instruments for the management of their affairs, and such being so rare), have endeavoured to convince young persons that no qualities were so likely to make a poor man's fortune as those of probity and integrity.\n\nMy list of virtues contain'd at first but twelve; but a Quaker friend having kindly informed me that I was generally thought proud; that my pride show'd itself frequently in conversation; that I was not content with being in the right when discussing any point, but was overbearing, and rather insolent, of which he convinc'd me by mentioning several instances; I determined endeavouring to cure myself, if I could, of this vice or folly among the rest, and I added Humility to my list, giving an extensive meaning to the word.\n\nI cannot boast of much success in acquiring the reality of this virtue, but I had a good deal with regard to the appearance of it. I made it a rule to forbear all direct contradiction to the sentiments of others, and all positive assertion of my own. I even forbid myself, agreeably to the old laws of our Junto, the use of every word or expression in the language that imported a fix'd opinion, such as certainly, undoubtedly, etc., and I adopted, instead of them, I conceive, I apprehend, or I imagine a thing to be so or so; or it so appears to me at present. When another asserted something that I thought an error, I deny'd myself the pleasure of contradicting him abruptly, and of showing immediately some absurdity in his proposition; and in answering I began by observing that in certain cases or circumstances his opinion would be right, but in the present case there appear'd or seem'd to me some difference, etc. I soon found the advantage of this change in my manner; the conversations I engag'd in went on more pleasantly. The modest way in which I propos'd my opinions procur'd them a readier reception and less contradiction; I had less mortification when I was found to be in the wrong, and I more easily prevail'd with others to give up their mistakes and join with me when I happened to be in the right.\n\nAnd this mode, which I at first put on with some violence to natural inclination, became at length so easy, and so habitual to me, that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape me. And to this habit (after my character of integrity) I think it principally owing that I had early so much weight with my fellow-citizens when I proposed new institutions, or alterations in the old, and so much influence in public councils when I became a member; for I was but a bad speaker, never eloquent, subject to much hesitation in my choice of words, hardly correct in language, and yet I generally carried my points.\n\nIn reality, there is, perhaps, no one of our natural passions so hard to subdue as pride. Disguise it, struggle with it, beat it down, stifle it, mortify it as much as one pleases, it is still alive, and will every now and then peep out and show itself; you will see it, perhaps, often in this history; for, even if I could conceive that I had compleatly overcome it, I should probably be proud of my humility.\n\n[Thus far written at Passy, 1784.]\n\n[\"I am now about to write at home, August, 1788, but cannot have the help expected from my papers, many of them being lost in the war. I have, however, found the following.\"][73]\n\nHaving mentioned a great and extensive project which I had conceiv'd, it seems proper that some account should be here given of that project and its object. Its first rise in my mind appears in the following little paper, accidentally preserv'd, viz.:\n\nObservations on my reading history, in Library, May 19th, 1731.\n\n\"That the great affairs of the world, the wars, revolutions, etc., are carried on and effected by parties.\n\n\"That the view of these parties is their present general interest, or what they take to be such.\n\n\"That the different views of these different parties occasion all confusion.\n\n\"That while a party is carrying on a general design, each man has his particular private interest in view.\n\n\"That as soon as a party has gain'd its general point, each member becomes intent upon his particular interest; which, thwarting others, breaks that party into divisions, and occasions more confusion.\n\n\"That few in public affairs act from a mere view of the good of their country, whatever they may pretend; and, tho' their actings bring real good to their country, yet men primarily considered that their own and their country's interest was united, and did not act from a principle of benevolence.\n\n\"That fewer still, in public affairs, act with a view to the good of mankind.\n\n\"There seems to me at present to be great occasion for raising a United Party for Virtue, by forming the virtuous and good men of all nations into a regular body, to be govern'd by suitable good and wise rules, which good and wise men may probably be more unanimous in their obedience to, than common people are to common laws.\n\n\"I at present think that whoever attempts this aright, and is well qualified, cannot fail of pleasing God, and of meeting with success.\n\nB. F.\"\n\nRevolving this project in my mind, as to be undertaken hereafter, when my circumstances should afford me the necessary leisure, I put down from time to time, on pieces of paper, such thoughts as occurr'd to me respecting it. Most of these are lost; but I find one purporting to be the substance of an intended creed, containing, as I thought, the essentials of every known religion, and being free of everything that might shock the professors of any religion. It is express'd in these words, viz.:\n\n\"That there is one God, who made all things.\n\n\"That he governs the world by his providence.\n\n\"That he ought to be worshiped by adoration, prayer, and thanksgiving.\n\n\"But that the most acceptable service of God is doing good to man.\n\n\"That the soul is immortal.\n\n\"And that God will certainly reward virtue and punish vice, either here or hereafter.\"\n\nMy ideas at that time were, that the sect should be begun and spread at first among young and single men only; that each person to be initiated should not only declare his assent to such creed, but should have exercised himself with the thirteen weeks' examination and practice of the virtues, as in the beforemention'd model; that the existence of such a society should be kept a secret, till it was become considerable, to prevent solicitations for the admission of improper persons, but that the members should each of them search among his acquaintance for ingenuous, well-disposed youths, to whom, with prudent caution, the scheme should be gradually communicated; that the members should engage to afford their advice, assistance, and support to each other in promoting one another's interests, business, and advancement in life; that, for distinction, we should be call'd The Society of the Free and Easy: free, as being, by the general practice and habit of the virtues, free from the dominion of vice; and particularly by the practice of industry and frugality, free from debt, which exposes a man to confinement, and a species of slavery to his creditors.\n\nThis is as much as I can now recollect of the project, except that I communicated it in part to two young men, who adopted it with some enthusiasm; but my then narrow circumstances, and the necessity I was under of sticking close to my business, occasioned my postponing the further prosecution of it at that time; and my multifarious occupations, public and private, induc'd me to continue postponing, so that it has been omitted till I have no longer strength or activity left sufficient for such an enterprise; though I am still of opinion that it was a practicable scheme, and might have been very useful, by forming a great number of good citizens; and I was not discourag'd by the seeming magnitude of the undertaking, as I have always thought that one man of tolerable abilities may work great changes, and accomplish great affairs among mankind, if he first forms a good plan, and, cutting off all amusements or other employments that would divert his attention, makes the execution of that same plan his sole study and business.\n\n[66] Compare Philippians iv, 8.\n\n[67] A famous Greek philosopher, who lived about 582-500 B. C. The Golden Verses here ascribed to him are probably of later origin. \"The time which he recommends for this work is about even or bed-time, that we may conclude the action of the day with the judgment of conscience, making the examination of our conversation an evening song to God.\"\n\n[68] This \"little book\" is dated July 1, 1733.\u2014W. T. F.\n\n[69] \"O philosophy, guide of life! O searcher out of virtue and exterminator of vice! One day spent well and in accordance with thy precepts is worth an immortality of sin.\"\u2014Tusculan Inquiries, Book V.\n\n[70] Professor McMaster tells us that when Franklin was American Agent in France, his lack of business order was a source of annoyance to his colleagues and friends. \"Strangers who came to see him were amazed to behold papers of the greatest importance scattered in the most careless way over the table and floor.\"\n\n[71] While there can be no question that Franklin's moral improvement and happiness were due to the practice of these virtues, yet most people will agree that we shall have to go back of his plan for the impelling motive to a virtuous life. Franklin's own suggestion that the scheme smacks of \"foppery in morals\" seems justified. Woodrow Wilson well puts it: \"Men do not take fire from such thoughts, unless something deeper, which is missing here, shine through them. What may have seemed to the eighteenth century a system of morals seems to us nothing more vital than a collection of the precepts of good sense and sound conduct. What redeems it from pettiness in this book is the scope of power and of usefulness to be seen in Franklin himself, who set these standards up in all seriousness and candor for his own life.\" See Galatians, chapter V, for the Christian plan of moral perfection.\n\n[72] Nothing so likely to make a man's fortune as virtue.\u2014Marg. note.\n\n[73] This is a marginal memorandum.\u2014B.\n\nX\n\nPOOR RICHARD'S ALMANAC AND OTHER ACTIVITIES\n\nblock-IN 1732 I first publish'd my Almanack, under the name of Richard Saunders; it was continu'd by me about twenty-five years, commonly call'd Poor Richard's Almanac.[74] I endeavour'd to make it both entertaining and useful, and it accordingly came to be in such demand, that I reap'd considerable profit from it, vending annually near ten thousand. And observing that it was generally read, scarce any neighborhood in the province being without it, I consider'd it as a proper vehicle for conveying instruction among the common people, who bought scarcely any other books; I therefore filled all the little spaces that occurr'd between the remarkable days in the calendar with proverbial sentences, chiefly such as inculcated industry and frugality, as the means of procuring wealth, and thereby securing virtue; it being more difficult for a man in want, to act always honestly, as, to use here one of those proverbs, it is hard for an empty sack to stand upright.\n\nThese proverbs, which contained the wisdom of many ages and nations, I assembled and form'd into a connected discourse prefix'd to the Almanack of 1757, as the harangue of a wise old man to the people attending an auction. The bringing all these scatter'd councils thus into a focus enabled them to make greater impression. The piece, being universally approved, was copied in all the newspapers of the Continent; reprinted in Britain on a broadside, to be stuck up in houses; two translations were made of it in French, and great numbers bought by the clergy and gentry, to distribute gratis among their poor parishioners and tenants. In Pennsylvania, as it discouraged useless expense in foreign superfluities, some thought it had its share of influence in producing that growing plenty of money which was observable for several years after its publication.\n\nTwo pages from Poor Richard's Almanac for 1736. Size of original. Reproduced from a copy at the New York Public Library.\n\nJune page from Poor Richard's Almanac for 1736\tJuly page from Poor Richard's Almanac for 1736\nI considered my newspaper, also, as another means of communicating instruction, and in that view frequently reprinted in it extracts from the Spectator, and other moral writers; and sometimes publish'd little pieces of my own, which had been first composed for reading in our Junto. Of these are a Socratic dialogue, tending to prove that, whatever might be his parts and abilities, a vicious man could not properly be called a man of sense; and a discourse on self-denial, showing that virtue was not secure till its practice became a habitude, and was free from the opposition of contrary inclinations. These may be found in the papers about the beginning of 1735.[75]\n\nIn the conduct of my newspaper, I carefully excluded all libeling and personal abuse, which is of late years become so disgraceful to our country. Whenever I was solicited to insert anything of that kind, and the writers pleaded, as they generally did, the liberty of the press, and that a newspaper was like a stage-coach, in which anyone who would pay had a right to a place, my answer was, that I would print the piece separately if desired, and the author might have as many copies as he pleased to distribute himself, but that I would not take upon me to spread his detraction; and that, having contracted with my subscribers to furnish them with what might be either useful or entertaining, I could not fill their papers with private altercation, in which they had no concern, without doing them manifest injustice. Now, many of our printers make no scruple of gratifying the malice of individuals by false accusations of the fairest characters among ourselves, augmenting animosity even to the producing of duels; and are, moreover, so indiscreet as to print scurrilous reflections on the government of neighboring states, and even on the conduct of our best national allies, which may be attended with the most pernicious consequences. These things I mention as a caution to young printers, and that they may be encouraged not to pollute their presses and disgrace their profession by such infamous practices, but refuse steadily, as they may see by my example that such a course of conduct will not, on the whole, be injurious to their interests.\n\nIn 1733 I sent one of my journeymen to Charleston, South Carolina, where a printer was wanting. I furnish'd him with a press and letters, on an agreement of partnership, by which I was to receive one-third of the profits of the business, paying one-third of the expense. He was a man of learning, and honest but ignorant in matters of account; and, tho' he sometimes made me remittances, I could get no account from him, nor any satisfactory state of our partnership while he lived. On his decease, the business was continued by his widow, who, being born and bred in Holland, where, as I have been inform'd, the knowledge of accounts makes a part of female education, she not only sent me as clear a state as she could find of the transactions past, but continued to account with the greatest regularity and exactness every quarter afterwards, and managed the business with such success, that she not only brought up reputably a family of children, but, at the expiration of the term, was able to purchase of me the printing-house, and establish her son in it.\n\nI mention this affair chiefly for the sake of recommending that branch of education for our young females, as likely to be of more use to them and their children, in case of widowhood, than either music or dancing, by preserving them from losses by imposition of crafty men, and enabling them to continue, perhaps, a profitable mercantile house, with establish'd correspondence, till a son is grown up fit to undertake and go on with it, to the lasting advantage and enriching of the family.\n\nAbout the year 1734 there arrived among us from Ireland a young Presbyterian preacher, named Hemphill, who delivered with a good voice, and apparently extempore, most excellent discourses, which drew together considerable numbers of different persuasions, who join'd in admiring them. Among the rest, I became one of his constant hearers, his sermons pleasing me, as they had little of the dogmatical kind, but inculcated strongly the practice of virtue, or what in the religious stile are called good works. Those, however, of our congregation, who considered themselves as orthodox Presbyterians, disapprov'd his doctrine, and were join'd by most of the old clergy, who arraign'd him of heterodoxy before the synod, in order to have him silenc'd. I became his zealous partisan, and contributed all I could to raise a party in his favour, and we combated for him awhile with some hopes of success. There was much scribbling pro and con upon the occasion; and finding that, tho' an elegant preacher, he was but a poor writer, I lent him my pen and wrote for him two or three pamphlets, and one piece in the Gazette of April, 1735. Those pamphlets, as is generally the case with controversial writings, tho' eagerly read at the time, were soon out of vogue, and I question whether a single copy of them now exists.[76]\n\nDuring the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly. One of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much admired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before, or at least a part of it. On search, he found that part quoted at length, in one of the British Reviews, from a discourse of Dr. Foster's.[77] This detection gave many of our party disgust, who accordingly abandoned his cause, and occasion'd our more speedy discomfiture in the synod. I stuck by him, however, as I rather approv'd his giving us good sermons composed by others, than bad ones of his own manufacture, tho' the latter was the practice of our common teachers. He afterward acknowledg'd to me that none of those he preach'd were his own; adding, that his memory was such as enabled him to retain and repeat any sermon after one reading only. On our defeat, he left us in search elsewhere of better fortune, and I quitted the congregation, never joining it after, tho' I continu'd many years my subscription for the support of its ministers.\n\nI had begun in 1733 to study languages; I soon made myself so much a master of the French as to be able to read the books with ease. I then undertook the Italian. An acquaintance, who was also learning it, us'd often to tempt me to play chess with him. Finding this took up too much of the time I had to spare for study, I at length refus'd to play any more, unless on this condition, that the victor in every game should have a right to impose a task, either in parts of the grammar to be got by heart, or in translations, etc., which tasks the vanquish'd was to perform upon honour, before our next meeting. As we play'd pretty equally, we thus beat one another into that language. I afterwards with a little painstaking, acquir'd as much of the Spanish as to read their books also.\n\nI have already mention'd that I had only one year's instruction in a Latin school, and that when very young, after which I neglected that language entirely. But, when I had attained an acquaintance with the French, Italian, and Spanish, I was surpris'd to find, on looking over a Latin Testament, that I understood so much more of that language than I had imagined, which encouraged me to apply myself again to the study of it, and I met with more success, as those preceding languages had greatly smooth'd my way.\n\nFrom these circumstances, I have thought that there is some inconsistency in our common mode of teaching languages. We are told that it is proper to begin first with the Latin, and, having acquir'd that, it will be more easy to attain those modern languages which are deriv'd from it; and yet we do not begin with the Greek, in order more easily to acquire the Latin. It is true that, if you can clamber and get to the top of a staircase without using the steps, you will more easily gain them in descending; but certainly, if you begin with the lowest you will with more ease ascend to the top; and I would therefore offer it to the consideration of those who superintend the education of our youth, whether, since many of those who begin with the Latin quit the same after spending some years without having made any great proficiency, and what they have learnt becomes almost useless, so that their time has been lost, it would not have been better to have begun with the French, proceeding to the Italian, etc.; for, tho', after spending the same time, they should quit the study of languages and never arrive at the Latin, they would, however, have acquired another tongue or two, that, being in modern use, might be serviceable to them in common life.[78]\n\nAfter ten years' absence from Boston, and having become easy in my circumstances, I made a journey thither to visit my relations, which I could not sooner well afford. In returning, I call'd at Newport to see my brother, then settled there with his printing-house. Our former differences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate. He was fast declining in his health, and requested of me that, in case of his death, which he apprehended not far distant, I would take home his son, then but ten years of age, and bring him up to the printing business. This I accordingly perform'd, sending him a few years to school before I took him into the office. His mother carried on the business till he was grown up, when I assisted him with an assortment of new types, those of his father being in a manner worn out. Thus it was that I made my brother ample amends for the service I had depriv'd him of by leaving him so early.\n\nOur former differences were forgotten, and our meeting was very cordial and affectionate\nIn 1736 I lost one of my sons, a fine boy of four years old, by the small-pox, taken in the common way. I long regretted bitterly, and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation. This I mention for the sake of parents who omit that operation, on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it; my example showing that the regret may be the same either way, and that, therefore, the safer should be chosen.\n\nOur club, the Junto, was found so useful, and afforded such satisfaction to the members, that several were desirous of introducing their friends, which could not well be done without exceeding what we had settled as a convenient number, viz., twelve. We had from the beginning made it a rule to keep our institution a secret, which was pretty well observ'd; the intention was to avoid applications of improper persons for admittance, some of whom, perhaps, we might find it difficult to refuse. I was one of those who were against any addition to our number, but, instead of it, made in writing a proposal, that every member separately should endeavour to form a subordinate club, with the same rules respecting queries, etc., and without informing them of the connection with the Junto. The advantages proposed were, the improvement of so many more young citizens by the use of our institutions; our better acquaintance with the general sentiments of the inhabitants on any occasion, as the Junto member might propose what queries we should desire, and was to report to the Junto what pass'd in his separate club; the promotion of our particular interests in business by more extensive recommendation, and the increase of our influence in public affairs, and our power of doing good by spreading thro' the several clubs the sentiments of the Junto.\n\nThe project was approv'd, and every member undertook to form his club, but they did not all succeed. Five or six only were compleated, which were called by different names, as the Vine, the Union, the Band, etc. They were useful to themselves, and afforded us a good deal of amusement, information, and instruction, besides answering, in some considerable degree, our views of influencing the public opinion on particular occasions, of which I shall give some instances in course of time as they happened.\n\nMy first promotion was my being chosen, in 1736, clerk of the General Assembly. The choice was made that year without opposition; but the year following, when I was again propos'd (the choice, like that of the members, being annual), a new member made a long speech against me, in order to favour some other candidate. I was, however, chosen, which was the more agreeable to me, as, besides the pay for the immediate service as clerk, the place gave me a better opportunity of keeping up an interest among the members, which secur'd to me the business of printing the votes, laws, paper money, and other occasional jobbs for the public, that, on the whole, were very profitable.\n\nI therefore did not like the opposition of this new member, who was a gentleman of fortune and education, with talents that were likely to give him, in time, great influence in the House, which, indeed, afterwards happened. I did not, however, aim at gaining his favour by paying any servile respect to him, but, after some time, took this other method. Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book, I wrote a note to him, expressing my desire of perusing that book, and requesting he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days. He sent it immediately, and I return'd it in about a week with another note, expressing strongly my sense of the favour. When we next met in the House, he spoke to me (which he had never done before), and with great civility; and he ever after manifested a readiness to serve me on all occasions, so that we became great friends, and our friendship continued to his death. This is another instance of the truth of an old maxim I had learned, which says, \"He that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another, than he whom you yourself have obliged.\" And it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove, than to resent, return, and continue inimical proceedings.\n\nIn 1737, Colonel Spotswood, late governor of Virginia, and then postmaster-general, being dissatisfied with the conduct of his deputy at Philadelphia, respecting some negligence in rendering, and inexactitude of his accounts, took from him the commission and offered it to me. I accepted it readily, and found it of great advantage; for, tho' the salary was small, it facilitated the correspondence that improv'd my newspaper, increas'd the number demanded, as well as the advertisements to be inserted, so that it came to afford me a considerable income. My old competitor's newspaper declin'd proportionately, and I was satisfy'd without retaliating his refusal, while postmaster, to permit my papers being carried by the riders. Thus he suffer'd greatly from his neglect in due accounting; and I mention it as a lesson to those young men who may be employ'd in managing affairs for others, that they should always render accounts, and make remittances, with great clearness and punctuality. The character of observing such a conduct is the most powerful of all recommendations to new employments and increase of business.\n\n[74] The almanac at that time was a kind of periodical as well as a guide to natural phenomena and the weather.

But these schools may assume the merit of teaching all that they pretend to teach, the Latin and Greek languages.'\"\u2014Bigelow.\n\nXI\n\nINTEREST IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS\n\nblock-IBEGAN now to turn my thoughts a little to public affairs, beginning, however, with small matters. The city watch was one of the first things that I conceiv'd to want regulation. It was managed by the constables of the respective wards in turn; the constable warned a number of housekeepers to attend him for the night. Those who chose never to attend, paid him six shillings a year to be excus'd, which was suppos'd to be for hiring substitutes, but was, in reality, much more than was necessary for that purpose, and made the constableship a place of profit; and the constable, for a little drink, often got such ragamuffins about him as a watch, that respectable housekeepers did not choose to mix with. Walking the rounds, too, was often neglected, and most of the nights spent in tippling. I thereupon wrote a paper to be read in Junto, representing these irregularities, but insisting more particularly on the inequality of this six-shilling tax of the constables, respecting the circumstances of those who paid it, since a poor widow housekeeper, all whose property to be guarded by the watch did not perhaps exceed the value of fifty pounds, paid as much as the wealthiest merchant, who had thousands of pounds' worth of goods in his stores.\n\nOn the whole, I proposed as a more effectual watch, the hiring of proper men to serve constantly in that business; and as a more equitable way of supporting the charge, the levying a tax that should be proportion'd to the property. This idea, being approv'd by the Junto, was communicated to the other clubs, but as arising in each of them; and though the plan was not immediately carried into execution, yet, by preparing the minds of people for the change, it paved the way for the law obtained a few years after, when the members of our clubs were grown into more influence.\n\nAbout this time I wrote a paper (first to be read in Junto, but it was afterward publish'd) on the different accidents and carelessnesses by which houses were set on fire, with cautions against them, and means proposed of avoiding them. This was much spoken of as a useful piece, and gave rise to a project, which soon followed it, of forming a company for the more ready extinguishing of fires, and mutual assistance in removing and securing of goods when in danger. Associates in this scheme were presently found, amounting to thirty. Our articles of agreement oblig'd every member to keep always in good order, and fit for use, a certain number of leather buckets, with strong bags and baskets (for packing and transporting of goods), which were to be brought to every fire; and we agreed to meet once a month and spend a social evening together, in discoursing and communicating such ideas as occurred to us upon the subjects of fires, as might be useful in our conduct on such occasions.\n\nThe utility of this institution soon appeared, and many more desiring to be admitted than we thought convenient for one company, they were advised to form another, which was accordingly done; and this went on, one new company being formed after another, till they became so numerous as to include most of the inhabitants who were men of property; and now, at the time of my writing this, tho' upward of fifty years since its establishment, that which I first formed, called the Union Fire Company, still subsists and flourishes, tho' the first members are all deceas'd but myself and one, who is older by a year than I am. The small fines that have been paid by members for absence at the monthly meetings have been apply'd to the purchase of fire-engines, ladders, fire-hooks, and other useful implements for each company, so that I question whether there is a city in the world better provided with the means of putting a stop to beginning conflagrations; and, in fact, since these institutions, the city has never lost by fire more than one or two houses at a time, and the flames have often been extinguished before the house in which they began has been half consumed.\n\nthe flames have often been extinguished\nIn 1739 arrived among us from Ireland the Reverend Mr. Whitefield,[79] who had made himself remarkable there as an itinerant preacher. He was at first permitted to preach in some of our churches; but the clergy, taking a dislike to him, soon refus'd him their pulpits, and he was oblig'd to preach in the fields. The multitudes of all sects and denominations that attended his sermons were enormous, and it was matter of speculation to me, who was one of the number, to observe the extraordinary influence of his oratory on his hearers, and how much they admir'd and respected him, notwithstanding his common abuse of them, by assuring them they were naturally half beasts and half devils. It was wonderful to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants. From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion, it seem'd as if all the world were growing religious, so that one could not walk thro' the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street.\n\nAnd it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air, subject to its inclemencies, the building of a house to meet in was no sooner propos'd, and persons appointed to receive contributions, but sufficient sums were soon receiv'd to procure the ground and erect the building, which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad, about the size of Westminster Hall;[80] and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could have been expected. Both house and ground were vested in trustees, expressly for the use of any preacher of any religious persuasion who might desire to say something to the people at Philadelphia; the design in building not being to accommodate any particular sect, but the inhabitants in general; so that even if the Mufti of Constantinople were to send a missionary to preach Mohammedanism to us, he would find a pulpit at his service.\n\nMr. Whitefield, in leaving us, went preaching all the way thro' the colonies to Georgia. The settlement of that province had lately been begun, but, instead of being made with hardy, industrious husbandmen, accustomed to labour, the only people fit for such an enterprise, it was with families of broken shop-keepers and other insolvent debtors, many of indolent and idle habits, taken out of the jails, who, being set down in the woods, unqualified for clearing land, and unable to endure the hardships of a new settlement, perished in numbers, leaving many helpless children unprovided for. The sight of their miserable situation inspir'd the benevolent heart of Mr. Whitefield with the idea of building an Orphan House there, in which they might be supported and educated. Returning northward, he preach'd up this charity, and made large collections, for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and purses of his hearers, of which I myself was an instance.\n\nI did not disapprove of the design, but, as Georgia was then destitute of materials and workmen, and it was proposed to send them from Philadelphia at a great expense, I thought it would have been better to have built the house here, and brought the children to it. This I advis'd; but he was resolute in his first project, rejected my counsel, and I therefore refus'd to contribute. I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons, in the course of which I perceived he intended to finish with a collection, and I silently resolved he should get nothing from me. I had in my pocket a handful of copper money, three or four silver dollars, and five pistoles in gold. As he proceeded I began to soften, and concluded to give the coppers. Another stroke of his oratory made me asham'd of that, and determin'd me to give the silver; and he finish'd so admirably, that I empty'd my pocket wholly into the collector's dish, gold and all. At this sermon there was also one of our club, who, being of my sentiments respecting the building in Georgia, and suspecting a collection might be intended, had, by precaution, emptied his pockets before he came from home. Towards the conclusion of the discourse, however, he felt a strong desire to give, and apply'd to a neighbour who stood near him, to borrow some money for the purpose. The application was unfortunately [made] to perhaps the only man in the company who had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher. His answer was, \"At any other time, Friend Hopkinson, I would lend to thee freely; but not now, for thee seems to be out of thy right senses.\"\n\nSome of Mr. Whitefield's enemies affected to suppose that he would apply these collections to his own private emolument; but I, who was intimately acquainted with him (being employed in printing his Sermons and Journals, etc.), never had the least suspicion of his integrity, but am to this day decidedly of opinion that he was in all his conduct a perfectly honest man; and methinks my testimony in his favour ought to have the more weight, as we had no religious connection. He us'd, indeed, sometimes to pray for my conversion, but never had the satisfaction of believing that his prayers were heard. Ours was a mere civil friendship, sincere on both sides, and lasted to his death.\n\nThe following instance will show something of the terms on which we stood. Upon one of his arrivals from England at Boston, he wrote to me that he should come soon to Philadelphia, but knew not where he could lodge when there, as he understood his old friend and host, Mr. Benezet was removed to Germantown. My answer was, \"You know my house; if you can make shift with its scanty accommodations, you will be most heartily welcome.\" He reply'd, that if I made that kind offer for Christ's sake, I should not miss of a reward. And I returned, \"Don't let me be mistaken; it was not for Christ's sake, but for your sake.\" One of our common acquaintance jocosely remark'd, that, knowing it to be the custom of the saints, when they received any favour, to shift the burden of the obligation from off their own shoulders, and place it in heaven, I had contriv'd to fix it on earth.\n\nThe last time I saw Mr. Whitefield was in London, when he consulted me about his Orphan House concern, and his purpose of appropriating it to the establishment of a college.\n\nHe had a loud and clear voice, and articulated his words and sentences so perfectly, that he might be heard and understood at a great distance, especially as his auditories, however numerous, observ'd the most exact silence. He preach'd one evening from the top of the Courthouse steps, which are in the middle of Market-street, and on the west side of Second-street, which crosses it at right angles. Both streets were fill'd with his hearers to a considerable distance. Being among the hindmost in Market-street, I had the curiosity to learn how far he could be heard, by retiring backwards down the street towards the river; and I found his voice distinct till I came near Front-street, when some noise in that street obscur'd it. Imagining then a semicircle, of which my distance should be the radius, and that it were fill'd with auditors, to each of whom I allow'd two square feet, I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand. This reconcil'd me to the newspaper accounts of his having preach'd to twenty-five thousand people in the fields, and to the ancient histories of generals haranguing whole armies, of which I had sometimes doubted.\n\nBy hearing him often, I came to distinguish easily between sermons newly compos'd, and those which he had often preach'd in the course of his travels. His delivery of the latter was so improv'd by frequent repetitions that every accent, every emphasis, every modulation of voice, was so perfectly well turn'd and well plac'd, that, without being interested in the subject, one could not help being pleas'd with the discourse; a pleasure of much the same kind with that receiv'd from an excellent piece of musick. This is an advantage itinerant preachers have over those who are stationary, as the latter cannot well improve their delivery of a sermon by so many rehearsals.\n\nHis writing and printing from time to time gave great advantage to his enemies; unguarded expressions, and even erroneous opinions, delivered in preaching, might have been afterwards explain'd or qualifi'd by supposing others that might have accompani'd them, or they might have been deny'd; but litera scripta manet. Critics attack'd his writings violently, and with so much appearance of reason as to diminish the number of his votaries and prevent their increase; so that I am of opinion if he had never written anything, he would have left behind him a much more numerous and important sect, and his reputation might in that case have been still growing, even after his death, as there being nothing of his writing on which to found a censure and give him a lower character, his proselytes would be left at liberty to feign for him as great a variety of excellences as their enthusiastic admiration might wish him to have possessed.\n\nMy business was now continually augmenting, and my circumstances growing daily easier, my newspaper having become very profitable, as being for a time almost the only one in this and the neighbouring provinces. I experienced, too, the truth of the observation, \"that after getting the first hundred pound, it is more easy to get the second,\" money itself being of a prolific nature.\n\nThe partnership at Carolina having succeeded, I was encourag'd to engage in others, and to promote several of my workmen, who had behaved well, by establishing them with printing-houses in different colonies, on the same terms with that in Carolina. Most of them did well, being enabled at the end of our term, six years, to purchase the types of me and go on working for themselves, by which means several families were raised. Partnerships often finish in quarrels; but I was happy in this, that mine were all carried on and ended amicably, owing, I think, a good deal to the precaution of having very explicitly settled, in our articles, everything to be done by or expected from each partner, so that there was nothing to dispute, which precaution I would therefore recommend to all who enter into partnerships; for, whatever esteem partners may have for, and confidence in each other at the time of the contract, little jealousies and disgusts may arise, with ideas of inequality in the care and burden of the business, etc., which are attended often with breach of friendship and of the connection, perhaps with lawsuits and other disagreeable consequences.\n\n[79] George Whitefield, pronounced Hwit'field (1714-1770), a celebrated English clergyman and pulpit orator, one of the founders of Methodism.\n\n[80] A part of the palace of Westminster, now forming the vestibule to the Houses of Parliament in London.\n\nXII\n\nDEFENSE OF THE PROVINCE\n\nblock-IHAD, on the whole, abundant reason to be satisfied with my being established in Pennsylvania. There were, however, two, things that I regretted, there being no provision for defense, nor for a compleat education of youth; no militia, nor any college. I therefore, in 1743, drew up a proposal for establishing an academy; and at that time, thinking the Reverend Mr. Peters, who was out of employ, a fit person to superintend such an institution, I communicated the project to him; but he, having more profitable views in the service of the proprietaries, which succeeded, declin'd the undertaking; and, not knowing another at that time suitable for such a trust, I let the scheme lie awhile dormant. I succeeded better the next year, 1744, in proposing and establishing a Philosophical Society. The paper I wrote for that purpose will be found among my writings, when collected.\n\nWith respect to defense, Spain having been several years at war against Great Britain, and being at length join'd by France, which brought us into great danger; and the laboured and long-continued endeavour of our governor, Thomas, to prevail with our Quaker Assembly to pass a militia law, and make other provisions for the security of the province, having proved abortive, I determined to try what might be done by a voluntary association of the people. To promote this, I first wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled Plain Truth, in which I stated our defenceless situation in strong lights, with the necessity of union and discipline for our defense, and promis'd to propose in a few days an association, to be generally signed for that purpose. The pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect. I was call'd upon for the instrument of association, and having settled the draft of it with a few friends, I appointed a meeting of the citizens in the large building before mentioned. The house was pretty full; I had prepared a number of printed copies, and provided pens and ink dispers'd all over the room. I harangued them a little on the subject, read the paper, and explained it, and then distributed the copies, which were eagerly signed, not the least objection being made.\n\nWhen the company separated, and the papers were collected, we found above twelve hundred hands; and, other copies being dispersed in the country, the subscribers amounted at length to upward of ten thousand. These all furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms, formed themselves into companies and regiments, chose their own officers, and met every week to be instructed in the manual exercise, and other parts of military discipline. The women, by subscriptions among themselves, provided silk colours, which they presented to the companies, painted with different devices and mottos, which I supplied.\n\nOne of the flags of the Pennsylvania Association, 1747.

Designed by Franklin and made by the women of Philadelphia.\nThe officers of the companies composing the Philadelphia regiment, being met, chose me for their colonel; but, conceiving myself unfit, I declin'd that station, and recommended Mr. Lawrence, a fine person, and man of influence, who was accordingly appointed. I then propos'd a lottery to defray the expense of building a battery below the town, and furnishing it with cannon. It filled expeditiously, and the battery was soon erected, the merlons being fram'd of logs and fill'd with earth. We bought some old cannon from Boston, but, these not being sufficient, we wrote to England for more, soliciting, at the same time, our proprietaries for some assistance, tho' without much expectation of obtaining it.\n\nMeanwhile, Colonel Lawrence, William Allen, Abram Taylor, Esqr., and myself were sent to New York by the associators, commission'd to borrow some cannon of Governor Clinton. He at first refus'd us peremptorily; but at dinner with his council, where there was great drinking of Madeira wine, as the custom of that place then was, he softened by degrees, and said he would lend us six. After a few more bumpers he advanc'd to ten; and at length he very good-naturedly conceded eighteen. They were fine cannon, eighteen-pounders, with their carriages, which we soon transported and mounted on our battery, where the associators kept a nightly guard while the war lasted, and among the rest I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier.\n\nI regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier\n\"I regularly took my turn of duty there as a common soldier\"\nMy activity in these operations was agreeable to the governor and council; they took me into confidence, and I was consulted by them in every measure wherein their concurrence was thought useful to the association. Calling in the aid of religion, I propos'd to them the proclaiming a fast, to promote reformation, and implore the blessing of Heaven on our undertaking. They embrac'd the motion; but, as it was the first fast ever thought of in the province, the secretary had no precedent from which to draw the proclamation. My education in New England, where a fast is proclaimed every year, was here of some advantage: I drew it in the accustomed stile, it was translated into German,[81] printed in both languages, and divulg'd thro' the province. This gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing their congregations to join in the association, and it would probably have been general among all but Quakers if the peace had not soon interven'd.\n\nIt was thought by some of my friends that, by my activity in these affairs, I should offend that sect, and thereby lose my interest in the Assembly of the province, where they formed a great majority. A young gentleman who had likewise some friends in the House, and wished to succeed me as their clerk, acquainted me that it was decided to displace me at the next election; and he, therefore, in good will, advis'd me to resign, as more consistent with my honour than being turn'd out. My answer to him was, that I had read or heard of some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office, and never to refuse one when offer'd to him. \"I approve,\" says I, \"of his rule, and will practice it with a small addition; I shall never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign an office. If they will have my office of clerk to dispose of to another, they shall take it from me. I will not, by giving it up, lose my right of some time or other making reprisals on my adversaries.\" I heard, however, no more of this; I was chosen again unanimously as usual at the next election. Possibly, as they dislik'd my late intimacy with the members of council, who had join'd the governors in all the disputes about military preparations, with which the House had long been harass'd, they might have been pleas'd if I would voluntarily have left them; but they did not care to displace me on account merely of my zeal for the association, and they could not well give another reason.\n\nIndeed I had some cause to believe that the defense of the country was not disagreeable to any of them, provided they were not requir'd to assist in it. And I found that a much greater number of them than I could have imagined, tho' against offensive war, were clearly for the defensive. Many pamphlets pro and con were publish'd on the subject, and some by good Quakers, in favour of defense, which I believe convinc'd most of their younger people.\n\nA transaction in our fire company gave me some insight into their prevailing sentiments. It had been propos'd that we should encourage the scheme for building a battery by laying out the present stock, then about sixty pounds, in tickets of the lottery. By our rules, no money could be dispos'd of till the next meeting after the proposal. The company consisted of thirty members, of which twenty-two were Quakers, and eight only of other persuasions. We eight punctually attended the meeting; but, tho' we thought that some of the Quakers would join us, we were by no means sure of a majority. Only one Quaker, Mr. James Morris, appear'd to oppose the measure. He expressed much sorrow that it had ever been propos'd, as he said Friends were all against it, and it would create such discord as might break up the company. We told him that we saw no reason for that; we were the minority, and if Friends were against the measure, and outvoted us, we must and should, agreeably to the usage of all societies, submit. When the hour for business arriv'd it was mov'd to put the vote; he allow'd we might then do it by the rules, but, as he could assure us that a number of members intended to be present for the purpose of opposing it, it would be but candid to allow a little time for their appearing.\n\nWhile we were disputing this, a waiter came to tell me two gentlemen below desir'd to speak with me. I went down, and found they were two of our Quaker members. They told me there were eight of them assembled at a tavern just by; that they were determin'd to come and vote with us if there should be occasion, which they hop'd would not be the case, and desir'd we would not call for their assistance if we could do without it, as their voting for such a measure might embroil them with their elders and friends. Being thus secure of a majority, I went up, and after a little seeming hesitation, agreed to a delay of another hour. This Mr. Morris allow'd to be extreamly fair. Not one of his opposing friends appear'd, at which he express'd great surprize; and, at the expiration of the hour, we carri'd the resolution eight to one; and as, of the twenty-two Quakers, eight were ready to vote with us, and thirteen, by their absence, manifested that they were not inclin'd to oppose the measure, I afterward estimated the proportion of Quakers sincerely against defense as one to twenty-one only; for these were all regular members of that society, and in good reputation among them, and had due notice of what was propos'd at that meeting.\n\nThe honorable and learned Mr. Logan, who had always been of that sect, was one who wrote an address to them, declaring his approbation of defensive war, and supporting his opinion by many strong arguments. He put into my hands sixty pounds to be laid out in lottery tickets for the battery, with directions to apply what prizes might be drawn wholly to that service. He told me the following anecdote of his old master, William Penn, respecting defense. He came over from England, when a young man, with that proprietary, and as his secretary. It was war-time, and their ship was chas'd by an armed vessel, suppos'd to be an enemy. Their captain prepar'd for defense; but told William Penn, and his company of Quakers, that he did not expect their assistance, and they might retire into the cabin, which they did, except James Logan,[82] who chose to stay upon deck, and was quarter'd to a gun. The suppos'd enemy prov'd a friend, so there was no fighting; but when the secretary went down to communicate the intelligence, William Penn rebuk'd him severely for staying upon deck, and undertaking to assist in defending the vessel, contrary to the principles of Friends, especially as it had not been required by the captain. This reproof, being before all the company, piqu'd the secretary, who answer'd, \"I being thy servant, why did thee not order me to come down? But thee was willing enough that I should stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought there was danger.\"\n\nMy being many years in the Assembly, the majority of which were constantly Quakers, gave me frequent opportunities of seeing the embarrassment given them by their principle against war, whenever application was made to them, by order of the crown, to grant aids for military purposes. They were unwilling to offend government, on the one hand, by a direct refusal; and their friends, the body of the Quakers, on the other, by compliance contrary to their principles; hence a variety of evasions to avoid complying, and modes of disguising the compliance when it became unavoidable. The common mode at last was, to grant money under the phrase of its being \"for the king's use,\" and never to inquire how it was applied.\n\nBut, if the demand was not directly from the crown, that phrase was found not so proper, and some other was to be invented. As, when powder was wanting (I think it was for the garrison at Louisburg), and the government of New England solicited a grant of some from Pennsylvania, which was much urg'd on the House by Governor Thomas, they could not grant money to buy powder, because that was an ingredient of war; but they voted an aid to New England of three thousand pounds, to be put into the hands of the governor, and appropriated it for the purchasing of bread, flour, wheat or other grain. Some of the council, desirous of giving the House still further embarrassment, advis'd the governor not to accept provision, as not being the thing he had demanded; but he repli'd, \"I shall take the money, for I understand very well their meaning; other grain is gunpowder,\" which he accordingly bought, and they never objected to it.[83]\n\nIt was in allusion to this fact that, when in our fire company we feared the success of our proposal in favour of the lottery, and I had said to my friend Mr. Syng, one of our members, \"If we fail, let us move the purchase of a fire-engine with the money; the Quakers can have no objection to that; and then, if you nominate me and I you as a committee for that purpose, we will buy a great gun, which is certainly a fire-engine.\" \"I see,\" says he, \"you have improv'd by being so long in the Assembly; your equivocal project would be just a match for their wheat or other grain.\"\n\nThese embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from having establish'd and published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was lawful, and which, being once published, they could not afterwards, however they might change their minds, easily get rid of, reminds me of what I think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us, that of the Dunkers. I was acquainted with one of its founders, Michael Welfare, soon after it appear'd. He complain'd to me that they were grievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions, and charg'd with abominable principles and practices to which they were utter strangers. I told him this had always been the case with new sects, and that, to put a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might be well to publish the articles of their belief, and the rules of their discipline. He said that it had been propos'd among them, but not agreed to, for this reason: \"When we were first drawn together as a society,\" says he, \"it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were errors; and that others, which we had esteemed errors, were real truths. >From time to time He has been pleased to afford us farther light, and our principles have been improving, and our errors diminishing. Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression, and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if we should once print our confession of faith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin'd by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive further improvement, and our successors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from.\"\n\nThis modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of mankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth, and that those who differ are so far in the wrong; like a man traveling in foggy weather, those at some distance before him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog, as well as those behind him, and also the people in the fields on each side, but near him all appears clear, tho' in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them. To avoid this kind of embarrassment, the Quakers have of late years been gradually declining the public service in the Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing rather to quit their power than their principle.\n\nIn order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in 1742, invented an open stove[84] for the better warming of rooms, and at the same time saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering, I made a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my early friends, who, having an iron-furnace,[85] found the casting of the plates for these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing in demand. To promote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled \"An Account of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein their Construction and Manner of Operation is particularly explained; their Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated; and all Objections that have been raised against the Use of them answered and obviated,\" etc. This pamphlet had a good effect. Gov'r. Thomas was so pleas'd with the construction of this stove, as described in it, that he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years; but I declin'd it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz., That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.\n\nAn ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet, and working it up into his own, and making some small changes in the machine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patent for it there, and made, as I was told, a little fortune by it. And this is not the only instance of patents taken out for my inventions by others, tho' not always with the same success, which I never contested, as having no desire of profiting by patents myself, and hating disputes. The use of these fireplaces in very many houses, both of this and the neighbouring colonies, has been, and is, a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.\n\n[81] Wm. Penn's agents sought recruits for the colony of Pennsylvania in the low countries of Germany, and there are still in eastern Pennsylvania many Germans, inaccurately called Pennsylvania Dutch. Many of them use a Germanized English.\n\n[82] James Logan (1674-1751) came to America with William Penn in 1699, and was the business agent for the Penn family.

The first step I took was to associate in the design a number of active friends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part; the next was to write and publish a pamphlet, entitled Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania. This I distributed among the principal inhabitants gratis; and as soon as I could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot a subscription for opening and supporting an academy; it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five years; by so dividing it, I judg'd the subscription might be larger, and I believe it was so, amounting to no less, if I remember right, than five thousand pounds.\n\nIn the introduction to these proposals, I stated their publication, not as an act of mine, but of some publick-spirited gentlemen, avoiding as much as I could, according to my usual rule, the presenting myself to the publick as the author of any scheme for their benefit.\n\nThe subscribers, to carry the project into immediate execution, chose out of their number twenty-four trustees, and appointed Mr. Francis,[86] then attorney-general, and myself to draw up constitutions for the government of the academy; which being done and signed, a house was hired, masters engag'd, and the schools opened, I think, in the same year, 1749.\n\nThe scholars increasing fast, the house was soon found too small, and we were looking out for a piece of ground, properly situated, with intention to build, when Providence threw into our way a large house ready built, which, with a few alterations, might well serve our purpose. This was the building before mentioned, erected by the hearers of Mr. Whitefield, and was obtained for us in the following manner.\n\nIt is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by people of different sects, care was taken in the nomination of trustees, in whom the building and ground was to be vested, that a predominancy should not be given to any sect, lest in time that predominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect, contrary to the original intention. It was therefore that one of each sect was appointed, viz., one Church-of-England man, one Presbyterian, one Baptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in case of vacancy by death, were to fill it by election from among the contributors. The Moravian happen'd not to please his colleagues, and on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect. The difficulty then was, how to avoid having two of some other sect, by means of the new choice.\n\nSeveral persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to. At length one mention'd me, with the observation that I was merely an honest man, and of no sect at all, which prevailed with them to chuse me. The enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abat'd, and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for paying the ground-rent, and discharging some other debts the building had occasion'd, which embarrass'd them greatly. Being now a member of both sets of trustees, that for the building and that for the academy, I had a good opportunity of negotiating with both, and brought them finally to an agreement, by which the trustees for the building were to cede it to those of the academy, the latter undertaking to discharge the debt, to keep forever open in the building a large hall for occasional preachers, according to the original intention, and maintain a free-school for the instruction of poor children. Writings were accordingly drawn, and on paying the debts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the premises; and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories, and different rooms above and below for the several schools, and purchasing some additional ground, the whole was soon made fit for our purpose, and the scholars remov'd into the building. The care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen, purchasing materials, and superintending the work, fell upon me; and I went thro' it the more cheerfully, as it did not then interfere with my private business, having the year before taken a very able, industrious, and honest partner, Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well acquainted, as he had work'd for me four years. He took off my hands all care of the printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the profits. The partnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us both.\n\nThe trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated by a charter from the governor; their funds were increas'd by contributions in Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries, to which the Assembly has since made considerable addition; and thus was established the present University of Philadelphia.[87] I have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning, now near forty years, and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receiv'd their education in it, distinguish'd by their improv'd abilities, serviceable in public stations, and ornaments to their country.\n\nWhen I disengaged myself, as above mentioned, from private business, I flatter'd myself that, by the sufficient tho' moderate fortune I had acquir'd, I had secured leisure during the rest of my life for philosophical studies and amusements. I purchased all Dr. Spence's apparatus, who had come from England to lecture here, and I proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the publick, now considering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for their purposes, every part of our civil government, and almost at the same time, imposing some duty upon me. The governor put me into the commission of the peace; the corporation of the city chose me of the common council, and soon after an alderman; and the citizens at large chose me a burgess to represent them in Assembly. This latter station was the more agreeable to me, as I was at length tired with sitting there to hear debates, in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and which were often so unentertaining that I was induc'd to amuse myself with making magic squares or circles, or anything to avoid weariness; and I conceiv'd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good. I would not, however, insinuate that my ambition was not flatter'd by all these promotions; it certainly was; for, considering my low beginning, they were great things to me; and they were still more pleasing, as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion, and by me entirely unsolicited.\n\nThe office of justice of the peace I try'd a little, by attending a few courts, and sitting on the bench to hear causes; but finding that more knowledge of the common law than I possess'd was necessary to act in that station with credit, I gradually withdrew from it, excusing myself by my being oblig'd to attend the higher duties of a legislator in the Assembly. My election to this trust was repeated every year for ten years, without my ever asking any elector for his vote, or signifying, either directly or indirectly, any desire of being chosen. On taking my seat in the House, my son was appointed their clerk.\n\nThe year following, a treaty being to be held with the Indians at Carlisle, the governor sent a message to the House, proposing that they should nominate some of their members, to be join'd with some members of council, as commissioners for that purpose.[88] The House named the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself; and, being commission'd, we went to Carlisle, and met the Indians accordingly.\n\nAs those people are extreamly apt to get drunk, and, when so, are very quarrelsome and disorderly, we strictly forbad the selling any liquor to them; and when they complain'd of this restriction, we told them that if they would continue sober during the treaty, we would give them plenty of rum when business was over. They promis'd this, and they kept their promise, because they could get no liquor, and the treaty was conducted very orderly, and concluded to mutual satisfaction. They then claim'd and received the rum; this was in the afternoon: they were near one hundred men, women, and children, and were lodg'd in temporary cabins, built in the form of a square, just without the town. In the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter. We found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square; they were all drunk, men and women, quarreling and fighting. Their dark-colour'd bodies, half naked, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire, running after and beating one another with firebrands, accompanied by their horrid yellings, form'd a scene the most resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagin'd; there was no appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our lodging. At midnight a number of them came thundering at our door, demanding more rum, of which we took no notice.\n\nThe next day, sensible they had misbehav'd in giving us that disturbance, they sent three of their old counselors to make their apology. The orator acknowledg'd the fault, but laid it upon the rum; and then endeavoured to excuse the rum by saying, \"The Great Spirit, who made all things, made everything for some use, and whatever use he design'd anything for, that use it should always be put to. Now, when he made rum, he said, 'Let this be for the Indians to get drunk with,' and it must be so.\" And, indeed, if it be the design of Providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth, it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means. It has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the sea-coast.\n\nIn the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter\n\"In the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter\"\nIn 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the idea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent design, which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), for the reception and cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of the province or strangers. He was zealous and active in endeavouring to procure subscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty in America, and at first not well understood, he met but with small success.\n\nAt length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no such thing as carrying a public-spirited project through without my being concern'd in it. \"For,\" says he, \"I am often ask'd by those to whom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted Franklin upon this business? And what does he think of it? And when I tell them that I have not (supposing it rather out of your line), they do not subscribe, but say they will consider of it.\" I enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme, and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation, I not only subscrib'd to it myself, but engag'd heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others. Previously, however, to the solicitation, I endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers, which was my usual custom in such cases, but which he had omitted.\n\nThe subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous; but, beginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from the Assembly, and therefore propos'd to petition for it, which was done. The country members did not at first relish the project; they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city, and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it; and they doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approv'd of it. My allegation on the contrary, that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations, they considered as a most extravagant supposition, and utterly impossible.\n\nOn this I form'd my plan; and, asking leave to bring in a bill for incorporating the contributors according to the prayer of their petition, and granting them a blank sum of money, which leave was obtained chiefly on the consideration that the House could throw the bill out if they did not like it, I drew it so as to make the important clause a conditional one, viz., \"And be it enacted, by the authority aforesaid, that when the said contributors shall have met and chosen their managers and treasurer, and shall have raised by their contributions a capital stock of\u2014\u2014value (the yearly interest of which is to be applied to the accommodating of the sick poor in the said hospital, free of charge for diet, attendance, advice, and medicines), and shall make the same appear to the satisfaction of the speaker of the Assembly for the time being, that then it shall and may be lawful for the said speaker, and he is hereby required, to sign an order on the provincial treasurer for the payment of two thousand pounds, in two yearly payments, to the treasurer of the said hospital, to be applied to the founding, building, and finishing of the same.\"\n\nThis condition carried the bill through; for the members, who had oppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the credit of being charitable without the expense, agreed to its passage; and then, in soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'd the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man's donation would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways. The subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and we claim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which enabled us to carry the design into execution. A convenient and handsome building was soon erected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful, and flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political manoeuvers, the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or wherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having made some use of cunning.\n\nIt was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert Tennent[89], came to me with a request that I would assist him in procuring a subscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was to be for the use of a congregation he had gathered among the Presbyterians, who were originally disciples of Mr. Whitefield. Unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellow-citizens by too frequently soliciting their contributions, I absolutely refus'd. He then desired I would furnish him with a list of the names of persons I knew by experience to be generous and public-spirited. I thought it would be unbecoming in me, after their kind compliance with my solicitations, to mark them out to be worried by other beggars, and therefore refus'd also to give such a list. He then desir'd I would at least give him my advice. \"That I will readily do,\" said I; \"and, in the first place, I advise you to apply to all those whom you know will give something; next, to those whom you are uncertain whether they will give anything or not, and show them the list of those who have given; and, lastly, do not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing, for in some of them you may be mistaken.\" He laugh'd and thank'd me, and said he would take my advice. He did so, for he ask'd of everybody, and he obtain'd a much larger sum than he expected, with which he erected the capacious and very elegant meeting-house that stands in Arch-street.\n\nOur city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets large, straight, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire, so that it was difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive. I had liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market, and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions. A strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length pav'd with brick, so that, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often over shoes in dirt to get there. By talking and writing on the subject, I was at length instrumental in getting the street pav'd with stone between the market and the brick'd foot-pavement, that was on each side next the houses. This, for some time, gave an easy access to the market dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not being pav'd, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'd with mire, which was not remov'd, the city as yet having no scavengers.\n\nAfter some inquiry, I found a poor, industrious man, who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week, carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours' doors, for the sum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtain'd by this small expense; the greater ease in keeping our houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet; the benefit to the shops by more custom, etc., etc., as buyers could more easily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust blown in upon their goods, etc., etc. I sent one of these papers to each house, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously sign'd, and for a time well executed. All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a convenience to all, and this rais'd a general desire to have all the streets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose.\n\nAfter some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought it into the Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did not pass till I was gone,[90] and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment, which I thought not for the better, but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a great improvement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John Clifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one at his door, that the people were first impress'd with the idea of enlighting all the city. The honour of this public benefit has also been ascrib'd to me, but it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supply'd with from London. Those we found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodg'd on its inside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford; giving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and render it totally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevices admitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by this means they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as the London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning, and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily repair'd.\n\nI have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not, from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd at Vauxhall[91] have in keeping them clean, learn to have such holes in their street lamps. But, these holes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro' them, the other use, of letting in air, seems not to have been thought of; and therefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of London are very poorly illuminated.\n\nThe mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos'd, when in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have known, and a great promoter of useful projects. I had observ'd that the streets, when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried away; but it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather reduc'd it to mud, and then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms, it was with great labour rak'd together and thrown up into carts open above, the sides of which suffered some of the slush at every jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyance of foot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets was that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses.\n\na poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom\nAn accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be done in a little time. I found at my door in Craven-street,[92] one morning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom; she appeared very pale and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness. I ask'd who employ'd her to sweep there; she said, \"Nobody, but I am very poor and in distress, and I sweeps before gentle-folkses doors, and hopes they will give me something.\" I bid her sweep the whole street clean, and I would give her a shilling; this was at nine o'clock; at 12 she came for the shilling. From the slowness I saw at first in her working, I could scarce believe that the work was done so soon, and sent my servant to examine it, who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean, and all the dust plac'd in the gutter, which was in the middle; and the next rain wash'd it quite away, so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean.\n\nI then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in three hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time. And here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on each side, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but when divided into two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, and only makes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement, which is thereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking. My proposal, communicated to the good doctor, was as follows:\n\n\"For the more effectual cleaning and keeping clean the streets of London and Westminster, it is proposed that the several watchmen be contracted with to have the dust swept up in dry seasons, and the mud rak'd up at other times, each in the several streets and lanes of his round; that they be furnish'd with brooms and other proper instruments for these purposes, to be kept at their respective stands, ready to furnish the poor people they may employ in the service.\n\n\"That in the dry summer months the dust be all swept up into heaps at proper distances, before the shops and windows of houses are usually opened, when the scavengers, with close-covered carts, shall also carry it all away.\n\n\"That the mud, when rak'd up, be not left in heaps to be spread abroad again by the wheels of carriages and trampling of horses, but that the scavengers be provided with bodies of carts, not plac'd high upon wheels, but low upon sliders, with lattice bottoms, which, being cover'd with straw, will retain the mud thrown into them, and permit the water to drain from it, whereby it will become much lighter, water making the greatest part of its weight; these bodies of carts to be plac'd at convenient distances, and the mud brought to them in wheelbarrows; they remaining where plac'd till the mud is drain'd, and then horses brought to draw them away.\"\n\nI have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and the difficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber too much the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiring the dust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shops are open, is very practicable in the summer, when the days are long; for, in walking thro' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seven o'clock, I observ'd there was not one shop open, tho' it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours; the inhabitants of London chusing voluntarily to live much by candle-light, and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain, a little absurdly, of the duty on candles, and the high price of tallow.\n\nSome may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating; but when they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyes of a single person, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of small importance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city, and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is produced not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. The money may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument. With these sentiments I have hazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city I love, having lived many years in it very happily, and perhaps to some of our towns in America.\n\nHaving been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of America as his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringing the officers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed, jointly with Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him, by a commission from the postmaster-general in England. The American office never had hitherto paid anything to that of Britain. We were to have six hundred pounds a year between us, if we could make that sum out of the profits of the office. To do this, a variety of improvements were necessary; some of these were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us. But it soon after began to repay us; and before I was displac'd by a freak of the ministers, of which I shall speak hereafter, we had brought it to yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the post-office of Ireland. Since that imprudent transaction, they have receiv'd from it\u2014not one farthing!\n\nThe business of the post-office occasion'd my taking a journey this year to New England, where the College of Cambridge, of their own motion, presented me with the degree of Master of Arts. Yale College, in Connecticut, had before made me a similar compliment. Thus, without studying in any college, I came to partake of their honours.

Governor Hamilton, having receiv'd this order, acquainted the House with it, requesting they would furnish proper presents for the Indians, to be given on this occasion; and naming the speaker (Mr. Norris) and myself to join Mr. Thomas Penn and Mr. Secretary Peters as commissioners to act for Pennsylvania. The House approv'd the nomination, and provided the goods for the present, and tho' they did not much like treating out of the provinces; and we met the other commissioners at Albany about the middle of June.\n\nIn our way thither, I projected and drew a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government, so far as might be necessary for defense, and other important general purposes. As we pass'd thro' New York, I had there shown my project to Mr. James Alexander and Mr. Kennedy, two gentlemen of great knowledge in public affairs, and, being fortified by their approbation, I ventur'd to lay it before the Congress. It then appeared that several of the commissioners had form'd plans of the same kind. A previous question was first taken, whether a union should be established, which pass'd in the affirmative unanimously. A committee was then appointed, one member from each colony, to consider the several plans and report. Mine happen'd to be preferr'd, and, with a few amendments, was accordingly reported.\n\nJOIN or DIE.\nBy this plan the general government was to be administered by a president-general, appointed and supported by the crown, and a grand council was to be chosen by the representatives of the people of the several colonies, met in their respective assemblies. The debates upon it in Congress went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business. Many objections and difficulties were started, but at length they were all overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed to, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces. Its fate was singular; the assemblies did not adopt it, as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it, and in England it was judg'd to have too much of the democratic. The Board of Trade therefore did not approve of it, nor recommend it for the approbation of his majesty; but another scheme was form'd, supposed to answer the same purpose better, whereby the governors of the provinces, with some members of their respective councils, were to meet and order the raising of troops, building of forts, etc., and to draw on the treasury of Great Britain for the expense, which was afterwards to be refunded by an act of Parliament laying a tax on America. My plan, with my reasons in support of it, is to be found among my political papers that are printed.\n\nBeing the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation with Governor Shirley upon both the plans. Part of what passed between us on the occasion may also be seen among those papers. The different and contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was really the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted. The colonies, so united, would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves; there would then have been no need of troops from England; of course, the subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloody contest it occasioned, would have been avoided. But such mistakes are not new; history is full of the errors of states and princes.\n\n\"Look round the habitable world, how few\nKnow their own good, or, knowing it, pursue!\"\nThose who govern, having much business on their hands, do not generally like to take the trouble of considering and carrying into execution new projects. The best public measures are therefore seldom adopted from previous wisdom, but forc'd by the occasion.\n\nThe Governor of Pennsylvania, in sending it down to the Assembly, expressed his approbation of the plan, \"as appearing to him to be drawn up with great clearness and strength of judgment, and therefore recommended it as well worthy of their closest and most serious attention.\" The House, however, by the management of a certain member, took it up when I happen'd to be absent, which I thought not very fair, and reprobated it without paying any attention to it at all, to my no small mortification.\n\nXV\n\nQUARRELS WITH THE PROPRIETARY GOVERNORS\n\nblock-IN my journey to Boston this year, I met at New York with our new governor, Mr. Morris, just arriv'd there from England, with whom I had been before intimately acquainted. He brought a commission to supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd me if I thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration. I said, \"No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one, if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly.\" \"My dear friend,\" says he, pleasantly, \"how can you advise my avoiding disputes? You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the regard I have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible, avoid them.\" He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and, therefore, generally successful in argumentative conversation. He had been brought up to it from a boy, his father, as I have heard, accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his diversion, while sitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice was not wise; for, in the course of my observation, these disputing, contradicting, and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs. They get victory sometimes, but they never get good will, which would be of more use to them. We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I to Boston.\n\nIn returning, I met at New York with the votes of the Assembly, by which it appear'd that, notwithstanding his promise to me, he and the House were already in high contention; and it was a continual battle between them as long as he retain'd the government. I had my share of it; for, as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put on every committee for answering his speeches and messages, and by the committees always desired to make the drafts. Our answers, as well as his messages, were often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and, as he knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that, when we met, we could hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so good-natur'd a man that no personal difference between him and me was occasion'd by the contest, and we often din'd together.\n\nOne afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the street\nOne afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the street. \"Franklin,\" says he, \"you must go home with me and spend the evening; I am to have some company that you will like;\" and, taking me by the arm, he led me to his house. In gay conversation over our wine, after supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir'd the idea of Sancho Panza,[93] who, when it was proposed to give him a government, requested it might be a government of blacks, as then, if he could not agree with his people, he might sell them. One of his friends, who sat next to me, says, \"Franklin, why do you continue to side with these damn'd Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietor would give you a good price.\" \"The governor,\" says I, \"has not yet blacked them enough.\" He, indeed, had laboured hard to blacken the Assembly in all his messages, but they wip'd off his colouring as fast as he laid it on, and plac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face; so that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as Mr. Hamilton, grew tir'd of the contest, and quitted the government.\n\nThese public quarrels[94] were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to be incurred for the defense of their province, with incredible meanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes, unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused; and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such instructions. The Assemblies for three years held out against this injustice, tho' constrained to bend at last. At length Captain Denny, who was Governor Morris's successor, ventured to disobey those instructions; how that was brought about I shall show hereafter.\n\nBut I am got forward too fast with my story: there are still some transactions to be mention'd that happened during the administration of Governor Morris.\n\nWar being in a manner commenced with France, the government of Massachusetts Bay projected an attack upon Crown Point,[95] and sent Mr. Quincy to Pennsylvania, and Mr. Pownall, afterward Governor Pownall, to New York, to solicit assistance. As I was in the Assembly, knew its temper, and was Mr. Quincy's countryman, he appli'd to me for my influence and assistance. I dictated his address to them, which was well received. They voted an aid of ten thousand pounds, to be laid out in provisions. But the governor refusing his assent to their bill (which included this with other sums granted for the use of the crown), unless a clause were inserted exempting the proprietary estate from bearing any part of the tax that would be necessary, the Assembly, tho' very desirous of making their grant to New England effectual, were at a loss how to accomplish it. Mr. Quincy labored hard with the governor to obtain his assent, but he was obstinate.\n\nI then suggested a method of doing the business without the governor, by orders on the trustees of the Loan office, which, by law, the Assembly had the right of drawing. There was, indeed, little or no money at that time in the office, and therefore I propos'd that the orders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interest of five per cent. With these orders I suppos'd the provisions might easily be purchas'd. The Assembly, with very little hesitation, adopted the proposal. The orders were immediately printed, and I was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them. The fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise, which being known to be more than sufficient, they obtain'd instant credit, and were not only receiv'd in payment for the provisions, but many money'd people, who had cash lying by them, vested it in those orders, which they found advantageous, as they bore interest while upon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money; so that they were eagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen. Thus this important affair was by my means completed. Mr. Quincy return'd thanks to the Assembly in a handsome memorial, went home highly pleas'd with this success of his embassy, and ever after bore for me the most cordial and affectionate friendship.\n\n[93] The \"round, selfish, and self-important\" squire of Don Quixote in Cervantes' romance of that name.\n\n[94] My acts in Morris's time, military, etc.\u2014Marg. note.\n\n[95] On Lake Champlain, ninety miles north of Albany.

It was finally captured from the English by the Americans in 1775.\n\nXVI\n\nBRADDOCK'S EXPEDITION\n\nblock-THE British government, not chusing to permit the union of the colonies as propos'd at Albany, and to trust that union with their defense, lest they should thereby grow too military, and feel their own strength, suspicions and jealousies at this time being entertain'd of them, sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for that purpose. He landed at Alexandria, in Virginia, and thence march'd to Frederictown, in Maryland, where he halted for carriages. Our Assembly apprehending, from some information, that he had conceived violent prejudices against them, as averse to the service, wish'd me to wait upon him, not as from them, but as postmaster-general, under the guise of proposing to settle with him the mode of conducting with most celerity and certainty the despatches between him and the governors of the several provinces, with whom he must necessarily have continual correspondence, and of which they propos'd to pay the expense. My son accompanied me on this journey.\n\nWe found the general at Frederictown, waiting impatiently for the return of those he had sent thro' the back parts of Maryland and Virginia to collect waggons. I stayed with him several days, din'd with him daily, and had full opportunity of removing all his prejudices, by the information of what the Assembly had before his arrival actually done, and were still willing to do, to facilitate his operations. When I was about to depart, the returns of waggons to be obtained were brought in, by which it appear'd that they amounted only to twenty-five, and not all of those were in serviceable condition. The general and all the officers were surpris'd, declar'd the expedition was then at an end, being impossible, and exclaim'd against the ministers for ignorantly landing them in a country destitute of the means of conveying their stores, baggage, etc., not less than one hundred and fifty waggons being necessary.\n\nI happen'd to say I thought it was pity they had not been landed rather in Pennsylvania, as in that country almost every farmer had his waggon. The general eagerly laid hold of my words, and said, \"Then you, sir, who are a man of interest there, can probably procure them for us; and I beg you will undertake it.\" I ask'd what terms were to be offer'd the owners of the waggons, and I was desir'd to put on paper the terms that appeared to me necessary. This I did, and they were agreed to, and a commission and instructions accordingly prepar'd immediately. What those terms were will appear in the advertisement I publish'd as soon as I arriv'd at Lancaster, which being, from the great and sudden effect it produc'd, a piece of some curiosity, I shall insert it at length, as follows:\n\n\"Advertisement.\n\"Lancaster, April 26, 1755.\n\n\"Whereas, one hundred and fifty waggons, with four horses to each waggon, and fifteen hundred saddle or pack horses, are wanted for the service of his majesty's forces now about to rendezvous at Will's Creek, and his excellency General Braddock having been pleased to empower me to contract for the hire of the same, I hereby give notice that I shall attend for that purpose at Lancaster from this day to next Wednesday evening, and at York from next Thursday morning till Friday evening, where I shall be ready to agree for waggons and teams, or single horses, on the following terms, viz.: 1. That there shall be paid for each waggon, with four good horses and a driver, fifteen shillings per diem; and for each able horse with a pack-saddle, or other saddle and furniture, two shillings per diem; and for each able horse without a saddle, eighteen pence per diem. 2. That the pay commence from the time of their joining the forces at Will's Creek, which must be on or before the 20th of May ensuing, and that a reasonable allowance be paid over and above for the time necessary for their travelling to Will's Creek and home again after their discharge. 3. Each waggon and team, and every saddle or pack horse, is to be valued by indifferent persons chosen between me and the owner; and in case of the loss of any waggon, team, or other horse in the service, the price according to such valuation is to be allowed and paid. 4. Seven days' pay is to be advanced and paid in hand by me to the owner of each waggon and team, or horse, at the time of contracting, if required, and the remainder to be paid by General Braddock, or by the paymaster of the army, at the time of their discharge, or from time to time, as it shall be demanded. 5. No drivers of waggons, or persons taking care of the hired horses, are on any account to be called upon to do the duty of soldiers, or be otherwise employed than in conducting or taking care of their carriages or horses. 6. All oats, Indian corn, or other forage that waggons or horses bring to the camp, more than is necessary for the subsistence of the horses, is to be taken for the use of the army, and a reasonable price paid for the same.\n\n\"Note.\u2014My son, William Franklin, is empowered to enter into like contracts with any person in Cumberland county.\n\n\"B. Franklin.\"\n\n\"To the inhabitants of the Counties of Lancaster, York, and Cumberland.\n\"Friends and Countrymen,\n\n\"Being occasionally[96] at the camp at Frederic a few days since, I found the general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not being supplied with horses and carriages, which had been expected from this province, as most able to furnish them; but, through the dissensions between our governor and Assembly, money had not been provided, nor any steps taken for that purpose.\n\n\"It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties, to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted, and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to drive and take care of them.\n\n\"I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these counties on such an occasion, especially considering the temper they are in, and their resentment against us, would be attended with many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants, and therefore more willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and equitable means. The people of these back counties have lately complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; you have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very considerable sum; for, if the service of this expedition should continue, as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred and twenty days, the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver and gold of the king's money.\n\n\"The service will be light and easy, for the army will scarce march above twelve miles per day, and the waggons and baggage-horses, as they carry those things that are absolutely necessary to the welfare of the army, must march with the army, and no faster; and are, for the army's sake, always placed where they can be most secure, whether in a march or in a camp.\n\n\"If you are really, as I believe you are, good and loyal subjects to his majesty, you may now do a most acceptable service, and make it easy to yourselves; for three or four of such as cannot separately spare from the business of their plantations a waggon and four horses and a driver, may do it together, one furnishing the waggon, another one or two horses, and another the driver, and divide the pay proportionately between you; but if you do not this service to your king and country voluntarily, when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to you, your loyalty will be strongly suspected. The king's business must be done; so many brave troops, come so far for your defense, must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected from you; waggons and horses must be had; violent measures will probably be used, and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it, and your case, perhaps, be little pitied or regarded.\n\n\"I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except the satisfaction of endeavouring to do good, I shall have only my labour for my pains. If this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not likely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen days; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar, with a body of soldiers, will immediately enter the province for the purpose, which I shall be sorry to hear, because I am very sincerely and truly your friend and well-wisher,\n\n\"B. Franklin.\"\n\nI received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to be disbursed in advance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but that sum being insufficient, I advanc'd upward of two hundred pounds more, and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundred and fifty-nine carrying horses, were on their march for the camp. The advertisement promised payment according to the valuation, in case any waggon or horse should be lost. The owners, however, alleging they did not know General Braddock, or what dependence might be had on his promise, insisted on my bond for the performance, which I accordingly gave them.\n\nWhile I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officers of Colonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concern for the subalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence, and could ill afford, in this dear country, to lay in the stores that might be necessary in so long a march, thro' a wilderness, where nothing was to be purchas'd. I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavour procuring them some relief. I said nothing, however, to him of my intention, but wrote the next morning to the committee of the Assembly, who had the disposition of some public money, warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration, and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments. My son, who had some experience of a camp life, and of its wants, drew up a list for me, which I enclos'd in my letter. The committee approv'd, and used such diligence that, conducted by my son, the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons. They consisted of twenty parcels, each containing\n\n6 lbs. loaf sugar.\t1 Gloucester cheese.\n6 lbs. good Muscovado do.\t1 kegg containing 20 lbs. good butter.\n1 lb. good green tea.\t2 doz. old Madeira wine.\n1 lb. good bohea do.\t2 gallons Jamaica spirits.\n6 lbs. good ground coffee.\t1 bottle flour of mustard.\n6 lbs. chocolate.\t2 well-cur'd hams.\n1-2 cwt. best white biscuit.\t1-2 dozen dry'd tongues.\n1-2 lb. pepper.\t6 lbs. rice.\n1 quart best white wine\t6 lbs. raisins.\n1 quart best white wine vinegar.\n\nThese twenty parcels, well pack'd, were placed on as many horses, each parcel, with the horse, being intended as a present for one officer. They were very thankfully receiv'd, and the kindness acknowledg'd by letters to me from the colonels of both regiments, in the most grateful terms. The general, too, was highly satisfied with my conduct in procuring him the waggons, etc., and readily paid my account of disbursements, thanking me repeatedly, and requesting my farther assistance in sending provisions after him. I undertook this also, and was busily employ'd in it till we heard of his defeat, advancing for the service of my own money, upwards of one thousand pounds sterling, of which I sent him an account. It came to his hands, luckily for me, a few days before the battle, and he return'd me immediately an order on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds, leaving the remainder to the next account. I consider this payment as good luck, having never been able to obtain that remainder, of which more hereafter.\n\nThis general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably have made a figure as a good officer in some European war. But he had too much self-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops, and too mean a one of both Americans and Indians. George Croghan, our Indian interpreter, join'd him on his march with one hundred of those people, who might have been of great use to his army as guides, scouts, etc., if he had treated them kindly; but he slighted and neglected them, and they gradually left him.\n\nIn conversation with him one day, he was giving me some account of his intended progress. \"After taking Fort Duquesne,\"[97] says he, \"I am to proceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac,[98] if the season will allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days; and then I see nothing that can obstruct my march to Niagara.\" Having before revolv'd in my mind the long line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road, to be cut for them thro' the woods and bushes, and also what I had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquois country, I had conceiv'd some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign. But I ventur'd only to say, \"To be sure, sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne, with these fine troops, so well provided with artillery, that place not yet completely fortified, and as we hear with no very strong garrison, can probably make but a short resistance. The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians, who, by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing them; and the slender line, near four miles long, which your army must make, may expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut like a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance, cannot come up in time to support each other.\"\n\nHe smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, \"These savages may, indeed, be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but upon the king's regular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossible they should make any impression.\" I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession, and said no more. The enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I apprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advance without interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then, when more in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front had halted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the woods than any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by heavy fire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemy's being near him. This guard being disordered, the general hurried the troops up to their assistance, which was done in great confusion, thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the fire came upon their flank: the officers, being on horseback, were more easily distinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very fast; and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle, having or hearing no orders, and standing to be shot at till two-thirds of them were killed; and then, being seiz'd with a panick, the whole fled with precipitation.\n\nThe only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians\nThe waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd; their example was immediately followed by others; so that all the waggons, provisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy. The general, being wounded, was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr. Shirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers, sixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred. These eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army; the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar, who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and baggage. The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd at Dunbar's camp, and the panick they brought with them instantly seiz'd him and all his people; and, tho' he had now above one thousand men, and the enemy who had beaten Braddock did not at most exceed four hundred Indians and French together, instead of proceeding, and endeavouring to recover some of the lost honour, he ordered all the stores, ammunition, etc., to be destroy'd, that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards the settlements, and less lumber to remove. He was there met with requests from the governors of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, that he would post his troops on the frontier, so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants; but he continued his hasty march thro' all the country, not thinking himself safe till he arrived at Philadelphia, where the inhabitants could protect him. This whole transaction gave us Americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regulars had not been well founded.[99]\n\nIn their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyond the settlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants, totally ruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and confining the people if they remonstrated. This was enough to put us out of conceit of such defenders, if we had really wanted any. How different was the conduct of our French friends in 1781, who, during a march thro' the most inhabited part of our country from Rhode Island to Virginia, near seven hundred miles, occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig, a chicken, or even an apple.\n\nCaptain Orme, who was one of the general's aids-de-camp, and, being grievously wounded, was brought off with him, and continu'd with him to his death, which happen'd in a few days, told me that he was totally silent all the first day, and at night only said, \"Who would have thought it?\" That he was silent again the following day, saying only at last, \"We shall better know how to deal with them another time\"; and dy'd in a few minutes after.\n\nThe secretary's papers, with all the general's orders, instructions, and correspondence, falling into the enemy's hands, they selected and translated into French a number of the articles, which they printed, to prove the hostile intentions of the British court before the declaration of war. Among these I saw some letters of the general to the ministry, speaking highly of the great service I had rendered the army, and recommending me to their notice. David Hume,[100] too, who was some years after secretary to Lord Hertford, when minister in France, and afterward to General Conway, when secretary of state, told me he had seen among the papers in that office, letters from Braddock highly recommending me. But, the expedition having been unfortunate, my service, it seems, was not thought of much value, for those recommendations were never of any use to me.\n\nAs to rewards from himself, I ask'd only one, which was, that he would give orders to his officers not to enlist any more of our bought servants, and that he would discharge such as had been already enlisted. This he readily granted, and several were accordingly return'd to their masters, on my application. Dunbar, when the command devolv'd on him, was not so generous. He being at Philadelphia, on his retreat, or rather flight, I apply'd to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that he had enlisted, reminding him of the late general's orders on that head. He promised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton, where he should be in a few days on his march to New York, he would there deliver their men to them. They accordingly were at the expense and trouble of going to Trenton, and there he refus'd to perform his promise, to their great loss and disappointment.\n\nAs soon as the loss of the waggons and horses was generally known, all the owners came upon me for the valuation which I had given bond to pay. Their demands gave me a great deal of trouble, my acquainting them that the money was ready in the paymaster's hands, but that orders for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley,[101] and my assuring them that I had apply'd to that general by letter; but, he being at a distance, an answer could not soon be receiv'd, and they must have patience, all this was not sufficient to satisfy, and some began to sue me. General Shirley at length relieved me from this terrible situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims, and ordering payment. They amounted to near twenty thousand pound, which to pay would have ruined me.\n\nBefore we had the news of this defeat, the two Doctors Bond came to me with a subscription paper for raising money to defray the expense of a grand firework, which it was intended to exhibit at a rejoicing on receipt of the news of our taking Fort Duquesne. I looked grave, and said it would, I thought, be time enough to prepare for the rejoicing when we knew we should have occasion to rejoice. They seem'd surpris'd that I did not immediately comply with their proposal. \"Why the d\u2014\u2014l!\" says one of them, \"you surely don't suppose that the fort will not be taken?\" \"I don't know that it will not be taken, but I know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty.\" I gave them the reasons of my doubting; the subscription was dropt, and the projectors thereby missed the mortification they would have undergone if the firework had been prepared. Dr. Bond, on some other occasion afterward, said that he did not like Franklin's forebodings.\n\nGovernor Morris, who had continually worried the Assembly with message after message before the defeat of Braddock, to beat them into the making of acts to raise money for the defense of the province, without taxing, among others, the proprietary estates, and had rejected all their bills for not having such an exempting clause, now redoubled his attacks with more hope of success, the danger and necessity being greater. The Assembly, however, continu'd firm, believing they had justice on their side, and that it would be giving up an essential right if they suffered the governor to amend their money-bills. In one of the last, indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds, his propos'd amendment was only of a single word. The bill express'd \"that all estates, real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the proprietaries not excepted.\" His amendment was, for not read only: a small, but very material alteration. However, when the news of this disaster reached England, our friends there whom we had taken care to furnish with all the Assembly's answers to the governor's messages, rais'd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving their governor such instructions; some going so far as to say that, by obstructing the defense of their province, they forfeited their right to it. They were intimidated by this, and sent orders to their receiver-general to add five thousand pounds of their money to whatever sum might be given by the Assembly for such purpose.\n\nThis, being notified to the House, was accepted in lieu of their share of a general tax, and a new bill was form'd, with an exempting clause, which passed accordingly. By this act I was appointed one of the commissioners for disposing of the money, sixty thousand pounds. I had been active in modelling the bill and procuring its passage, and had, at the same time, drawn a bill for establishing and disciplining a voluntary militia, which I carried thro' the House without much difficulty, as care was taken in it to leave the Quakers at their liberty. To promote the association necessary to form the militia, I wrote a dialogue,[102] stating and answering all the objections I could think of to such a militia, which was printed, and had, as I thought, great effect.\n\n[96] By chance.\n\n[97] Pittsburg.\n\n[98] Kingston, at the eastern end of Lake Ontario.\n\n[99] Other accounts of this expedition and defeat may be found in Fiske's Washington and his Country, or Lodge's George Washington, Vol. 1.\n\n[100] A famous Scotch philosopher and historian (1711-1776).\n\n[101] Governor of Massachusetts and commander of the British forces in America.\n\n[102] This dialogue and the militia act are in the Gentleman's Magazine for February and March, 1756.\u2014Marg. note.\n\nXVII\n\nFRANKLIN'S DEFENSE OF THE FRONTIER\n\nblock-WHILE the several companies in the city and country were forming, and learning their exercise, the governor prevail'd with me to take charge of our North-western frontier, which was infested by the enemy, and provide for the defense of the inhabitants by raising troops and building a line of forts. I undertook this military business, tho' I did not conceive myself well qualified for it. He gave me a commission with full powers, and a parcel of blank commissions for officers, to be given to whom I thought fit. I had but little difficulty in raising men, having soon five hundred and sixty under my command. My son, who had in the preceding war been an officer in the army rais'd against Canada, was my aid-de-camp, and of great use to me. The Indians had burned Gnadenhut,[103] a village settled by the Moravians, and massacred the inhabitants; but the place was thought a good situation for one of the forts.\n\nIn order to march thither, I assembled the companies at Bethlehem, the chief establishment of those people. I was surprised to find it in so good a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger. The principal buildings were defended by a stockade; they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York, and had even plac'd quantities of small paving stones between the windows of their high stone houses, for their women to throw down upon the heads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them. The armed brethren, too, kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any garrison town. In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I mention'd this my surprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of Parliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies, I had suppos'd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms. He answer'd me that it was not one of their established principles, but that, at the time of their obtaining that act, it was thought to be a principle with many of their people. On this occasion, however, they, to their surprise, found it adopted by but a few. It seems they were either deceiv'd in themselves, or deceiv'd the Parliament; but common sense, aided by present danger, will sometimes be too strong for whimsical opinions.\n\nIt was the beginning of January when we set out upon this business of building forts. I sent one detachment toward the Minisink, with instructions to erect one for the security of that upper part of the country, and another to the lower part, with similar instructions; and I concluded to go myself with the rest of my force to Gnadenhut, where a fort was tho't more immediately necessary. The Moravians procur'd me five waggons for our tools, stores, baggage, etc.\n\nJust before we left Bethlehem, eleven farmers, who had been driven from their plantations by the Indians, came to me requesting a supply of firearms, that they might go back and fetch off their cattle. I gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition. We had not march'd many miles before it began to rain, and it continued raining all day; there were no habitations on the road to shelter us, till we arriv'd near night at the house of a German, where, and in his barn, we were all huddled together, as wet as water could make us. It was well we were not attack'd in our march, for our arms were of the most ordinary sort, and our men could not keep their gun locks[104] dry. The Indians are dexterous in contrivances for that purpose, which we had not. They met that day the eleven poor farmers above mentioned, and killed ten of them. The one who escap'd inform'd that his and his companions' guns would not go off, the priming being wet with the rain.\n\nWe had not march'd many miles before it began to rain\nThe next day being fair, we continu'd our march, and arriv'd at the desolated Gnadenhut. There was a saw-mill near, round which were left several piles of boards, with which we soon hutted ourselves; an operation the more necessary at that inclement season, as we had no tents. Our first work was to bury more effectually the dead we found there, who had been half interr'd by the country people.\n\nThe next morning our fort was plann'd and mark'd out, the circumference measuring four hundred and fifty-five feet, which would require as many palisades to be made of trees, one with another, of a foot diameter each. Our axes, of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work to cut down trees, and, our men being dexterous in the use of them, great despatch was made. Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter. Each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one end. While these were preparing, our other men dug a trench all round, of three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be planted; and, our waggons, the bodys being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch,[105] we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within, about six feet high, for the men to stand on when to fire thro' the loopholes. We had one swivel gun, which we mounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to let the Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we had such pieces; and thus our fort, if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade, was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hard every other day that the men could not work.\n\nOur axes ... were immediately set to work to cut down trees\n\"Our axes ... were immediately set to work to cut down trees\"\nThis gave me occasion to observe, that, when men are employ'd, they are best content'd; for on the days they worked they were good-natur'd and cheerful, and, with the consciousness of having done a good day's work, they spent the evening jollily; but on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome, finding fault with their pork, the bread, etc., and in continual ill-humour, which put me in mind of a sea-captain, whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work; and, when his mate once told him that they had done everything, and there was nothing further to employ them about, \"Oh,\" says he, \"make them scour the anchor.\"\n\nThis kind of fort, however contemptible, is a sufficient defense against Indians, who have no cannon. Finding ourselves now posted securely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'd out in parties to scour the adjacent country. We met with no Indians, but we found the places on the neighbouring hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings. There was an art in their contrivance of those places that seems worth mention. It being winter, a fire was necessary for them; but a common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have discover'd their position at a distance. They had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter, and somewhat deeper; we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods. With these coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes, and we observ'd among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies, made by their laying all round, with their legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm, which, with them, is an essential point. This kind of fire, so manag'd, could not discover them, either by its light, flame, sparks, or even smoke: it appear'd that their number was not great, and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage.\n\nWe had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty, who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and exhortations. When they enlisted, they were promised, besides pay and provisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv'd out to them, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening; and I observed they were as punctual in attending to receive it; upon which I said to Mr. Beatty, \"It is, perhaps, below the dignity of your profession to act as steward of the rum, but if you were to deal it out and only just after prayers, you would have them all about you.\" He liked the tho't, undertook the office, and, with the help of a few hands to measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction, and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended; so that I thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws for non-attendance on divine service.\n\nI had hardly finish'd this business, and got my fort well stor'd with provisions, when I receiv'd a letter from the governor, acquainting me that he had call'd the Assembly, and wished my attendance there, if the posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there was no longer necessary. My friends, too, of the Assembly, pressing me by their letters to be, if possible, at the meeting, and my three intended forts being now compleated, and the inhabitants contented to remain on their farms under that protection, I resolved to return; the more willingly, as a New England officer, Colonel Clapham, experienced in Indian war, being on a visit to our establishment, consented to accept the command. I gave him a commission, and, parading the garrison, had it read before them, and introduc'd him to them as an officer who, from his skill in military affairs, was much more fit to command them than myself; and, giving them a little exhortation, took my leave. I was escorted as far as Bethlehem, where I rested a few days to recover from the fatigue I had undergone. The first night, being in a good bed, I could hardly sleep, it was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of our hut at Gnaden wrapt only in a blanket or two.\n\nWhile at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice of the Moravians: some of them had accompanied me, and all were very kind to me. I found they work'd for a common stock, ate at common tables, and slept in common dormitories, great numbers together. In the dormitories I observed loopholes, at certain distances all along just under the ceiling, which I thought judiciously placed for change of air. I was at their church, where I was entertain'd with good musick, the organ being accompanied with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets, etc. I understood that their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of men, women, and children, as is our common practice, but that they assembled sometimes the married men, at other times their wives, then the young men, the young women, and the little children, each division by itself. The sermon I heard was to the latter, who came in and were plac'd in rows on benches; the boys under the conduct of a young man, their tutor, and the girls conducted by a young woman. The discourse seem'd well adapted to their capacities, and was delivered in a pleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as it were, to be good. They behav'd very orderly, but looked pale and unhealthy, which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors, or not allow'd sufficient exercise.\n\nI inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the report was true that they were by lot. I was told that lots were us'd only in particular cases; that generally, when a young man found himself dispos'd to marry, he inform'd the elders of his class, who consulted the elder ladies that govern'd the young women. As these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches were suitable, and their judgments were generally acquiesc'd in; but if, for example, it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred to. I objected, if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy. \"And so they may,\" answer'd my informer, \"if you let the parties chuse for themselves;\" which, indeed, I could not deny.\n\nBeing returned to Philadelphia, I found the association went on swimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having pretty generally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chose their captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law. Dr. B. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to spread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much to those endeavours. I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my Dialogue; however, not knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him enjoy his opinion, which I take to be generally the best way in such cases. The officers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment, which I this time accepted. I forget how many companies we had, but we paraded about twelve hundred well-looking men, with a company of artillery, who had been furnished with six brass field-pieces, which they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute. The first time I reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house, and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door, which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus. And my new honour proved not much less brittle; for all our commissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in England.\n\nDuring this short time of my colonelship, being about to set out on a journey to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it into their heads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town, as far as the Lower Ferry. Just as I was getting on horseback they came to my door, between thirty and forty, mounted, and all in their uniforms. I had not been previously acquainted with the project, or I should have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion; and I was a good deal chagrin'd at their appearance, as I could not avoid their accompanying me. What made it worse was, that, as soon as we began to move, they drew their swords and rode with them naked all the way. Somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor, and it gave him great offense. No such honour had been paid him when in the province, nor to any of his governors; and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal, which may be true for aught I know, who was, and still am, ignorant of the etiquette in such cases.\n\nThis silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me, which was before not a little, on account of my conduct in the Assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation, which I had always oppos'd very warmly, and not without severe reflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it. He accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle to the King's service, preventing, by my influence in the House, the proper form of the bills for raising money, and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force. He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general, to deprive me of my office; but it had no other effect than to procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition.\n\nNotwithstanding the continual wrangle between the governor and the House, in which I, as a member, had so large a share, there still subsisted a civil intercourse between that gentleman and myself, and we never had any personal difference. I have sometimes since thought that his little or no resentment against me, for the answers it was known I drew up to his messages, might be the effect of professional habit, and that, being bred a lawyer, he might consider us both as merely advocates for contending clients in a suit, he for the proprietaries and I for the Assembly. He would, therefore, sometimes call in a friendly way to advise with me on difficult points, and sometimes, tho' not often, take my advice.\n\nWe acted in concert to supply Braddock's army with provisions; and, when the shocking news arrived of his defeat, the governor sent in haste for me, to consult with him on measures for preventing the desertion of the back counties. I forget now the advice I gave; but I think it was, that Dunbar should be written to, and prevail'd with, if possible, to post his troops on the frontiers for their protection, till, by reinforcements from the colonies, he might be able to proceed on the expedition. And, after my return from the frontier, he would have had me undertake the conduct of such an expedition with provincial troops, for the reduction of Fort Duquesne, Dunbar and his men being otherwise employed; and he proposed to commission me as general. I had not so good an opinion of my military abilities as he profess'd to have, and I believe his professions must have exceeded his real sentiments; but probably he might think that my popularity would facilitate the raising of the men, and my influence in Assembly, the grant of money to pay them, and that, perhaps, without taxing the proprietary estate. Finding me not so forward to engage as he expected, the project was dropt, and he soon after left the government, being superseded by Captain Denny.\n\n[103] Pronounced Gna\u00b4-den-hoot.\n\n[104] Flint-lock guns, discharged by means of a spark struck from flint and steel into powder (priming) in an open pan.\n\n[105] Here the pole connecting the front and rear wheels of a wagon.\n\nXVIII\n\nSCIENTIFIC EXPERIMENTS\n\nblock-bEFORE I proceed in relating the part I had in public affairs under this new governor's administration, it may not be amiss here to give some account of the rise and progress of my philosophical reputation.\n\nIn 1746, being at Boston, I met there with a Dr. Spence, who was lately arrived from Scotland, and show'd me some electric experiments. They were imperfectly perform'd, as he was not very expert; but, being on a subject quite new to me, they equally surpris'd and pleased me. Soon after my return to Philadelphia, our library company receiv'd from Mr. P. Collinson, Fellow of the Royal Society[106] of London, a present of a glass tube, with some account of the use of it in making such experiments. I eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating what I had seen at Boston; and, by much practice, acquired great readiness in performing those, also, which we had an account of from England, adding a number of new ones. I say much practice, for my house was continually full, for some time, with people who came to see these new wonders.\n\nTo divide a little this incumbrance among my friends, I caused a number of similar tubes to be blown at our glass-house, with which they furnish'd themselves, so that we had at length several performers. Among these, the principal was Mr. Kinnersley, an ingenious neighbour, who, being out of business, I encouraged to undertake showing the experiments for money, and drew up for him two lectures, in which the experiments were rang'd in such order, and accompanied with such explanations in such method, as that the foregoing should assist in comprehending the following. He procur'd an elegant apparatus for the purpose, in which all the little machines that I had roughly made for myself were nicely form'd by instrument-makers. His lectures were well attended, and gave great satisfaction; and after some time he went thro' the colonies, exhibiting them in every capital town, and pick'd up some money. In the West India islands, indeed, it was with difficulty the experiments could be made, from the general moisture of the air.\n\nOblig'd as we were to Mr. Collinson for his present of the tube, etc., I thought it right he should be inform'd of our success in using it, and wrote him several letters containing accounts of our experiments. He got them read in the Royal Society, where they were not at first thought worth so much notice as to be printed in their Transactions. One paper, which I wrote for Mr. Kinnersley, on the sameness of lightning with electricity,[107] I sent to Dr. Mitchel, an acquaintance of mine, and one of the members also of that society, who wrote me word that it had been read, but was laughed at by the connoisseurs. The papers, however, being shown to Dr. Fothergill, he thought them of too much value to be stifled, and advis'd the printing of them. Mr. Collinson then gave them to Cave for publication in his Gentleman's Magazine; but he chose to print them separately in a pamphlet, and Dr. Fothergill wrote the preface. Cave, it seems, judged rightly for his profit, for by the additions that arrived afterward, they swell'd to a quarto volume, which has had five editions, and cost him nothing for copy-money.\n\nIt was, however, some time before those papers were much taken notice of in England. A copy of them happening to fall into the hands of the Count de Buffon,[108] a philosopher deservedly of great reputation in France, and, indeed, all over Europe, he prevailed with M. Dalibard[109] to translate them into French, and they were printed at Paris. The publication offended the Abb\u00e9 Nollet, preceptor in Natural Philosophy to the royal family, and an able experimenter, who had form'd and publish'd a theory of electricity, which then had the general vogue. He could not at first believe that such a work came from America, and said it must have been fabricated by his enemies at Paris, to decry his system. Afterwards, having been assur'd that there really existed such a person as Franklin at Philadelphia, which he had doubted, he wrote and published a volume of Letters, chiefly address'd to me, defending his theory, and denying the verity of my experiments, and of the positions deduc'd from them.\n\nI once purpos'd answering the abb\u00e9, and actually began the answer; but, on consideration that my writings contained a description of experiments which anyone might repeat and verify, and if not to be verifi'd, could not be defended; or of observations offer'd as conjectures, and not delivered dogmatically, therefore not laying me under any obligation to defend them; and reflecting that a dispute between two persons, writing in different languages, might be lengthened greatly by mistranslations, and thence misconceptions of one another's meaning, much of one of the abb\u00e9's letters being founded on an error in the translation, I concluded to let my papers shift for themselves, believing it was better to spend what time I could spare from public business in making new experiments, than in disputing about those already made. I therefore never answered M. Nollet, and the event gave me no cause to repent my silence; for my friend M. le Roy, of the Royal Academy of Sciences, took up my cause and refuted him; my book was translated into the Italian, German, and Latin languages; and the doctrine it contain'd was by degrees universally adopted by the philosophers of Europe, in preference to that of the abb\u00e9; so that he lived to see himself the last of his sect, except Monsieur B\u2014\u2014, of Paris, his \u00e9l\u00e8ve and immediate disciple.\n\nWhat gave my book the more sudden and general celebrity, was the success of one of its proposed experiments, made by Messrs. Dalibard and De Lor at Marly, for drawing lightning from the clouds. This engag'd the public attention everywhere. M. de Lor, who had an apparatus for experimental philosophy, and lectur'd in that branch of science, undertook to repeat what he called the Philadelphia Experiments; and, after they were performed before the king and court, all the curious of Paris flocked to see them. I will not swell this narrative with an account of that capital experiment, nor of the infinite pleasure I receiv'd in the success of a similar one I made soon after with a kite at Philadelphia, as both are to be found in the histories of electricity.\n\nDr. Wright, an English physician, when at Paris, wrote to a friend, who was of the Royal Society, an account of the high esteem my experiments were in among the learned abroad, and of their wonder that my writings had been so little noticed in England. The society, on this, resum'd the consideration of the letters that had been read to them; and the celebrated Dr. Watson drew up a summary account of them, and of all I had afterwards sent to England on the subject, which he accompanied with some praise of the writer. This summary was then printed in their Transactions; and some members of the society in London, particularly the very ingenious Mr. Canton, having verified the experiment of procuring lightning from the clouds by a pointed rod, and acquainting them with the success, they soon made me more than amends for the slight with which they had before treated me. Without my having made any application for that honour, they chose me a member, and voted that I should be excus'd the customary payments, which would have amounted to twenty-five guineas; and ever since have given me their Transactions gratis. They also presented me with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley[110] for the year 1753, the delivery of which was accompanied by a very handsome speech of the president, Lord Macclesfield, wherein I was highly honoured.\n\n[106] The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge was founded in 1660 and holds the foremost place among English societies for the advancement of science.\n\n[107]See page 327.\n\n[108] A celebrated French naturalist (1707-1788).\n\n[109] Dalibard, who had translated Franklin's letters to Collinson into French, was the first to demonstrate, in a practical application of Franklin's experiment, that lightning and electricity are the same. \"This was May 10th, 1752, one month before Franklin flew his famous kite at Philadelphia and proved the fact himself.\"\u2014McMaster.\n\n[110] An English baronet (died in 1709), donator of a fund of \u00a3100, \"in trust for the Royal Society of London for improving natural knowledge.\"\n\nthe gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley\nXIX\n\nAGENT OF PENNSYLVANIA IN LONDON\n\nblock-OUR new governor, Captain Denny, brought over for me the before mentioned medal from the Royal Society, which he presented to me at an entertainment given him by the city. He accompanied it with very polite expressions of his esteem for me, having, as he said, been long acquainted with my character. After dinner, when the company, as was customary at that time, were engag'd in drinking, he took me aside into another room, and acquainted me that he had been advis'd by his friends in England to cultivate a friendship with me, as one who was capable of giving him the best advice, and of contributing most effectually to the making his administration easy; that he therefore desired of all things to have a good understanding with me, and he begged me to be assured of his readiness on all occasions to render me every service that might be in his power. He said much to me, also, of the proprietor's good disposition towards the province, and of the advantage it might be to us all, and to me in particular, if the opposition that had been so long continu'd to his measures was dropt, and harmony restor'd between him and the people; in effecting which, it was thought no one could be more serviceable than myself; and I might depend on adequate acknowledgments and recompenses, etc., etc. The drinkers, finding we did not return immediately to the table, sent us a decanter of Madeira, which the governor made liberal use of, and in proportion became more profuse of his solicitations and promises.\n\nMy answers were to this purpose: that my circumstances, thanks to God, were such as to make proprietary favours unnecessary to me; and that, being a member of the Assembly, I could not possibly accept of any; that, however, I had no personal enmity to the proprietary, and that, whenever the public measures he propos'd should appear to be for the good of the people, no one should espouse and forward them more zealously than myself; my past opposition having been founded on this, that the measures which had been urged were evidently intended to serve the proprietary interest, with great prejudice to that of the people; that I was much obliged to him (the governor) for his professions of regard to me, and that he might rely on everything in my power to make his administration as easy as possible, hoping at the same time that he had not brought with him the same unfortunate instruction his predecessor had been hampered with.\n\nOn this he did not then explain himself; but when he afterwards came to do business with the Assembly, they appear'd again, the disputes were renewed, and I was as active as ever in the opposition, being the penman, first, of the request to have a communication of the instructions, and then of the remarks upon them, which may be found in the votes of the time, and in the Historical Review I afterward publish'd. But between us personally no enmity arose; we were often together; he was a man of letters, had seen much of the world, and was very entertaining and pleasing in conversation. He gave me the first information that my old friend Jas. Ralph was still alive; that he was esteem'd one of the best political writers in England; had been employed in the dispute[111] between Prince Frederic and the king, and had obtain'd a pension of three hundred a year; that his reputation was indeed small as a poet, Pope having damned his poetry in the Dunciad,[112] but his prose was thought as good as any man's.\n\nThe Assembly finally finding the proprietary obstinately persisted in manacling their deputies with instructions inconsistent not only with the privileges of the people, but with the service of the crown, resolv'd to petition the king against them, and appointed me their agent to go over to England, to present and support the petition. The House had sent up a bill to the governor, granting a sum of sixty thousand pounds for the king's use (ten thousand pounds of which was subjected to the orders of the then general, Lord Loudoun), which the governor absolutely refus'd to pass, in compliance with his instructions.\n\nI had agreed with Captain Morris, of the packet at New York, for my passage, and my stores were put on board, when Lord Loudoun arriv'd at Philadelphia, expressly, as he told me, to endeavour an accommodation between the governor and Assembly, that his majesty's service might not be obstructed by their dissensions. Accordingly, he desir'd the governor and myself to meet him, that he might hear what was to be said on both sides. We met and discussed the business. In behalf of the Assembly, I urged all the various arguments that may be found in the public papers of that time, which were of my writing, and are printed with the minutes of the Assembly; and the governor pleaded his instructions, the bond he had given to observe them, and his ruin if he disobey'd, yet seemed not unwilling to hazard himself if Lord Loudoun would advise it. This his lordship did not chuse to do, though I once thought I had nearly prevail'd with him to do it; but finally he rather chose to urge the compliance of the Assembly; and he entreated me to use my endeavours with them for that purpose, declaring that he would spare none of the king's troops for the defense of our frontiers, and that, if we did not continue to provide for that defense ourselves, they must remain expos'd to the enemy.\n\nI acquainted the House with what had pass'd, and, presenting them with a set of resolutions I had drawn up, declaring our rights, and that we did not relinquish our claim to those rights, but only suspended the exercise of them on this occasion thro' force, against which we protested, they at length agreed to drop that bill, and frame another conformable to the proprietary instructions. This of course the governor pass'd, and I was then at liberty to proceed on my voyage. But, in the meantime, the packet had sailed with my sea-stores, which was some loss to me, and my only recompense was his lordship's thanks for my service, all the credit of obtaining the accommodation falling to his share.\n\nHe set out for New York before me; and, as the time for dispatching the packet-boats was at his disposition, and there were two then remaining there, one of which, he said, was to sail very soon, I requested to know the precise time, that I might not miss her by any delay of mine. His answer was, \"I have given out that she is to sail on Saturday next; but I may let you know, entre nous, that if you are there by Monday morning, you will be in time, but do not delay longer.\" By some accidental hindrance at a ferry, it was Monday noon before I arrived, and I was much afraid she might have sailed, as the wind was fair; but I was soon made easy by the information that she was still in the harbor, and would not move till the next day. One would imagine that I was now on the very point of departing for Europe. I thought so; but I was not then so well acquainted with his lordship's character, of which indecision was one of the strongest features. I shall give some instances. It was about the beginning of April that I came to New York, and I think it was near the end of June before we sail'd. There were then two of the packet-boats, which had been long in port, but were detained for the general's letters, which were always to be ready to-morrow. Another packet arriv'd; she too was detain'd; and, before we sail'd, a fourth was expected. Ours was the first to be dispatch'd, as having been there longest. Passengers were engaged in all, and some extremely impatient to be gone, and the merchants uneasy about their letters, and the orders they had given for insurance (it being war time) for fall goods; but their anxiety avail'd nothing; his lordship's letters were not ready; and yet whoever waited on him found him always at his desk, pen in hand, and concluded he must needs write abundantly.\n\nGoing myself one morning to pay my respects, I found in his antechamber one Innis, a messenger of Philadelphia, who had come from thence express with a packet from Governor Denny for the general. He delivered to me some letters from my friends there, which occasion'd my inquiring when he was to return, and where he lodg'd, that I might send some letters by him. He told me he was order'd to call to-morrow at nine for the general's answer to the governor, and should set off immediately. I put my letters into his hands the same day. A fortnight after I met him again in the same place. \"So, you are soon return'd, Innis?\" \"Return'd! no, I am not gone yet.\" \"How so?\" \"I have called here by order every morning these two weeks past for his lordship's letter, and it is not yet ready.\" \"Is it possible, when he is so great a writer? for I see him constantly at his escritoire.\" \"Yes,\" says Innis, \"but he is like St. George on the signs, always on horseback, and never rides on.\" This observation of the messenger was, it seems, well founded; for, when in England, I understood that Mr. Pitt[113] gave it as one reason for removing this general, and sending Generals Amherst and Wolfe, that the minister never heard from him, and could not know what he was doing.\n\nThis daily expectation of sailing, and all the three packets going down to Sandy Hook, to join the fleet there, the passengers thought it best to be on board, lest by a sudden order the ships should sail, and they be left behind. There, if I remember right, we were about six weeks, consuming our sea-stores, and oblig'd to procure more. At length the fleet sail'd, the general and all his army on board, bound to Louisburg, with the intent to besiege and take that fortress; all the packet-boats in company ordered to attend the general's ship, ready to receive his dispatches when they should be ready. We were out five days before we got a letter with leave to part, and then our ship quitted the fleet and steered for England. The other two packets he still detained, carried them with him to Halifax, where he stayed some time to exercise the men in sham attacks upon sham forts, then altered his mind as to besieging Louisburg, and returned to New York, with all his troops, together with the two packets above mentioned, and all their passengers! During his absence the French and savages had taken Fort George, on the frontier of that province, and the savages had massacred many of the garrison after capitulation.\n\nI saw afterwards in London Captain Bonnell, who commanded one of those packets. He told me that, when he had been detain'd a month, he acquainted his lordship that his ship was grown foul, to a degree that must necessarily hinder her fast sailing, a point of consequence for a packet-boat, and requested an allowance of time to heave her down and clean her bottom. He was asked how long time that would require. He answered, three days. The general replied, \"If you can do it in one day, I give leave; otherwise not; for you must certainly sail the day after to-morrow.\" So he never obtain'd leave, though detained afterwards from day to day during full three months.\n\nI saw also in London one of Bonnell's passengers, who was so enrag'd against his lordship for deceiving and detaining him so long at New York, and then carrying him to Halifax and back again, that he swore he would sue him for damages. Whether he did or not, I never heard; but, as he represented the injury to his affairs, it was very considerable.\n\nOn the whole, I wonder'd much how such a man came to be intrusted[114] with so important a business as the conduct of a great army; but, having since seen more of the great world, and the means of obtaining, and motives for giving places, my wonder is diminished. General Shirley, on whom the command of the army devolved upon the death of Braddock, would, in my opinion, if continued in place, have made a much better campaign than that of Loudoun in 1757, which was frivolous, expensive, and disgraceful to our nation beyond conception; for, tho' Shirley was not a bred soldier, he was sensible and sagacious in himself, and attentive to good advice from others, capable of forming judicious plans, and quick and active in carrying them into execution. Loudoun, instead of defending the colonies with his great army, left them totally expos'd while he paraded idly at Halifax, by which means Fort George was lost, besides, he derang'd all our mercantile operations, and distress'd our trade, by a long embargo on the exportation of provisions, on pretence of keeping supplies from being obtain'd by the enemy, but in reality for beating down their price in favour of the contractors, in whose profits, it was said, perhaps from suspicion only, he had a share. And, when at length the embargo was taken off, by neglecting to send notice of it to Charlestown, the Carolina fleet was detain'd near three months longer, whereby their bottoms were so much damaged by the worm that a great part of them foundered in their passage home.\n\nShirley was, I believe, sincerely glad of being relieved from so burdensome a charge as the conduct of an army must be to a man unacquainted with military business. I was at the entertainment given by the city of New York to Lord Loudoun, on his taking upon him the command. Shirley, tho' thereby superseded, was present also. There was a great company of officers, citizens, and strangers, and, some chairs having been borrowed in the neighborhood, there was one among them very low, which fell to the lot of Mr. Shirley. Perceiving it as I sat by him, I said, \"They have given you, sir, too low a seat.\" \"No matter,\" says he, \"Mr. Franklin, I find a low seat the easiest.\"\n\nWhile I was, as afore mention'd, detain'd at New York, I receiv'd all the accounts of the provisions, etc., that I had furnish'd to Braddock, some of which accounts could not sooner be obtain'd from the different persons I had employ'd to assist in the business. I presented them to Lord Loudoun, desiring to be paid the balance. He caus'd them to be regularly examined by the proper officer, who, after comparing every article with its voucher, certified them to be right; and the balance due for which his lordship promis'd to give me an order on the paymaster. This was, however, put off from time to time; and tho' I call'd often for it by appointment, I did not get it. At length, just before my departure, he told me he had, on better consideration, concluded not to mix his accounts with those of his predecessors. \"And you,\" says he, \"when in England, have only to exhibit your accounts at the treasury, and you will be paid immediately.\"\n\nI mention'd, but without effect, the great and unexpected expense I had been put to by being detain'd so long at New York, as a reason for my desiring to be presently paid; and on my observing that it was not right I should be put to any further trouble or delay in obtaining the money I had advanc'd, as I charged no commission for my service, \"O, Sir,\" says he, \"you must not think of persuading us that you are no gainer; we understand better those affairs, and know that every one concerned in supplying the army finds means, in the doing it, to fill his own pockets.\" I assur'd him that was not my case, and that I had not pocketed a farthing; but he appear'd clearly not to believe me; and, indeed, I have since learnt that immense fortunes are often made in such employments. As to my balance, I am not paid it to this day, of which more hereafter.\n\nOur captain of the packet had boasted much, before we sailed, of the swiftness of his ship; unfortunately, when we came to sea, she proved the dullest of ninety-six sail, to his no small mortification. After many conjectures respecting the cause, when we were near another ship almost as dull as ours, which, however, gain'd upon us, the captain ordered all hands to come aft, and stand as near the ensign staff as possible. We were, passengers included, about forty persons. While we stood there, the ship mended her pace, and soon left her neighbour far behind, which prov'd clearly what our captain suspected, that she was loaded too much by the head. The casks of water, it seems, had been all plac'd forward; these he therefore order'd to be mov'd further aft, on which the ship recover'd her character, and proved the best sailer in the fleet.\n\nThe captain said she had once gone at the rate of thirteen knots, which is accounted thirteen miles per hour. We had on board, as a passenger, Captain Kennedy, of the Navy, who contended that it was impossible, and that no ship ever sailed so fast, and that there must have been some error in the division of the log-line, or some mistake in heaving the log.[115] A wager ensu'd between the two captains, to be decided when there should be sufficient wind. Kennedy thereupon examin'd rigorously the log-line, and, being satisfi'd with that, he determin'd to throw the log himself. Accordingly some days after, when the wind blew very fair and fresh, and the captain of the packet, Lutwidge, said he believ'd she then went at the rate of thirteen knots, Kennedy made the experiment, and own'd his wager lost.\n\nThe above fact I give for the sake of the following observation. It has been remark'd, as an imperfection in the art of ship-building, that it can never be known, till she is tried, whether a new ship will or will not be a good sailer; for that the model of a good-sailing ship has been exactly follow'd in a new one, which has prov'd, on the contrary, remarkably dull. I apprehend that this may partly be occasion'd by the different opinions of seamen respecting the modes of lading, rigging, and sailing of a ship; each has his system; and the same vessel, laden by the judgment and orders of one captain, shall sail better or worse than when by the orders of another. Besides, it scarce ever happens that a ship is form'd, fitted for the sea, and sail'd by the same person. One man builds the hull, another rigs her, a third lades and sails her. No one of these has the advantage of knowing all the ideas and experience of the others, and, therefore, cannot draw just conclusions from a combination of the whole.\n\nEven in the simple operation of sailing when at sea, I have often observ'd different judgments in the officers who commanded the successive watches, the wind being the same. One would have the sails trimm'd sharper or flatter than another, so that they seem'd to have no certain rule to govern by. Yet I think a set of experiments might be instituted; first, to determine the most proper form of the hull for swift sailing; next, the best dimensions and properest place for the masts; then the form and quantity of sails, and their position, as the wind may be; and, lastly, the disposition of the lading. This is an age of experiments, and I think a set accurately made and combin'd would be of great use. I am persuaded, therefore, that ere long some ingenious philosopher will undertake it, to whom I wish success.\n\nSailboat\nWe were several times chas'd in our passage, but out-sail'd every thing, and in thirty days had soundings. We had a good observation, and the captain judg'd himself so near our port, Falmouth, that, if we made a good run in the night, we might be off the mouth of that harbor in the morning, and by running in the night might escape the notice of the enemy's privateers, who often cruis'd near the entrance of the channel. Accordingly, all the sail was set that we could possibly make, and the wind being very fresh and fair, we went right before it, and made great way. The captain, after his observation, shap'd his course, as he thought, so as to pass wide of the Scilly Isles; but it seems there is sometimes a strong indraught setting up St. George's Channel, which deceives seamen and caused the loss of Sir Cloudesley Shovel's squadron. This indraught was probably the cause of what happened to us.\n\nWe had a watchman plac'd in the bow, to whom they often called, \"Look well out before there,\" and he as often answered, \"Ay, ay\"; but perhaps had his eyes shut, and was half asleep at the time, they sometimes answering, as is said, mechanically; for he did not see a light just before us, which had been hid by the studding-sails from the man at the helm, and from the rest of the watch, but by an accidental yaw of the ship was discover'd, and occasion'd a great alarm, we being very near it, the light appearing to me as big as a cartwheel. It was midnight, and our captain fast asleep; but Captain Kennedy, jumping upon deck, and seeing the danger, ordered the ship to wear round, all sails standing; an operation dangerous to the masts, but it carried us clear, and we escaped shipwreck, for we were running right upon the rocks on which the lighthouse was erected. This deliverance impressed me strongly with the utility of lighthouses, and made me resolve to encourage the building more of them in America if I should live to return there.\n\nIn the morning it was found by the soundings, etc., that we were near our port, but a thick fog hid the land from our sight. About nine o'clock the fog began to rise, and seem'd to be lifted up from the water like the curtain at a play-house, discovering underneath, the town of Falmouth, the vessels in its harbor, and the fields that surrounded it. This was a most pleasing spectacle to those who had been so long without any other prospects than the uniform view of a vacant ocean, and it gave us the more pleasure as we were now free from the anxieties which the state of war occasion'd.\n\nI set out immediately, with my son, for London, and we only stopt a little by the way to view Stonehenge[116] on Salisbury Plain, and Lord Pembroke's house and gardens, with his very curious antiquities at Wilton. We arrived in London the 27th of July, 1757.[117]\n\nAs soon as I was settled in a lodging Mr. Charles had provided for me, I went to visit Dr. Fothergill, to whom I was strongly recommended, and whose counsel respecting my proceedings I was advis'd to obtain. He was against an immediate complaint to government, and thought the proprietaries should first be personally appli'd to, who might possibly be induc'd by the interposition and persuasion of some private friends, to accommodate matters amicably. I then waited on my old friend and correspondent, Mr. Peter Collinson, who told me that John Hanbury, the great Virginia merchant, had requested to be informed when I should arrive, that he might carry me to Lord Granville's,[118] who was then President of the Council and wished to see me as soon as possible. I agreed to go with him the next morning. Accordingly Mr. Hanbury called for me and took me in his carriage to that nobleman's, who receiv'd me with great civility; and after some questions respecting the present state of affairs in America and discourse thereupon, he said to me: \"You Americans have wrong ideas of the nature of your constitution; you contend that the king's instructions to his governors are not laws, and think yourselves at liberty to regard or disregard them at your own discretion. But those instructions are not like the pocket instructions given to a minister going abroad, for regulating his conduct in some trifling point of ceremony. They are first drawn up by judges learned in the laws; they are then considered, debated, and perhaps amended in Council, after which they are signed by the king. They are then, so far as they relate to you, the law of the land, for the king is the Legislator of the Colonies,\"[119] I told his lordship this was new doctrine to me. I had always understood from our charters that our laws were to be made by our Assemblies, to be presented indeed to the king for his royal assent, but that being once given the king could not repeal or alter them. And as the Assemblies could not make permanent laws without his assent, so neither could he make a law for them without theirs. He assur'd me I was totally mistaken. I did not think so, however, and his lordship's conversation having a little alarm'd me as to what might be the sentiments of the court concerning us, I wrote it down as soon as I return'd to my lodgings. I recollected that about 20 years before, a clause in a bill brought into Parliament by the ministry had propos'd to make the king's instructions laws in the colonies, but the clause was thrown out by the Commons, for which we adored them as our friends and friends of liberty, till by their conduct towards us in 1765 it seem'd that they had refus'd that point of sovereignty to the king only that they might reserve it for themselves.\n\nWith his keen insight into human nature and his consequent knowledge of American character, he foresaw the inevitable result of such an attitude on the part of England. This conversation with Grenville makes these last pages of the Autobiography one of its most important parts.\n\nAfter some days, Dr. Fothergill having spoken to the proprietaries, they agreed to a meeting with me at Mr. T. Penn's house in Spring Garden. The conversation at first consisted of mutual declarations of disposition to reasonable accommodations, but I suppose each party had its own ideas of what should be meant by reasonable. We then went into consideration of our several points of complaint, which I enumerated. The proprietaries justify'd their conduct as well as they could, and I the Assembly's. We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement. However, it was concluded that I should give them the heads of our complaints in writing, and they promis'd then to consider them. I did so soon after, but they put the paper into the hands of their solicitor, Ferdinand John Paris, who managed for them all their law business in their great suit with the neighbouring proprietary of Maryland, Lord Baltimore, which had subsisted 70 years, and wrote for them all their papers and messages in their dispute with the Assembly. He was a proud, angry man, and as I had occasionally in the answers of the Assembly treated his papers with some severity, they being really weak in point of argument and haughty in expression, he had conceived a mortal enmity to me, which discovering itself whenever we met, I declin'd the proprietary's proposal that he and I should discuss the heads of complaint between our two selves, and refus'd treating with anyone but them. They then by his advice put the paper into the hands of the Attorney and Solicitor-General for their opinion and counsel upon it, where it lay unanswered a year wanting eight days, during which time I made frequent demands of an answer from the proprietaries, but without obtaining any other than that they had not yet received the opinion of the Attorney and Solicitor-General. What it was when they did receive it I never learnt, for they did not communicate it to me, but sent a long message to the Assembly drawn and signed by Paris, reciting my paper, complaining of its want of formality, as a rudeness on my part, and giving a flimsy justification of their conduct, adding that they should be willing to accommodate matters if the Assembly would send out some person of candour to treat with them for that purpose, intimating thereby that I was not such.\n\nWe now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement\n\"We now appeared very wide, and so far from each other in our opinions as to discourage all hope of agreement\"\nThe want of formality or rudeness was, probably, my not having address'd the paper to them with their assum'd titles of True and Absolute Proprietaries of the Province of Pennsylvania, which I omitted as not thinking it necessary in a paper, the intention of which was only to reduce to a certainty by writing, what in conversation I had delivered viva voce.\n\nBut during this delay, the Assembly having prevailed with Gov'r Denny to pass an act taxing the proprietary estate in common with the estates of the people, which was the grand point in dispute, they omitted answering the message.\n\nWhen this act however came over, the proprietaries, counselled by Paris, determined to oppose its receiving the royal assent. Accordingly they petitioned the king in Council, and a hearing was appointed in which two lawyers were employ'd by them against the act, and two by me in support of it. They alledg'd that the act was intended to load the proprietary estate in order to spare those of the people, and that if it were suffer'd to continue in force, and the proprietaries, who were in odium with the people, left to their mercy in proportioning the taxes, they would inevitably be ruined. We reply'd that the act had no such intention, and would have no such effect. That the assessors were honest and discreet men under an oath to assess fairly and equitably, and that any advantage each of them might expect in lessening his own tax by augmenting that of the proprietaries was too trifling to induce them to perjure themselves. This is the purport of what I remember as urged by both sides, except that we insisted strongly on the mischievous consequences that must attend a repeal, for that the money, \u00a3100,000, being printed and given to the king's use, expended in his service, and now spread among the people, the repeal would strike it dead in their hands to the ruin of many, and the total discouragement of future grants, and the selfishness of the proprietors in soliciting such a general catastrophe, merely from a groundless fear of their estate being taxed too highly, was insisted on in the strongest terms. On this, Lord Mansfield, one of the counsel, rose, and beckoning me took me into the clerk's chamber, while the lawyers were pleading, and asked me if I was really of opinion that no injury would be done the proprietary estate in the execution of the act. I said certainly. \"Then,\" says he, \"you can have little objection to enter into an engagement to assure that point.\" I answer'd, \"None at all.\" He then call'd in Paris, and after some discourse, his lordship's proposition was accepted on both sides; a paper to the purpose was drawn up by the Clerk of the Council, which I sign'd with Mr. Charles, who was also an Agent of the Province for their ordinary affairs, when Lord Mansfield returned to the Council Chamber, where finally the law was allowed to pass. Some changes were however recommended and we also engaged they should be made by a subsequent law, but the Assembly did not think them necessary; for one year's tax having been levied by the act before the order of Council arrived, they appointed a committee to examine the proceedings of the assessors, and on this committee they put several particular friends of the proprietaries. After a full enquiry, they unanimously sign'd a report that they found the tax had been assess'd with perfect equity.\n\nThe Assembly looked into my entering into the first part of the engagement, as an essential service to the Province, since it secured the credit of the paper money then spread over all the country. They gave me their thanks in form when I return'd. But the proprietaries were enraged at Governor Denny for having pass'd the act, and turn'd him out with threats of suing him for breach of instructions which he had given bond to observe. He, however, having done it at the instance of the General, and for His Majesty's service, and having some powerful interest at court, despis'd the threats and they were never put in execution....

MDCCVI.\nAPPENDIX\n\nELECTRICAL KITE\n\nTo Peter Collinson\n[Philadelphia], Oct. 19, 1752.\n\nSir,\n\nAs frequent mention is made in public papers from Europe of the success of the Philadelphia experiment for drawing the electric fire from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected on high buildings, &c., it may be agreeable to the curious to be informed, that the same experiment has succeeded in Philadelphia, though made in a different and more easy manner, which is as follows:\n\nMake a small cross of two light strips of cedar, the arms so long as to reach to the four corners of a large, thin silk handkerchief when extended; tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities of the cross, so you have the body of a kite; which being properly accommodated with a tail, loop, and string, will rise in the air, like those made of paper; but this being of silk, is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thunder-gust without tearing. To the top of the upright stick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharp-pointed wire, rising a foot or more above the wood. To the end of the twine, next the hand, is to be tied a silk ribbon, and where the silk and twine join, a key may be fastened. This kite is to be raised when a thunder-gust appears to be coming on, and the person who holds the string must stand within a door or window, or under some cover, so that the silk ribbon may not be wet; and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or window. As soon as any of the thunder clouds come over the kite, the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them, and the kite, with all the twine will be electrified, and the loose filaments of the twine will stand out every way and be attracted by an approaching finger. And when the rain has wet the kite and twine, so that it can conduct the electric fire freely, you will find it stream out plentifully from the key on the approach of your knuckle. At this key the phial may be charged; and from electric fire thus obtained, spirits may be kindled, and all the electric experiments be performed, which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube, and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning completely demonstrated.\n\nB.

Reproduced from a copy at the New York Public Library.\n\nTHE WAY TO WEALTH\n\n(From \"Father Abraham's Speech,\" forming the preface to Poor Richard's Almanac for 1758.)\n\nIt would be thought a hard Government that should tax its People one-tenth Part of their Time, to be employed in its Service. But Idleness taxes many of us much more, if we reckon all that is spent in absolute Sloth, or doing of nothing, with that which is spent in idle Employments or Amusements, that amount to nothing. Sloth, by bringing on Diseases, absolutely shortens Life. Sloth, like Rust, consumes faster than Labor wears; while the used key is always bright, as Poor Richard says. But dost thou love Life, then do not squander Time, for that's the stuff Life is made of, as Poor Richard says. How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep, forgetting that The sleeping Fox catches no Poultry, and that There will be sleeping enough in the Grave, as Poor Richard says.\n\nIf Time be of all Things the most precious, wasting Time must be, as Poor Richard says, the greatest Prodigality; since, as he elsewhere tells us, Lost Time is never found again; and what we call Time enough, always proves little enough: Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the Purpose; so by Diligence shall we do more with less Perplexity. Sloth makes all Things difficult, but Industry all easy, as Poor Richard says; and He that riseth late must trot all Day, and shall scarce overtake his Business at Night; while Laziness travels so slowly, that Poverty soon overtakes him, as we read in Poor Richard, who adds, Drive thy Business, let not that drive thee; and Early to Bed, and early to rise, makes a Man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\n\nIndustry need not wish, and he that lives upon Hope will die fasting.\n\nThere are no Gains without Pains.\n\nHe that hath a Trade hath an Estate; and he that hath a Calling, hath an Office of Profit and Honor; but then the Trade must be worked at, and the Calling well followed, or neither the Estate nor the Office will enable us to pay our Taxes.\n\nWhat though you have found no Treasure, nor has any rich Relation left you a Legacy, Diligence is the Mother of Good-luck, as Poor Richard says, and God gives all Things to Industry.\n\nOne To-day is worth two To-morrows, and farther, Have you somewhat to do To-morrow, do it To-day.\n\nIf you were a Servant, would you not be ashamed that a good Master should catch you idle? Are you then your own Master, be ashamed to catch yourself idle.\n\nStick to it steadily; and you will see great Effects, for Constant Dropping wears away Stones, and by Diligence and Patience the Mouse ate in two the Cable; and Little Strokes fell great Oaks.\n\nMethinks I hear some of you say, Must a Man afford himself no Leisure? I will tell thee, my friend, what Poor Richard says, Employ thy Time well, if thou meanest to gain Leisure; and, since thou art not sure of a Minute, throw not away an Hour. Leisure, is Time for doing something useful; this Leisure the diligent Man will obtain, but the lazy Man never; so that, as Poor Richard says, A Life of Leisure and a Life of Laziness are two things.\n\nKeep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep thee; and again, If you would have your business done, go; if not, send.\n\nIf you would have a faithful Servant, and one that you like, serve yourself.\n\nA little Neglect may breed great Mischief: adding, for want of a Nail the Shoe was lost; for want of a Shoe the Horse was lost; and for want of a Horse the Rider was lost, being overtaken and slain by the Enemy; all for the want of Care about a Horse-shoe Nail.\n\nSo much for Industry, my Friends, and Attention to one's own Business; but to these we must add Frugality.\n\nWhat maintains one Vice, would bring up two Children. You may think perhaps, that a little Tea, or a little Punch now and then, Diet a little more costly, Clothes a little finer, and a little Entertainment now and then, can be no great Matter; but remember what Poor Richard says, Many a Little makes a Mickle.\n\nBeware of little expenses; A small Leak will sink a great Ship; and again, Who Dainties love, shall Beggars prove; and moreover, Fools make Feasts, and wise Men eat them.\n\nBuy what thou hast no Need of, and ere long thou shalt sell thy Necessaries.\n\nIf you would know the Value of Money, go and try to borrow some; for, he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing.\n\nThe second Vice is Lying, the first is running in Debt.\n\nLying rides upon Debt's Back.\n\nPoverty often deprives a Man of all Spirit and Virtue: 'Tis hard for an empty Bag to stand upright.\n\nAnd now to conclude, Experience keeps a dear School, but Fools will learn in no other, and scarce in that; for it is true, we may give Advice, but we cannot give Conduct, as Poor Richard says: However, remember this, They that won't be counseled, can't be helped, as Poor Richard says: and farther, That if you will not hear Reason, she'll surely rap your Knuckles.\n\nTHE WHISTLE\n\nTo Madame Brillon\nPassy, November 10, 1779.\n\nI am charmed with your description of Paradise, and with your plan of living there; and I approve much of your conclusion, that, in the meantime, we should draw all the good we can from this world. In my opinion, we might all draw more good from it than we do, and suffer less evil, if we would take care not to give too much for whistles. For to me it seems, that most of the unhappy people we meet with, are become so by neglect of that caution.\n\nYou ask what I mean? You love stories, and will excuse my telling one of myself.\n\nWhen I was a child of seven year old, my friends, on a holiday, filled my pocket with coppers. I went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children; and being charmed with the sound of a whistle, that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I voluntarily offered and gave all my money for one. I then came home, and went whistling all over the house, much pleased with my whistle, but disturbing all the family. My brothers, and sisters, and cousins, understanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth; put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of the money; and laughed at me so much for my folly, that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure.\n\nThis, however, was afterwards of use to me, the impression continuing on my mind; so that often, when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing, I said to myself, Don't give too much for the whistle; and I saved my money.\n\nAs I grew up, came into the world, and observed the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whistle.\n\nWhen I saw one too ambitious of court favor, sacrificing his time in attendance on levees, his repose, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends, to attain it, I have said to myself, This man gives too much for his whistle.\n\nWhen I saw another fond of popularity, constantly employing himself in political bustles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by neglect, He pays, indeed, said I, too much for his whistle.\n\nIf I knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living, all the pleasure of doing good to others, all the esteem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of benevolent friendship, for the sake of accumulating wealth, Poor man, said I, you pay too much for your whistle.\n\nWhen I met with a man of pleasure, sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporeal sensations, and ruining his health in their pursuit, Mistaken man, said I, you are providing pain for yourself, instead of pleasure; you give too much for your whistle.\n\nIf I see one fond of appearance, or fine clothes, fine houses, fine furniture, fine equipages, all above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, and ends his career in a prison, Alas! say I, he has paid dear, very dear, for his whistle.\n\nWhen I see a beautiful, sweet-tempered girl married to an ill-natured brute of a husband, What a pity, say I, that she should pay so much for a whistle!\n\nIn short, I conceive that great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by the false estimates they have made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whistles.\n\nYet I ought to have charity for these unhappy people, when I consider, that, with all this wisdom of which I am boasting, there are certain things in the world so tempting, for example, the apples of King John, which happily are not to be bought; for if they were put to sale by auction, I might very easily be led to ruin myself in the purchase, and find that I had once more given too much for the whistle.\n\nAdieu, my dear friend, and believe me ever yours very sincerely and with unalterable affection,\n\nB. Franklin.\n\nA LETTER TO SAMUEL MATHER\n\nPassy, May 12, 1784.\n\nRevd Sir,\n\nIt is now more than 60 years since I left Boston, but I remember well both your father and grandfather, having heard them both in the pulpit, and seen them in their houses. The last time I saw your father was in the beginning of 1724, when I visited him after my first trip to Pennsylvania. He received me in his library, and on my taking leave showed me a shorter way out of the house through a narrow passage, which was crossed by a beam overhead. We were still talking as I withdrew, he accompanying me behind, and I turning partly towards him, when he said hastily, \"Stoop, stoop!\" I did not understand him, till I felt my head hit against the beam. He was a man that never missed any occasion of giving instruction, and upon this he said to me, \"You are young, and have the world before you; stoop as you go through it, and you will miss many hard thumps.\" This advice, thus beat into my head, has frequently been of use to me; and I often think of it, when I see pride mortified, and misfortunes brought upon people by their carrying their heads too high.\n\nB. Franklin.\n\nTHE END1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1686309", "artist_names": "Mac Davis", "full_title": "Beginning to Feel the Pain by\u00a0Mac\u00a0Davis",

till man shall learn\nVainly his incense soars, his victim bleeds;\nPoor child of Doubt and Death, whose hope is built on reeds.\n\nIV.\nBound to the earth, he lifts his eyes to heaven\u2014\nIs't not enough, unhappy thing, to know\nThou art?  Is this a boon so kindly given,\nThat being, thou wouldst be again, and go,\nThou know'st not, reck'st not to what region, so\nOn earth no more, but mingled with the skies!\nStill wilt thou dream on future joy and woe?\nRegard and weigh yon dust before it flies:\nThat little urn saith more than thousand homilies.\n\nV.\n\nOr burst the vanished hero's lofty mound;\nFar on the solitary shore he sleeps;\nHe fell, and falling nations mourned around;\nBut now not one of saddening thousands weeps,\nNor warlike worshipper his vigil keeps\nWhere demi-gods appeared, as records tell.\nRemove yon skull from out the scattered heaps:\nIs that a temple where a God may dwell?\nWhy, e'en the worm at last disdains her shattered cell!\n\nVI.\n\nLook on its broken arch, its ruined wall,\nIts chambers desolate, and portals foul:\nYes, this was once Ambition's airy hall,\nThe dome of Thought, the Palace of the Soul.\nBehold through each lack-lustre, eyeless hole,\nThe gay recess of Wisdom and of Wit,\nAnd Passion's host, that never brooked control:\nCan all saint, sage, or sophist ever writ,\nPeople this lonely tower, this tenement refit?\nVII.\n\nWell didst thou speak, Athena's wisest son!\n'All that we know is, nothing can be known.'\nWhy should we shrink from what we cannot shun?\nEach hath its pang, but feeble sufferers groan\nWith brain-born dreams of evil all their own.\nPursue what chance or fate proclaimeth best;\nPeace waits us on the shores of Acheron:\nThere no forced banquet claims the sated guest,\nBut Silence spreads the couch of ever welcome rest.\n\nVIII.\n\nYet if, as holiest men have deemed, there be\nA land of souls beyond that sable shore,\nTo shame the doctrine of the Sadducee\nAnd sophists, madly vain of dubious lore;\nHow sweet it were in concert to adore\nWith those who made our mortal labours light!\nTo hear each voice we feared to hear no more!\nBehold each mighty shade revealed to sight,\nThe Bactrian, Samian sage, and all who taught the right!\n\nIX.\n\nThere, thou!\u2014whose love and life together fled,\nHave left me here to love and live in vain\u2014\nTwined with my heart, and can I deem thee dead,\nWhen busy memory flashes on my brain?\nWell\u2014I will dream that we may meet again,\nAnd woo the vision to my vacant breast:\nIf aught of young Remembrance then remain,\nBe as it may Futurity's behest,\nFor me 'twere bliss enough to know thy spirit blest!\n\nX.\n\nHere let me sit upon this mossy stone,\nThe marble column's yet unshaken base!\nHere, son of Saturn, was thy favourite throne!\nMightiest of many such!  Hence let me trace\nThe latent grandeur of thy dwelling-place.\nIt may not be:  nor even can Fancy's eye\nRestore what time hath laboured to deface.\nYet these proud pillars claim no passing sigh;\nUnmoved the Moslem sits, the light Greek carols by.\n\nXI.\n\nBut who, of all the plunderers of yon fane\nOn high, where Pallas lingered, loth to flee\nThe latest relic of her ancient reign\u2014\nThe last, the worst, dull spoiler, who was he?\nBlush, Caledonia! such thy son could be!\nEngland!  I joy no child he was of thine:\nThy free-born men should spare what once was free;\nYet they could violate each saddening shrine,\nAnd bear these altars o'er the long reluctant brine.\n\nXII.\n\nBut most the modern Pict's ignoble boast,\nTo rive what Goth, and Turk, and Time hath spared:\nCold as the crags upon his native coast,\nHis mind as barren and his heart as hard,\nIs he whose head conceived, whose hand prepared,\nAught to displace Athena's poor remains:\nHer sons too weak the sacred shrine to guard,\nYet felt some portion of their mother's pains,\nAnd never knew, till then, the weight of Despot's chains.\n\nXIII.\n\nWhat! shall it e'er be said by British tongue\nAlbion was happy in Athena's tears?\nThough in thy name the slaves her bosom wrung,\nTell not the deed to blushing Europe's ears;\nThe ocean queen, the free Britannia, bears\nThe last poor plunder from a bleeding land:\nYes, she, whose generous aid her name endears,\nTore down those remnants with a harpy's hand.\nWhich envious eld forbore, and tyrants left to stand.\n\nXIV.\n\nWhere was thine aegis, Pallas, that appalled\nStern Alaric and Havoc on their way?\nWhere Peleus' son? whom Hell in vain enthralled,\nHis shade from Hades upon that dread day\nBursting to light in terrible array!\nWhat! could not Pluto spare the chief once more,\nTo scare a second robber from his prey?\nIdly he wandered on the Stygian shore,\nNor now preserved the walls he loved to shield before.\n\nXV.\n\nCold is the heart, fair Greece, that looks on thee,\nNor feels as lovers o'er the dust they loved;\nDull is the eye that will not weep to see\nThy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed\nBy British hands, which it had best behoved\nTo guard those relics ne'er to be restored.\nCurst be the hour when from their isle they roved,\nAnd once again thy hapless bosom gored,\nAnd snatched thy shrinking gods to northern climes abhorred!\n\nXVI.\n\nBut where is Harold? shall I then forget\nTo urge the gloomy wanderer o'er the wave?\nLittle recked he of all that men regret;\nNo loved one now in feigned lament could rave;\nNo friend the parting hand extended gave,\nEre the cold stranger passed to other climes.\nHard is his heart whom charms may not enslave;\nBut Harold felt not as in other times,\nAnd left without a sigh the land of war and crimes.\n\nXVII.\n\nHe that has sailed upon the dark blue sea,\nHas viewed at times, I ween, a full fair sight;\nWhen the fresh breeze is fair as breeze may be,\nThe white sails set, the gallant frigate tight,\nMasts, spires, and strand retiring to the right,\nThe glorious main expanding o'er the bow,\nThe convoy spread like wild swans in their flight,\nThe dullest sailer wearing bravely now,\nSo gaily curl the waves before each dashing prow.\n\nXVIII.\n\nAnd oh, the little warlike world within!\nThe well-reeved guns, the netted canopy,\nThe hoarse command, the busy humming din,\nWhen, at a word, the tops are manned on high:\nHark to the boatswain's call, the cheering cry,\nWhile through the seaman's hand the tackle glides\nOr schoolboy midshipman that, standing by,\nStrains his shrill pipe, as good or ill betides,\nAnd well the docile crew that skilful urchin guides.\n\nXIX.\n\nWhite is the glassy deck, without a stain,\nWhere on the watch the staid lieutenant walks:\nLook on that part which sacred doth remain\nFor the lone chieftain, who majestic stalks,\nSilent and feared by all:  not oft he talks\nWith aught beneath him, if he would preserve\nThat strict restraint, which broken, ever baulks\nConquest and Fame:  but Britons rarely swerve\nFrom law, however stern, which tends their strength to nerve.\n\nXX.\n\nBlow, swiftly blow, thou keel-compelling gale,\nTill the broad sun withdraws his lessening ray;\nThen must the pennant-bearer slacken sail,\nThat lagging barks may make their lazy way.\nAh! grievance sore, and listless dull delay,\nTo waste on sluggish hulks the sweetest breeze!\nWhat leagues are lost before the dawn of day,\nThus loitering pensive on the willing seas,\nThe flapping sails hauled down to halt for logs like these!\n\nXXI.\n\nThe moon is up; by Heaven, a lovely eve!\nLong streams of light o'er dancing waves expand!\nNow lads on shore may sigh, and maids believe:\nSuch be our fate when we return to land!\nMeantime some rude Arion's restless hand\nWakes the brisk harmony that sailors love:\nA circle there of merry listeners stand,\nOr to some well-known measure featly move,\nThoughtless, as if on shore they still were free to rove.\n\nXXII.\n\nThrough Calpe's straits survey the steepy shore;\nEurope and Afric, on each other gaze!\nLands of the dark-eyed maid and dusky Moor,\nAlike beheld beneath pale Hecate's blaze:\nHow softly on the Spanish shore she plays,\nDisclosing rock, and slope, and forest brown,\nDistinct, though darkening with her waning phase:\nBut Mauritania's giant-shadows frown,\nFrom mountain-cliff to coast descending sombre down.\n\nXXIII.\n\n'Tis night, when Meditation bids us feel\nWe once have loved, though love is at an end:\nThe heart, lone mourner of its baffled zeal,\nThough friendless now, will dream it had a friend.\nWho with the weight of years would wish to bend,\nWhen Youth itself survives young Love and Joy?\nAlas! when mingling souls forget to blend,\nDeath hath but little left him to destroy!\nAh, happy years! once more who would not be a boy?\n\nXXIV.\n\nThus bending o'er the vessel's laving side,\nTo gaze on Dian's wave-reflected sphere,\nThe soul forgets her schemes of Hope and Pride,\nAnd flies unconscious o'er each backward year.\nNone are so desolate but something dear,\nDearer than self, possesses or possessed\nA thought, and claims the homage of a tear;\nA flashing pang! of which the weary breast\nWould still, albeit in vain, the heavy heart divest.\n\nXXV.\n\nTo sit on rocks, to muse o'er flood and fell,\nTo slowly trace the forest's shady scene,\nWhere things that own not man's dominion dwell,\nAnd mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been;\nTo climb the trackless mountain all unseen,\nWith the wild flock that never needs a fold;\nAlone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean:\nThis is not solitude; 'tis but to hold\nConverse with Nature's charms, and view her stores unrolled.\n\nXXVI.\n\nBut midst the crowd, the hum, the shock of men,\nTo hear, to see, to feel, and to possess,\nAnd roam along, the world's tired denizen,\nWith none who bless us, none whom we can bless;\nMinions of splendour shrinking from distress!\nNone that, with kindred consciousness endued,\nIf we were not, would seem to smile the less\nOf all that flattered, followed, sought, and sued:\nThis is to be alone; this, this is solitude!\n\nXXVII.\n\nMore blest the life of godly eremite,\nSuch as on lonely Athos may be seen,\nWatching at eve upon the giant height,\nWhich looks o'er waves so blue, skies so serene,\nThat he who there at such an hour hath been,\nWill wistful linger on that hallowed spot;\nThen slowly tear him from the witching scene,\nSigh forth one wish that such had been his lot,\nThen turn to hate a world he had almost forgot.\n\nXXVIII.\n\nPass we the long, unvarying course, the track\nOft trod, that never leaves a trace behind;\nPass we the calm, the gale, the change, the tack,\nAnd each well-known caprice of wave and wind;\nPass we the joys and sorrows sailors find,\nCooped in their winged sea-girt citadel;\nThe foul, the fair, the contrary, the kind,\nAs breezes rise and fall, and billows swell,\nTill on some jocund morn\u2014lo, land! and all is well.\n\nXXIX.\n\nBut not in silence pass Calypso's isles,\nThe sister tenants of the middle deep;\nThere for the weary still a haven smiles,\nThough the fair goddess long has ceased to weep,\nAnd o'er her cliffs a fruitless watch to keep\nFor him who dared prefer a mortal bride:\nHere, too, his boy essayed the dreadful leap\nStern Mentor urged from high to yonder tide;\nWhile thus of both bereft, the nymph-queen doubly sighed.\n\nXXX.\n\nHer reign is past, her gentle glories gone:\nBut trust not this; too easy youth, beware!\nA mortal sovereign holds her dangerous throne,\nAnd thou mayst find a new Calypso there.\nSweet Florence! could another ever share\nThis wayward, loveless heart, it would be thine:\nBut checked by every tie, I may not dare\nTo cast a worthless offering at thy shrine,\nNor ask so dear a breast to feel one pang for mine.\n\nXXXI.\n\nThus Harold deemed, as on that lady's eye\nHe looked, and met its beam without a thought,\nSave Admiration glancing harmless by:\nLove kept aloof, albeit not far remote,\nWho knew his votary often lost and caught,\nBut knew him as his worshipper no more,\nAnd ne'er again the boy his bosom sought:\nSince now he vainly urged him to adore,\nWell deemed the little god his ancient sway was o'er.\n\nXXXII.\n\nFair Florence found, in sooth with some amaze,\nOne who, 'twas said, still sighed to all he saw,\nWithstand, unmoved, the lustre of her gaze,\nWhich others hailed with real or mimic awe,\nTheir hope, their doom, their punishment, their law:\nAll that gay Beauty from her bondsmen claims:\nAnd much she marvelled that a youth so raw\nNor felt, nor feigned at least, the oft-told flames,\nWhich, though sometimes they frown, yet rarely anger dames.\n\nXXXIII.\n\nLittle knew she that seeming marble heart,\nNow masked by silence or withheld by pride,\nWas not unskilful in the spoiler's art,\nAnd spread its snares licentious far and wide;\nNor from the base pursuit had turned aside,\nAs long as aught was worthy to pursue:\nBut Harold on such arts no more relied;\nAnd had he doted on those eyes so blue,\nYet never would he join the lover's whining crew.\n\nXXXIV.\n\nNot much he kens, I ween, of woman's breast,\nWho thinks that wanton thing is won by sighs;\nWhat careth she for hearts when once possessed?\nDo proper homage to thine idol's eyes,\nBut not too humbly, or she will despise\nThee and thy suit, though told in moving tropes;\nDisguise e'en tenderness, if thou art wise;\nBrisk Confidence still best with woman copes;\nPique her and soothe in turn, soon Passion crowns thy hopes.\n\nXXXV.\n\n'Tis an old lesson:  Time approves it true,\nAnd those who know it best deplore it most;\nWhen all is won that all desire to woo,\nThe paltry prize is hardly worth the cost:\nYouth wasted, minds degraded, honour lost,\nThese are thy fruits, successful Passion! these!\nIf, kindly cruel, early hope is crossed,\nStill to the last it rankles, a disease,\nNot to be cured when Love itself forgets to please.\n\nXXXVI.\n\nAway! nor let me loiter in my song,\nFor we have many a mountain path to tread,\nAnd many a varied shore to sail along,\nBy pensive Sadness, not by Fiction, led\u2014\nClimes, fair withal as ever mortal head\nImagined in its little schemes of thought;\nOr e'er in new Utopias were read:\nTo teach man what he might be, or he ought;\nIf that corrupted thing could ever such be taught.\n\nXXXVII.\n\nDear Nature is the kindest mother still;\nThough always changing, in her aspect mild:\nFrom her bare bosom let me take my fill,\nHer never-weaned, though not her favoured child.\nOh! she is fairest in her features wild,\nWhere nothing polished dares pollute her path:\nTo me by day or night she ever smiled,\nThough I have marked her when none other hath,\nAnd sought her more and more, and loved her best in wrath.\n\nXXXVIII.\n\nLand of Albania! where Iskander rose;\nTheme of the young, and beacon of the wise,\nAnd he his namesake, whose oft-baffled foes,\nShrunk from his deeds of chivalrous emprise:\nLand of Albania! let me bend mine eyes\nOn thee, thou rugged nurse of savage men!\nThe cross descends, thy minarets arise,\nAnd the pale crescent sparkles in the glen,\nThrough many a cypress grove within each city's ken.\n\nXXXIX.\n\nChilde Harold sailed, and passed the barren spot\nWhere sad Penelope o'erlooked the wave;\nAnd onward viewed the mount, not yet forgot,\nThe lover's refuge, and the Lesbian's grave.\nDark Sappho! could not verse immortal save\nThat breast imbued with such immortal fire?\nCould she not live who life eternal gave?\nIf life eternal may await the lyre,\nThat only Heaven to which Earth's children may aspire.\n\nXL.\n\n'Twas on a Grecian autumn's gentle eve,\nChilde Harold hailed Leucadia's cape afar;\nA spot he longed to see, nor cared to leave:\nOft did he mark the scenes of vanished war,\nActium, Lepanto, fatal Trafalgar:\nMark them unmoved, for he would not delight\n(Born beneath some remote inglorious star)\nIn themes of bloody fray, or gallant fight,\nBut loathed the bravo's trade, and laughed at martial wight.\n\nXLI.\n\nBut when he saw the evening star above\nLeucadia's far-projecting rock of woe,\nAnd hailed the last resort of fruitless love,\nHe felt, or deemed he felt, no common glow:\nAnd as the stately vessel glided slow\nBeneath the shadow of that ancient mount,\nHe watched the billows' melancholy flow,\nAnd, sunk albeit in thought as he was wont,\nMore placid seemed his eye, and smooth his pallid front.\n\nXLII.\n\nMorn dawns; and with it stern Albania's hills,\nDark Suli's rocks, and Pindus' inland peak,\nRobed half in mist, bedewed with snowy rills,\nArrayed in many a dun and purple streak,\nArise; and, as the clouds along them break,\nDisclose the dwelling of the mountaineer;\nHere roams the wolf, the eagle whets his beak,\nBirds, beasts of prey, and wilder men appear,\nAnd gathering storms around convulse the closing year.\n\nXLIII.\n\nNow Harold felt himself at length alone,\nAnd bade to Christian tongues a long adieu:\nNow he adventured on a shore unknown,\nWhich all admire, but many dread to view:\nHis breast was armed 'gainst fate, his wants were few:\nPeril he sought not, but ne'er shrank to meet:\nThe scene was savage, but the scene was new;\nThis made the ceaseless toil of travel sweet,\nBeat back keen winter's blast; and welcomed summer's heat.\n\nXLIV.\n\nHere the red cross, for still the cross is here,\nThough sadly scoffed at by the circumcised,\nForgets that pride to pampered priesthood dear;\nChurchman and votary alike despised.\nFoul Superstition! howsoe'er disguised,\nIdol, saint, virgin, prophet, crescent, cross,\nFor whatsoever symbol thou art prized,\nThou sacerdotal gain, but general loss!\nWho from true worship's gold can separate thy dross.\n\nXLV.\n\nAmbracia's gulf behold, where once was lost\nA world for woman, lovely, harmless thing!\nIn yonder rippling bay, their naval host\nDid many a Roman chief and Asian king\nTo doubtful conflict, certain slaughter, bring\nLook where the second Caesar's trophies rose,\nNow, like the hands that reared them, withering;\nImperial anarchs, doubling human woes!\nGod! was thy globe ordained for such to win and lose?\n\nXLVI.\n\nFrom the dark barriers of that rugged clime,\nE'en to the centre of Illyria's vales,\nChilde Harold passed o'er many a mount sublime,\nThrough lands scarce noticed in historic tales:\nYet in famed Attica such lovely dales\nAre rarely seen; nor can fair Tempe boast\nA charm they know not; loved Parnassus fails,\nThough classic ground, and consecrated most,\nTo match some spots that lurk within this lowering coast.\n\nXLVII.\n\nHe passed bleak Pindus, Acherusia's lake,\nAnd left the primal city of the land,\nAnd onwards did his further journey take\nTo greet Albania's chief, whose dread command\nIs lawless law; for with a bloody hand\nHe sways a nation, turbulent and bold:\nYet here and there some daring mountain-band\nDisdain his power, and from their rocky hold\nHurl their defiance far, nor yield, unless to gold.\n\nXLVIII.\n\nMonastic Zitza! from thy shady brow,\nThou small, but favoured spot of holy ground!\nWhere'er we gaze, around, above, below,\nWhat rainbow tints, what magic charms are found!\nRock, river, forest, mountain all abound,\nAnd bluest skies that harmonise the whole:\nBeneath, the distant torrent's rushing sound\nTells where the volumed cataract doth roll\nBetween those hanging rocks, that shock yet please the soul.\n\nXLIX.\n\nAmidst the grove that crowns yon tufted hill,\nWhich, were it not for many a mountain nigh\nRising in lofty ranks, and loftier still,\nMight well itself be deemed of dignity,\nThe convent's white walls glisten fair on high;\nHere dwells the caloyer, nor rude is he,\nNor niggard of his cheer:  the passer-by\nIs welcome still; nor heedless will he flee\nFrom hence, if he delight kind Nature's sheen to see.\n\nL.\n\nHere in the sultriest season let him rest,\nFresh is the green beneath those aged trees;\nHere winds of gentlest wing will fan his breast,\nFrom heaven itself he may inhale the breeze:\nThe plain is far beneath\u2014oh! let him seize\nPure pleasure while he can; the scorching ray\nHere pierceth not, impregnate with disease:\nThen let his length the loitering pilgrim lay,\nAnd gaze, untired, the morn, the noon, the eve away.\n\nLI.\n\nDusky and huge, enlarging on the sight,\nNature's volcanic amphitheatre,\nChimera's alps extend from left to right:\nBeneath, a living valley seems to stir;\nFlocks play, trees wave, streams flow, the mountain fir\nNodding above; behold black Acheron!\nOnce consecrated to the sepulchre.\nPluto! if this be hell I look upon,\nClose shamed Elysium's gates, my shade shall seek for none.\n\nLII.\n\nNo city's towers pollute the lovely view;\nUnseen is Yanina, though not remote,\nVeiled by the screen of hills:  here men are few,\nScanty the hamlet, rare the lonely cot;\nBut, peering down each precipice, the goat\nBrowseth:  and, pensive o'er his scattered flock,\nThe little shepherd in his white capote\nDoth lean his boyish form along the rock,\nOr in his cave awaits the tempest's short-lived shock.\n\nLIII.\n\nOh! where, Dodona, is thine aged grove,\nProphetic fount, and oracle divine?\nWhat valley echoed the response of Jove?\nWhat trace remaineth of the Thunderer's shrine?\nAll, all forgotten\u2014and shall man repine\nThat his frail bonds to fleeting life are broke?\nCease, fool! the fate of gods may well be thine:\nWouldst thou survive the marble or the oak,\nWhen nations, tongues, and worlds must sink beneath the stroke?\n\nLIV.\n\nEpirus' bounds recede, and mountains fail;\nTired of up-gazing still, the wearied eye\nReposes gladly on as smooth a vale\nAs ever Spring yclad in grassy dye:\nE'en on a plain no humble beauties lie,\nWhere some bold river breaks the long expanse,\nAnd woods along the banks are waving high,\nWhose shadows in the glassy waters dance,\nOr with the moonbeam sleep in Midnight's solemn trance.\n\nLV.\n\nThe sun had sunk behind vast Tomerit,\nThe Laos wide and fierce came roaring by;\nThe shades of wonted night were gathering yet,\nWhen, down the steep banks winding wearily\nChilde Harold saw, like meteors in the sky,\nThe glittering minarets of Tepalen,\nWhose walls o'erlook the stream; and drawing nigh,\nHe heard the busy hum of warrior-men\nSwelling the breeze that sighed along the lengthening glen.\n\nLVI.\n\nHe passed the sacred harem's silent tower,\nAnd underneath the wide o'erarching gate\nSurveyed the dwelling of this chief of power\nWhere all around proclaimed his high estate.\nAmidst no common pomp the despot sate,\nWhile busy preparation shook the court;\nSlaves, eunuchs, soldiers, guests, and santons wait;\nWithin, a palace, and without a fort,\nHere men of every clime appear to make resort.\n\nLVII.\n\nRichly caparisoned, a ready row\nOf armed horse, and many a warlike store,\nCircled the wide-extending court below;\nAbove, strange groups adorned the corridor;\nAnd ofttimes through the area's echoing door,\nSome high-capped Tartar spurred his steed away;\nThe Turk, the Greek, the Albanian, and the Moor,\nHere mingled in their many-hued array,\nWhile the deep war-drum's sound announced the close of day.\n\nLVIII.\n\nThe wild Albanian kirtled to his knee,\nWith shawl-girt head and ornamented gun,\nAnd gold-embroidered garments, fair to see:\nThe crimson-scarfed men of Macedon;\nThe Delhi with his cap of terror on,\nAnd crooked glaive; the lively, supple Greek;\nAnd swarthy Nubia's mutilated son;\nThe bearded Turk, that rarely deigns to speak,\nMaster of all around, too potent to be meek,\n\nLIX.\n\nAre mixed conspicuous:  some recline in groups,\nScanning the motley scene that varies round;\nThere some grave Moslem to devotion stoops,\nAnd some that smoke, and some that play are found;\nHere the Albanian proudly treads the ground;\nHalf-whispering there the Greek is heard to prate;\nHark! from the mosque the nightly solemn sound,\nThe muezzin's call doth shake the minaret,\n'There is no god but God!\u2014to prayer\u2014lo! God is great!'\n\nLX.\n\nJust at this season Ramazani's fast\nThrough the long day its penance did maintain.\nBut when the lingering twilight hour was past,\nRevel and feast assumed the rule again:\nNow all was bustle, and the menial train\nPrepared and spread the plenteous board within;\nThe vacant gallery now seemed made in vain,\nBut from the chambers came the mingling din,\nAs page and slave anon were passing out and in.\n\nLXI.\n\nHere woman's voice is never heard:  apart\nAnd scarce permitted, guarded, veiled, to move,\nShe yields to one her person and her heart,\nTamed to her cage, nor feels a wish to rove;\nFor, not unhappy in her master's love,\nAnd joyful in a mother's gentlest cares,\nBlest cares! all other feelings far above!\nHerself more sweetly rears the babe she bears,\nWho never quits the breast, no meaner passion shares.\n\nLXII.\n\nIn marble-paved pavilion, where a spring\nOf living water from the centre rose,\nWhose bubbling did a genial freshness fling,\nAnd soft voluptuous couches breathed repose,\nAli reclined, a man of war and woes:\nYet in his lineaments ye cannot trace,\nWhile Gentleness her milder radiance throws\nAlong that aged venerable face,\nThe deeds that lurk beneath, and stain him with disgrace.\n\nLXIII.\n\nIt is not that yon hoary lengthening beard\nIll suits the passions which belong to youth:\nLove conquers age\u2014so Hafiz hath averred,\nSo sings the Teian, and he sings in sooth\u2014\nBut crimes that scorn the tender voice of ruth,\nBeseeming all men ill, but most the man\nIn years, have marked him with a tiger's tooth:\nBlood follows blood, and through their mortal span,\nIn bloodier acts conclude those who with blood began.\n\nLXIV.\n\nMid many things most new to ear and eye,\nThe pilgrim rested here his weary feet,\nAnd gazed around on Moslem luxury,\nTill quickly wearied with that spacious seat\nOf Wealth and Wantonness, the choice retreat\nOf sated Grandeur from the city's noise:\nAnd were it humbler, it in sooth were sweet;\nBut Peace abhorreth artificial joys,\nAnd Pleasure, leagued with Pomp, the zest of both destroys.\n\nLXV.\n\nFierce are Albania's children, yet they lack\nNot virtues, were those virtues more mature.\nWhere is the foe that ever saw their back?\nWho can so well the toil of war endure?\nTheir native fastnesses not more secure\nThan they in doubtful time of troublous need:\nTheir wrath how deadly! but their friendship sure,\nWhen Gratitude or Valour bids them bleed,\nUnshaken rushing on where'er their chief may lead.\n\nLXVI.\n\nChilde Harold saw them in their chieftain's tower,\nThronging to war in splendour and success;\nAnd after viewed them, when, within their power,\nHimself awhile the victim of distress;\nThat saddening hour when bad men hotlier press:\nBut these did shelter him beneath their roof,\nWhen less barbarians would have cheered him less,\nAnd fellow-countrymen have stood aloof\u2014\nIn aught that tries the heart how few withstand the proof!\n\nLXVII.\n\nIt chanced that adverse winds once drove his bark\nFull on the coast of Suli's shaggy shore,\nWhen all around was desolate and dark;\nTo land was perilous, to sojourn more;\nYet for awhile the mariners forbore,\nDubious to trust where treachery might lurk:\nAt length they ventured forth, though doubting sore\nThat those who loathe alike the Frank and Turk\nMight once again renew their ancient butcher-work.\n\nLXVIII.\n\nVain fear! the Suliotes stretched the welcome hand,\nLed them o'er rocks and past the dangerous swamp,\nKinder than polished slaves, though not so bland,\nAnd piled the hearth, and wrung their garments damp,\nAnd filled the bowl, and trimmed the cheerful lamp,\nAnd spread their fare:  though homely, all they had:\nSuch conduct bears Philanthropy's rare stamp\u2014\nTo rest the weary and to soothe the sad,\nDoth lesson happier men, and shames at least the bad.\n\nLXIX.\n\nIt came to pass, that when he did address\nHimself to quit at length this mountain land,\nCombined marauders half-way barred egress,\nAnd wasted far and near with glaive and brand;\nAnd therefore did he take a trusty band\nTo traverse Acarnania forest wide,\nIn war well-seasoned, and with labours tanned,\nTill he did greet white Achelous' tide,\nAnd from his farther bank AEtolia's wolds espied.\n\nLXX.\n\nWhere lone Utraikey forms its circling cove,\nAnd weary waves retire to gleam at rest,\nHow brown the foliage of the green hill's grove,\nNodding at midnight o'er the calm bay's breast,\nAs winds come whispering lightly from the west,\nKissing, not ruffling, the blue deep's serene:\nHere Harold was received a welcome guest;\nNor did he pass unmoved the gentle scene,\nFor many a joy could he from night's soft presence glean.\n\nLXXI.\n\nOn the smooth shore the night-fires brightly blazed,\nThe feast was done, the red wine circling fast,\nAnd he that unawares had there ygazed\nWith gaping wonderment had stared aghast;\nFor ere night's midmost, stillest hour was past,\nThe native revels of the troop began;\nEach palikar his sabre from him cast,\nAnd bounding hand in hand, man linked to man,\nYelling their uncouth dirge, long danced the kirtled clan.\n\nLXXII.\n\nChilde Harold at a little distance stood,\nAnd viewed, but not displeased, the revelrie,\nNor hated harmless mirth, however rude:\nIn sooth, it was no vulgar sight to see\nTheir barbarous, yet their not indecent, glee:\nAnd as the flames along their faces gleamed,\nTheir gestures nimble, dark eyes flashing free,\nThe long wild locks that to their girdles streamed,\nWhile thus in concert they this lay half sang, half screamed:\n\nTambourgi! Tambourgi! thy larum afar\nGives hope to the valiant, and promise of war;\nAll the sons of the mountains arise at the note,\nChimariot, Illyrian, and dark Suliote!\n\nOh! who is more brave than a dark Suliote,\nTo his snowy camese and his shaggy capote?\nTo the wolf and the vulture he leaves his wild flock,\nAnd descends to the plain like the stream from the rock.\n\nShall the sons of Chimari, who never forgive\nThe fault of a friend, bid an enemy live?\nLet those guns so unerring such vengeance forego?\nWhat mark is so fair as the breast of a foe?\n\nMacedonia sends forth her invincible race;\nFor a time they abandon the cave and the chase:\nBut those scarves of blood-red shall be redder, before\nThe sabre is sheathed and the battle is o'er.\n\nThen the pirates of Parga that dwell by the waves,\nAnd teach the pale Franks what it is to be slaves,\nShall leave on the beach the long galley and oar,\nAnd track to his covert the captive on shore.\n\nI ask not the pleasure that riches supply,\nMy sabre shall win what the feeble must buy:\nShall win the young bride with her long flowing hair,\nAnd many a maid from her mother shall tear.\n\nI love the fair face of the maid in her youth;\nHer caresses shall lull me, her music shall soothe:\nLet her bring from her chamber the many-toned lyre,\nAnd sing us a song on the fall of her sire.\n\nRemember the moment when Previsa fell,\nThe shrieks of the conquered, the conqueror's yell;\nThe roofs that we fired, and the plunder we shared,\nThe wealthy we slaughtered, the lovely we spared.\n\nI talk not of mercy, I talk not of fear;\nHe neither must know who would serve the Vizier;\nSince the days of our prophet, the crescent ne'er saw\nA chief ever glorious like Ali Pasha.\n\nDark Muchtar his son to the Danube is sped,\nLet the yellow-haired Giaours view his horsetail with dread;\nWhen his Delhis come dashing in blood o'er the banks,\nHow few shall escape from the Muscovite ranks!\n\nSelictar! unsheath then our chief's scimitar:\nTambourgi! thy larum gives promise of war.\nYe mountains that see us descend to the shore,\nShall view us as victors, or view us no more!\n\nLXXIII.\n\nFair Greece! sad relic of departed worth!\nImmortal, though no more; though fallen, great!\nWho now shall lead thy scattered children forth,\nAnd long accustomed bondage uncreate?\nNot such thy sons who whilome did await,\nThe hopeless warriors of a willing doom,\nIn bleak Thermopylae's sepulchral strait\u2014\nOh, who that gallant spirit shall resume,\nLeap from Eurotas' banks, and call thee from the tomb?\n\nLXXIV.\n\nSpirit of Freedom! when on Phyle's brow\nThou sat'st with Thrasybulus and his train,\nCouldst thou forbode the dismal hour which now\nDims the green beauties of thine Attic plain?\nNot thirty tyrants now enforce the chain,\nBut every carle can lord it o'er thy land;\nNor rise thy sons, but idly rail in vain,\nTrembling beneath the scourge of Turkish hand,\nFrom birth till death enslaved; in word, in deed, unmanned.\n\nLXXV.\n\nIn all save form alone, how changed! and who\nThat marks the fire still sparkling in each eye,\nWho would but deem their bosom burned anew\nWith thy unquenched beam, lost Liberty!\nAnd many dream withal the hour is nigh\nThat gives them back their fathers' heritage:\nFor foreign arms and aid they fondly sigh,\nNor solely dare encounter hostile rage,\nOr tear their name defiled from Slavery's mournful page.\n\nLXXVI.\n\nHereditary bondsmen! know ye not\nWho would be free themselves must strike the blow?\nBy their right arms the conquest must be wrought?\nWill Gaul or Muscovite redress ye?

once the empress of their reign?\nThough turbans now pollute Sophia's shrine\nAnd Greece her very altars eyes in vain:\n(Alas! her woes will still pervade my strain!)\nGay were her minstrels once, for free her throng,\nAll felt the common joy they now must feign;\nNor oft I've seen such sight, nor heard such song,\nAs wooed the eye, and thrilled the Bosphorus along.\n\nLXXX.\n\nLoud was the lightsome tumult on the shore;\nOft Music changed, but never ceased her tone,\nAnd timely echoed back the measured oar,\nAnd rippling waters made a pleasant moan:\nThe Queen of tides on high consenting shone;\nAnd when a transient breeze swept o'er the wave,\n'Twas as if, darting from her heavenly throne,\nA brighter glance her form reflected gave,\nTill sparkling billows seemed to light the banks they lave.\n\nLXXXI.\n\nGlanced many a light caique along the foam,\nDanced on the shore the daughters of the land,\nNo thought had man or maid of rest or home,\nWhile many a languid eye and thrilling hand\nExchanged the look few bosoms may withstand,\nOr gently pressed, returned the pressure still:\nOh Love! young Love! bound in thy rosy band,\nLet sage or cynic prattle as he will,\nThese hours, and only these, redeemed Life's years of ill!\n\nLXXXII.\n\nBut, midst the throng in merry masquerade,\nLurk there no hearts that throb with secret pain,\nE'en through the closest searment half-betrayed?\nTo such the gentle murmurs of the main\nSeem to re-echo all they mourn in vain;\nTo such the gladness of the gamesome crowd\nIs source of wayward thought and stern disdain:\nHow do they loathe the laughter idly loud,\nAnd long to change the robe of revel for the shroud!\n\nLXXXIII.\n\nThis must he feel, the true-born son of Greece,\nIf Greece one true-born patriot can boast:\nNot such as prate of war but skulk in peace,\nThe bondsman's peace, who sighs for all he lost,\nYet with smooth smile his tyrant can accost,\nAnd wield the slavish sickle, not the sword:\nAh, Greece! they love thee least who owe thee most\u2014\nTheir birth, their blood, and that sublime record\nOf hero sires, who shame thy now degenerate horde!\n\nLXXXIV.\n\nWhen riseth Lacedaemon's hardihood,\nWhen Thebes Epaminondas rears again,\nWhen Athens' children are with hearts endued,\nWhen Grecian mothers shall give birth to men,\nThen mayst thou be restored; but not till then.\nA thousand years scarce serve to form a state;\nAn hour may lay it in the dust:  and when\nCan man its shattered splendour renovate,\nRecall its virtues back, and vanquish Time and Fate?\n\nLXXXV.\n\nAnd yet how lovely in thine age of woe,\nLand of lost gods and godlike men, art thou!\nThy vales of evergreen, thy hills of snow,\nProclaim thee Nature's varied favourite now;\nThy fanes, thy temples to the surface bow,\nCommingling slowly with heroic earth,\nBroke by the share of every rustic plough:\nSo perish monuments of mortal birth,\nSo perish all in turn, save well-recorded worth;\n\nLXXXVI.\n\nSave where some solitary column mourns\nAbove its prostrate brethren of the cave;\nSave where Tritonia's airy shrine adorns\nColonna's cliff, and gleams along the wave;\nSave o'er some warrior's half-forgotten grave,\nWhere the grey stones and unmolested grass\nAges, but not oblivion, feebly brave,\nWhile strangers only not regardless pass,\nLingering like me, perchance, to gaze, and sigh 'Alas!'\n\nLXXXVII.\n\nYet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild:\nSweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields,\nThine olives ripe as when Minerva smiled,\nAnd still his honeyed wealth Hymettus yields;\nThere the blithe bee his fragrant fortress builds,\nThe freeborn wanderer of thy mountain air;\nApollo still thy long, long summer gilds,\nStill in his beam Mendeli's marbles glare;\nArt, Glory, Freedom fail, but Nature still is fair.\n\nLXXXVIII.\n\nWhere'er we tread, 'tis haunted, holy ground;\nNo earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould,\nBut one vast realm of wonder spreads around,\nAnd all the Muse's tales seem truly told,\nTill the sense aches with gazing to behold\nThe scenes our earliest dreams have dwelt upon:\nEach hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold,\nDefies the power which crushed thy temples gone:\nAge shakes Athena's tower, but spares gray Marathon.\n\nLXXXIX.\n\nThe sun, the soil, but not the slave, the same;\nUnchanged in all except its foreign lord\u2014\nPreserves alike its bounds and boundless fame;\nThe battle-field, where Persia's victim horde\nFirst bowed beneath the brunt of Hellas' sword,\nAs on the morn to distant Glory dear,\nWhen Marathon became a magic word;\nWhich uttered, to the hearer's eye appear\nThe camp, the host, the fight, the conqueror's career.\n\nXC.\n\nThe flying Mede, his shaftless broken bow;\nThe fiery Greek, his red pursuing spear;\nMountains above, Earth's, Ocean's plain below;\nDeath in the front, Destruction in the rear!\nSuch was the scene\u2014what now remaineth here?\nWhat sacred trophy marks the hallowed ground,\nRecording Freedom's smile and Asia's tear?\nThe rifled urn, the violated mound,\nThe dust thy courser's hoof, rude stranger! spurns around.\n\nXCI.\n\nYet to the remnants of thy splendour past\nShall pilgrims, pensive, but unwearied, throng:\nLong shall the voyager, with th' Ionian blast,\nHail the bright clime of battle and of song;\nLong shall thine annals and immortal tongue\nFill with thy fame the youth of many a shore:\nBoast of the aged! lesson of the young!\nWhich sages venerate and bards adore,\nAs Pallas and the Muse unveil their awful lore.\n\nXCII.\n\nThe parted bosom clings to wonted home,\nIf aught that's kindred cheer the welcome hearth;\nHe that is lonely, hither let him roam,\nAnd gaze complacent on congenial earth.\nGreece is no lightsome land of social mirth;\nBut he whom Sadness sootheth may abide,\nAnd scarce regret the region of his birth,\nWhen wandering slow by Delphi's sacred side,\nOr gazing o'er the plains where Greek and Persian died.\n\nXCIII.\n\nLet such approach this consecrated land,\nAnd pass in peace along the magic waste:\nBut spare its relics\u2014let no busy hand\nDeface the scenes, already how defaced!\nNot for such purpose were these altars placed.\nRevere the remnants nations once revered;\nSo may our country's name be undisgraced,\nSo mayst thou prosper where thy youth was reared,\nBy every honest joy of love and life endeared!\n\nXCIV.\n\nFor thee, who thus in too protracted song\nHath soothed thine idlesse with inglorious lays,\nSoon shall thy voice be lost amid the throng\nOf louder minstrels in these later days:\nTo such resign the strife for fading bays\u2014\nIll may such contest now the spirit move\nWhich heeds nor keen reproach nor partial praise,\nSince cold each kinder heart that might approve,\nAnd none are left to please where none are left to love.\n\nXCV.\n\nThou too art gone, thou loved and lovely one!\nWhom youth and youth's affections bound to me;\nWho did for me what none beside have done,\nNor shrank from one albeit unworthy thee.\nWhat is my being? thou hast ceased to be!\nNor stayed to welcome here thy wanderer home,\nWho mourns o'er hours which we no more shall see\u2014\nWould they had never been, or were to come!\nWould he had ne'er returned to find fresh cause to roam!\n\nXCVI.\n\nOh!

full reckless may ye flow,\nSince Time hath reft whate'er my soul enjoyed,\nAnd with the ills of eld mine earlier years alloyed.\n\n\n\n\n\nCANTO THE THIRD.\n\nI.\n\nIs thy face like thy mother's, my fair child!\nAda! sole daughter of my house and heart?\nWhen last I saw thy young blue eyes, they smiled,\nAnd then we parted,\u2014not as now we part,\nBut with a hope.\u2014\nAwaking with a start,\nThe waters heave around me; and on high\nThe winds lift up their voices:  I depart,\nWhither I know not; but the hour's gone by,\nWhen Albion's lessening shores could grieve or glad mine eye.\n\nII.\n\nOnce more upon the waters! yet once more!\nAnd the waves bound beneath me as a steed\nThat knows his rider.  Welcome to their roar!\nSwift be their guidance, wheresoe'er it lead!\nThough the strained mast should quiver as a reed,\nAnd the rent canvas fluttering strew the gale,\nStill must I on; for I am as a weed,\nFlung from the rock, on Ocean's foam, to sail\nWhere'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath prevail.\n\nIII.\n\nIn my youth's summer I did sing of One,\nThe wandering outlaw of his own dark mind;\nAgain I seize the theme, then but begun,\nAnd bear it with me, as the rushing wind\nBears the cloud onwards:  in that tale I find\nThe furrows of long thought, and dried-up tears,\nWhich, ebbing, leave a sterile track behind,\nO'er which all heavily the journeying years\nPlod the last sands of life\u2014where not a flower appears.\n\nIV.\n\nSince my young days of passion\u2014joy, or pain,\nPerchance my heart and harp have lost a string,\nAnd both may jar:  it may be, that in vain\nI would essay as I have sung to sing.\nYet, though a dreary strain, to this I cling,\nSo that it wean me from the weary dream\nOf selfish grief or gladness\u2014so it fling\nForgetfulness around me\u2014it shall seem\nTo me, though to none else, a not ungrateful theme.\n\nV.\n\nHe who, grown aged in this world of woe,\nIn deeds, not years, piercing the depths of life,\nSo that no wonder waits him; nor below\nCan love or sorrow, fame, ambition, strife,\nCut to his heart again with the keen knife\nOf silent, sharp endurance:  he can tell\nWhy thought seeks refuge in lone caves, yet rife\nWith airy images, and shapes which dwell\nStill unimpaired, though old, in the soul's haunted cell.\n\nVI.\n\n'Tis to create, and in creating live\nA being more intense, that we endow\nWith form our fancy, gaining as we give\nThe life we image, even as I do now.\nWhat am I?  Nothing:  but not so art thou,\nSoul of my thought! with whom I traverse earth,\nInvisible but gazing, as I glow\nMixed with thy spirit, blended with thy birth,\nAnd feeling still with thee in my crushed feelings' dearth.\n\nVII.\n\nYet must I think less wildly:  I HAVE thought\nToo long and darkly, till my brain became,\nIn its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought,\nA whirling gulf of phantasy and flame:\nAnd thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,\nMy springs of life were poisoned.  'Tis too late!\nYet am I changed; though still enough the same\nIn strength to bear what time cannot abate,\nAnd feed on bitter fruits without accusing fate.\n\nVIII.\n\nSomething too much of this:  but now 'tis past,\nAnd the spell closes with its silent seal.\nLong-absent Harold reappears at last;\nHe of the breast which fain no more would feel,\nWrung with the wounds which kill not, but ne'er heal;\nYet Time, who changes all, had altered him\nIn soul and aspect as in age:  years steal\nFire from the mind as vigour from the limb;\nAnd life's enchanted cup but sparkles near the brim.\n\nIX.\n\nHis had been quaffed too quickly, and he found\nThe dregs were wormwood; but he filled again,\nAnd from a purer fount, on holier ground,\nAnd deemed its spring perpetual; but in vain!\nStill round him clung invisibly a chain\nWhich galled for ever, fettering though unseen,\nAnd heavy though it clanked not; worn with pain,\nWhich pined although it spoke not, and grew keen,\nEntering with every step he took through many a scene.\n\nX.\n\nSecure in guarded coldness, he had mixed\nAgain in fancied safety with his kind,\nAnd deemed his spirit now so firmly fixed\nAnd sheathed with an invulnerable mind,\nThat, if no joy, no sorrow lurked behind;\nAnd he, as one, might midst the many stand\nUnheeded, searching through the crowd to find\nFit speculation; such as in strange land\nHe found in wonder-works of God and Nature's hand.\n\nXI.\n\nBut who can view the ripened rose, nor seek\nTo wear it? who can curiously behold\nThe smoothness and the sheen of beauty's cheek,\nNor feel the heart can never all grow old?\nWho can contemplate fame through clouds unfold\nThe star which rises o'er her steep, nor climb?\nHarold, once more within the vortex rolled\nOn with the giddy circle, chasing Time,\nYet with a nobler aim than in his youth's fond prime.\n\nXII.\n\nBut soon he knew himself the most unfit\nOf men to herd with Man; with whom he held\nLittle in common; untaught to submit\nHis thoughts to others, though his soul was quelled,\nIn youth by his own thoughts; still uncompelled,\nHe would not yield dominion of his mind\nTo spirits against whom his own rebelled;\nProud though in desolation; which could find\nA life within itself, to breathe without mankind.\n\nXIII.\n\nWhere rose the mountains, there to him were friends;\nWhere rolled the ocean, thereon was his home;\nWhere a blue sky, and glowing clime, extends,\nHe had the passion and the power to roam;\nThe desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,\nWere unto him companionship; they spake\nA mutual language, clearer than the tome\nOf his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake\nFor nature's pages glassed by sunbeams on the lake.\n\nXIV.\n\nLike the Chaldean, he could watch the stars,\nTill he had peopled them with beings bright\nAs their own beams; and earth, and earth-born jars,\nAnd human frailties, were forgotten quite:\nCould he have kept his spirit to that flight,\nHe had been happy; but this clay will sink\nIts spark immortal, envying it the light\nTo which it mounts, as if to break the link\nThat keeps us from yon heaven which woos us to its brink.\n\nXV.\n\nBut in Man's dwellings he became a thing\nRestless and worn, and stern and wearisome,\nDrooped as a wild-born falcon with clipt wing,\nTo whom the boundless air alone were home:\nThen came his fit again, which to o'ercome,\nAs eagerly the barred-up bird will beat\nHis breast and beak against his wiry dome\nTill the blood tinge his plumage, so the heat\nOf his impeded soul would through his bosom eat.\n\nXVI.\n\nSelf-exiled Harold wanders forth again,\nWith naught of hope left, but with less of gloom;\nThe very knowledge that he lived in vain,\nThat all was over on this side the tomb,\nHad made Despair a smilingness assume,\nWhich, though 'twere wild\u2014as on the plundered wreck\nWhen mariners would madly meet their doom\nWith draughts intemperate on the sinking deck\u2014\nDid yet inspire a cheer, which he forbore to check.\n\nXVII.\n\nStop! for thy tread is on an empire's dust!\nAn earthquake's spoil is sepulchred below!\nIs the spot marked with no colossal bust?\nNor column trophied for triumphal show?\nNone; but the moral's truth tells simpler so,\nAs the ground was before, thus let it be;\u2014\nHow that red rain hath made the harvest grow!\nAnd is this all the world has gained by thee,\nThou first and last of fields! king-making Victory?\n\nXVIII.\n\nAnd Harold stands upon this place of skulls,\nThe grave of France, the deadly Waterloo!\nHow in an hour the power which gave annuls\nIts gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!\nIn 'pride of place' here last the eagle flew,\nThen tore with bloody talon the rent plain,\nPierced by the shaft of banded nations through:\nAmbition's life and labours all were vain;\nHe wears the shattered links of the world's broken chain.\n\nXIX.\n\nFit retribution!  Gaul may champ the bit,\nAnd foam in fetters, but is Earth more free?\nDid nations combat to make ONE submit;\nOr league to teach all kings true sovereignty?\nWhat! shall reviving thraldom again be\nThe patched-up idol of enlightened days?\nShall we, who struck the Lion down, shall we\nPay the Wolf homage? proffering lowly gaze\nAnd servile knees to thrones?  No; PROVE before ye praise!\n\nXX.\n\nIf not, o'er one fall'n despot boast no more!\nIn vain fair cheeks were furrowed with hot tears\nFor Europe's flowers long rooted up before\nThe trampler of her vineyards; in vain years\nOf death, depopulation, bondage, fears,\nHave all been borne, and broken by the accord\nOf roused-up millions:  all that most endears\nGlory, is when the myrtle wreathes a sword\nSuch as Harmodius drew on Athens' tyrant lord.\n\nXXI.\n\nThere was a sound of revelry by night,\nAnd Belgium's capital had gathered then\nHer Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright\nThe lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;\nA thousand hearts beat happily; and when\nMusic arose with its voluptuous swell,\nSoft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,\nAnd all went merry as a marriage bell;\nBut hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!\n\nXXII.\n\nDid ye not hear it?\u2014No; 'twas but the wind,\nOr the car rattling o'er the stony street;\nOn with the dance! let joy be unconfined;\nNo sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet\nTo chase the glowing Hours with flying feet.\nBut hark!\u2014that heavy sound breaks in once more,\nAs if the clouds its echo would repeat;\nAnd nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!\nArm! arm! it is\u2014it is\u2014the cannon's opening roar!\n\nXXIII.\n\nWithin a windowed niche of that high hall\nSate Brunswick's fated chieftain; he did hear\nThat sound, the first amidst the festival,\nAnd caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;\nAnd when they smiled because he deemed it near,\nHis heart more truly knew that peal too well\nWhich stretched his father on a bloody bier,\nAnd roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:\nHe rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.\n\nXXIV.\n\nAh! then and there was hurrying to and fro,\nAnd gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,\nAnd cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago\nBlushed at the praise of their own loveliness;\nAnd there were sudden partings, such as press\nThe life from out young hearts, and choking sighs\nWhich ne'er might be repeated:  who would guess\nIf ever more should meet those mutual eyes,\nSince upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!\n\nXXV.\n\nAnd there was mounting in hot haste:  the steed,\nThe mustering squadron, and the clattering car,\nWent pouring forward with impetuous speed,\nAnd swiftly forming in the ranks of war;\nAnd the deep thunder peal on peal afar;\nAnd near, the beat of the alarming drum\nRoused up the soldier ere the morning star;\nWhile thronged the citizens with terror dumb,\nOr whispering, with white lips\u2014'The foe!  They come! they come!'\n\nXXVI.\n\nAnd wild and high the 'Cameron's gathering' rose,\nThe war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills\nHave heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes:\nHow in the noon of night that pibroch thrills\nSavage and shrill!  But with the breath which fills\nTheir mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers\nWith the fierce native daring which instils\nThe stirring memory of a thousand years,\nAnd Evan's, Donald's fame rings in each clansman's ears.\n\nXXVII.\n\nAnd Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,\nDewy with Nature's tear-drops, as they pass,\nGrieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,\nOver the unreturniug brave,\u2014alas!\nEre evening to be trodden like the grass\nWhich now beneath them, but above shall grow\nIn its next verdure, when this fiery mass\nOf living valour, rolling on the foe,\nAnd burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.\n\nXXVIII.\n\nLast noon beheld them full of lusty life,\nLast eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay,\nThe midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,\nThe morn the marshalling in arms,\u2014the day\nBattle's magnificently stern array!\nThe thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent\nThe earth is covered thick with other clay,\nWhich her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,\nRider and horse,\u2014friend, foe,\u2014in one red burial blent!\n\nXXIX.\n\nTheir praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine;\nYet one I would select from that proud throng,\nPartly because they blend me with his line,\nAnd partly that I did his sire some wrong,\nAnd partly that bright names will hallow song;\nAnd his was of the bravest, and when showered\nThe death-bolts deadliest the thinned files along,\nEven where the thickest of war's tempest lowered,\nThey reached no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant Howard!\n\nXXX.\n\nThere have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,\nAnd mine were nothing, had I such to give;\nBut when I stood beneath the fresh green tree,\nWhich living waves where thou didst cease to live,\nAnd saw around me the wild field revive\nWith fruits and fertile promise, and the Spring\nCome forth her work of gladness to contrive,\nWith all her reckless birds upon the wing,\nI turned from all she brought to those she could not bring.\n\nXXXI.\n\nI turned to thee, to thousands, of whom each\nAnd one as all a ghastly gap did make\nIn his own kind and kindred, whom to teach\nForgetfulness were mercy for their sake;\nThe Archangel's trump, not Glory's, must awake\nThose whom they thirst for; though the sound of Fame\nMay for a moment soothe, it cannot slake\nThe fever of vain longing, and the name\nSo honoured, but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.\n\nXXXII.\n\nThey mourn, but smile at length; and, smiling, mourn:\nThe tree will wither long before it fall:\nThe hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;\nThe roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall\nIn massy hoariness; the ruined wall\nStands when its wind-worn battlements are gone;\nThe bars survive the captive they enthral;\nThe day drags through though storms keep out the sun;\nAnd thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on:\n\nXXXIII.\n\nE'en as a broken mirror, which the glass\nIn every fragment multiplies; and makes\nA thousand images of one that was,\nThe same, and still the more, the more it breaks;\nAnd thus the heart will do which not forsakes,\nLiving in shattered guise, and still, and cold,\nAnd bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,\nYet withers on till all without is old,\nShowing no visible sign, for such things are untold.\n\nXXXIV.\n\nThere is a very life in our despair,\nVitality of poison,\u2014a quick root\nWhich feeds these deadly branches; for it were\nAs nothing did we die; but life will suit\nItself to Sorrow's most detested fruit,\nLike to the apples on the Dead Sea shore,\nAll ashes to the taste:  Did man compute\nExistence by enjoyment, and count o'er\nSuch hours 'gainst years of life,\u2014say, would he name threescore?\n\nXXXV.\n\nThe Psalmist numbered out the years of man:\nThey are enough:  and if thy tale be TRUE,\nThou, who didst grudge him e'en that fleeting span,\nMore than enough, thou fatal Waterloo!\nMillions of tongues record thee, and anew\nTheir children's lips shall echo them, and say,\n'Here, where the sword united nations drew,\nOur countrymen were warring on that day!'\nAnd this is much, and all which will not pass away.\n\nXXXVI.\n\nThere sunk the greatest, nor the worst of men,\nWhose spirit anithetically mixed\nOne moment of the mightiest, and again\nOn little objects with like firmness fixed;\nExtreme in all things! hadst thou been betwixt,\nThy throne had still been thine, or never been;\nFor daring made thy rise as fall:  thou seek'st\nEven now to reassume the imperial mien,\nAnd shake again the world, the Thunderer of the scene!\n\nXXXVII.\n\nConqueror and captive of the earth art thou!\nShe trembles at thee still, and thy wild name\nWas ne'er more bruited in men's minds than now\nThat thou art nothing, save the jest of Fame,\nWho wooed thee once, thy vassal, and became\nThe flatterer of thy fierceness, till thou wert\nA god unto thyself; nor less the same\nTo the astounded kingdoms all inert,\nWho deemed thee for a time whate'er thou didst assert.\n\nXXXVIII.\n\nOh, more or less than man\u2014in high or low,\nBattling with nations, flying from the field;\nNow making monarchs' necks thy footstool, now\nMore than thy meanest soldier taught to yield:\nAn empire thou couldst crush, command, rebuild,\nBut govern not thy pettiest passion, nor,\nHowever deeply in men's spirits skilled,\nLook through thine own, nor curb the lust of war,\nNor learn that tempted Fate will leave the loftiest star.\n\nXXXIX.\n\nYet well thy soul hath brooked the turning tide\nWith that untaught innate philosophy,\nWhich, be it wisdom, coldness, or deep pride,\nIs gall and wormwood to an enemy.\nWhen the whole host of hatred stood hard by,\nTo watch and mock thee shrinking, thou hast smiled\nWith a sedate and all-enduring eye;\nWhen Fortune fled her spoiled and favourite child,\nHe stood unbowed beneath the ills upon him piled.\n\nXL.\n\nSager than in thy fortunes; for in them\nAmbition steeled thee on to far too show\nThat just habitual scorn, which could contemn\nMen and their thoughts; 'twas wise to feel, not so\nTo wear it ever on thy lip and brow,\nAnd spurn the instruments thou wert to use\nTill they were turned unto thine overthrow:\n'Tis but a worthless world to win or lose;\nSo hath it proved to thee, and all such lot who choose.\n\nXLI.\n\nIf, like a tower upon a headland rock,\nThou hadst been made to stand or fall alone,\nSuch scorn of man had helped to brave the shock;\nBut men's thoughts were the steps which paved thy throne,\nTHEIR admiration thy best weapon shone;\nThe part of Philip's son was thine, not then\n(Unless aside thy purple had been thrown)\nLike stern Diogenes to mock at men;\nFor sceptred cynics earth were far too wide a den.\n\nXLII.\n\nBut quiet to quick bosoms is a hell,\nAnd THERE hath been thy bane; there is a fire\nAnd motion of the soul, which will not dwell\nIn its own narrow being, but aspire\nBeyond the fitting medium of desire;\nAnd, but once kindled, quenchless evermore,\nPreys upon high adventure, nor can tire\nOf aught but rest; a fever at the core,\nFatal to him who bears, to all who ever bore.\n\nXLIII.\n\nThis makes the madmen who have made men mad\nBy their contagion!  Conquerors and Kings,\nFounders of sects and systems, to whom add\nSophists, Bards, Statesmen, all unquiet things\nWhich stir too strongly the soul's secret springs,\nAnd are themselves the fools to those they fool;\nEnvied, yet how unenviable! what stings\nAre theirs!  One breast laid open were a school\nWhich would unteach mankind the lust to shine or rule:\n\nXLIV.\n\nTheir breath is agitation, and their life\nA storm whereon they ride, to sink at last,\nAnd yet so nursed and bigoted to strife,\nThat should their days, surviving perils past,\nMelt to calm twilight, they feel overcast\nWith sorrow and supineness, and so die;\nEven as a flame unfed, which runs to waste\nWith its own flickering, or a sword laid by,\nWhich eats into itself, and rusts ingloriously.\n\nXLV.\n\nHe who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find\nThe loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;\nHe who surpasses or subdues mankind,\nMust look down on the hate of those below.\nThough high ABOVE the sun of glory glow,\nAnd far BENEATH the earth and ocean spread,\nROUND him are icy rocks, and loudly blow\nContending tempests on his naked head,\nAnd thus reward the toils which to those summits led.\n\nXLVI.\n\nAway with these; true Wisdom's world will be\nWithin its own creation, or in thine,\nMaternal Nature! for who teems like thee,\nThus on the banks of thy majestic Rhine?\nThere Harold gazes on a work divine,\nA blending of all beauties; streams and dells,\nFruit, foliage, crag, wood, corn-field, mountain, vine,\nAnd chiefless castles breathing stern farewells\nFrom grey but leafy walls, where Ruin greenly dwells.\n\nXLVII.\n\nAnd there they stand, as stands a lofty mind,\nWorn, but unstooping to the baser crowd,\nAll tenantless, save to the crannying wind,\nOr holding dark communion with the cloud.\nThere was a day when they were young and proud,\nBanners on high, and battles passed below;\nBut they who fought are in a bloody shroud,\nAnd those which waved are shredless dust ere now,\nAnd the bleak battlements shall bear no future blow.\n\nXLVIII.\n\nBeneath these battlements, within those walls,\nPower dwelt amidst her passions; in proud state\nEach robber chief upheld his armed halls,\nDoing his evil will, nor less elate\nThan mightier heroes of a longer date.\nWhat want these outlaws conquerors should have\nBut History's purchased page to call them great?\nA wider space, an ornamented grave?\nTheir hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.\n\nXLIX.\n\nIn their baronial feuds and single fields,\nWhat deeds of prowess unrecorded died!\nAnd Love, which lent a blazon to their shields,\nWith emblems well devised by amorous pride,\nThrough all the mail of iron hearts would glide;\nBut still their flame was fierceness, and drew on\nKeen contest and destruction near allied,\nAnd many a tower for some fair mischief won,\nSaw the discoloured Rhine beneath its ruin run.\n\nL.\n\nBut thou, exulting and abounding river!\nMaking thy waves a blessing as they flow\nThrough banks whose beauty would endure for ever,\nCould man but leave thy bright creation so,\nNor its fair promise from the surface mow\nWith the sharp scythe of conflict,\u2014then to see\nThy valley of sweet waters, were to know\nEarth paved like Heaven; and to seem such to me\nEven now what wants thy stream?\u2014that it should Lethe be.\n\nLI.\n\nA thousand battles have assailed thy banks,\nBut these and half their fame have passed away,\nAnd Slaughter heaped on high his weltering ranks:\nTheir very graves are gone, and what are they?\nThy tide washed down the blood of yesterday,\nAnd all was stainless, and on thy clear stream\nGlassed with its dancing light the sunny ray;\nBut o'er the blackened memory's blighting dream\nThy waves would vainly roll, all sweeping as they seem.\n\nLII.\n\nThus Harold inly said, and passed along,\nYet not insensible to all which here\nAwoke the jocund birds to early song\nIn glens which might have made e'en exile dear:\nThough on his brow were graven lines austere,\nAnd tranquil sternness which had ta'en the place\nOf feelings fierier far but less severe,\nJoy was not always absent from his face,\nBut o'er it in such scenes would steal with transient trace.\n\nLIII.\n\nNor was all love shut from him, though his days\nOf passion had consumed themselves to dust.\nIt is in vain that we would coldly gaze\nOn such as smile upon us; the heart must\nLeap kindly back to kindness, though disgust\nHath weaned it from all worldlings:  thus he felt,\nFor there was soft remembrance, and sweet trust\nIn one fond breast, to which his own would melt,\nAnd in its tenderer hour on that his bosom dwelt.\n\nLIV.\n\nAnd he had learned to love,\u2014I know not why,\nFor this in such as him seems strange of mood,\u2014\nThe helpless looks of blooming infancy,\nEven in its earliest nurture; what subdued,\nTo change like this, a mind so far imbued\nWith scorn of man, it little boots to know;\nBut thus it was; and though in solitude\nSmall power the nipped affections have to grow,\nIn him this glowed when all beside had ceased to glow.\n\nLV.\n\nAnd there was one soft breast, as hath been said,\nWhich unto his was bound by stronger ties\nThan the church links withal; and, though unwed,\nTHAT love was pure, and, far above disguise,\nHad stood the test of mortal enmities\nStill undivided, and cemented more\nBy peril, dreaded most in female eyes;\nBut this was firm, and from a foreign shore\nWell to that heart might his these absent greetings pour!\n\nThe castled crag of Drachenfels\nFrowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine.\nWhose breast of waters broadly swells\nBetween the banks which bear the vine,\nAnd hills all rich with blossomed trees,\nAnd fields which promise corn and wine,\nAnd scattered cities crowning these,\nWhose far white walls along them shine,\nHave strewed a scene, which I should see\nWith double joy wert THOU with me!\n\nAnd peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,\nAnd hands which offer early flowers,\nWalk smiling o'er this paradise;\nAbove, the frequent feudal towers\nThrough green leaves lift their walls of grey,\nAnd many a rock which steeply lours,\nAnd noble arch in proud decay,\nLook o'er this vale of vintage bowers:\nBut one thing want these banks of Rhine,\u2014\nThy gentle hand to clasp in mine!\n\nI send the lilies given to me;\nThough long before thy hand they touch,\nI know that they must withered be,\nBut yet reject them not as such;\nFor I have cherished them as dear,\nBecause they yet may meet thine eye,\nAnd guide thy soul to mine e'en here,\nWhen thou behold'st them drooping nigh,\nAnd know'st them gathered by the Rhine,\nAnd offered from my heart to thine!\n\nThe river nobly foams and flows,\nThe charm of this enchanted ground,\nAnd all its thousand turns disclose\nSome fresher beauty varying round;\nThe haughtiest breast its wish might bound\nThrough life to dwell delighted here;\nNor could on earth a spot be found\nTo Nature and to me so dear,\nCould thy dear eyes in following mine\nStill sweeten more these banks of Rhine!\n\nLVI.\n\nBy Coblentz, on a rise of gentle ground,\nThere is a small and simple pyramid,\nCrowning the summit of the verdant mound;\nBeneath its base are heroes' ashes hid,\nOur enemy's,\u2014but let not that forbid\nHonour to Marceau! o'er whose early tomb\nTears, big tears, gushed from the rough soldier's lid,\nLamenting and yet envying such a doom,\nFalling for France, whose rights he battled to resume.\n\nLVI.\n\nBrief, brave, and glorious was his young career,\u2014\nHis mourners were two hosts, his friends and foes;\nAnd fitly may the stranger lingering here\nPray for his gallant spirit's bright repose;\nFor he was Freedom's champion, one of those,\nThe few in number, who had not o'erstept\nThe charter to chastise which she bestows\nOn such as wield her weapons; he had kept\nThe whiteness of his soul, and thus men o'er him wept.\n\nLVIII.\n\nHere Ehrenbreitstein, with her shattered wall\nBlack with the miner's blast, upon her height\nYet shows of what she was, when shell and ball\nRebounding idly on her strength did light;\nA tower of victory! from whence the flight\nOf baffled foes was watched along the plain;\nBut Peace destroyed what War could never blight,\nAnd laid those proud roofs bare to Summer's rain\u2014\nOn which the iron shower for years had poured in vain.\n\nLIX.\n\nAdieu to thee, fair Rhine!  How long, delighted,\nThe stranger fain would linger on his way;\nThine is a scene alike where souls united\nOr lonely Contemplation thus might stray;\nAnd could the ceaseless vultures cease to prey\nOn self-condemning bosoms, it were here,\nWhere Nature, not too sombre nor too gay,\nWild but not rude, awful yet not austere,\nIs to the mellow earth as autumn to the year.\n\nLX.\n\nAdieu to thee again! a vain adieu!\nThere can be no farewell to scene like thine;\nThe mind is coloured by thy every hue;\nAnd if reluctantly the eyes resign\nTheir cherished gaze upon thee, lovely Rhine!\n'Tis with the thankful glance of parting praise;\nMore mighty spots may rise\u2014more glaring shine,\nBut none unite in one attaching maze\nThe brilliant, fair, and soft;\u2014the glories of old days.\n\nLXI.\n\nThe negligently grand, the fruitful bloom\nOf coming ripeness, the white city's sheen,\nThe rolling stream, the precipice's gloom,\nThe forest's growth, and Gothic walls between,\nThe wild rocks shaped as they had turrets been\nIn mockery of man's art; and these withal\nA race of faces happy as the scene,\nWhose fertile bounties here extend to all,\nStill springing o'er thy banks, though empires near them fall.\n\nLXII.\n\nBut these recede.  Above me are the Alps,\nThe palaces of Nature, whose vast walls\nHave pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,\nAnd throned Eternity in icy halls\nOf cold sublimity, where forms and falls\nThe avalanche\u2014the thunderbolt of snow!\nAll that expands the spirit, yet appals,\nGathers around these summits, as to show\nHow Earth may pierce to Heaven, yet leave vain man below.\n\nLXIII.\n\nBut ere these matchless heights I dare to scan,\nThere is a spot should not be passed in vain,\u2014\nMorat! the proud, the patriot field! where man\nMay gaze on ghastly trophies of the slain,\nNor blush for those who conquered on that plain;\nHere Burgundy bequeathed his tombless host,\nA bony heap, through ages to remain,\nThemselves their monument;\u2014the Stygian coast\nUnsepulchred they roamed, and shrieked each wandering ghost.\n\nLXIV.\n\nWhile Waterloo with Cannae's carnage vies,\nMorat and Marathon twin names shall stand;\nThey were true Glory's stainless victories,\nWon by the unambitious heart and hand\nOf a proud, brotherly, and civic band,\nAll unbought champions in no princely cause\nOf vice-entailed Corruption; they no land\nDoomed to bewail the blasphemy of laws\nMaking king's rights divine, by some Draconic clause.\n\nLXV.\n\nBy a lone wall a lonelier column rears\nA grey and grief-worn aspect of old days\n'Tis the last remnant of the wreck of years,\nAnd looks as with the wild bewildered gaze\nOf one to stone converted by amaze,\nYet still with consciousness; and there it stands,\nMaking a marvel that it not decays,\nWhen the coeval pride of human hands,\nLevelled Aventicum, hath strewed her subject lands.\n\nLXVI.\n\nAnd there\u2014oh! sweet and sacred be the name!\u2014\nJulia\u2014the daughter, the devoted\u2014gave\nHer youth to Heaven; her heart, beneath a claim\nNearest to Heaven's, broke o'er a father's grave.\nJustice is sworn 'gainst tears, and hers would crave\nThe life she lived in; but the judge was just,\nAnd then she died on him she could not save.\nTheir tomb was simple, and without a bust,\nAnd held within their urn one mind, one heart, one dust.\n\nLXVII.\n\nBut these are deeds which should not pass away,\nAnd names that must not wither, though the earth\nForgets her empires with a just decay,\nThe enslavers and the enslaved, their death and birth;\nThe high, the mountain-majesty of worth,\nShould be, and shall, survivor of its woe,\nAnd from its immortality look forth\nIn the sun's face, like yonder Alpine snow,\nImperishably pure beyond all things below.\n\nLXVIII.\n\nLake Leman woos me with its crystal face,\nThe mirror where the stars and mountains view\nThe stillness of their aspect in each trace\nIts clear depth yields of their far height and hue:\nThere is too much of man here, to look through\nWith a fit mind the might which I behold;\nBut soon in me shall Loneliness renew\nThoughts hid, but not less cherished than of old,\nEre mingling with the herd had penned me in their fold.\n\nLXIX.\n\nTo fly from, need not be to hate, mankind;\nAll are not fit with them to stir and toil,\nNor is it discontent to keep the mind\nDeep in its fountain, lest it overboil\nIn one hot throng, where we become the spoil\nOf our infection, till too late and long\nWe may deplore and struggle with the coil,\nIn wretched interchange of wrong for wrong\nMidst a contentious world, striving where none are strong.\n\nLXX.\n\nThere, in a moment, we may plunge our years\nIn fatal penitence, and in the blight\nOf our own soul, turn all our blood to tears,\nAnd colour things to come with hues of Night;\nThe race of life becomes a hopeless flight\nTo those that walk in darkness:  on the sea,\nThe boldest steer but where their ports invite,\nBut there are wanderers o'er Eternity\nWhose bark drives on and on, and anchored ne'er shall be.\n\nLXXI.\n\nIs it not better, then, to be alone,\nAnd love Earth only for its earthly sake?\nBy the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone,\nOr the pure bosom of its nursing lake,\nWhich feeds it as a mother who doth make\nA fair but froward infant her own care,\nKissing its cries away as these awake;\u2014\nIs it not better thus our lives to wear,\nThan join the crushing crowd, doomed to inflict or bear?\n\nLXXII.\n\nI live not in myself, but I become\nPortion of that around me; and to me,\nHigh mountains are a feeling, but the hum\nOf human cities torture:  I can see\nNothing to loathe in Nature, save to be\nA link reluctant in a fleshly chain,\nClassed among creatures, when the soul can flee,\nAnd with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain\nOf ocean, or the stars, mingle, and not in vain.\n\nLXXIII.\n\nAnd thus I am absorbed, and this is life:\nI look upon the peopled desert Past,\nAs on a place of agony and strife,\nWhere, for some sin, to Sorrow I was cast,\nTo act and suffer, but remount at last\nWith a fresh pinion; which I felt to spring,\nThough young, yet waxing vigorous as the blast\nWhich it would cope with, on delighted wing,\nSpurning the clay-cold bonds which round our being cling.\n\nLXXIV.\n\nAnd when, at length, the mind shall be all free\nFrom what it hates in this degraded form,\nReft of its carnal life, save what shall be\nExistent happier in the fly and worm,\u2014\nWhen elements to elements conform,\nAnd dust is as it should be, shall I not\nFeel all I see, less dazzling, but more warm?\nThe bodiless thought? the Spirit of each spot?\nOf which, even now, I share at times the immortal lot?\n\nLXXV.\n\nAre not the mountains, waves, and skies a part\nOf me and of my soul, as I of them?\nIs not the love of these deep in my heart\nWith a pure passion? should I not contemn\nAll objects, if compared with these? and stem\nA tide of suffering, rather than forego\nSuch feelings for the hard and worldly phlegm\nOf those whose eyes are only turned below,\nGazing upon the ground, with thoughts which dare not glow?\n\nLXXVI.\n\nBut this is not my theme; and I return\nTo that which is immediate, and require\nThose who find contemplation in the urn,\nTo look on One whose dust was once all fire,\nA native of the land where I respire\nThe clear air for awhile\u2014a passing guest,\nWhere he became a being,\u2014whose desire\nWas to be glorious; 'twas a foolish quest,\nThe which to gain and keep he sacrificed all rest.\n\nLXXVII.\n\nHere the self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau,\nThe apostle of affliction, he who threw\nEnchantment over passion, and from woe\nWrung overwhelming eloquence, first drew\nThe breath which made him wretched; yet he knew\nHow to make madness beautiful, and cast\nO'er erring deeds and thoughts a heavenly hue\nOf words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they past\nThe eyes, which o'er them shed tears feelingly and fast.\n\nLXXVIII.\n\nHis love was passion's essence\u2014as a tree\nOn fire by lightning; with ethereal flame\nKindled he was, and blasted; for to be\nThus, and enamoured, were in him the same.\nBut his was not the love of living dame,\nNor of the dead who rise upon our dreams,\nBut of Ideal beauty, which became\nIn him existence, and o'erflowing teems\nAlong his burning page, distempered though it seems.\n\nLXXIX.\n\nTHIS breathed itself to life in Julie, THIS\nInvested her with all that's wild and sweet;\nThis hallowed, too, the memorable kiss\nWhich every morn his fevered lip would greet,\nFrom hers, who but with friendship his would meet:\nBut to that gentle touch, through brain and breast\nFlashed the thrilled spirit's love-devouring heat;\nIn that absorbing sigh perchance more blest,\nThan vulgar minds may be with all they seek possest.\n\nLXXX.\n\nHis life was one long war with self-sought foes,\nOr friends by him self-banished; for his mind\nHad grown Suspicion's sanctuary, and chose\nFor its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,\n'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.\nBut he was frenzied,\u2014wherefore, who may know?\nSince cause might be which skill could never find;\nBut he was frenzied by disease or woe\nTo that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning show.\n\nLXXXI.\n\nFor then he was inspired, and from him came,\nAs from the Pythian's mystic cave of yore,\nThose oracles which set the world in flame,\nNor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more:\nDid he not this for France, which lay before\nBowed to the inborn tyranny of years?\nBroken and trembling to the yoke she bore,\nTill by the voice of him and his compeers\nRoused up to too much wrath, which follows o'ergrown fears?\n\nLXXXII.\n\nThey made themselves a fearful monument!\nThe wreck of old opinions\u2014things which grew,\nBreathed from the birth of time:  the veil they rent,\nAnd what behind it lay, all earth shall view.\nBut good with ill they also overthrew,\nLeaving but ruins, wherewith to rebuild\nUpon the same foundation, and renew\nDungeons and thrones, which the same hour refilled,\nAs heretofore, because ambition was self-willed.\n\nLXXXIII.\n\nBut this will not endure, nor be endured!\nMankind have felt their strength, and made it felt.\nThey might have used it better, but, allured\nBy their new vigour, sternly have they dealt\nOn one another; Pity ceased to melt\nWith her once natural charities.  But they,\nWho in Oppression's darkness caved had dwelt,\nThey were not eagles, nourished with the day;\nWhat marvel then, at times, if they mistook their prey?\n\nLXXXIV.\n\nWhat deep wounds ever closed without a scar?\nThe heart's bleed longest, and but heal to wear\nThat which disfigures it; and they who war\nWith their own hopes, and have been vanquished, bear\nSilence, but not submission:  in his lair\nFixed Passion holds his breath, until the hour\nWhich shall atone for years; none need despair:\nIt came, it cometh, and will come,\u2014the power\nTo punish or forgive\u2014in ONE we shall be slower.\n\nLXXXV.\n\nClear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,\nWith the wild world I dwelt in, is a thing\nWhich warns me, with its stillness, to forsake\nEarth's troubled waters for a purer spring.\nThis quiet sail is as a noiseless wing\nTo waft me from distraction; once I loved\nTorn ocean's roar, but thy soft murmuring\nSounds sweet as if a sister's voice reproved,\nThat I with stern delights should e'er have been so moved.\n\nLXXXVI.\n\nIt is the hush of night, and all between\nThy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear,\nMellowed and mingling, yet distinctly seen.\nSave darkened Jura, whose capt heights appear\nPrecipitously steep; and drawing near,\nThere breathes a living fragrance from the shore,\nOf flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear\nDrops the light drip of the suspended oar,\nOr chirps the grasshopper one good-night carol more;\n\nLXXXVII.\n\nHe is an evening reveller, who makes\nHis life an infancy, and sings his fill;\nAt intervals, some bird from out the brakes\nStarts into voice a moment, then is still.\nThere seems a floating whisper on the hill,\nBut that is fancy, for the starlight dews\nAll silently their tears of love instil,\nWeeping themselves away, till they infuse\nDeep into Nature's breast the spirit of her hues.\n\nLXXXVIII.\n\nYe stars! which are the poetry of heaven,\nIf in your bright leaves we would read the fate\nOf men and empires,\u2014'tis to be forgiven,\nThat in our aspirations to be great,\nOur destinies o'erleap their mortal state,\nAnd claim a kindred with you; for ye are\nA beauty and a mystery, and create\nIn us such love and reverence from afar,\nThat fortune, fame, power, life, have named themselves a star.\n\nLXXXIX.\n\nAll heaven and earth are still\u2014though not in sleep,\nBut breathless, as we grow when feeling most;\nAnd silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep: \u2014\nAll heaven and earth are still:  from the high host\nOf stars, to the lulled lake and mountain-coast,\nAll is concentered in a life intense,\nWhere not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,\nBut hath a part of being, and a sense\nOf that which is of all Creator and defence.\n\nXC.\n\nThen stirs the feeling infinite, so felt\nIn solitude, where we are LEAST alone;\nA truth, which through our being then doth melt,\nAnd purifies from self:  it is a tone,\nThe soul and source of music, which makes known\nEternal harmony, and sheds a charm,\nLike to the fabled Cytherea's zone,\nBinding all things with beauty;\u2014'twould disarm\nThe spectre Death, had he substantial power to harm.\n\nXCI.\n\nNor vainly did the early Persian make\nHis altar the high places and the peak\nOf earth-o'ergazing mountains, and thus take\nA fit and unwalled temple, there to seek\nThe Spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak,\nUpreared of human hands.  Come, and compare\nColumns and idol-dwellings, Goth or Greek,\nWith Nature's realms of worship, earth and air,\nNor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer!\n\nXCII.\n\nThe sky is changed!\u2014and such a change!  O night,\nAnd storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,\nYet lovely in your strength, as is the light\nOf a dark eye in woman!  Far along,\nFrom peak to peak, the rattling crags among,\nLeaps the live thunder!  Not from one lone cloud,\nBut every mountain now hath found a tongue;\nAnd Jura answers, through her misty shroud,\nBack to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!\n\nXCIII.\n\nAnd this is in the night:\u2014Most glorious night!\nThou wert not sent for slumber! let me be\nA sharer in thy fierce and far delight\u2014\nA portion of the tempest and of thee!\nHow the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,\nAnd the big rain comes dancing to the earth!\nAnd now again 'tis black,\u2014and now, the glee\nOf the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,\nAs if they did rejoice o'er a young earthquake's birth.\n\nXCIV.\n\nNow, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between\nHeights which appear as lovers who have parted\nIn hate, whose mining depths so intervene,\nThat they can meet no more, though broken-hearted;\nThough in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,\nLove was the very root of the fond rage\nWhich blighted their life's bloom, and then departed:\nItself expired, but leaving them an age\nOf years all winters\u2014war within themselves to wage.\n\nXCV.\n\nNow, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,\nThe mightiest of the storms hath ta'en his stand;\nFor here, not one, but many, make their play,\nAnd fling their thunderbolts from hand to hand,\nFlashing and cast around:  of all the band,\nThe brightest through these parted hills hath forked\nHis lightnings, as if he did understand\nThat in such gaps as desolation worked,\nThere the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.\n\nXCVI.\n\nSky, mountains, river, winds, lake, lightnings! ye,\nWith night, and clouds, and thunder, and a soul\nTo make these felt and feeling, well may be\nThings that have made me watchful; the far roll\nOf your departing voices, is the knoll\nOf what in me is sleepless,\u2014if I rest.\nBut where of ye, O tempests! is the goal?\nAre ye like those within the human breast?\nOr do ye find at length, like eagles, some high nest?\n\nXCVII.\n\nCould I embody and unbosom now\nThat which is most within me,\u2014could I wreak\nMy thoughts upon expression, and thus throw\nSoul, heart, mind, passions, feelings, strong or weak,\nAll that I would have sought, and all I seek,\nBear, know, feel, and yet breathe\u2014into one word,\nAnd that one word were lightning, I would speak;\nBut as it is, I live and die unheard,\nWith a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword.\n\nXCVIII.\n\nThe morn is up again, the dewy morn,\nWith breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom,\nLaughing the clouds away with playful scorn,\nAnd living as if earth contained no tomb,\u2014\nAnd glowing into day:  we may resume\nThe march of our existence:  and thus I,\nStill on thy shores, fair Leman! may find room\nAnd food for meditation, nor pass by\nMuch, that may give us pause, if pondered fittingly.\n\nXCIX.\n\nClarens! sweet Clarens! birthplace of deep Love!\nThine air is the young breath of passionate thought;\nThy trees take root in love; the snows above\nThe very glaciers have his colours caught,\nAnd sunset into rose-hues sees them wrought\nBy rays which sleep there lovingly:  the rocks,\nThe permanent crags, tell here of Love, who sought\nIn them a refuge from the worldly shocks,\nWhich stir and sting the soul with hope that woos, then mocks.\n\nC.\n\nClarens! by heavenly feet thy paths are trod,\u2014\nUndying Love's, who here ascends a throne\nTo which the steps are mountains; where the god\nIs a pervading life and light,\u2014so shown\nNot on those summits solely, nor alone\nIn the still cave and forest; o'er the flower\nHis eye is sparkling, and his breath hath blown,\nHis soft and summer breath, whose tender power\nPasses the strength of storms in their most desolate hour.\n\nCI.\n\nAll things are here of HIM; from the black pines,\nWhich are his shade on high, and the loud roar\nOf torrents, where he listeneth, to the vines\nWhich slope his green path downward to the shore,\nWhere the bowed waters meet him, and adore,\nKissing his feet with murmurs; and the wood,\nThe covert of old trees, with trunks all hoar,\nBut light leaves, young as joy, stands where it stood,\nOffering to him, and his, a populous solitude.\n\nCII.\n\nA populous solitude of bees and birds,\nAnd fairy-formed and many coloured things,\nWho worship him with notes more sweet than words,\nAnd innocently open their glad wings,\nFearless and full of life:  the gush of springs,\nAnd fall of lofty fountains, and the bend\nOf stirring branches, and the bud which brings\nThe swiftest thought of beauty, here extend,\nMingling, and made by Love, unto one mighty end.\n\nCIII.\n\nHe who hath loved not, here would learn that lore,\nAnd make his heart a spirit:  he who knows\nThat tender mystery, will love the more,\nFor this is Love's recess, where vain men's woes,\nAnd the world's waste, have driven him far from those,\nFor 'tis his nature to advance or die;\nHe stands not still, but or decays, or grows\nInto a boundless blessing, which may vie\nWith the immortal lights, in its eternity!\n\nCIV.\n\n'Twas not for fiction chose Rousseau this spot,\nPeopling it with affections; but he found\nIt was the scene which passion must allot\nTo the mind's purified beings; 'twas the ground\nWhere early Love his Psyche's zone unbound,\nAnd hallowed it with loveliness:  'tis lone,\nAnd wonderful, and deep, and hath a sound,\nAnd sense, and sight of sweetness; here the Rhone\nHath spread himself a couch, the Alps have reared a throne.\n\nCV.\n\nLausanne! and Ferney! ye have been the abodes\nOf names which unto you bequeathed a name;\nMortals, who sought and found, by dangerous roads,\nA path to perpetuity of fame:\nThey were gigantic minds, and their steep aim\nWas, Titan-like, on daring doubts to pile\nThoughts which should call down thunder, and the flame\nOf Heaven, again assailed, if Heaven the while\nOn man and man's research could deign do more than smile.\n\nCVI.\n\nThe one was fire and fickleness, a child\nMost mutable in wishes, but in mind\nA wit as various,\u2014gay, grave, sage, or wild,\u2014\nHistorian, bard, philosopher combined:\nHe multiplied himself among mankind,\nThe Proteus of their talents:  But his own\nBreathed most in ridicule,\u2014which, as the wind,\nBlew where it listed, laying all things prone,\u2014\nNow to o'erthrow a fool, and now to shake a throne.\n\nCVII.\n\nThe other, deep and slow, exhausting thought,\nAnd hiving wisdom with each studious year,\nIn meditation dwelt, with learning wrought,\nAnd shaped his weapon with an edge severe,\nSapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer;\nThe lord of irony,\u2014that master spell,\nWhich stung his foes to wrath, which grew from fear,\nAnd doomed him to the zealot's ready hell,\nWhich answers to all doubts so eloquently well.\n\nCVIII.\n\nYet, peace be with their ashes,\u2014for by them,\nIf merited, the penalty is paid;\nIt is not ours to judge, far less condemn;\nThe hour must come when such things shall be made\nKnown unto all,\u2014or hope and dread allayed\nBy slumber on one pillow, in the dust,\nWhich, thus much we are sure, must lie decayed;\nAnd when it shall revive, as is our trust,\n'Twill be to be forgiven, or suffer what is just.\n\nCIX.\n\nBut let me quit man's works, again to read\nHis Maker's spread around me, and suspend\nThis page, which from my reveries I feed,\nUntil it seems prolonging without end.\nThe clouds above me to the white Alps tend,\nAnd I must pierce them, and survey whate'er\nMay be permitted, as my steps I bend\nTo their most great and growing region, where\nThe earth to her embrace compels the powers of air.\n\nCX.\n\nItalia! too, Italia! looking on thee\nFull flashes on the soul the light of ages,\nSince the fierce Carthaginian almost won thee,\nTo the last halo of the chiefs and sages\nWho glorify thy consecrated pages;\nThou wert the throne and grave of empires; still,\nThe fount at which the panting mind assuages\nHer thirst of knowledge, quaffing there her fill,\nFlows from the eternal source of Rome's imperial hill.\n\nCXI.\n\nThus far have I proceeded in a theme\nRenewed with no kind auspices:\u2014to feel\nWe are not what we have been, and to deem\nWe are not what we should be, and to steel\nThe heart against itself; and to conceal,\nWith a proud caution, love or hate, or aught,\u2014\nPassion or feeling, purpose, grief, or zeal,\u2014\nWhich is the tyrant spirit of our thought,\nIs a stern task of soul:\u2014No matter,\u2014it is taught.\n\nCXII.\n\nAnd for these words, thus woven into song,\nIt may be that they are a harmless wile,\u2014\nThe colouring of the scenes which fleet along,\nWhich I would seize, in passing, to beguile\nMy breast, or that of others, for a while.\nFame is the thirst of youth,\u2014but I am not\nSo young as to regard men's frown or smile\nAs loss or guerdon of a glorious lot;\nI stood and stand alone,\u2014remembered or forgot.\n\nCXIII.\n\nI have not loved the world, nor the world me;\nI have not flattered its rank breath, nor bowed\nTo its idolatries a patient knee,\u2014\nNor coined my cheek to smiles, nor cried aloud\nIn worship of an echo; in the crowd\nThey could not deem me one of such; I stood\nAmong them, but not of them; in a shroud\nOf thoughts which were not their thoughts, and still could,\nHad I not filed my mind, which thus itself subdued.\n\nCXIV.\n\nI have not loved the world, nor the world me,\u2014\nBut let us part fair foes; I do believe,\nThough I have found them not, that there may be\nWords which are things,\u2014hopes which will not deceive,\nAnd virtues which are merciful, nor weave\nSnares for the falling:  I would also deem\nO'er others' griefs that some sincerely grieve;\nThat two, or one, are almost what they seem,\u2014\nThat goodness is no name, and happiness no dream.\n\nCXV.\n\nMy daughter! with thy name this song begun\u2014\nMy daughter! with thy name this much shall end\u2014\nI see thee not, I hear thee not,\u2014but none\nCan be so wrapt in thee; thou art the friend\nTo whom the shadows of far years extend:\nAlbeit my brow thou never shouldst behold,\nMy voice shall with thy future visions blend,\nAnd reach into thy heart, when mine is cold,\u2014\nA token and a tone, even from thy father's mould.\n\nCXVI.\n\nTo aid thy mind's development,\u2014to watch\nThy dawn of little joys,\u2014to sit and see\nAlmost thy very growth,\u2014to view thee catch\nKnowledge of objects, wonders yet to thee!\nTo hold thee lightly on a gentle knee,\nAnd print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss,\u2014\nThis, it should seem, was not reserved for me\nYet this was in my nature:\u2014As it is,\nI know not what is there, yet something like to this.\n\nCXVII.\n\nYet, though dull Hate as duty should be taught,\nI know that thou wilt love me; though my name\nShould be shut from thee, as a spell still fraught\nWith desolation, and a broken claim:\nThough the grave closed between us,\u2014'twere the same,\nI know that thou wilt love me:  though to drain\nMY blood from out thy being were an aim,\nAnd an attainment,\u2014all would be in vain,\u2014\nStill thou wouldst love me, still that more than life retain.\n\nCXVIII.\n\nThe child of love,\u2014though born in bitterness,\nAnd nurtured in convulsion.  Of thy sire\nThese were the elements, and thine no less.\nAs yet such are around thee; but thy fire\nShall be more tempered, and thy hope far higher.\nSweet be thy cradled slumbers!  O'er the sea,\nAnd from the mountains where I now respire,\nFain would I waft such blessing upon thee,\nAs, with a sigh, I deem thou mightst have been to me!\n\n\n\n\n\nCANTO THE FOURTH.\n\nI.\n\nI stood in Venice, on the Bridge of Sighs;\nA palace and a prison on each hand:\nI saw from out the wave her structures rise\nAs from the stroke of the enchanter's wand:\nA thousand years their cloudy wings expand\nAround me, and a dying glory smiles\nO'er the far times when many a subject land\nLooked to the winged Lion's marble piles,\nWhere Venice sate in state, throned on her hundred isles!\n\nII.\n\nShe looks a sea Cybele, fresh from ocean,\nRising with her tiara of proud towers\nAt airy distance, with majestic motion,\nA ruler of the waters and their powers:\nAnd such she was; her daughters had their dowers\nFrom spoils of nations, and the exhaustless East\nPoured in her lap all gems in sparkling showers.\nIn purple was she robed, and of her feast\nMonarchs partook, and deemed their dignity increased.\n\nIII.\n\nIn Venice, Tasso's echoes are no more,\nAnd silent rows the songless gondolier;\nHer palaces are crumbling to the shore,\nAnd music meets not always now the ear:\nThose days are gone\u2014but beauty still is here.\nStates fall, arts fade\u2014but Nature doth not die,\nNor yet forget how Venice once was dear,\nThe pleasant place of all festivity,\nThe revel of the earth, the masque of Italy!\n\nIV.\n\nBut unto us she hath a spell beyond\nHer name in story, and her long array\nOf mighty shadows, whose dim forms despond\nAbove the dogeless city's vanished sway;\nOurs is a trophy which will not decay\nWith the Rialto; Shylock and the Moor,\nAnd Pierre, cannot be swept or worn away\u2014\nThe keystones of the arch! though all were o'er,\nFor us repeopled were the solitary shore.\n\nV.\n\nThe beings of the mind are not of clay;\nEssentially immortal, they create\nAnd multiply in us a brighter ray\nAnd more beloved existence:  that which Fate\nProhibits to dull life, in this our state\nOf mortal bondage, by these spirits supplied,\nFirst exiles, then replaces what we hate;\nWatering the heart whose early flowers have died,\nAnd with a fresher growth replenishing the void.\n\nVI.\n\nSuch is the refuge of our youth and age,\nThe first from Hope, the last from Vacancy;\nAnd this worn feeling peoples many a page,\nAnd, may be, that which grows beneath mine eye:\nYet there are things whose strong reality\nOutshines our fairy-land; in shape and hues\nMore beautiful than our fantastic sky,\nAnd the strange constellations which the Muse\nO'er her wild universe is skilful to diffuse:\n\nVII.\n\nI saw or dreamed of such,\u2014but let them go\u2014\nThey came like truth, and disappeared like dreams;\nAnd whatsoe'er they were\u2014are now but so;\nI could replace them if I would:  still teems\nMy mind with many a form which aptly seems\nSuch as I sought for, and at moments found;\nLet these too go\u2014for waking reason deems\nSuch overweening phantasies unsound,\nAnd other voices speak, and other sights surround.\n\nVIII.\n\nI've taught me other tongues, and in strange eyes\nHave made me not a stranger; to the mind\nWhich is itself, no changes bring surprise;\nNor is it harsh to make, nor hard to find\nA country with\u2014ay, or without mankind;\nYet was I born where men are proud to be,\nNot without cause; and should I leave behind\nThe inviolate island of the sage and free,\nAnd seek me out a home by a remoter sea,\n\nIX.\n\nPerhaps I loved it well:  and should I lay\nMy ashes in a soil which is not mine,\nMy spirit shall resume it\u2014if we may\nUnbodied choose a sanctuary.  I twine\nMy hopes of being remembered in my line\nWith my land's language:  if too fond and far\nThese aspirations in their scope incline,\u2014\nIf my fame should be, as my fortunes are,\nOf hasty growth and blight, and dull Oblivion bar.\n\nX.\n\nMy name from out the temple where the dead\nAre honoured by the nations\u2014let it be\u2014\nAnd light the laurels on a loftier head!\nAnd be the Spartan's epitaph on me\u2014\n'Sparta hath many a worthier son than he.'\nMeantime I seek no sympathies, nor need;\nThe thorns which I have reaped are of the tree\nI planted,\u2014they have torn me, and I bleed:\nI should have known what fruit would spring from such a seed.\n\nXI.\n\nThe spouseless Adriatic mourns her lord;\nAnd, annual marriage now no more renewed,\nThe Bucentaur lies rotting unrestored,\nNeglected garment of her widowhood!\nSt. Mark yet sees his lion where he stood\nStand, but in mockery of his withered power,\nOver the proud place where an Emperor sued,\nAnd monarchs gazed and envied in the hour\nWhen Venice was a queen with an unequalled dower.\n\nXII.\n\nThe Suabian sued, and now the Austrian reigns\u2014\nAn Emperor tramples where an Emperor knelt;\nKingdoms are shrunk to provinces, and chains\nClank over sceptred cities; nations melt\nFrom power's high pinnacle, when they have felt\nThe sunshine for a while, and downward go\nLike lauwine loosened from the mountain's belt:\nOh for one hour of blind old Dandolo!\nThe octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe.\n\nXIII.\n\nBefore St. Mark still glow his steeds of brass,\nTheir gilded collars glittering in the sun;\nBut is not Doria's menace come to pass?\nAre they not BRIDLED?\u2014Venice, lost and won,\nHer thirteen hundred years of freedom done,\nSinks, like a seaweed, into whence she rose!\nBetter be whelmed beneath the waves, and shun,\nEven in Destruction's depth, her foreign foes,\nFrom whom submission wrings an infamous repose.\n\nXIV.\n\nIn youth she was all glory,\u2014a new Tyre,\u2014\nHer very byword sprung from victory,\nThe 'Planter of the Lion,' which through fire\nAnd blood she bore o'er subject earth and sea;\nThough making many slaves, herself still free\nAnd Europe's bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite:\nWitness Troy's rival, Candia!  Vouch it, ye\nImmortal waves that saw Lepanto's fight!\nFor ye are names no time nor tyranny can blight.\n\nXV.\n\nStatues of glass\u2014all shivered\u2014the long file\nOf her dead doges are declined to dust;\nBut where they dwelt, the vast and sumptuous pile\nBespeaks the pageant of their splendid trust;\nTheir sceptre broken, and their sword in rust,\nHave yielded to the stranger:  empty halls,\nThin streets, and foreign aspects, such as must\nToo oft remind her who and what enthrals,\nHave flung a desolate cloud o'er Venice' lovely walls.\n\nXVI.\n\nWhen Athens' armies fell at Syracuse,\nAnd fettered thousands bore the yoke of war,\nRedemption rose up in the Attic Muse,\nHer voice their only ransom from afar:\nSee! as they chant the tragic hymn, the car\nOf the o'ermastered victor stops, the reins\nFall from his hands\u2014his idle scimitar\nStarts from its belt\u2014he rends his captive's chains,\nAnd bids him thank the bard for freedom and his strains.\n\nXVII.\n\nThus, Venice, if no stronger claim were thine,\nWere all thy proud historic deeds forgot,\nThy choral memory of the bard divine,\nThy love of Tasso, should have cut the knot\nWhich ties thee to thy tyrants; and thy lot\nIs shameful to the nations,\u2014most of all,\nAlbion! to thee:  the Ocean Queen should not\nAbandon Ocean's children; in the fall\nOf Venice think of thine, despite thy watery wall.\n\nXVIII.\n\nI loved her from my boyhood:  she to me\nWas as a fairy city of the heart,\nRising like water-columns from the sea,\nOf joy the sojourn, and of wealth the mart\nAnd Otway, Radcliffe, Schiller, Shakspeare's art,\nHad stamped her image in me, and e'en so,\nAlthough I found her thus, we did not part,\nPerchance e'en dearer in her day of woe,\nThan when she was a boast, a marvel, and a show.\n\nXIX.\n\nI can repeople with the past\u2014and of\nThe present there is still for eye and thought,\nAnd meditation chastened down, enough;\nAnd more, it may be, than I hoped or sought;\nAnd of the happiest moments which were wrought\nWithin the web of my existence, some\nFrom thee, fair Venice! have their colours caught:\nThere are some feelings Time cannot benumb,\nNor torture shake, or mine would now be cold and dumb.\n\nXX.\n\nBut from their nature will the tannen grow\nLoftiest on loftiest and least sheltered rocks,\nRooted in barrenness, where nought below\nOf soil supports them 'gainst the Alpine shocks\nOf eddying storms; yet springs the trunk, and mocks\nThe howling tempest, till its height and frame\nAre worthy of the mountains from whose blocks\nOf bleak, grey granite, into life it came,\nAnd grew a giant tree;\u2014the mind may grow the same.\n\nXXI.\n\nExistence may be borne, and the deep root\nOf life and sufferance make its firm abode\nIn bare and desolate bosoms:  mute\nThe camel labours with the heaviest load,\nAnd the wolf dies in silence.  Not bestowed\nIn vain should such examples be; if they,\nThings of ignoble or of savage mood,\nEndure and shrink not, we of nobler clay\nMay temper it to bear,\u2014it is but for a day.\n\nXXII.\n\nAll suffering doth destroy, or is destroyed,\nEven by the sufferer; and, in each event,\nEnds:\u2014Some, with hope replenished and rebuoyed,\nReturn to whence they came\u2014with like intent,\nAnd weave their web again; some, bowed and bent,\nWax grey and ghastly, withering ere their time,\nAnd perish with the reed on which they leant;\nSome seek devotion, toil, war, good or crime,\nAccording as their souls were formed to sink or climb.\n\nXXIII.\n\nBut ever and anon of griefs subdued\nThere comes a token like a scorpion's sting,\nScarce seen, but with fresh bitterness imbued;\nAnd slight withal may be the things which bring\nBack on the heart the weight which it would fling\nAside for ever:  it may be a sound\u2014\nA tone of music\u2014summer's eve\u2014or spring\u2014\nA flower\u2014the wind\u2014the ocean\u2014which shall wound,\nStriking the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound.\n\nXXIV.\n\nAnd how and why we know not, nor can trace\nHome to its cloud this lightning of the mind,\nBut feel the shock renewed, nor can efface\nThe blight and blackening which it leaves behind,\nWhich out of things familiar, undesigned,\nWhen least we deem of such, calls up to view\nThe spectres whom no exorcism can bind,\u2014\nThe cold\u2014the changed\u2014perchance the dead\u2014anew,\nThe mourned, the loved, the lost\u2014too many!\u2014yet how few!\n\nXXV.\n\nBut my soul wanders; I demand it back\nTo meditate amongst decay, and stand\nA ruin amidst ruins; there to track\nFall'n states and buried greatness, o'er a land\nWhich WAS the mightiest in its old command,\nAnd IS the loveliest, and must ever be\nThe master-mould of Nature's heavenly hand,\nWherein were cast the heroic and the free,\nThe beautiful, the brave\u2014the lords of earth and sea.\n\nXXVI.\n\nThe commonwealth of kings, the men of Rome!\nAnd even since, and now, fair Italy!\nThou art the garden of the world, the home\nOf all Art yields, and Nature can decree;\nEven in thy desert, what is like to thee?\nThy very weeds are beautiful, thy waste\nMore rich than other climes' fertility;\nThy wreck a glory, and thy ruin graced\nWith an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.\n\nXXVII.\n\nThe moon is up, and yet it is not night\u2014\nSunset divides the sky with her\u2014a sea\nOf glory streams along the Alpine height\nOf blue Friuli's mountains; Heaven is free\nFrom clouds, but of all colours seems to be\u2014\nMelted to one vast Iris of the West,\nWhere the day joins the past eternity;\nWhile, on the other hand, meek Dian's crest\nFloats through the azure air\u2014an island of the blest!\n\nXXVIII.\n\nA single star is at her side, and reigns\nWith her o'er half the lovely heaven; but still\nYon sunny sea heaves brightly, and remains\nRolled o'er the peak of the far Rhaetian hill,\nAs Day and Night contending were, until\nNature reclaimed her order:\u2014gently flows\nThe deep-dyed Brenta, where their hues instil\nThe odorous purple of a new-born rose,\nWhich streams upon her stream, and glassed within it glows,\n\nXXIX.\n\nFilled with the face of heaven, which, from afar,\nComes down upon the waters; all its hues,\nFrom the rich sunset to the rising star,\nTheir magical variety diffuse:\nAnd now they change; a paler shadow strews\nIts mantle o'er the mountains; parting day\nDies like the dolphin, whom each pang imbues\nWith a new colour as it gasps away,\nThe last still loveliest, till\u2014'tis gone\u2014and all is grey.\n\nXXX.\n\nThere is a tomb in Arqua;\u2014reared in air,\nPillared in their sarcophagus, repose\nThe bones of Laura's lover:  here repair\nMany familiar with his well-sung woes,\nThe pilgrims of his genius.  He arose\nTo raise a language, and his land reclaim\nFrom the dull yoke of her barbaric foes:\nWatering the tree which bears his lady's name\nWith his melodious tears, he gave himself to fame.\n\nXXXI.\n\nThey keep his dust in Arqua, where he died;\nThe mountain-village where his latter days\nWent down the vale of years; and 'tis their pride\u2014\nAn honest pride\u2014and let it be their praise,\nTo offer to the passing stranger's gaze\nHis mansion and his sepulchre; both plain\nAnd venerably simple, such as raise\nA feeling more accordant with his strain,\nThan if a pyramid formed his monumental fane.\n\nXXXII.\n\nAnd the soft quiet hamlet where he dwelt\nIs one of that complexion which seems made\nFor those who their mortality have felt,\nAnd sought a refuge from their hopes decayed\nIn the deep umbrage of a green hill's shade,\nWhich shows a distant prospect far away\nOf busy cities, now in vain displayed,\nFor they can lure no further; and the ray\nOf a bright sun can make sufficient holiday.\n\nXXXIII.\n\nDeveloping the mountains, leaves, and flowers\nAnd shining in the brawling brook, where-by,\nClear as its current, glide the sauntering hours\nWith a calm languor, which, though to the eye\nIdlesse it seem, hath its morality,\nIf from society we learn to live,\n'Tis solitude should teach us how to die;\nIt hath no flatterers; vanity can give\nNo hollow aid; alone\u2014man with his God must strive:\n\nXXXIV.\n\nOr, it may be, with demons, who impair\nThe strength of better thoughts, and seek their prey\nIn melancholy bosoms, such as were\nOf moody texture from their earliest day,\nAnd loved to dwell in darkness and dismay,\nDeeming themselves predestined to a doom\nWhich is not of the pangs that pass away;\nMaking the sun like blood, the earth a tomb,\nThe tomb a hell, and hell itself a murkier gloom.\n\nXXXV.\n\nFerrara! in thy wide and grass-grown streets,\nWhose symmetry was not for solitude,\nThere seems as 'twere a curse upon the seat's\nOf former sovereigns, and the antique brood\nOf Este, which for many an age made good\nIts strength within thy walls, and was of yore\nPatron or tyrant, as the changing mood\nOf petty power impelled, of those who wore\nThe wreath which Dante's brow alone had worn before.\n\nXXXVI.\n\nAnd Tasso is their glory and their shame.\nHark to his strain! and then survey his cell!\nAnd see how dearly earned Torquato's fame,\nAnd where Alfonso bade his poet dwell.\nThe miserable despot could not quell\nThe insulted mind he sought to quench, and blend\nWith the surrounding maniacs, in the hell\nWhere he had plunged it.

Do I err\nIn deeming such inhabit many a spot?\nThough with them to converse can rarely be our lot.\n\nCLXXVIII.\n\nThere is a pleasure in the pathless woods,\nThere is a rapture on the lonely shore,\nThere is society where none intrudes,\nBy the deep Sea, and music in its roar:\nI love not Man the less, but Nature more,\nFrom these our interviews, in which I steal\nFrom all I may be, or have been before,\nTo mingle with the Universe, and feel\nWhat I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.\n\nCLXXIX.\n\nRoll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean\u2014roll!\nTen thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;\nMan marks the earth with ruin\u2014his control\nStops with the shore;\u2014upon the watery plain\nThe wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain\nA shadow of man's ravage, save his own,\nWhen for a moment, like a drop of rain,\nHe sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,\nWithout a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.\n\nCLXXX.\n\nHis steps are not upon thy paths,\u2014thy fields\nAre not a spoil for him,\u2014thou dost arise\nAnd shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields\nFor earth's destruction thou dost all despise,\nSpurning him from thy bosom to the skies,\nAnd send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray\nAnd howling, to his gods, where haply lies\nHis petty hope in some near port or bay,\nAnd dashest him again to earth:\u2014there let him lay.\n\nCLXXXI.\n\nThe armaments which thunderstrike the walls\nOf rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,\nAnd monarchs tremble in their capitals.\nThe oak leviathans, whose huge ribs make\nTheir clay creator the vain title take\nOf lord of thee, and arbiter of war;\nThese are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,\nThey melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar\nAlike the Armada's pride, or spoils of Trafalgar.\n\nCLXXXII.\n\nThy shores are empires, changed in all save thee\u2014\nAssyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they?\nThy waters washed them power while they were free\nAnd many a tyrant since:  their shores obey\nThe stranger, slave, or savage; their decay\nHas dried up realms to deserts:  not so thou,\nUnchangeable save to thy wild waves' play\u2014\nTime writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow\u2014\nSuch as creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now.\n\nCLXXXIII.\n\nThou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form\nGlasses itself in tempests; in all time,\nCalm or convulsed\u2014in breeze, or gale, or storm,\nIcing the pole, or in the torrid clime\nDark-heaving;\u2014boundless, endless, and sublime\u2014\nThe image of Eternity\u2014the throne\nOf the Invisible; even from out thy slime\nThe monsters of the deep are made; each zone\nObeys thee:  thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.\n\nCLXXXIV.\n\nAnd I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy\nOf youthful sports was on thy breast to be\nBorne like thy bubbles, onward:  from a boy\nI wantoned with thy breakers\u2014they to me\nWere a delight; and if the freshening sea\nMade them a terror\u2014'twas a pleasing fear,\nFor I was as it were a child of thee,\nAnd trusted to thy billows far and near,\nAnd laid my hand upon thy mane\u2014as I do here.\n\nCLXXXV.\n\nMy task is done\u2014my song hath ceased\u2014my theme\nHas died into an echo; it is fit\nThe spell should break of this protracted dream.\nThe torch shall be extinguished which hath lit\nMy midnight lamp\u2014and what is writ, is writ\u2014\nWould it were worthier! but I am not now\nThat which I have been\u2014and my visions flit\nLess palpably before me\u2014and the glow\nWhich in my spirit dwelt is fluttering, faint, and low.\n\nCLXXXVI.\n\nFarewell! a word that must be, and hath been\u2014\nA sound which makes us linger; yet, farewell!\nYe, who have traced the Pilgrim to the scene\nWhich is his last, if in your memories dwell\nA thought which once was his, if on ye swell\nA single recollection, not in vain\nHe wore his sandal-shoon and scallop shell;\nFarewell! with HIM alone may rest the pain,\nIf such there were\u2014with YOU, the moral of his strain.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/1782747", "artist_names": "Leopold von Sacher-Masoch", "full_title": "Venus in Furs by\u00a0Leopold\u00a0von Sacher-Masoch", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b07765570a032551c0291e65a4d844f2.220x220x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b07765570a032551c0291e65a4d844f2.220x220x1.jpg", "id": 1782747, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1651700, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1456872674, "path": "/Leopold-von-sacher-masoch-venus-in-furs-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Leopold-von-sacher-masoch-venus-in-furs-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/b07765570a032551c0291e65a4d844f2.220x220x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b07765570a032551c0291e65a4d844f2.220x220x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 4, "hot": false}, "title": "Venus in Furs", "title_with_featured": "Venus in Furs", "updated_by_human_at": 1512394806, "url": "https://genius.com/Leopold-von-sacher-masoch-venus-in-furs-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/396390", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b07765570a032551c0291e65a4d844f2.220x220x1.jpg", "id": 396390, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/b07765570a032551c0291e65a4d844f2.220x220x1.jpg", "index_character": "l", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Leopold von Sacher-Masoch", "slug": "Leopold-von-sacher-masoch", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Leopold-von-sacher-masoch"}, "artist": "Leopold von Sacher-Masoch", "lyrics": "Venus in Furs LyricsTitle: Venus in Furs\n\nAuthor: Ritter von Leopold Sacher-Masoch\n\nTranslator: Fernanda Savage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVENUS IN FURS\n\n\nOf this book, intended for\nprivate circulation, only\n1225 copies have been\nprinted, and type afterward\ndistributed.\n\n\n\n\nVENUS IN FURS\n\nBy\n\nLEOPOLD VON SACHER-MASOCH\n\n\nTranslated from the German\n\nBy\n\nFERNANDA SAVAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\"But the Almighty Lord hath struck him,\nand hath delivered him into the hands of\na woman.\"_\n\n--The Vulgate, Judith, xvi. 7.\n\n\nMy company was charming.\n\nOpposite me by the massive Renaissance fireplace sat Venus; she was not a casual woman of the half-world, who under this pseudonym wages war against the enemy sex, like Mademoiselle Cleopatra, but the real, true goddess of love.\n\nShe sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire, whose\nreflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes, and from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm them.\n\nHer head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes; it was all I could see of her. She had wrapped her marble-like body in a huge fur, and rolled herself up trembling like a cat.\n\n\"I don't understand it,\" I exclaimed, \"It isn't really cold any\nlonger. For two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather. You must be nervous.\"\n\"Much obliged for your spring,\" she replied with a low stony voice, and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely, twice in succession. \"I really can't stand it here much longer, and I am beginning to understand--\"\n\n\"What, dear lady?\"\n\n\"I am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the un-understandable. All of a sudden I understand the Germanic virtue of woman, and German philosophy, and I am no longer surprised that you of the North do not know how to love, haven't even an idea of what love is.\"\n\n\"But, madame,\" I replied flaring up, \"I surely haven't given you any reason.\"\n\n\"Oh, you--\" The divinity sneezed for the third time, and shrugged her shoulders with inimitable grace. \"That's why I have always been nice to you, and even come to see you now and then, although I catch a cold every time, in spite of all my furs. Do you remember the first time we met?\"\n\n\"How could I forget it,\" I said. \"You wore your abundant hair in\nbrown curls, and you had brown eyes and a red mouth, but I recognized you immediately by the outline of your face and its marble-like pallor--you always wore a violet-blue velvet jacket edged with squirrel-skin.\"\n\n\"You were really in love with the costume, and awfully docile.\"\n\n\"You have taught me what love is. Your serene form of worship let me forget two thousand years.\"\n\n\"And my faithfulness to you was without equal!\"\n\n\"Well, as far as faithfulness goes--\"\n\n\"Ungrateful!\"\n\n\"I will not reproach you with anything. You are a divine woman, but nevertheless a woman, and like every woman cruel in love.\"\n\n\"What you call cruel,\" the goddess of love replied eagerly, \"is\nsimply the element of passion and of natural love, which is woman's nature and makes her give herself where she loves, and makes her love everything, that pleases her.\"\n\n\"Can there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the\nunfaithfulness of the woman he loves?\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" she replied. \"We are faithful as long as we love, but you demand faithfulness of a woman without love, and the giving of herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel there--woman or man? You of\nthe North in general take love too soberly and seriously. You talk\nof duties where there should be only a question of pleasure.\"\n\n\"That is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous, and our\nrelations permanent.\"\n\n\"And yet a restless, always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of\npaganism,\" she interrupted, \"but that love, which is the highest joy,\nwhich is divine simplicity itself, is not for you moderns, you\nchildren of reflection. It works only evil in you. _As soon as you\nwish to be natural, you become common._ To you nature seems something\nhostile; you have made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece, and\nout of me a demon. You can only exorcise and curse me, or slay\nyourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar. And if ever one of\nyou has had the courage to kiss my red mouth, he makes a barefoot\npilgrimage to Rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow\nfrom his withered staff, while under my feet roses, violets, and\nmyrtles spring up every hour, but their fragrance does not agree with\nyou. Stay among your northern fogs and Christian incense; let us\npagans remain under the debris, beneath the lava; do not disinter us.\nPompeii was not built for you, nor our villas, our baths, our temples.\nYou do not require gods. We are chilled in your world.\"\n\nThe beautiful marble woman coughed, and drew the dark sables still\ncloser about her shoulders.\n\n\"Much obliged for the classical lesson,\" I replied, \"but you cannot\ndeny, that man and woman are mortal enemies, in your serene sunlit\nworld as well as in our foggy one. In love there is union into a\nsingle being for a short time only, capable of only one thought, one\nsensation, one will, in order to be then further disunited. And you\nknow this better than I; whichever of the two fails to subjugate will\nsoon feel the feet of the other on his neck--\"\n\n\"And as a rule the man that of the woman,\" cried Madame Venus with\nproud mockery, \"which you know better than I.\"\n\n\"Of course, and that is why I don't have any illusions.\"\n\n\"You mean you are now my slave without illusions, and for that\nreason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy.\"\n\n\"Madame!\"\n\n\"Don't you know me yet? Yes, I am _cruel_--since you take so much\ndelight in that word-and am I not entitled to be so? Man is the one\nwho desires, woman the one who is desired. This is woman's entire but\ndecisive advantage. Through his passion nature has given man into\nwoman's hands, and the woman who does not know how to make him her\nsubject, her slave, her toy, and how to betray him with a smile in the\nend is not wise.\"\n\n\"Exactly your principles,\" I interrupted angrily.\n\n\"They are based on the experience of thousands of years,\" she\nreplied ironically, while her white fingers played over the dark fur.\n\"The more devoted a woman shows herself, the sooner the man sobers\ndown and becomes domineering. The more cruelly she treats him and the\nmore faithless she is, the worse she uses him, the more wantonly she\nplays with him, the less pity she shows him, by so much the more will\nshe increase his desire, be loved, worshipped by him. So it has\nalways been, since the time of Helen and Delilah, down to Catherine\nthe Second and Lola Montez.\"\n\n\"I cannot deny,\" I said, \"that nothing will attract a man more than\nthe picture of a beautiful, passionate, cruel, and despotic woman who\nwantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her\nwhim--\"\n\n\"And in addition wears furs,\" exclaimed the divinity.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I know your predilection.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" I interrupted, \"that, since we last saw each other,\nyou have grown very coquettish.\"\n\n\"In what way, may I ask?\"\n\n\"In that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater\nadvantage than by these dark furs, and that--\"\n\nThe divinity laughed.\n\n\"You are dreaming,\" she cried, \"wake up!\" and she clasped my arm\nwith her marble-white hand. \"Do wake up,\" she repeated raucously with\nthe low register of her voice. I opened my eyes with difficulty.\n\nI saw the hand which shook me, and suddenly it was brown as bronze;\nthe voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who\nstood before me at his full height of nearly six feet.\n\n\"Do get up,\" continued the good fellow, \"it is really disgraceful.\"\n\n\"What is disgraceful?\"\n\n\"To fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides.\" He snuffed\nthe candles which had burned down, and picked up the volume which had\nfallen from my hand, \"with a book by\"--he looked at the title page--\n\"by Hegel. Besides it is high time you were starting for Mr.\nSeverin's who is expecting us for tea.\"\n\n\"A curious dream,\" said Severin when I had finished. He supported\nhis arms on his knees, resting his face in his delicate, finely\nveined hands, and fell to pondering.\n\nI knew that he wouldn't move for a long time, hardly even breathe. This\nactually happened, but I didn't consider his behavior as in any way\nremarkable. I had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly\nthree years, and gotten used to his peculiarities. For it cannot be\ndenied that he was peculiar, although he wasn't quite the dangerous\nmadman that the neighborhood, or indeed the entire district of Kolomea,\nconsidered him to be. I found his personality not only interesting--and\nthat is why many also regarded me a bit mad--but to a degree\nsympathetic. For a Galician nobleman and land-owner, and considering his\nage--he was hardly over thirty--he displayed surprising sobriety, a\ncertain seriousness, even pedantry. He lived according to a minutely\nelaborated, half-philosophical, half-practical system, like clock-work;\nnot this alone, but also by the thermometer, barometer, aerometer,\nhydrometer, Hippocrates, Hufeland, Plato, Kant, Knigge, and Lord\nChesterfield. But at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion, and\ngave the impression of being about to run with his head right through a\nwall. At such times every one preferred to get out of his way.\n\nWhile he remained silent, the fire sang in the chimney and the large\nvenerable samovar sang; and the ancient chair in which I sat rocking\nto and fro smoking my cigar, and the cricket in the old walls sang\ntoo. I let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus, skeletons of\nanimals, stuffed birds, globes, plaster-casts, with which his room\nwas heaped full, until by chance my glance remained fixed on a\npicture which I had seen often enough before. But to-day, under the\nreflected red glow of the fire, it made an indescribable impression\non me.\n\nIt was a large oil painting, done in the robust full-bodied manner\nof the Belgian school. Its subject was strange enough.\n\nA beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face, with abundant\nhair tied into a classical knot, on which white powder lay like a\nsoft hoarfrost, was resting on an ottoman, supported on her left arm.\nShe was nude in her dark furs. Her right hand played with a lash,\nwhile her bare foot rested carelessly on a man, lying before her like\na slave, like a dog. In the sharply outlined, but well-formed\nlinaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate\ndevotion; he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a\nmartyr. This man, the footstool for her feet, was Severin, but\nbeardless, and, it seemed, some ten years younger.\n\n\"_Venus in Furs_,\" I cried, pointing to the picture. \"That is the way\nI saw her in my dream.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" said Severin, \"only I dreamed my dream with open eyes.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"It is a tiresome story.\"\n\n\"Your picture apparently suggested my dream,\" I continued. \"But do\ntell me what it means. I can imagine that it played a role in your\nlife, and perhaps a very decisive one. But the details I can only get\nfrom you.\"\n\n\"Look at its counterpart,\" replied my strange friend, without\nheeding my question.\n\nThe counterpart was an excellent copy of Titian's well-known \"Venus\nwith the Mirror\" in the Dresden Gallery.\n\n\"And what is the significance?\"\n\nSeverin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which\nTitian garbed his goddess of love.\n\n\"It, too, is a 'Venus in Furs,'\" he said with a slight smile. \"I\ndon't believe that the old Venetian had any secondary intention. He\nsimply painted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina, and was\ntactful enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her\nmajestic allure with cold satisfaction. He looks as though his task\nwere becoming burdensome enough. The picture is painted flattery.\nLater an 'expert' in the Rococo period baptized the lady with the\nname of Venus. The furs of the despot in which Titian's fair model\nwrapped herself, probably more for fear of a cold than out of\nmodesty, have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that\nconstitute woman's essence and her beauty.\n\n\"But enough of that. The picture, as it now exists, is a bitter\nsatire on our love. Venus in this abstract North, in this icy\nChristian world, has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch\ncold--\"\n\nSeverin laughed, and lighted a fresh cigarette.\n\nJust then the door opened and an attractive, stoutish, blonde girl\nentered. She had wise, kindly eyes, was dressed in black silk, and\nbrought us cold meat and eggs with our tea. Severin took one of the\nlatter, and decapitated it with his knife.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you that I want them soft-boiled?\" he cried with a\nviolence that made the young woman tremble.\n\n\"But my dear Sevtchu--\" she said timidly.\n\n\"Sevtchu, nothing,\" he yelled, \"you are to obey, obey, do you\nunderstand?\" and he tore the _kantchuk_ [Footnote: A long whip with a\nshort handle.] which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook.\n\nThe woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe.\n\n\"Just wait, I'll get you yet,\" he called after her.\n\n\"But Severin,\" I said placing my hand on his arm, \"how can you treat\na pretty young woman thus?\"\n\n\"Look at the woman,\" he replied, blinking humorously with his eyes.\n\"Had I flattered her, she would have cast the noose around my neck,\nbut now, when I bring her up with the _kantchuk_, she adores me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, nothing, that is the way you have to break in women.\"\n\n\"Well, if you like it, live like a pasha in your harem, but don't\nlay down theories for me--\"\n\n\"Why not,\" he said animatedly. \"Goethe's 'you must be hammer or anvil'\nis absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman.\nDidn't Lady Venus in your dream prove that to you? Woman's power lies\nin man's passion, and she knows how to use it, if man doesn't\nunderstand himself. He has only one choice: to be the _tyrant_ over or\nthe _slave_ of woman. As soon as he gives in, his neck is under the\nyoke, and the lash will soon fall upon him.\"\n\n\"Strange maxims!\"\n\n\"Not maxims, but experiences,\" he replied, nodding his head, \"_I have\nactually felt the lash_. I am cured. Do you care to know how?\"\n\nHe rose, and got a small manuscript from his massive desk, and put\nit in front of me.\n\n\"You have already asked about the picture. I have long owed you an\nexplanation. Here--read!\"\n\nSeverin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me, and seemed\nto dream with open eyes. Silence had fallen again, and again the fire\nsang in the chimney, and the samovar and the cricket in the old\nwalls. I opened the manuscript and read:\n\nCONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN.\n\nThe margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the well-known\nlines from _Faust_:\n\n\"Thou supersensual sensual wooer\nA woman leads you by the nose.\"\n--MEPHISTOPHELES.\n\nI turned the title-page and read: \"What follows has been compiled\nfrom my diary of that period, because it is impossible ever frankly\nto write of one's past, but in this way everything retains its fresh\ncolors, the colors of the present.\"\n\nGogol, the Russian Moliere, says--where? well, somewhere--\"the real\ncomic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down.\"\n\nA wonderful saying.\n\nSo I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down. The\natmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers,\nwhich overcomes me and gives me a headache. The smoke of the\nfireplace curls and condenses into figures, small gray-bearded\nkokolds that mockingly point their finger at me. Chubby-cheeked\ncupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees. I have to smile\ninvoluntarily, even laugh aloud, as I am writing down my adventures.\nYet I am not writing with ordinary ink, but with red blood that drips\nfrom my heart. All its wounds long scarred over have opened and it\nthrobs and hurts, and now and then a tear falls on the paper.\n\nThe days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort.\nYou see no one, and no one sees you. It is boring enough to write idyls.\nI would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings,\nfurnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season, a dozen\nvirtuosos with concertos, trios, and duos, but--what am I saying--the\nupshot of it all is that I don't do much more than to stretch the\ncanvas, smooth the bow, line the scores. For I am--no false modesty,\nFriend Severin; you can lie to others, but you don't quite succeed any\nlonger in lying to yourself--I am nothing but a dilettante, a dilettante\nin painting, in poetry, in music, and several other of the so-called\nunprofitable arts, which, however, at present secure for their masters\nthe income of a cabinet minister, or even that of a minor potentate.\nAbove all else I am a dilettante in life.\n\nUp to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry.\nI never got far beyond the preparation, the plan, the first act, the\nfirst stanza. There are people like that who begin everything, and\nnever finish anything. I am such a one.\n\nBut what am I saying?\n\nTo the business in hand.\n\nI lie in my window, and the miserable little town, which fills me\nwith despondency, really seems infinitely full of poetry. How\nwonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven\nwith golden sunlight; mountain-torrents weave through them like\nribbons of silver! How clear and blue the heavens into which\nsnowcapped crags project; how green and fresh the forested slopes;\nthe meadows on which small herds graze, down to the yellow billows\nof grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again.\n\nThe house in which I live stands in a sort of park, or forest, or\nwilderness, whatever one wants to call it, and is very solitary.\n\nIts sole inhabitants are myself, a widow from Lemberg, and Madame\nTartakovska, who runs the house, a little old woman, who grows older\nand smaller each day. There are also an old dog that limps on one\nleg, and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn. This\nball of yarn, I believe, belongs to the widow.\n\nShe is said to be really beautiful, this widow, still very young,\ntwenty-four at the most, and very rich. She dwells in the first story,\nand I on the ground floor. She always keeps the green blinds drawn, and\nhas a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants. I for my\npart down below have a comfortable, intimate arbor of honeysuckle, in\nwhich I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs. I\ncan look up on the balcony. Sometimes I actually do so, and then from\ntime to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network.\n\nReally the beautiful woman up there doesn't interest me very much, for I\nam in love with someone else, and terribly unhappy at that; far more\nunhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon\nl'Escault, because the object of my adoration is of stone.\n\nIn the garden, in the tiny wilderness, there is a graceful little\nmeadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully. On this meadow is\na stone statue of Venus, the original of which, I believe, is in\nFlorence. This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in\nall my life.\n\nThat, however, does not signify much, for I have seen few beautiful\nwomen, or rather few women at all. In love too, I am a dilettante who\nnever got beyond the preparation, the first act.\n\nBut why talk in superlatives, as if something that is beautiful\ncould be surpassed?\n\nIt is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful. I love her\npassionately with a morbid intensity; madly as one can only love a\nwoman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally\nuniform, eternally calm, stony smile. I literally adore her.\n\nI often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when\nthe sun broods over the forest. Often I visit that cold, cruel\nmistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her, with the\nface pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest, and\nmy prayers go up to her.\n\nThe rising moon, which just now is waning, produces an indescribable\neffect. It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow\nin its gleam of silver. The goddess stands as if transfigured, and\nseems to bathe in the soft moonlight.\n\nOnce when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks\nleading to the house, I suddenly saw a woman's figure, white as\nstone, under the illumination of the moon and separated from me\nmerely by a screen of trees. It seemed as if the beautiful woman of\nmarble had taken pity on me, become alive, and followed me. I was\nseized by a nameless fear, my heart threatened to burst, and instead--\n\nWell, I am a dilettante. As always, I broke down at the second\nstanza; rather, on the contrary, I did not break down, but ran away\nas fast as my legs would carry me.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat an accident! Through a Jew, dealing in photographs I secured a\npicture of my ideal. It is a small reproduction of Titian's \"Venus\nwith the Mirror.\" What a woman! I want to write a poem, but instead,\nI take the reproduction, and write on it: _Venus in Furs_.\n\nYou are cold, while you yourself fan flames. By all means wrap\nyourself in your despotic furs, there is no one to whom they are more\nappropriate, cruel goddess of love and of beauty!--After a while I add\na few verses from Goethe, which I recently found in his paralipomena\nto _Faust_.\n\nTO AMOR\n\n\"The pair of wings a fiction are,\nThe arrows, they are naught but claws,\nThe wreath conceals the little horns,\nFor without any doubt he is\nLike all the gods of ancient Greece\nOnly a devil in disguise.\"\n\nThen I put the picture before me on my table, supporting it with a\nbook, and looked at it.\n\nI was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by\nthe cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms\nin her furs of dark sable; by the severity and hardness which lay in\nthis cold marble-like face. Again I took my pen in hand, and wrote\nthe following words:\n\n\"To love, to be loved, what happiness! And yet how the glamour of\nthis pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a\nwoman who makes a plaything out of us, of being the slave of a\nbeautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot. Even Samson, the\nhero, the giant, again put himself into the hands of Delilah, even\nafter she had betrayed him, and again she betrayed him, and the\nPhilistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very end\nhe kept fixed, drunken with rage and love, upon the beautiful\nbetrayer.\"\n\nI was breakfasting in my honey-suckle arbor, and reading in the Book\nof Judith. I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman\nwho cut off his head with a sword, and because of his beautiful\nsanguinary end.\n\n\"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\nhands of a woman.\"\n\nThis sentence strangely impressed me.\n\nHow ungallant these Jews are, I thought. And their God might choose\nmore becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex.\n\n\"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\nhands of a woman,\" I repeated to myself. What shall I do, so that He\nmay punish me?\n\nHeaven preserve us! Here comes the housekeeper, who has again\ndiminished somewhat in size overnight. And up there among the green\ntwinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again. Is it Venus,\nor the widow?\n\nThis time it happens to be the widow, for Madame Tartakovska makes\na courtesy, and asks me in her name for something to read. I run to\nmy room, and gather together a couple of volumes.\n\nLater I remember that my picture of Venus is in one of them, and now\nit and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there\ntogether. What will she say?\n\nI hear her laugh.\n\nIs she laughing at me?\n\nIt is full moon. It is already peering over the tops of the low\nhemlocks that fringe the park. A silvery exhalation fills the\nterrace, the groups of trees, all the landscape, as far as the eye\ncan reach; in the distance it gradually fades away, like trembling\nwaters.\n\nI cannot resist. I feel a strange urge and call within me. I put on\nmy clothes again and go out into the garden.\n\nSome power draws me toward the meadow, toward her, who is my\ndivinity and my beloved.\n\nThe night is cool. I feel a slight chill. The atmosphere is heavy\nwith the odor of flowers and of the forest. It intoxicates.\n\nWhat solemnity! What music round about! A nightingale sobs. The\nstars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour. The meadow seems\nsmooth, like a mirror, like a covering of ice on a pond.\n\nThe statue of Venus stands out august and luminous.\n\nBut--what has happened? From the marble shoulders of the goddess a\nlarge dark fur flows down to her heels. I stand dumbfounded and stare\nat her in amazement; again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me\nand I take flight.\n\nI hasten my steps, and notice that I have missed the main path. As\nI am about to turn aside into one of the green walks I see Venus\nsitting before me on a stone bench, not the beautiful woman of\nmarble, but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing\npulses. She has actually come to life for me, like the statue that\nbegan to breathe for her creator. Indeed, the miracle is only half\ncompleted. Her white hair seems still to be of stone, and her white\ngown shimmers like moonlight, or is it satin? From her shoulders the\ndark fur flows. But her lips are already reddening and her cheeks\nbegin to take color. Two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fall\nupon me, and now she laughs.\n\nHer laughter is very mysterious, very--I don't know. It cannot be\ndescribed, it takes my breath away. I flee further, and after every\nfew steps I have to pause to take breath. The mocking laughter\npursues me through the dark leafy paths, across light open spaces,\nthrough the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce. I can no\nlonger find my way, I wander about utterly confused, with cold drops\nof perspiration on the forehead.\n\nFinally I stand still, and engage in a short monologue.\n\nIt runs--well--one is either very polite to one's self or very rude.\n\nI say to myself:\n\n\"Donkey!\"\n\nThis word exercises a remarkable effect, like a magic formula, which\nsets me free and makes me master of myself.\n\nI am perfectly quiet in a moment.\n\nWith considerable pleasure I repeat: \"Donkey!\"\n\nNow everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again.\nThere is the fountain, there the alley of box-wood, there the house\nwhich I am slowly approaching.\n\nYet--suddenly the appearance is here again. Behind the green screen\nthrough which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with\nsilver, I again see the white figure, the woman of stone whom I\nadore, whom I fear and flee.\n\nWith a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and\nreflect.\n\nWhat am I really, a little dilettante or a great big donkey?\n\nA sultry morning, the atmosphere is dead, heavily laden with odors,\nyet stimulating. Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor, reading\nin the Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers\ninto beasts. A wonderful picture of antique love.\n\nThere is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my\nbook rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling.\n\nA woman's dress--\n\nShe is there--Venus--but without furs--No, this time it is merely\nthe widow--and yet--Venus-oh, what a woman!\n\nAs she stands there in her light white morning gown, looking at me, her\nslight figure seems full of poetry and grace. She is neither large, nor\nsmall; her head is alluring, piquant--in the sense of the period of the\nFrench marquises--rather than formally beautiful. What enchantment and\nsoftness, what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth! Her\nskin is so infinitely delicate, that the blue veins show through\neverywhere; even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom. How\nabundant her red hair-it is red, not blonde or golden-yellow--how\ndiabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck! Now her eyes\nmeet mine like green lightnings--they are green, these eyes of hers,\nwhose power is so indescribable--green, but as are precious stones, or\ndeep unfathomable mountain lakes.\n\nShe observes my confusion, which has even made me discourteous, for I\nhave remained seated and still have my cap on my head.\n\nShe smiles roguishly.\n\nFinally I rise and bow to her. She comes closer, and bursts out into\na loud, almost childlike laughter. I stammer, as only a little\ndilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasion.\n\nThus our acquaintance began.\n\nThe divinity asks for my name, and mentions her own.\n\nHer name is Wanda von Dunajew.\n\nAnd she is actually my Venus.\n\n\"But madame, what put the idea into your head?\"\n\n\"The little picture in one of your books--\"\n\n\"I had forgotten about it.\"\n\n\"The curious notes on its back--\"\n\n\"Why curious?\"\n\nShe looked at me.\n\n\"I have always wanted to know a real dreamer some time--for the sake\nof the change--and you seem one of the maddest of the tribe.\"\n\n\"Dear lady--in fact--\" Again I fell victim to an odious, asinine\nstammering, and in addition blushed in a way that might have been\nappropriate for a youngster of sixteen, but not for me, who was\nalmost a full ten years older--\n\n\"You were afraid of me last night.\"\n\n\"Really--of course--but won't you sit down?\"\n\nShe sat down, and enjoyed my embarrassment--for actually I was even\nmore afraid of her now in the full light of day. A delightful\nexpression of contempt hovered about her upper lip.\n\n\"You look at love, and especially woman,\" she began, \"as something\nhostile, something against which you put up a defense, even if\nunsuccessfully. You feel that their power over you gives you a\nsensation of pleasurable torture, of pungent cruelty. This is a\ngenuinely modern point of view.\"\n\n\"You don't share it?\"\n\n\"I do not share it,\" she said quickly and decisively, shaking her\nhead, so that her curls flew up like red flames.\n\n\"The ideal which I strive to realize in my life is the serene\nsensuousness of the Greeks--pleasure without pain. I do not believe\nin the kind of love which is preached by Christianity, by the\nmoderns, by the knights of the spirit. Yes, look at me, I am worse\nthan a heretic, I am a pagan.\n\n'Doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel\nWhen in Ida's grove she was pleased with the hero Achilles?'\n\n\"These lines from Goethe's _Roman Elegy_ have always delighted me.\n\n\"In nature there is only the love of the heroic age, 'when gods and\ngoddesses loved.' At that time 'desire followed the glance, enjoyment\ndesire.' All else is factitious, affected, a lie. Christianity, whose\ncruel emblem, the cross, has always had for me an element of the\nmonstrous, brought something alien and hostile into nature and its\ninnocent instincts.\n\n\"The battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern\nman. I do not care to have a share in it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mount Olympus would be the place for you, madame,\" I replied,\n\"but we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity, least of\nall in love. The idea of sharing a woman, even if it were an Aspasia,\nwith another revolts us. We are jealous as is our God. For example,\nwe have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious Phryne.\n\n\"We prefer one of Holbein's meagre, pallid virgins, which is wholly\nours to an antique Venus, no matter how divinely beautiful she is,\nbut who loves Anchises to-day, Paris to-morrow, Adonis the day after.\nAnd if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing,\npassionate devotion to such a woman, her serene joy of life appears\nto us as something demonic and cruel, and we read into our happiness\na sin which we must expiate.\"\n\n\"So you too are one of those who rave about modern women, those\nmiserable hysterical feminine creatures who don't appreciate a real\nman in their somnambulistic search for some dream-man and masculine\nideal. Amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their Christian\nduties; they cheat and are cheated; they always seek again and choose\nand reject; they are never happy, and never give happiness. They\naccuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and\nlive as Helen and Aspasia lived. Nature admits of no permanence in\nthe relation between man and woman.\"\n\n\"But, my dear lady--\"\n\n\"Let me finish. It is only man's egoism which wants to keep woman\nlike some buried treasure. All endeavors to introduce permanence in\nlove, the most changeable thing in this changeable human existence,\nhave gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies, vows, and\nlegalities. Can you deny that our Christian world has given itself\nover to corruption?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But you are about to say, the individual who rebels against the\narrangements of society is ostracized, branded, stoned. So be it. I\nam willing to take the risk; my principles are very pagan. I will\nlive my own life as it pleases me. I am willing to do without your\nhypocritical respect; I prefer to be happy. The inventors of the\nChristian marriage have done well, simultaneously to invent\nimmortality. I, however, have no wish to live eternally. When with\nmy last breath everything as far as Wanda von Dunajew is concerned\ncomes to an end here below, what does it profit me whether my pure\nspirit joins the choirs of angels, or whether my dust goes into the\nformation of new beings? Shall I belong to one man whom I don't love,\nmerely because I have once loved him? No, I do not renounce; I love\neveryone who pleases me, and give happiness to everyone who loves me.\nIs that ugly? No, it is more beautiful by far, than if cruelly I\nenjoy the tortures, which my beauty excites, and virtuously reject\nthe poor fellow who is pining away for me. I am young, rich, and\nbeautiful, and I live serenely for the sake of pleasure and\nenjoyment.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly, and I had taken\nhold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them, but\nbeing a genuine dilettante I hastily let go of them again.\n\n\"Your frankness,\" I said, \"delights me, and not it alone--\"\n\nMy confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were\na rope around my neck.\n\n\"You were about to say--\"\n\n\"I was about to say--I was--I am sorry--I interrupted you.\"\n\n\"How, so?\"\n\nA long pause. She is doubtless engaging in a monologue, which\ntranslated into my language would be comprised in the single word,\n\"donkey.\"\n\n\"If I may ask,\" I finally began, \"how did you arrive at these--these\nconclusions?\"\n\n\"Quite simply, my father was an intelligent man. From my cradle onward\nI was surrounded by replicas of ancient art; at ten years of age I\nread _Gil Blas_, at twelve _La Pucelle_. Where others had\nHop-o'-my-thumb, Bluebeard, Cinderella, as childhood friends, mine\nwere Venus and Apollo, Hercules and Lackoon. My husband's personality\nwas filled with serenity and sunlight. Not even the incurable illness\nwhich fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow.\nOn the very night of his death he took me in his arms, and during the\nmany months when he lay dying in his wheel chair, he often said\njokingly to me: 'Well, have you already picked out a lover?' I blushed\nwith shame. 'Don't deceive me,' he added on one occasion, 'that would\nseem ugly to me, but pick out an attractive lover, or preferably\nseveral. You are a splendid woman, but still half a child, and you\nneed toys.'\n\n\"I suppose, I hardly need tell you that during his life time I had\nno lover; but it was through him that I have become what I am, a\nwoman of Greece.\"\n\n\"A goddess,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"Which one,\" she smiled.\n\n\"Venus.\"\n\nShe threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows. \"Perhaps,\neven a 'Venus in Furs.' Watch out, I have a large, very large fur,\nwith which I could cover you up entirely, and I have a mind to catch\nyou in it as in a net.\"\n\n\"Do you believe,\" I said quickly, for an idea which seemed good, in\nspite of its conventionality and triteness, flashed into my head, \"do\nyou believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the\npresent time, that Venus would be permitted to stray with impunity\namong our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and\nserenity?\"\n\n\"_Undraped_, of course not, but in furs,\" she replied smiling, \"would\nyou care to see mine?\"\n\n\"And then--\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Beautiful, free, serene, and happy human beings, such as the Greeks\nwere, are only possible when it is permitted to have _slaves_ who will\nperform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else\nlabor for them.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied playfully, \"an Olympian divinity, such as\nI am, requires a whole army of slaves. Beware of me!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nI myself was frightened at the hardiness with which I uttered this\n\"why\"; it did not startle her in the least.\n\nShe drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became\nvisible, and then said lightly, as if she were discussing some\ntrifling matter, \"Do you want to be my slave?\"\n\n\"There is no equality in love,\" I replied solemnly. \"Whenever it is\na matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled, it seems much\nmore satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman. But\nwhere shall I find the woman who knows how to rule, calmly, full of\nself-confidence, even harshly, and not seek to gain her power by\nmeans of petty nagging?\"\n\n\"Oh, that might not be so difficult.\"\n\n\"You think--\"\n\n\"I--for instance--\" she laughed and leaned far back--\"I have a real\ntalent for despotism--I also have the necessary furs--but last night\nyou were really seriously afraid of me!\"\n\n\"Quite seriously.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"Now, I am more afraid of you than ever!\"\n\nWe are together every day, I and--Venus; we are together a great\ndeal. We breakfast in my honey-suckle arbor, and have tea in her\nlittle sitting-room. I have an opportunity to unfold all my small,\nvery small talents. Of what use would have been my study of all the\nvarious sciences, my playing at all the arts, if I were unable in the\ncase of a pretty, little woman--\n\nBut this woman is by no means little; in fact she impresses me\ntremendously. I made a drawing of her to-day, and felt particularly\nclearly, how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a\ncameo-head like hers. The configuration of her face has little of the\nRoman, but much of the Greek.\n\nSometimes I should like to paint her as Psyche, and then again as\nAstarte. It depends upon the expression in her eyes, whether it is\nvaguely dreamy, or half-consuming, filled with tired desire.\nShe, however, insists that it be a portrait-likeness.\n\nI shall make her a present of furs.\n\nHow could I have any doubts? If not for her, for whom would princely\nfurs be suitable?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI was with her yesterday evening, reading the _Roman Elegies_ to her.\nThen I laid the book aside, and improvised something for her. She\nseemed pleased; rather more than that, she actually hung upon my\nwords, and her bosom heaved.\n\nOr was I mistaken?\n\nThe rain beat in melancholy fashion on the window-panes, the fire\ncrackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort. I felt quite at home\nwith her, and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman;\nI kissed her hand, and she permitted it.\n\nThen I sat down at her feet and read a short poem I had written for\nher.\n\nVENUS IN FURS.\n\n\"Place thy foot upon thy slave,\nOh thou, half of hell, half of dreams;\nAmong the shadows, dark and grave,\nThy extended body softly gleams.\"\n\nAnd--so on. This time I really got beyond the first stanza. At her\nrequest I gave her the poem in the evening, keeping no copy. And now\nas I am writing this down in my diary I can only remember the first\nstanza.\n\nI am filled with a very curious sensation. I don't believe that I am\nin love with Wanda; I am sure that at our first meeting, I felt\nnothing of the lightning-like flashes of passion. But I feel how her\nextraordinary, really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares\nabout me. It isn't any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me; it\nis a physical subjection, coming on slowly, but for that reason more\nabsolutely.\n\nI suffer under it more and more each day, and she--she merely smiles.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout any provocation she suddenly said to me to-day: \"You\ninterest me. Most men are very commonplace, without verve or poetry.\nIn you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a\ndeep seriousness, which delight me. I might learn to love you.\"\n\nAfter a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow\nand the statue of Venus. All about us the earth steamed; mists rose\nup toward heaven like clouds of incense; a shattered rainbow still\nhovered in the air. The trees were still shedding drops, but sparrows\nand finches were already hopping from twig to twig. They are\ntwittering gaily, as if very much pleased at something. Everything\nis filled with a fresh fragrance. We cannot cross the meadow for it\nis still wet. In the sunlight it looks like a small pool, and the\ngoddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirror-like\nsurface. About her head a swarm of gnats is dancing, which,\nilluminated by the sun, seem to hover above her like an aureole.\n\nWanda is enjoying the lovely scene. As all the benches along the\nwalk are still wet, she supports herself on my arm to rest a while.\nA soft weariness permeates her whole being, her eyes are half closed;\nI feel the touch of her breath on my cheek.\n\nHow I managed to get up courage enough I really don't know, but I\ntook hold of her hand, asking,\n\n\"Could you love me?\"\n\n\"Why not,\" she replied, letting her calm, clear look rest upon me,\nbut not for long.\n\nA moment later I am kneeling before her, pressing my burning face\nagainst the fragrant muslin of her gown.\n\n\"But Severin--this isn't right,\" she cried.\n\nBut I take hold of her little foot, and press my lips upon it.\n\n\"You are getting worse and worse!\" she cried. She tore herself free,\nand fled rapidly toward the house, the while her adorable slipper\nremained in my hand.\n\nIs it an omen?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll day long I didn't dare to go near her. Toward evening as I was\nsitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the\ngreenery of her balcony. \"Why don't you come up?\" he called down\nimpatiently.\n\nI ran upstairs, and at the top lost courage again. I knocked very\nlightly. She didn't say come-in, but opened the door herself, and\nstood on the threshold.\n\n\"Where is my slipper?\"\n\n\"It is--I have--I want,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Get it, and then we will have tea together, and chat.\"\n\nWhen I returned, she was engaged in making tea. I ceremoniously\nplaced the slipper on the table, and stood in the corner like a child\nawaiting punishment.\n\nI noticed that her brows were slightly contracted, and there was an\nexpression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted\nme.\n\nAll of a sudden she broke out laughing.\n\n\"So--you are really in love--with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I suffer more from it than you can imagine?\"\n\n\"You suffer?\" she laughed again.\n\nI was revolted, mortified, annihilated, but all this was quite\nuseless.\n\n\"Why?\" she continued, \"I like you, with all my heart.\"\n\nShe gave me her hand, and looked at me in the friendliest fashion.\n\n\"And will you be my wife?\"\n\nWanda looked at me--how did she look at me? I think first of all\nwith surprise, and then with a tinge of irony.\n\n\"What has given you so much courage, all at once?\"\n\n\"Courage?\"\n\n\"Yes courage, to ask anyone to be your wife, and me in particular?\"\nShe lifted up the slipper. \"Was it through a sudden friendship with\nthis? But joking aside. Do you really wish to marry me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, Severin, that is a serious matter. I believe, you love me,\nand I care for you too, and what is more important each of us finds\nthe other interesting. There is no danger that we would soon get\nbored, but, you know, I am a fickle person, and just for that reason\nI take marriage seriously. If I assume obligations, I want to be able\nto meet them. But I am afraid--no--it would hurt you.\"\n\n\"Please be perfectly frank with me,\" I replied.\n\n\"Well then honestly, I don't believe I could love a man longer than--\"\nShe inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused.\n\n\"A year.\"\n\n\"What do you imagine--a month perhaps.\"\n\n\"Not even me?\"\n\n\"Oh you--perhaps two.\"\n\n\"Two months!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Two months is very long.\"\n\n\"You go beyond antiquity, madame.\"\n\n\"You see, you cannot stand the truth.\"\n\nWanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace,\nwatching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece.\n\n\"What shall I do with you?\" she began anew.\n\n\"Whatever you wish,\" I replied with resignation, \"whatever will give\nyou pleasure.\"\n\n\"How illogical!\" she cried, \"first you want to make me your wife,\nand then you offer yourself to me as something to toy with.\"\n\n\"Wanda--I love you.\"\n\n\"Now we are back to the place where we started. You love me, and\nwant to make me your wife, but I don't want to enter into a new\nmarriage, because I doubt the permanence of both my and your\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"But if I am willing to take the risk with you?\" I replied.\n\n\"But it also depends on whether I am willing to risk it with you,\"\nshe said quietly. \"I can easily imagine belonging to one man for my\nentire life, but he would have to be a whole man, a man who would\ndominate me, who would subjugate me by his inate strength, do you\nunderstand? And every man--I know this very well--as soon as he falls\nin love becomes weak, pliable, ridiculous. He puts himself into the\nwoman's hands, kneels down before her. The only man whom I could love\npermanently would be he before whom I should have to kneel. I've gotten\nto like you so much, however, that I'll try it with you.\"\n\nI fell down at her feet.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, here you are kneeling already,\" she said\nmockingly. \"You are making a good beginning.\" When I had risen again\nshe continued, \"I will give you a year's time to win me, to convince\nme that we are suited to each other, that we might live together. If\nyou succeed, I will become your wife, and a wife, Severin, who will\nconscientiously and strictly perform all her duties. During this year\nwe will live as though we were married--\"\n\nMy blood rose to my head.\n\nIn her eyes too there was a sudden flame--\n\n\"We will live together,\" she continued, \"share our daily life, so that\nwe may find out whether we are really fitted for each other. _I grant\nyou all the rights of a husband, of a lover, of a friend._ Are you\nsatisfied?\"\n\n\"I suppose, I'll have to be?\"\n\n\"You don't have to.\"\n\n\"Well then, I want to--\"\n\n\"Splendid. That is how a man speaks. Here is my hand.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor ten days I have been with her every hour, except at night. All\nthe time I was allowed to look into her eyes, hold her hands, listen\nto what she said, accompany her wherever she went.\n\nMy love seems to me like a deep, bottomless abyss, into which I\nsubside deeper and deeper. There is nothing now which could save me\nfrom it.\n\nThis afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the\nVenus-statue. I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap; she\nwound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess.\n\nSuddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became\nconfused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration. Losing\ncommand over myself, I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips,\nand she--she drew me close to her heaving breast.\n\n\"Are you angry?\" I then asked her.\n\n\"I am never angry at anything that is natural--\" she replied, \"but\n_I_ am afraid you suffer.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am suffering frightfully.\"\n\n\"Poor friend!\" she brushed my disordered hair back from my fore-head. \"I\nhope it isn't through any fault of mine.\"\n\n\"No--\" I replied,--\"and yet my love for you has become a sort of\nmadness. The thought that I might lose you, perhaps actually lose\nyou, torments me day and night.\"\n\n\"But you don't yet possess me,\" said Wanda, and again she looked at\nme with that vibrant, consuming expression, which had already once\nbefore carried me away. Then she rose, and with her small transparent\nhands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head\nof Venus. Half against my will I threw my arm around her body.\n\n\"I can no longer live without you, oh wonderful woman,\" I said.\n\"Believe me, believe only this once, that this time it is not a\nphrase, not a thing of dreams. I feel deep down in my innermost soul,\nthat my life belongs inseparably with yours. If you leave me, I shall\nperish, go to pieces.\"\n\n\"That will hardly be necessary, for I love you,\" she took hold of my\nchin, \"you foolish man!\"\n\n\"But you will be mine only under conditions, while I belong to you\nunconditionally--\"\n\n\"That isn't wise, Severin,\" she replied almost with a start. \"Don't\nyou know me yet, do you absolutely refuse to know me? I am good when\nI am treated seriously and reasonably, but when you abandon yourself\ntoo absolutely to me, I grow arrogant--\"\n\n\"So be it, be arrogant, be despotic,\" I cried in the fulness of\nexaltation, \"only be mine, mine forever.\" I lay at her feet,\nembracing her knees.\n\n\"Things will end badly, my friend,\" she said soberly, without moving.\n\n\"It shall never end,\" I cried excitedly, almost violently. \"Only death\nshall part us. If you cannot be mine, all mine and for always, then _I\nwant to be your slave_, serve you, suffer everything from you, if only\nyou won't drive me away.\"\n\n\"Calm yourself,\" she said, bending down and kissing my forehead, \"I\nam really very fond of you, but your way is not the way to win and\nhold me.\"\n\n\"I want to do everything, absolutely everything, that you want, only\nnot to lose you,\" I cried, \"only not that, I cannot bear the thought.\"\n\n\"Do get up.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"You are a strange person,\" continued Wanda. \"You wish to possess me\nat any price?\"\n\n\"Yes, at any price.\"\n\n\"But of what value, for instance, would that be?\"--She pondered; a\nlurking uncanny expression entered her eyes--\"If I no longer loved\nyou, if I belonged to another.\"\n\nA shudder ran through me. I looked at her She stood firmly and\nconfident before me, and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam.\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"the very thought frightens you.\" A\nbeautiful smile suddenly illuminated her face.\n\n\"I feel a perfect horror, when I imagine, that the woman I love and\nwho has responded to my love could give herself to another regardless\nof me. But have I still a choice? If I love such a woman, even unto\nmadness, shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake\nof a bit of boastful strength; shall I send a bullet through my\nbrains? I have two ideals of woman. If I cannot obtain the one that\nis noble and simple, the woman who will faithfully and truly share\nmy life, well then I don't want anything half-way or lukewarm. Then\nI would rather be subject to a woman without virtue, fidelity, or pity.\nSuch a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal. If\nI am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love, fully and wholly,\nI want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs; I want to\nbe maltreated and betrayed by the woman I love, and the more cruelly\nthe better. This too is a luxury.\"\n\n\"Have you lost your senses,\" cried Wanda.\n\n\"I love you with all my soul,\" I continued, \"with all my senses, and\nyour presence and personality are absolutely essential to me, if I\nam to go on living. Choose between my ideals. Do with me what you will,\nmake of me your husband or your slave.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Wanda, contracting her small but strongly arched\nbrows, \"it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man,\nwho interests me and loves me, completely in my power; at least I\nshall not lack pastime. You were imprudent enough to leave the choice\nto me. Therefore I choose; I want you to be my slave, I shall make\na plaything for myself out of you!\"\n\n\"Oh, please do,\" I cried half-shuddering, half-enraptured. \"If the\nfoundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement, it is\nlikewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites. We\nare such opposites, almost enemies. That is why my love is part hate,\npart fear. In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other\nanvil. I wish to be the anvil. I cannot be happy when I look down\nupon the woman I love. I want to adore a woman, and this I can only\ndo when she is cruel towards me.\"\n\n\"But, Severin,\" replied Wanda, almost angrily, \"do you believe me\ncapable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do, and whom I love?\"\n\n\"Why not, if I adore you the more on this account? _It is possible to\nlove really only that which stands above us,_ a woman, who through her\nbeauty, temperament, intelligence, and strength of will subjugates us\nand becomes a despot over us.\"\n\n\"Then that which repels others, attracts you.\"\n\n\"Yes. That is the strange part of me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, after all, there isn't anything so very unique or strange\nin all your passions, for who doesn't love beautiful furs? And\neveryone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are\nrelated.\"\n\n\"But in my case all these elements are raised to their highest\ndegree,\" I replied.\n\n\"In other words, reason has little power over you, and you are by\nnature, soft, sensual, yielding.\"\n\n\"Were the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature?\"\n\n\"The martyrs?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, they were _supersensual men,_ who found enjoyment in\nsuffering. They sought out the most frightful tortures, even death\nitself, as others seek joy, and as they were, so am I--_supersensual.\"_\n\n\"Have a care that in being such, you do not become a martyr to love,\nthe _martyr of a woman_.\"\n\nWe are sitting on Wanda's little balcony in the mellow fragrant\nsummer night. A twofold roof is above us, first the green ceiling of\nclimbing-plants, and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable\nstars. The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park. I am\nsitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity, and am telling her\nof my childhood.\n\n\"And even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked\nin you?\" asked Wanda.\n\n\"Of course, I can't remember a time when I didn't have them. Even in\nmy cradle, so mother has told me, I was _supersensual._ I scorned the\nhealthy breast of my nurse, and had to be brought up on goats' milk.\nAs a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women, which really was\nonly an expression of an inordinate interest in them. I was oppressed\nby the gray arches and half-darknesses of the church, and actually\nafraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints. Secretly,\nhowever, I sneaked as to a secret joy to a plaster-Venus which stood\nin my father's little library. I kneeled down before her, and to her I\nsaid the prayers I had been taught--the Paternoster, the Ave Maria,\nand the Credo.\n\n\"Once at night I left my bed to visit her. The sickle of the moon\nwas my light and showed me the goddess in a pale-blue cold light. I\nprostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet, as I had seen\nour peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead Savior.\n\n\"An irresistible yearning seized me.\n\n\"I got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold\nlips. A deep shudder fell upon me and I fled, and later in a dream,\nit seemed to me, as if the goddess stood beside my bed, threatening\nme with up-raised arm.\n\n\"I was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium. I\npassionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world\nof antiquity accessible to me. Soon I was more familiar with the gods\nof Greece than with the religion of Jesus. I was with Paris when he\ngave the fateful apple to Venus, I saw Troy burn, and followed\nUlysses on his wanderings. The prototypes of all that is beautiful\nsank deep into my soul, and consequently at the time when other boys\nare coarse and obscene, I displayed an insurmountable aversion to\neverything base, vulgar, unbeautiful.\n\n\"To me, the maturing youth, love for women seemed something\nespecially base and unbeautiful, for it showed itself to me first in\nall its commonness. I avoided all contact with the fair sex; in\nshort, I was supersensual to madness.\n\n\"When I was about fourteen my mother had a charming chamber-maid,\nyoung, attractive, with a figure just budding into womanhood. I was\nsitting one day studying my Tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the\nvirtues of the ancient Teutons, while she was sweeping my room.\nSuddenly she stopped, bent down over me, in the meantime holding fast\nto the broom, and a pair of fresh, full, adorable lips touched mine.\nThe kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder,\nbut I raised up my _Germania_, like a shield against the temptress,\nand indignantly left the room.\"\n\nWanda broke out in loud laughter. \"It would, indeed, be hard to find\nanother man like you, but continue.\"\n\n\"There is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period,\"\nI continued my story. \"Countess Sobol, a distant aunt of mine, was\nvisiting my parents. She was a beautiful majestic woman with an\nattractive smile. I, however, hated her, for she was regarded by the\nfamily as a sort of Messalina. My behavior toward her was as rude,\nmalicious, and awkward as possible.\n\n\"One day my parents drove to the capital of the district. My aunt\ndetermined to take advantage of their absence, and to exercise\njudgment over me. She entered unexpectedly in her fur-lined\n_kazabaika,_ [Footnote: A woman's jacket.] followed by the cook,\nkitchen-maid, and the cat of a chamber-maid whom I had scorned.\nWithout asking any questions, they seized me and bound me hand and\nfoot, in spite of my violent resistance. Then my aunt, with an evil\nsmile, rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switch.\nShe whipped so hard that the blood flowed, and that, at last,\nnotwithstanding my heroic spirit, I cried and wept and begged for\nmercy. She then had me untied, but I had to get down on my knees and\nthank her for the punishment and kiss her hand.\n\n\"Now you understand the supersensual fool! Under the lash of a\nbeautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman. In her\nfur-jacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen, and from then on\nmy aunt became the most desirable woman on God's earth.\n\n\"My Cato-like austerity, my shyness before woman, was nothing but an\nexcessive feeling for beauty. In my imagination sensuality became a\nsort of cult. I took an oath to myself that I would not squander its\nholy wealth upon any ordinary person, but I would reserve it for an\nideal woman, if possible for the goddess of love herself.\n\n\"I went to the university at a very early age. It was in the capital\nwhere my aunt lived. My room looked at that time like Doctor\nFaustus's. Everything in it was in a wild confusion. There were huge\nclosets stuffed full of books, which I bought for a song from a\nJewish dealer on the Servanica; [Footnote: The street of the Jews in\nLemberg.] there were globes, atlases, flasks, charts of the heavens,\nskeletons of animals, skulls, the busts of eminent men. It looked as\nthough Mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the huge\ngreen store as a wandering scholiast at any moment.\n\n\"I studied everything in a jumble without system, without selection:\nchemistry, alchemy, history, astronomy, philosophy, law, anatomy, and\nliterature; I read Homer, Virgil, Ossian, Schiller, Goethe,\nShakespeare, Cervantes, Voltaire, Moliere, the Koran, the Kosmos,\nCasanova's Memoirs. I grew more confused each day, more fantastical,\nmore supersensual. All the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my\nimagination. Every so and so often she appeared before me like a\nvision among my leather-bound books and dead bones, lying on a bed of\nroses, surrounded by cupids. Sometimes she appeared gowned like the\nOlympians with the stern white face of the plaster Venus; sometimes in\nbraids of a rich brown, blue-eyes, in my aunt's red velvet\n_kazabaika,_ trimmed with ermine.\n\n\"One morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my\nimagination in all her smiling beauty, I went to see Countess Sobol,\nwho received me in a friendly, even cordial manner. She gave me a\nkiss of welcome, which put all my senses in a turmoil. She was\nprobably about forty years old, but like most well-preserved women\nof the world, still very attractive. She wore as always her fur-edged\njacket. This time it was one of green velvet with brown marten. But\nnothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time was\nnow discernable.\n\n\"On the contrary, there was so little of cruelty in her that without\nany more ado she let me adore her.\n\n\"Only too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocence,\nand it pleased her to make me happy. As for myself--I was as happy\nas a young god. What rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her\non my knees, and to kiss her hands, those with which she had scourged\nme! What marvellous hands they were, of beautiful form, delicate,\nrounded, and white, with adorable dimples! I really was in love with\nher hands only. I played with them, let them submerge and emerge in\nthe dark fur, held them against the light, and was unable to satiate\nmy eyes with them.\"\n\nWanda involuntarily looked at her hand; I noticed it, and had to\nsmile.\n\n\"From the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those\ndays you can see that I was in love only with the cruel lashes I\nreceived from my aunt; and about two years later when I paid court\nto a young actress only in the roles she played. Still later I became\nthe admirer of a respectable woman. She acted the part of\nirreproachable virtue, only in the end to betray me with a rich Jew.\nYou see, it is because I was betrayed, sold, by a woman who feigned\nthe strictest principles and the highest ideals, that I hate that\nsort of poetical, sentimental virtue so intensely. Give me rather a\nwoman who is honest enough to say to me: I am a Pompadour, a Lucretia\nBorgia, and I am ready to adore her.\"\n\nWanda rose and opened the window.\n\n\"You have a curious way of arousing one's imagination, stimulating\nall one's nerves, and making one's pulses beat faster. You put an\naureole on vice, provided only if it is honest. Your ideal is a\ndaring courtesan of genius. Oh, you are the kind of man who will\ncorrupt a woman to her very last fiber.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the middle of the night there was a knock at my window; I got up,\nopened it, and was startled. Without stood \"Venus in Furs,\" just as\nshe had appeared to me the first time.\n\n\"You have disturbed me with your stories; I have been tossing about\nin bed, and can't go to sleep,\" she said. \"Now come and stay with me.\"\n\n\"In a moment.\"\n\nAs I entered Wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had\nkindled a small fire.\n\n\"Autumn is coming,\" she began, \"the nights are really quite cold\nalready. I am afraid you may not like it, but I can't put off my furs\nuntil the room is sufficiently warm.\"\n\n\"Not like it--you are joking--you know--\" I threw my arm around her,\nand kissed her.\n\n\"Of course, I know, but why this great fondness for furs?\"\n\n\"I was born with it,\" I replied. \"I already had it as a child.\nFurthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized\nnatures. This is due both to general and natural laws. It is a\nphysical stimulus which sets you tingling, and no one can wholly\nescape it. Science has recently shown a certain relationship between\nelectricity and warmth; at any rate, their effects upon the human\norganism are related. The torrid zone produces more passionate\ncharacters, a heated atmosphere stimulation. Likewise with\nelectricity. This is the reason why the presence of cats exercises\nsuch a magic influence upon highly-organized men of intellect. This\nis why these long-tailed Graces of the animal kingdom, these\nadorable, scintillating electric batteries have been the favorite\nanimal of a Mahommed, Cardinal Richelieu, Crebillon, Rousseau,\nWieland.\"\n\n\"A woman wearing furs, then,\" cried Wanda, \"is nothing else than a\nlarge cat, an augmented electric battery?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied. \"That is my explanation of the symbolic\nmeaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty.\nMonarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in\nthis sense for their costume, exclusively; great painters used it\nonly for queenly beauty. The most beautiful frame, which Raphael\ncould find for the divine forms of Fornarina and Titian for the\nroseate body of his beloved, was dark furs.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the learned discourse on love,\" said Wanda, \"but you\nhaven't told me everything. You associate something entirely\nindividual with furs.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I cried. \"I have repeatedly told you that suffering has\na peculiar attraction for me. Nothing can intensify my passion more\nthan tyranny, cruelty, and especially the faithlessness of a\nbeautiful woman. And I cannot imagine this woman, this strange ideal\nderived from an aesthetics of ugliness, this soul of Nero in the body\nof a Phryne, except in furs.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Wanda interrupted. \"It gives a dominant and imposing\nquality to a woman.\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" I continued. \"You know I am _supersensual._ With me\neverything has its roots in the imagination, and thence it receives\nits nourishment. I was already pre-maturely developed and highly\nsensitive, when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs\nfell into my hands. I remember reading with a kind of horror, which\nreally was rapture, of how they pined in prisons, were laid on the\ngridiron, pierced with arrows, boiled in pitch, thrown to wild\nanimals, nailed to the cross, and suffered the most horrible torment\nwith a kind of joy. To suffer and endure cruel torture from then on\nseemed to me exquisite delight, especially when it was inflicted by a\nbeautiful woman, for ever since I can remember all poetry and\neverything demonic was for me concentrated in woman. I literally\ncarried the idea into a sort of cult.\n\n\"I felt there was something sacred in sex; in fact, it was the only\nsacred thing. In woman and her beauty I saw something divine, because\nthe most important function of existence--the continuation of the\nspecies--is her vocation. To me woman represented a personification of\nnature, _Isis_, and man was her priest, her slave. In contrast to him\nshe was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served\nher purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it. To him her\ncruelties, even death itself, still were sensual raptures.\n\n\"I envied King Gunther whom the mighty Brunhilde fettered on the\nbridal night, and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress\nhad sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game. I\nenvied the Knight Ctirad whom the daring Amazon Scharka craftily\nensnared in a forest near Prague, and carried to her castle Divin,\nwhere, after having amused herself a while with him, she had him\nbroken on the wheel--\"\n\n\"Disgusting,\" cried Wanda. \"I almost wish you might fall into the\nhands of a woman of their savage race. In the wolf's skin, under the\nteeth of the dogs, or upon the wheel, you would lose the taste for\nyour kind of poetry.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? I hardly do.\"\n\n\"Have you actually lost your senses.\"\n\n\"Possibly. But let me go on. I developed a perfect passion for\nreading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described. I\nloved especially to look at pictures and prints which represented\nthem. All the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne; the\ninquisitors who had the heretics tortured, roasted, and butchered;\nall the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustful,\nbeautiful, and violent women like Libussa, Lucretia Borgia, Agnes of\nHungary, Queen Margot, Isabeau, the Sultana Roxolane, the Russian\nCzarinas of last century--all these I saw in furs or in robes\nbordered with ermine.\"\n\n\"And so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you,\" said Wanda, and\nsimultaneously she began to drape her magnificent fur-cloak\ncoquettishly about her, so that the dark shining sable played\nbeautifully around her bust and arms. \"Well, how do you feel now,\nhalf broken on the wheel?\"\n\nHer piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking\nsatisfaction. Overcome by desire, I flung myself down before her, and\nthrew my arms about her.\n\n\"Yes--you have awakened my dearest dream,\" I cried. \"It has slept\nlong enough.\"\n\n\"And this is?\" She put her hand on my neck.\n\nI was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this\nwarm little hand and of her regard, which, tenderly searching, fell\nupon me through her half-closed lids.\n\n_\"To be the slave of a woman, a beautiful woman, whom I love, whom\nI worship.\"_\n\n\"And who on that account maltreats you,\" interrupted Wanda, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, who fetters me and whips me, treads me underfoot, the while\nshe gives herself to another.\"\n\n\"And who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of\nyou to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must\nmeet him face to face, who will turn you over to his absolute mercy.\nWhy not? This final tableau doesn't please you so well?\"\n\nI looked at Wanda frightened.\n\n\"You surpass my dreams.\"\n\n\"Yes, we women are inventive,\" she said, \"take heed, when you find\nyour ideal, it might easily happen, that she will treat you more\ncruelly than you anticipate.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I have already found my ideal!\" I exclaimed,\nburying my burning face in her lap.\n\n\"Not I?\" exclaimed Wanda, throwing off her furs and moving about the\nroom laughing. She was still laughing as I went downstairs, and when\nI stood musing in the yard, I still heard her peals of laughter above.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you really then expect me to embody your ideal?\" Wanda asked\narchly, when we met in the park to-day.\n\nAt first I could find no answer. The most antagonistic emotions were\nbattling within me. In the meantime she sat down on one of the\nstone-benches, and played with a flower.\n\n\"Well--am I?\"\n\nI kneeled down and seized her hands.\n\n\"Once more I beg you to become my wife, my true and loyal wife; if\nyou can't do that then become the embodiment of my ideal, absolutely,\nwithout reservation, without softness.\"\n\n\"You know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand, if\nyou prove to be the man I am seeking,\" Wanda replied very seriously,\n\"but I think you would be more grateful to me if through me you\nrealized your imaginings. Well, which do you prefer?\"\n\n\"I believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in\nyour personality.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" I continued, \"that you enjoy having a man wholly in\nyour power, torturing him--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she exclaimed quickly, \"or perhaps--.\" She pondered.\n\n\"I don't understand myself any longer,\" she continued, \"but I have\na confession to make to you. You have corrupted my imagination and\ninflamed my blood. I am beginning to like the things you speak of.\nThe enthusiasm with which you speak of a Pompadour, a Catherine the\nSecond, and all the other selfish, frivolous, cruel women, carries\nme away and takes hold of my soul. It urges me on to become like those\nwomen, who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during\ntheir lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their graves.\n\n\"You will end by making of me a despot in miniature, a domestic\nPompadour.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" I said in agitation, \"if all this is inherent in you,\ngive way to this trend of your nature. Nothing half-way. If you can't\nbe a true and loyal wife to me, be a demon.\"\n\nI was nervous from loss of sleep, and the proximity of the beautiful\nwoman affected me like a fever. I no longer recall what I said, but\nI remember that I kissed her feet, and finally raised her foot and\nput my neck under it. She withdrew it quickly, and rose almost angrily.\n\n\"If you love me, Severin,\" she said quickly, and her voice sounded\nsharp and commanding, \"never speak to me of those things again.\nUnderstand, never! Otherwise I might really--\" She smiled and sat\ndown again.\n\n\"I am entirely serious,\" I exclaimed, half-raving. \"I adore you so\ninfinitely that I am willing to suffer anything from you, for the\nsake of spending my whole life near you.\"\n\n\"Severin, once more I warn you.\"\n\n\"Your warning is vain. Do with me what you will, as long as you\ndon't drive me away.\"\n\n\"Severin,\" replied Wanda, \"I am a frivolous young woman; it is\ndangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power. You will\nend by actually becoming a plaything to me. Who will give warrant\nthat I shall not abuse your insane desire?\"\n\n\"Your own nobility of character.\"\n\n\"Power makes people over-bearing.\"\n\n\"Be it,\" I cried, \"tread me underfoot.\"\n\nWanda threw her arms around my neck, looked into my eyes, and shook\nher head.\n\n\"I am afraid I can't, but I will try, for your sake, for I love you\nSeverin, as I have loved no other man.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl, and I had to go shopping\nwith her. She looked at whips, long whips with a short handle, the\nkind that are used on dogs.\n\n\"Are these satisfactory?\" said the shopkeeper.\n\n\"No, they are much too small,\" replied Wanda, with a side-glance at\nme. \"I need a large--\"\n\n\"For a bull-dog, I suppose?\" opined the merchant.\n\n\"Yes,\" she exclaimed, \"of the kind that are used in Russia for\nintractable slaves.\"\n\nShe looked further and finally selected a whip, at whose sight I\nfelt a strange creeping sensation.\n\n\"Now good-by, Severin,\" she said. \"I have some other purchases to\nmake, but you can't go along.\"\n\nI left her and took a walk. On the way back I saw Wanda coming out\nat a furrier's. She beckoned me.\n\n\"Consider it well,\" she began in good spirits, \"I have never made a\nsecret of how deeply your serious, dreamy character has fascinated\nme. The idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power, actually\nlying enraptured at my feet, of course, stimulates me--but will this\nattraction last? Woman loves a man; she maltreats a slave, and ends\nby kicking him aside.\"\n\n\"Very well then, kick me aside,\" I replied, \"when you are tired of\nme. I want to be your slave.\"\n\n\"Dangerous forces lie within me,\" said Wanda, after we had gone a\nfew steps further. \"You awaken them, and not to your advantage. You\nknow how to paint pleasure, cruelty, arrogance in glowing colors.\nWhat would you say should I try my hand at them, and make you the\nfirst object of my experiments. I would be like Dionysius who had the\ninventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his\nwails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox.\n\n\"Perhaps I am a female Dionysius?\"\n\n\"Be it,\" I exclaimed, \"and my dreams will be fulfilled. I am yours\nfor good or evil, choose. The destiny that lies concealed within my\nbreast drives me on--demoniacally--relentlessly.\"\n\n\"My Beloved,\n\nI do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow, and not until evening\nthe day after tomorrow, and then _as my slave_.\n\nYour mistress\n\nWanda.\"\n\n\"As my slave\" was underlined. I read the note which I received early\nin the morning a second time. Then I had a donkey saddled, an animal\nsymbolic of learned professors, and rode into the mountains. I wanted\nto numb my desire, my yearning, with the magnificent scenery of the\nCarpathians. I am back, tired, hungry, thirsty, and more in love than\never. I quickly change my clothes, and a few moments later knock at\nher door.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nI enter. She is standing in the center of the room, dressed in a gown\nof white satin which floods down her body like light. Over it she\nwears a scarlet _kazabaika_, richly edged with ermine. Upon her\npowdered, snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds. She stands with\nher arms folded across her breast, and with her brows contracted.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I run toward her, and am about to throw my arm about her to\nkiss her. She retreats a step, measuring me from top to bottom.\n\n\"Slave!\"\n\n\"Mistress!\" I kneel down, and kiss the hem of her garment.\n\n\"That is as it should be.\"\n\n\"Oh, how beautiful you are.\"\n\n\"Do I please you?\" She stepped before the mirror, and looked at\nherself with proud satisfaction.\n\n\"I shall become mad!\"\n\nHer lower lip twitched derisively, and she looked at me mockingly\nfrom behind half-closed lids.\n\n\"Give me the whip.\"\n\nI looked about the room.\n\n\"No,\" she exclaimed, \"stay as you are, kneeling.\" She went over to\nthe fire-place, took the whip from the mantle-piece, and, watching\nme with a smile, let it hiss through the air; then she slowly rolled\nup the sleeve of her fur-jacket.\n\n\"Marvellous woman!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Silence, slave!\" She suddenly scowled, looked savage, and struck me\nwith the whip. A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me, and\npityingly bent down to me. \"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, half-shyly,\nhalf-timidly.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"and even if you had, pains that come through you\nare a joy. Strike again, if it gives you pleasure.\"\n\n\"But it doesn't give me pleasure.\"\n\nAgain I was seized with that strange intoxication.\n\n\"Whip me,\" I begged, \"whip me without mercy.\"\n\nWanda swung the whip, and hit me twice. \"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Seriously, no?\"\n\n\"Whip me, I beg you, it is a joy to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, because you know very well that it isn't serious,\" she\nreplied, \"because I haven't the heart to hurt you. This brutal game\ngoes against my grain. Were I really the woman who beats her slaves\nyou would be horrified.\"\n\n\"No, Wanda,\" I replied, \"I love you more than myself; I am devoted\nto you for death and life. In all seriousness, you can do with me\nwhatever you will, whatever your caprice suggests.\"\n\n\"Severin!\"\n\n\"Tread me underfoot!\" I exclaimed, and flung myself face to the\nfloor before her.\n\n\"I hate all this play-acting,\" said Wanda impatiently.\n\n\"Well, then maltreat me seriously.\"\n\nAn uncanny pause.\n\n\"Severin, I warn you for the last time,\" began Wanda.\n\n\"If you love me, be cruel towards me,\" I pleaded with upraised eyes.\n\n\"If I love you,\" repeated Wanda. \"Very well!\" She stepped back and\nlooked at me with a sombre smile. _\"Be then my slave, and know what\nit means to be delivered into the hands of a woman.\"_ And at the\nsame moment she gave me a kick.\n\n\"How do you like that, slave?\"\n\nThen she flourished the whip.\n\n\"Get up!\"\n\nI was about to rise.\n\n\"Not that way,\" she commanded, \"on your knees.\"\n\nI obeyed, and she began to apply the lash.\n\nThe blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms. Each one\ncut into my flesh and burned there, but the pains enraptured me. They\ncame from her whom I adored, and for whom I was ready at any hour to\nlay down my life.\n\nShe stopped. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\" she said, \"but enough for\nto-day. I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far\nyour strength goes. I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and\nwrithe beneath my whip, and in hearing your groans and wails; I want\nto go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy, until you\nlose your senses. You have awakened dangerous elements in my being.\nBut now get up.\"\n\nI seized her hand to press it to my lips.\n\n\"What impudence.\"\n\nShe shoved me away with her foot.\n\n\"Out of my sight, slave!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams, I\nawoke. Dawn was just beginning to break.\n\nHow much of what was hovering in my memory was true; what had I\nactually experienced and what had I dreamed? That I had been whipped\nwas certain. I can still feel each blow, and count the burning red\nstripes on my body. And _she_ whipped me. Now I know everything.\n\nMy dream has become truth. How does it make me feel? Am I\ndisappointed in the realization of my dream?\n\nNo, I am merely somewhat tired, but her cruelty has enraptured me.\nOh, how I love her, adore her! All this cannot express in the\nremotest way my feeling for her, my complete devotion to her. What\nhappiness to be her slave!\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe calls to me from her balcony. I hurry upstairs. She is standing\non the threshold, holding out her hand in friendly fashion. \"I am\nashamed of myself,\" she says, while I embrace her, and she hides her\nhead against my breast.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday,\" she said with\nquivering voice, \"I have fulfilled your mad wish, now let us be\nreasonable and happy and love each other, and in a year I will be\nyour wife.\"\n\n\"My mistress,\" I exclaimed, \"and I your slave!\"\n\n\"Not another word of slavery, cruelty, or the whip,\" interrupted\nWanda. \"I shall not grant you any of those favors, none except\nwearing my fur-jacket; come and help me into it.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his\nbolt struck midnight.\n\nI rose, and wanted to leave.\n\nWanda said nothing, but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman.\nShe began to kiss me anew, and this silent language was so\ncomprehensible, so convincing--\n\nAnd it told me more than I dared to understand.\n\nA languid abandonment pervaded Wanda's entire being. What a\nvoluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed\neyes, in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the\nwhite powder, in the red and white satin which crackled about her\nwith every movement, in the swelling ermine of the _kazabaika_\nin which she carelessly nestled.\n\n\"Please,\" I stammered, \"but you will be angry with me.\"\n\n\"Do with me what you will,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Well, then whip me, or I shall go mad.\"\n\n\"Haven't I forbidden you,\" said Wanda sternly, \"but you are\nincorrigible.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so terribly in love.\" I had sunken on my knees, and was\nburying my glowing face in her lap.\n\n\"I really believe,\" said Wanda thoughtfully, \"that your madness is\nnothing but a demonic, unsatisfied sensuality. _Our unnatural way\nof life must generate such illnesses._ Were you less virtuous, you\nwould be completely sane.\"\n\n\"Well then, make me sane,\" I murmured. My hands were running through\nher hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur, which rose\nand fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom, and drove all\nmy senses into confusion.\n\nAnd I kissed her. No, she kissed me savagely, pitilessly, as if she\nwanted to slay me with her kisses. I was as in a delirium, and had\nlong since lost my reason, but now I, too, was breathless. I sought\nto free myself.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.\n\n\"I am suffering agonies.\"\n\n\"You are suffering--\" she broke out into a loud amused laughter.\n\n\"You laugh!\" I moaned, \"have you no idea--\"\n\nShe was serious all of a sudden. She raised my head in her hands,\nand with a violent gesture drew me to her breast.\n\n\"Wanda,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Of course, you enjoy suffering,\" she said, and laughed again, \"but\nwait, I'll bring you to your senses.\"\n\n\"No, I will no longer ask,\" I exclaimed, \"whether you want to belong\nto me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication. I want\nto drain my happiness to the full. You are mine now, and I would\nrather lose you than never to have had you.\"\n\n\"Now you are sensible,\" she said. She kissed me again with her\nmurderous lips. I tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and\nher naked breast surged against mine.\n\nThen my senses left me--\n\nThe first thing I remember is the moment when I saw blood dripping\nfrom my hand, and she asked apathetically: \"Did you scratch me?\"\n\n\"No, I believe, I have bitten you.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as\nsoon as a new person enters.\n\nWe spent marvellous days together; we visited the mountains and\nlakes, we read together, and I completed Wanda's portrait. And how\nwe loved one another, how beautiful her smiling face was!\n\nThen a friend of hers arrived, a divorced woman somewhat older, more\nexperienced, and less scrupulous than Wanda. Her influence is already\nmaking itself felt in every direction.\n\nWanda wrinkles her brows, and displays a certain impatience with me.\n\nHas she ceased loving me?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us.\nHer friend lives with her, and we are never alone. A circle of men\nsurrounds the young women. With my seriousness and melancholy I am\nplaying an absurd role as lover. Wanda treats me like a stranger.\n\nTo-day, while out walking, she staid behind with me. I saw that this\nwas done intentionally, and I rejoiced. But what did she tell me?\n\n\"My friend doesn't understand how I can love you. She doesn't think\nyou either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise. She is\ntelling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous\nlife in the capital, hinting at the advantages to which I could lay\nclaim, the large parties which I would find there, and the\ndistinguished and handsome admirers which I would attract. But of\nwhat use is all this, since it happens that I love you.\"\n\nFor a moment I lost my breath, then I said: \"I have no wish to stand\nin the way of your happiness, Wanda. Do not consider me.\" Then I\nraised my hat, and let her go ahead. She looked at me surprised, but\ndid not answer a syllable.\n\nWhen by chance I happened to be close to her on the way back, she\nsecretly pressed my hand. Her glance was so radiant, so full of\npromised happiness, that in a moment all the torments of these days\nwere forgotten and all their wounds healed.\n\nI now am aware again of how much I love her.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My friend has complained about you,\" said Wanda to-day.\n\n\"Perhaps she feels that I despise her.\"\n\n\"But why do you despise her, you foolish young man?\" exclaimed\nWanda, pulling my ears with both hands.\n\n\"Because she is a hypocrite,\" I said. \"I respect only a woman who is\nactually virtuous, or who openly lives for pleasure's sake.\"\n\n\"Like me, for instance,\" replied Wanda jestingly, \"but you see,\nchild, a woman can only do that in the rarest cases. She can neither\nbe as gaily sensual, nor as spiritually free as man; her state is\nalways a mixture of the sensual and spiritual. Her heart desires to\nenchain man permanently, while she herself is ever subject to the\ndesire for change. The result is a conflict, and thus usually against\nher wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality\nand corrupt her character.\"\n\n\"Certainly that is true,\" I said. \"The transcendental character with\nwhich woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception.\"\n\n\"But the world likewise demands it,\" Wanda interrupted. \"Look at\nthis woman. She has a husband and a lover in Lemberg and has found\na new admirer here. She deceives all three and yet is honored by all\nand respected by the world.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" I exclaimed, \"but she is to leave you alone; she\ntreats you like an article of commerce.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously. \"Every woman\nhas the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions,\nand much is to be said for giving one's self without love or pleasure\nbecause if you do it in cold blood, you can reap profit to best\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"Wanda, what are you saying?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" she said, \"and take note of what I am about to say to you.\n_Never feel secure with the woman you love,_ for there are more\ndangers in woman's nature than you imagine. Women are neither as\n_good_ as their admirers and defenders maintain, nor as _bad_ as their\nenemies make them out to be. _Woman's character is characterlessness._\nThe best woman will momentarily go down into the mire, and the worst\nunexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to\nshame those that despise her. No woman is so good or so bad, but that\nat any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the\nmost divine, of the filthiest as well as of the purest, thoughts,\nemotions, and actions. In spite of all the advances of civilization,\nwoman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature. She has the\nnature of a savage, who is faithful or faithless, magnanimous or\ncruel, according to the impulse that dominates at the moment.\nThroughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has\nproduced moral character. Man even when he is selfish or evil always\nfollows _principles,_ woman never follows anything but _impulses._\nDon't ever forget that, and never feel secure with the woman you\nlove.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nHer friend has left. At last an evening alone with her again. It\nseems as if Wanda had saved up all the love, which had been kept from\nher, for this superlative evening; never had she been so kind, so\nnear, so full of tenderness.\n\nWhat happiness to cling to her lips, and to die away in her arms! In\na state of relaxation and wholly mine, her head rests against my\nbreast, and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other.\n\nI cannot yet believe, comprehend, that this woman is mine, wholly\nmine.\n\n\"She is right on one point,\" Wanda began, without moving, without\nopening her eyes, as if she were asleep.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nShe remained silent.\n\n\"Your friend?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, she is right, you are not a man, you are a\ndreamer, a charming cavalier, and you certainly would be a priceless\nslave, but I cannot imagine you as husband.\"\n\nI was frightened.\n\n\"What is the matter? You are trembling?\"\n\n\"I tremble at the thought of how easily I might lose you,\" I replied.\n\n\"Are you made less happy now, because of this?\" she replied. \"Does\nit rob you of any of your joys, that I have belonged to another\nbefore I did to you, that others after you will possess me, and would\nyou enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with you?\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"that would be a way out. You won't ever\nlose me then. I care deeply for you and intellectually we are\nharmonious, and I should like to live with you always, if in addition\nto you I might have--\"\n\n\"What an idea,\" I cried. \"You fill me with a sort of horror.\"\n\n\"Do you love me any the less?\"\n\n\"On the contrary.\"\n\nWanda had raised herself on her left arm. \"I believe,\" she said,\n\"that to hold a man permanently, it is vitally important not to be\nfaithful to him. What honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved\nas a hetaira?\"\n\n\"There is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved\nwoman. It is the highest kind of ecstacy.\"\n\n\"For you, too?\" Wanda asked quickly.\n\n\"For me, too.\"\n\n\"And if I should give you that pleasure,\" Wanda exclaimed mockingly.\n\n\"I shall suffer terrible agonies, but I shall adore you the more,\"\nI replied. \"But you would never deceive me, you would have the daemonic\ngreatness of saying to me: I shall love no one but you, but I shall\nmake happy whoever pleases me.\"\n\nWanda shook her head. \"I don't like deception, I am honest, but what\nman exists who can support the burden of truth. Were I say to you:\nthis serene, sensual life, this paganism is my ideal, would you be\nstrong enough to bear it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I could endure anything so as not to lose you. I feel\nhow little I really mean to you.\"\n\n\"But Severin--\"\n\n\"But it is so,\" said I, \"and just for that reason--\"\n\n\"For that reason you would--\" she smiled roguishly--\"have I guessed\nit?\"\n\n\"Be your slave!\" I exclaimed. \"Be your unrestricted property,\nwithout a will of my own, of which you could dispose as you wished,\nand which would therefore never be a burden to you. While you drink\nlife at its fullness, while surrounded by luxury, you enjoy the\nserene happiness and Olympian love, I want to be your servant, put\non and take off your shoes.\"\n\n\"You really aren't so far from wrong,\" replied Wanda, \"for only as\nmy slave could you endure my loving others. Furthermore the freedom\nof enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery. It\nmust give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before\none and tremble. I want a slave, do you hear, Severin?\"\n\n\"Am I not your slave?\"\n\n\"Then listen to me,\" said Wanda excitedly, seizing my hand. \"I want\nto be yours, as long as I love you.\"\n\n\"A month?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, even two.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then you become my slave.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I? Why do you ask? I am a goddess and sometimes I descend from my\nOlympian heights to you, softly, very softly, and secretly.\n\n\"But what does all this mean,\" said Wanda, resting her head in both\nhands with her gaze lost in the distance, \"a golden fancy which never\ncan become true.\" An uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her\nentire being; I have never seen her like that.\n\n\"Why unachievable?\" I began.\n\n\"Because slavery doesn't exist any longer.\"\n\n\"Then we will go to a country where it still exists, to the Orient,\nto Turkey,\" I said eagerly.\n\n\"You would--Severin--in all seriousness,\" Wanda replied. Her eyes\nburned.\n\n\"Yes, in all seriousness, I want to be your slave,\" I continued. \"I\nwant your power over me to be sanctified by law; I want my life to\nbe in your hands, I want nothing that could protect or save me from\nyou. Oh, what a voluptuous joy when once I feel myself entirely dependent\nupon your absolute will, your whim, at your beck and call. And then\nwhat happiness, when at some time you deign to be gracious, and the\nslave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him.\" I knelt\ndown, and leaned my burning forehead against her knee.\n\n\"You are talking as in a fever,\" said Wanda agitatedly, \"and you\nreally love me so endlessly.\" She held me to her breast, and covered\nme with kisses.\n\n\"You really want it?\"\n\n\"I swear to you now by God and my honor, that I shall be your slave,\nwherever and whenever you wish it, as soon as you command,\" I\nexclaimed, hardly master of myself.\n\n\"And if I take you at your word?\" said Wanda.\n\n\"Please do!\"\n\n\"All this appeals to me,\" she said then. \"It is different from\nanything else--to know that a man who worships me, and whom I love\nwith all my heart, is so wholly mine, dependent on my will and\ncaprice, my possession and slave, while I--\"\n\nShe looked strangely at me.\n\n\"If I should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame,\" she\ncontinued. \"It almost seems as if you were afraid of me already, but\nyou have sworn.\"\n\n\"And I shall keep my oath.\"\n\n\"I shall see to that,\" she replied. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\nand, heaven help me, we won't stick to fancies now. You shall become\nmy slave, and I--I shall try to be _Venus in Furs_.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought that at last I knew this woman, understood her, and now I\nsee I have to begin at the very beginning again. Only a little while\nago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile, and now she\ntries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousness.\n\nShe has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of\nhonor and agree under oath to be her slave, as long as she wishes.\n\nWith her arm around my neck she reads this, unprecedented,\nincredible document to me. The end of each sentence she punctuates\nwith a kiss.\n\n\"But all the obligations in the contract are on my side,\" I said,\nteasing her.\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied with great seriousness, \"you cease to be my\nlover, and consequently I am released from all duties and obligations\ntowards you. You will have to look upon my favors as pure\nbenevolence. You no longer have any rights, and no longer can lay\nclaim to any. There can be no limit to my power over you. Remember,\nthat you won't be much better than a dog, or some inanimate object.\nYou will be mine, my plaything, which I can break to pieces, whenever\nI want an hour's amusement. You are nothing, I am everything. Do you\nunderstand?\" She laughed and kissed me again, and yet a sort of cold\nshiver ran through me.\n\n\"Won't you allow me a few conditions--\" I began.\n\n\"Conditions?\" She contracted her forehead. \"Ah! You are afraid\nalready, or perhaps you regret, but it is too late now. You have\nsworn, I have your word of honor. But let me hear them.\"\n\n\"First of all I should like to have it included in our contract,\nthat you will never completely leave me, and then that you will never\ngive me over to the mercies of any of your admirers--\"\n\n\"But Severin,\" exclaimed Wanda with her voice full of emotion and\nwith tears in her eyes, \"how can you imagine that I--and you, a man\nwho loves me so absolutely, who puts himself so entirely in my power--\"\nShe halted.\n\n\"No, no!\" I said, covering her hands with kisses. \"I don't fear\nanything from you that might dishonor me. Forgive me the ugly\nthought.\"\n\nWanda smiled happily, leaned her cheek against mine, and seemed to\nreflect.\n\n\"You have forgotten something,\" she whispered coquettishly, \"the\nmost important thing!\"\n\n\"A condition?\"\n\n\"Yes, that I must always wear my furs,\" exclaimed Wanda. \"But I\npromise you I'll do that anyhow because they give me a despotic\nfeeling. And I shall be very cruel to you, do you understand?\"\n\n\"Shall I sign the contract?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Wanda. \"I shall first add your conditions, and the\nactual signing won't occur until the proper time and place.\"\n\n\"In Constantinople?\"\n\n\"No. I have thought things over. What special value would there be\nin owning a slave where everyone owns slaves. What I want is to\n_have a slave, I alone,_ here in our civilized sober, Philistine\nworld, and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely on\naccount of my beauty and personality, not because of law, of property\nrights, or compulsions. This attracts me. But at any rate we will go\nto a country where we are not known and where you can appear before\nthe world as my servant without embarrassment. Perhaps to Italy, to\nRome or Naples.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were sitting on Wanda's ottoman. She wore her ermine jacket, her\nhair was loose and fell like a lion's mane down her back. She clung\nto my lips, drawing my soul from my body. My head whirled, my blood\nbegan to seethe, my heart beat violently against hers.\n\n\"I want to be absolutely in your power, Wanda,\" I exclaimed\nsuddenly, seized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think\nclearly or decide freely. \"I want to put myself absolutely at your\nmercy for good or evil without any condition, without any limit to\nyour power.\"\n\nWhile saying this I had slipped from the ottoman, and lay at her\nfeet looking up at her with drunken eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful you now are,\" she exclaimed, \"your eyes half-broken\nin ecstacy fill me with joy, carry me away. How wonderful your look\nwould be if you were being beaten to death, in the extreme agony. You\nhave the eye of a martyr.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nSometimes, nevertheless, I have an uneasy feeling about placing\nmyself so absolutely, so unconditionally into a woman's hands.\nSuppose she did abuse my passion, her power?\n\nWell, then I would experience what has occupied my imagination since\nmy childhood, what has always given me the feeling of seductive\nterror. A foolish apprehension! It will be a wanton game she will play\nwith me, nothing more. She loves me, and she is good, a noble\npersonality, incapable of a breach of faith. But it lies in her hands\n--_if she wants to she can._ What a temptation in this doubt, this\nfear!\n\nNow I understand Manon l'Escault and the poor chevalier, who, even\nin the pillory, while she was another man's mistress, still adored\nher.\n\nLove knows no virtue, no profit; it loves and forgives and suffers\neverything, because it must. It is not our judgment that leads us;\nit is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover, that\nmake us abandon ourselves, or that repel us.\n\nIt is a sweet, soft, enigmatic power that drives us on. We cease to\nthink, to feel, to will; we let ourselves be carried away by it, and\nask not whither?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade.\nHe aroused general interest on account of his athletic figure,\nmagnificent face, and splendid bearing. The women particularly gaped\nat him as though he were a wild animal, but he went his way gloomily\nwithout paying attention to any one. He was accompanied by two\nservants, one a negro, completely dressed in red satin, and the other\na Circassian in his full gleaming uniform. Suddenly he saw Wanda, and\nfixed his cold piercing look upon her; he even turned his head after\nher, and when she had passed, he stood still and followed her with\nhis eyes.\n\nAnd she--she veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyes--and\ndid everything possible to meet him again.\n\nThe cunning coquetry with which she walked, moved, and looked at\nhim, almost stifled me. On the way home I remarked about it. She knit\nher brows.\n\n\"What do you want,\" she said, \"the prince is a man whom I might\nlike, who even dazzles me, and I am free. I can do what I please--\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any longer--\" I stammered, frightened.\n\n\"I love only you,\" she replied, \"but I shall have the prince pay\ncourt to me.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Aren't you my slave?\" she said calmly. \"Am I not Venus, the cruel\nnorthern Venus in Furs?\"\n\nI was silent. I felt literally crushed by her words; her cold look\nentered my heart like a dagger.\n\n\"You will find out immediately the prince's name, residence, and\ncircumstances,\" she continued. \"Do you understand?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No argument, obey!\" exclaimed Wanda, more sternly than I would have\nthought possible for her, \"and don't dare to enter my sight until you\ncan answer my questions.\"\n\nIt was not till afternoon that I could obtain the desired\ninformation for Wanda. She let me stand before her like a servant,\nwhile she leaned back in her arm-chair and listened to me, smiling.\nThen she nodded; she seemed to be satisfied.\n\n\"Bring me my footstool,\" she commanded shortly.\n\nI obeyed, and after having put it before her and having put her feet\non it, I remained kneeling.\n\n\"How will this end?\" I asked sadly after a short pause.\n\nShe broke into playful laughter. \"Why things haven't even begun yet.\"\n\n\"You are more heartless than I imagined,\" I replied, hurt.\n\n\"Severin,\" Wanda began earnestly. \"I haven't done anything yet, not\nthe slightest thing, and you are already calling me heartless. What\nwill happen when I begin to carry your dreams to their realization,\nwhen I shall lead a gay, free life and have a circle of admirers\nabout me, when I shall actually fulfil your ideal, tread you\nunderfoot and apply the lash?\"\n\n\"You take my dreams too seriously.\"\n\n\"Too seriously? I can't stop at make-believe, when once I begin,\"\nshe replied. \"You know I hate all play-acting and comedy. You have\nwished it. Was it my idea or yours? Did I persuade you or did you\ninflame my imagination? I am taking things seriously now.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I replied, caressingly, \"listen quietly to me. We love each\nother infinitely, we are very happy, will you sacrifice our entire\nfuture to a whim?\"\n\n\"It is no longer a whim,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked frightened.\n\n\"Something that was probably latent in me,\" she said quietly and\nthoughtfully. \"Perhaps it would never have come to light, if you had\nnot called it to life, and made it grow. Now that it has become a\npowerful impulse, fills my whole being, now that I enjoy it, now that\nI cannot and do not want to do otherwise, now you want to back out--\nyou--are you a man?\"\n\n\"Dear, sweet Wanda!\" I began to caress her, kiss her.\n\n\"Don't--you are not a man--\"\n\n\"And you,\" I flared up.\n\n\"I am stubborn,\" she said, \"you know that. I haven't a strong\nimagination, and like you I am weak in execution. But when I make up\nmy mind to do something, I carry it through, and the more certainly,\nthe more opposition I meet. Leave me alone!\"\n\nShe pushed me away, and got up.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I likewise rose, and stood facing her.\n\n\"Now you know what I am,\" she continued. \"Once more I warn you. You\nstill have the choice. I am not compelling you to be my slave.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes, \"don't\nyou know how I love you?\"\n\nHer lips quivered contemptuously.\n\n\"You are mistaken, you make yourself out worse than you are; you are\ngood and noble by nature--\"\n\n\"What do you know about my nature,\" she interrupted vehemently, \"you\nwill get to know me as I am.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Decide, will you submit, unconditionally?\"\n\n\"And if I say no.\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\nShe stepped close up to me, cold and contemptuous. As she stood\nbefore me now, the arms folded across her breast, with an evil smile\nabout her lips, she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams. Her\nexpression seemed hard, and nothing lay in her eyes that promised\nkindness or mercy.\n\n\"Well--\" she said at last.\n\n\"You are angry,\" I cried, \"you will punish me.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" she replied, \"I shall let you go. You are free. I am not\nholding you.\"\n\n\"Wanda--I, who love you so--\"\n\n\"Yes, you, my dear sir, you who adore me,\" she exclaimed\ncontemptuously, \"but who are a coward, a liar, and a breaker of\npromises. Leave me instantly--\"\n\n\"Wanda I--\"\n\n\"Wretch!\"\n\nMy blood rose in my heart. I threw myself down at her feet and began\nto cry.\n\n\"Tears, too!\" She began to laugh. Oh, this laughter was frightful.\n\"Leave me--I don't want to see you again.\"\n\n\"Oh my God!\" I cried, beside myself. \"I will do whatever you\ncommand, be your slave, a mere object with which you can do what you\nwill--only don't send me away--I can't bear it--I cannot live without\nyou.\" I embraced her knees, and covered her hand with kisses.\n\n\"Yes, you must be a slave, and feel the lash, for you are not a\nman,\" she said calmly. She said this to me with perfect composure,\nnot angrily, not even excitedly, and it was what hurt most. \"Now I\nknow you, your dog-like nature, that adores where it is kicked, and\nthe more, the more it is maltreated. Now I know you, and now you\nshall come to know me.\"\n\nShe walked up and down with long strides, while I remained crushed\non my knees; my head was hanging supine, tears flowed from my eyes.\n\n\"Come here,\" Wanda commanded harshly, sitting down on the ottoman.\nI obeyed her command, and sat down beside her. She looked at me\nsombrely, and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior\nof her eye. Smiling, she drew me toward her breast, and began to kiss\nthe tears out of my eyes.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe odd part of my situation is that I am like the bear in Lily's\npark. I can escape and don't want to; I am ready to endure everything\nas soon as she threatens to set me free.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIf only she would use the whip again. There is something uncanny in\nthe kindness with which she treats me. I seem like a little captive\nmouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays. She is ready at any\nmoment to tear it to pieces, and my heart of a mouse threatens to\nburst.\n\nWhat are her intentions? What does she purpose to do with me?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seems she has completely forgotten the contract, my slavehood. Or\nwas it actually only stubbornness? And she gave up her whole plan as\nsoon as I no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim?\n\nHow kind she is to me, how tender, how loving! We are spending\nmarvellously happy days.\n\nTo-day she had me read to her the scene between Faust and\nMephistopheles, in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar.\nHer glance hung on me with strange pleasure.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said when I had finished, \"how a man who\ncan read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression, and\ninterpret them so clearly, concisely, and intelligently, can at the\nsame time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are.\"\n\n\"Were you pleased,\" said I, and kissed her forehead.\n\nShe gently stroked my brow. \"I love you, Severin,\" she whispered. \"I\ndon't believe I could ever love any one more than you. Let us be\nsensible, what do you say?\"\n\nInstead of replying I folded her in my arms; a deep inward, yet\nvaguely sad happiness filled my breast, my eyes grew moist, and a\ntear fell upon her hand.\n\n\"How can you cry!\" she exclaimed, \"you are a child!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn a pleasure drive we met the Russian prince in his carriage. He\nseemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by Wanda's side, and\nlooked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his\nelectric gray eyes. She, however, did not seem to notice him. I felt\nat that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet.\nShe let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an\ninanimate object, a tree, for instance, and turned to me with her\ngracious smile.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I said good-night to her to-day she seemed suddenly\nunaccountably distracted and moody. What was occupying her?\n\n\"I am sorry you are going,\" she said when I was already standing on\nthe threshold.\n\n\"It is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my\ntrial, to cease tormenting me--\" I pleaded.\n\n\"Do you imagine that this compulsion isn't a torment for me, too,\"\nWanda interjected.\n\n\"Then end it,\" I exclaimed, embracing her, \"be my wife.\"\n\n\"_Never, Severin_,\" she said gently, but with great firmness.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nI was frightened in my innermost soul.\n\n\"_You are not the man for me._\"\n\nI looked at her, and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about\nher waist; then I left the room, and she--she did not call me back.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA sleepless night; I made countless decisions, only to toss them\naside again. In the morning I wrote her a letter in which I declared\nour relationship dissolved. My hand trembled when I put on the seal,\nand I burned my fingers.\n\nAs I went upstairs to hand it to the maid, my knees threatened to\ngive way.\n\nThe door opened, and Wanda thrust forth her head full of curling-papers.\n\n\"I haven't had my hair dressed yet,\" she said, smiling. \"What have\nyou there?\"\n\n\"A letter--\"\n\n\"For me?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Ah, you want to break with me,\" she exclaimed, mockingly.\n\n\"Didn't you tell me yesterday that I wasn't the man for you?\"\n\n_\"I repeat it now!\"_\n\n\"Very well, then.\" My whole body was trembling, my voice failed me,\nand I handed her the letter.\n\n\"Keep it,\" she said, measuring me coldly. \"You forget that is no\nlonger a question as to whether you satisfy me as a man; as a _slave_\nyou will doubtless do well enough.\"\n\n\"Madame!\" I exclaimed, aghast.\n\n\"That is what you will call me in the future,\" replied Wanda,\nthrowing back her head with a movement of unutterable contempt. \"Put\nyour affairs in order within the next twenty-four hours. The day\nafter to-morrow I shall start for Italy, and you will accompany me\nas my servant.\"\n\n\"Wanda--\"\n\n\"I forbid any sort of familiarity,\" she said, cutting my words short,\n\"likewise you are not to come in unless I call or ring for you, and\nyou are not to speak to me until you are spoken to. From now on your\nname is no longer Severin, but _Gregor_.\"\n\nI trembled with rage, and yet, unfortunately, I cannot deny it, I\nalso felt a strange pleasure and stimulation.\n\n\"But, madame, you know my circumstances,\" I began in my confusion.\n\"I am dependent on my father, and I doubt whether he will give me the\nlarge sum of money needed for this journey--\"\n\n\"That means you have no money, Gregor,\" said Wanda, delightedly, \"so\nmuch the better, you are then entirely dependent on me, and in fact\nmy slave.\"\n\n\"You don't consider,\" I tried to object, \"that as man of honor it is\nimpossible for me--\"\n\n\"I have indeed considered it,\" she replied almost with a tone of\ncommand. \"As a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your\npromise to follow me as slave whithersoever I demand and to obey\nwhatever I command. Now leave me, Gregor!\"\n\nI turned toward the door.\n\n\"Not yet--you may first kiss my hand.\" She held it out to me with a\ncertain proud indifference, and I the dilettante, the donkey, the\nmiserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips\nwhich were dry and hot with excitement.\n\nThere was another gracious nod of the head.\n\nThen I was dismissed.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThough it was late in the evening my light was still lit, and a fire\nwas burning in the large green stove. There were still many things\namong my letters and documents to be put in order. Autumn, as is\nusually the case with us, had fallen with all its power.\n\nSuddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip.\n\nI opened and saw her standing outside in her ermine-lined jacket and\nin a high round Cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great\nCatherine favored.\n\n\"Are you ready, Gregor?\" she asked darkly.\n\n\"Not yet, mistress,\" I replied.\n\n\"I like that word,\" she said then, \"you are always to call me\nmistress, do you understand? We leave here to-morrow morning at nine\no'clock. As far as the district capital you will be my companion and\nfriend, but from the moment that we enter the railway-coach you are\nmy slave, my servant. Now close the window, and open the door.\"\n\nAfter I had done as she had demanded, and after she had entered, she\nasked, contracting her brows ironically, \"well, how do you like me.\"\n\n\"Wanda, you--\"\n\n\"Who gave you permission?\" She gave me a blow with the whip.\n\n\"You are very beautiful, mistress.\"\n\nWanda smiled and sat down in the arm-chair. \"Kneel down--here beside\nmy chair.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"Kiss my hand.\"\n\nI seized her small cold hand and kissed it.\n\n\"And the mouth--\"\n\nIn a surge of passion I threw my arms around the beautiful cruel\nwoman, and covered her face, arms, and breast with glowing kisses.\nShe returned them with equal fervor--the eyelids closed as in a\ndream. It was after midnight when she left.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAt nine o'clock sharp in the morning everything was ready for departure,\nas she had ordered. We left the little Carpathian health-resort in a\ncomfortable light carriage. The most interesting drama of my life had\nreached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossible\nto foretell.\n\nSo far everything went well. I sat beside Wanda, and she chatted\nvery graciously and intelligently with me, as with a good friend,\nconcerning Italy, Pisemski's new novel, and Wagner's music. She wore\na sort of Amazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short\njacket of the same material, set with dark fur. It fitted closely and\nshowed her figure to best advantage. Over it she wore dark furs. Her\nhair wound into an antique knot, lay beneath a small dark fur-hat\nfrom which a black veil hung. Wanda was in very good humor; she fed\nme candies, played with my hair, loosened my neck cloth and made a\npretty cockade of it; she covered my knees with her furs and\nstealthily pressed the fingers of my hand. When our Jewish driver\npersistently went on nodding to himself, she even gave me a kiss, and\nher cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnal\nrose, which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves and\nupon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWe are at the district capital. We get out at the railway station.\nWanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm, and goes\nto secure the tickets.\n\nWhen she returns she has completely changed.\n\n\"Here is your ticket, Gregor,\" she says in a tone which supercilious\nladies use to their servants.\n\n\"A third-class ticket,\" I reply with comic horror.\n\n\"Of course,\" she continues, \"but now be careful. You won't get on\nuntil I am settled in my compartment and don't need you any longer.\nAt each station you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders. Don't\nforget. And now give me my furs.\"\n\nAfter I had helped her into them, humbly like a slave, she went to\nfind an empty first-class coupe. I followed. Supporting herself on\nmy shoulder, she got on and I wrapped her feet in bear-skins and placed\nthem on the warming bottle.\n\nThen she nodded to me, and dismissed me. I slowly ascended a third-class\ncarriage, which was filled with abominable tobacco-smoke that seemed\nlike the fogs of Acheron at the entrance to Hades. I now had the leisure\nto muse about the riddle of human existence, and about its greatest\nriddle of all--_woman_.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhenever the train stops, I jump off, run to her carriage, and with\ndrawn cap await her orders. She wants coffee and then a glass of\nwater, at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands, and\nthus it goes on. She lets several men who have entered her\ncompartment pay court to her. I am dying of jealousy and have to leap\nabout like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and\nnot miss the train.\n\nIn this way the night passes. I haven't had time to eat a mouthful\nand I can't sleep, I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish\npeasants, Jewish peddlers, and common soldiers.\n\nWhen I mount the steps of her coupe, she is lying stretched out\non cushions in her comfortable furs, covered up with the skins of\nanimals. She is like an oriental despot, and the men sit like Indian\ndeities, straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to\nbreathe.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stops over in Vienna for a day to go shopping, and particularly\nto buy series of luxurious gowns. She continues to treat me as her\nservant. I follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces. She\nhands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look,\nand laden down like a donkey I pant along behind.\n\nBefore leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel\nwaiters. I am ordered to put on her livery. It is a Cracovian costume\nin her colors, light-blue with red facings, and red quadrangular cap,\nornamented with peacock-feathers. The costume is rather becoming to\nme.\n\nThe silver buttons bear her coat of arms. I have the feeling of having\nbeen sold or of having bonded myself to the devil. My fair demon leads\nme from Vienna to Florence. Instead of linen-garbed Mazovians and\ngreasy-haired Jews, my companions now are curly-haired Contadini, a\nmagnificent sergeant of the first Italian Grenadiers, and a poor German\npainter. The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions, but of salami and\ncheese.\n\nNight has fallen again. I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack; my arms and\nlegs seem broken. But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the\naffair. The stars sparkle round about, the Italian sergeant has a face\nlike Apollo Belvedere, and the German painter sings a lovely German\nsong.\n\n\"Now that all the shadows gather\nAnd endless stars grow light,\nDeep yearning on me falls\nAnd softly fills the night.\"\n\n\"Through the sea of dreams\nSailing without cease,\nSailing goes my soul\nIn thine to find release.\"\n\nAnd I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal\ncomfort among her soft furs.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFlorence! Crowds, cries, importunate porters and cab-drivers. Wanda\nchooses a carriage, and dismisses the porters.\n\n\"What have I a servant for,\" she says, \"Gregor--here is the ticket--\nget the luggage.\"\n\nShe wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I\ndrag the heavy trunks hither, one after another. I break down for a\nmoment under the last one; a good-natured _carabiniere_ with an\nintelligent face comes to my assistance. She laughs.\n\n\"It must be heavy,\" said she, \"all my furs are in it.\"\n\nI get up on the driver's seat, wiping drops of perspiration from my\nbrow. She gives the name of the hotel, and the driver urges on his\nhorse. In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated\nentrance.\n\n\"Have you any rooms?\" she asks the portier.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"Two for me, one for my servant, all with stoves.\"\n\n\"Two first-class rooms for you, madame, both with stoves,\" replied\nthe waiter who had hastily come up, \"and one without heat for your\nservant.\"\n\nShe looked at them, and then abruptly said: \"they are satisfactory,\nhave fires built at once; my servant can sleep in the unheated room.\"\n\nI merely looked at her.\n\n\"Bring up the trunks, Gregor,\" she commands, paying no attention to\nmy looks. \"In the meantime I'll be dressing, and then will go down\nto the dining-room, and you can eat something for supper.\"\n\nAs she goes into the adjoining room, I drag the trunks upstairs and\nhelp the waiter build a fire in her bed-room. He tries to question\nme in bad French about my employer. With a brief glance I see the\nblazing fire, the fragrant white poster-bed, and the rugs which cover\nthe floor. Tired and hungry I then descend the stairs, and ask for\nsomething to eat. A good-natured waiter, who used to be in the\nAustrian army and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in German,\nshows me the dining-room and waits on me. I have just had the first\nfresh drink in thirty-six hours and the first bite of warm food on\nmy fork, when she enters.\n\nI rise.\n\n\"What do you mean by taking me into a dining-room in which my\nservant is eating,\" she snaps at the waiter, flaring with anger. She\nturns around and leaves.\n\nMeanwhile I thank heaven that I am permitted to go on eating. Later\nI climb the four flights upstairs to my room. My small trunk is\nalready there, and a miserable little oil-lamp is burning. It is a\nnarrow room without fire-place, without a window, but with a small\nair-hole. If it weren't so beastly cold, it would remind me of one\nof the Venetian _piombi_. [Footnote: These were notorious prisons\nunder the leaden roof of the Palace of the Doges.] Involuntarily I\nhave to laugh out aloud, so that it re-echoes, and I am startled by\nmy own laughter.\n\nSuddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical\nItalian gesture calls \"You are to come down to madame, at once.\" I\npick up my cap, stumble down the first few steps, but finally arrive\nin front of her door on the first floor and knock.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nI enter, shut the door, and stand attention.\n\nWanda has made herself comfortable. She is sitting in a neglige of\nwhite muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a\nfootstool that matches. She has thrown her fur-cloak about her. It\nis the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time,\nas goddess of love.\n\nThe yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections,\ntheir reflections in the large mirrors, and the red flames from the\nopen fireplace play beautifully on the green velvet, the dark-brown\nsable of the cloak, the smooth white skin, and the red, flaming hair\nof the beautiful woman. Her clear, but cold face is turned toward me,\nand her cold green eyes rest upon me.\n\n\"I am satisfied with you, Gregor,\" she began.\n\nI bowed.\n\n\"Come closer.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"Still closer,\" she looked down, and stroked the sable with her\nhand. \"Venus in Furs receives her slave. I can see that you are more\nthan an ordinary dreamer, you don't remain far in arrears of your\ndreams; you are the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into\neffect, no matter how mad they are. I confess, I like this; it\nimpresses me. There is strength in this, and strength is the only\nthing one respects. I actually believe that under unusual\ncircumstances, in a period of great deeds, what seems to be your\nweakness would reveal itself as extraordinary power. Under the early\nemperors you would have been a martyr, at the time of the Reformation\nan anabaptist, during the French Revolution one of those inspired\nGirondists who mounted the guillotine with the marseillaise on their\nlips. But you are my slave, my--\"\n\nShe suddenly leaped up; the furs slipped down, and she threw her\narms with soft pressure about my neck.\n\n\"My beloved slave, Severin, oh, how I love you, how I adore you, how\nhandsome you are in your Cracovian costume! You will be cold to-night\nup in your wretched room without a fire. Shall I give you one of my\nfurs, dear heart, the large one there--\"\n\nShe quickly picked it up, throwing it over my shoulders, and before\nI knew what had happened I was completely wrapped up in it.\n\n\"How wonderfully becoming furs are to your face, they bring out your\nnoble lines. As soon as you cease being my slave, you must wear a\nvelvet coat with sable, do you understand? Otherwise I shall never\nput on my fur-jacket again.\"\n\nAnd again she began to caress me and kiss me; finally she drew me\ndown on the little divan.\n\n\"You seem to be pleased with yourself in furs,\" she said. \"Quick,\nquick, give them to me, or I will lose all sense of dignity.\"\n\nI placed the furs about her, and Wanda slipped her right arm into\nthe sleeve.\n\n\"This is the pose in Titian's picture. But now enough of joking.\nDon't always look so solemn, it makes me feel sad. As far as the\nworld is concerned you are still merely my servant; you are not yet\nmy slave, for you have not yet signed the contract. You are still\nfree, and can leave me any moment. You have played your part\nmagnificently. I have been delighted, but aren't you tired of it\nalready, and don't you think I am abominable? Well, say something--I\ncommand it.\"\n\n\"Must I confess to you, Wanda?\" I began.\n\n\"Yes, you must.\"\n\n\"Even it you take advantage of it,\" I continued, \"I shall love you\nthe more deeply, adore you the more fanatically, the worse you treat\nme. What you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my\nsenses.\" I held her close to me and clung for several moments to her\nmoist lips.\n\n\"Oh, you beautiful woman,\" I then exclaimed, looking at her. In my\nenthusiasm I tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth\nagainst her neck.\n\n\"You love me even when I am cruel,\" said Wanda, \"now go!--you bore\nme--don't you hear?\"\n\nShe boxed my ears so that I saw stars and bells rang in my ears.\n\n\"Help me into my furs, slave.\"\n\nI helped her, as well as I could.\n\n\"How awkward,\" she exclaimed, and was scarcely in it before she\nstruck me in the face again. I felt myself growing pale.\n\n\"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, softly touching me with her hand.\n\n\"No, no,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"At any rate you have no reason to complain, you want it thus; now\nkiss me again.\"\n\nI threw my arms about her, and her lips clung closely to mine. As\nshe lay against my breast in her large heavy furs, I had a curiously\noppressive sensation. It was as if a wild beast, a she-bear, were\nembracing me. It seemed as if I were about to feel her claws in my\nflesh. But this time the she-bear let me off easily.\n\nWith my heart filled with smiling hopes, I went up to my miserable\nservant's room, and threw myself down on my hard couch.\n\n\"Life is really amazingly droll,\" I thought. \"A short time ago the\nmost beautiful woman, Venus herself, rested against your breast, and\nnow you have an opportunity for studying the Chinese hell. Unlike us,\nthey don't hurl the damned into flames, but they have devils chasing\nthem out into fields of ice.\n\n\"Very likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated\nrooms.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the night I startled out of my sleep with a scream. I had\nbeen dreaming of an icefield in which I had lost my way; I had been\nlooking in vain for a way out. Suddenly an eskimo drove up in a\nsleigh harnessed with reindeer; he had the face of the waiter who had\nshown me to the unheated room.\n\n\"What are you looking for here, my dear sir?\" he exclaimed. \"This is\nthe North Pole.\"\n\nA moment later he had disappeared, and Wanda flew over the smooth\nice on tiny skates. Her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled; the\nermine of her jacket and cap, but especially her face, gleamed whiter\nthan the snow. She shot toward me, inclosed me in her arms, and began\nto kiss me. Suddenly I felt my blood running warm down my side.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked horror-stricken.\n\nShe laughed, and as I looked at her now, it was no longer Wanda, but\na huge, white she-bear, who was digging her paws into my body.\n\nI cried out in despair, and still heard her diabolical laughter when\nI awoke, and looked about the room in surprise.\n\nEarly in the morning I stood at Wanda's door, and the waiter brought\nthe coffee. I took it from him, and served it to my beautiful\nmistress. She had already dressed, and looked magnificent, all fresh\nand roseate. She smiled graciously at me and called me back, when I\nwas about to withdraw respectfully.\n\n\"Come, Gregor, have your breakfast quickly too,\" she said, \"then we\nwill go house-hunting. I don't want to stay in the hotel any longer\nthan I have to. It is very embarassing here. If I chat with you for\nmore than a minute, people will immediately say: 'The fair Russian\nis having an affair with her servant, you see, the race of Catherines\nisn't extinct yet.'\"\n\nHalf an hour later we went out; Wanda was in her cloth-gown with the\nRussian cap, and I in my Cracovian costume. We created quite a stir. I\nwalked about ten paces behind, looking very solemn, but expected\nmomentarily to have to break out into loud laughter. There was scarcely\na street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear\nthe sign _camere ammobiliate_. Wanda always sent me upstairs, and only\nwhen the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herself\nascend. By noon I was as tired as a stag-hound after the hunt.\n\nWe entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitable\nhabitation. Wanda was already somewhat out of humor. Suddenly she said\nto me: \"Severin, the seriousness with which you play your part is\ncharming, and the restrictions, which we have placed upon each other are\nreally annoying me. I can't stand it any longer, I do love you, I must\nkiss you. Let's go into one of the houses.\"\n\n\"But, my lady--\" I interposed.\n\n\"Gregor?\" She entered the next open corridor and ascended a few\nsteps of the dark stair-way; then she threw her arms about me with\npassionate tenderness and kissed me.\n\n\"Oh, Severin, you were very wise. You are much more dangerous as\nslave than I would have imagined; you are positively irrestible, and\nI am afraid I shall have to fall in love with you again.\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any longer then,\" I asked seized by a sudden\nfright.\n\nShe solemnly shook her head, but kissed me again with her swelling,\nadorable lips.\n\nWe returned to the hotel. Wanda had luncheon, and ordered me also\nquickly to get something to eat.\n\nOf course, I wasn't served as quickly as she, and so it happened\nthat just as I was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth,\nthe waiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture:\n\"Madame wants you, at once.\"\n\nI took a rapid and painful leave of my food, and, tired and hungry,\nhurried toward Wanda, who was already on the street.\n\n\"I wouldn't have imagined you could be so cruel,\" I said\nreproachfully. \"With all these, fatiguing duties you don't even leave\nme time to eat in peace.\"\n\nWanda laughed gaily. \"I thought you had finished,\" she said, \"but\nnever mind. Man was born to suffer, and you in particular. The\nmartyrs didn't have any beefsteaks either.\"\n\nI followed her resentfully, gnawing at my hunger.\n\n\"I have given up the idea of finding a place in the city,\" Wanda\ncontinued. \"It will be difficult to find an entire floor which is\nshut off and where you can do as you please. In such a strange, mad\nrelationship as ours there must be no jarring note. I shall rent an\nentire villa--and you will be surprised. You have my permission now\nto satisfy your hunger, and look about a bit in Florence. I won't be\nhome till evening. If I need you then, I will have you called.\"\n\nI looked at the Duomo, the Palazzo Vecchio, the Logia di Lanzi, and\nthen I stood for a long time on the banks of the Arno. Again and\nagain I let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient Florence, whose\nround cupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue,\ncloudless sky. I watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide\narches the lively waves of the beautiful, yellow river ran, and the\ngreen hills which surrounded the city, bearing slender cypresses and\nextensive buildings, palaces and monasteries.\n\nIt is a different world, this one in which we are--a gay, sensuous,\nsmiling world. The landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and\nsomberness of ours. It is a long ways off to the last white villas\nscattered among the pale green of the mountains, and yet there isn't\na spot that isn't bright with sunlight. The people are less serious\nthan we; perhaps, they think less, but they all look as though they\nwere happy.\n\nIt is also maintained that death is easier in the South.\n\nI have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn\nand love of the senses without torment does exist.\n\nWanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the\nwinter. It is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the\nArno, opposite the Cascine. It is surrounded by an attractive garden\nwith lovely paths, grass plots, and magnificent meadow of camelias.\nIt is only two stories high, quadrangular in the Italian fashion. An\nopen gallery runs along one side, a sort of loggia with plaster-casts\nof antique statues; stone steps lead from it down into the garden.\nFrom the gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin,\nfrom which winding stairs lead to my mistress' bed-chamber.\n\nWanda occupies the second story by herself.\n\nA room on the ground floor has been assigned to me; it is very\nattractive, and even has a fireplace.\n\nI have roamed through the garden. On a round hillock I discovered a\nlittle temple, but I found its door locked. However, there is a chink\nin the door and when I glue my eye to it, I see the goddess of love\non a white pedestal.\n\nA slight shudder passes over me. It seems to me as if she were\nsmiling at me saying: \"Are you there? I have been expecting you.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is evening. An attractive maid brings me orders to appear before\nmy mistress. I ascend the wide marble stairs, pass through the\nanteroom, a large salon furnished with extravagant magnificence, and\nknock at the door of the bedroom. I knock very softly for the luxury\ndisplayed everywhere intimidates me. Consequently no one hears me,\nand I stand for some time in front of the door. I have a feeling as\nif I were standing before the bed-room of the great Catherine, and\nit seems as if at any moment she might come out in her green sleeping\nfurs, with the red ribbon and decoration on her bare breast, and with\nher little white powdered curls.\n\nI knocked again. Wanda impatiently pulls the door open.\n\n\"Why so late?\" she asks.\n\n\"I was standing in front of the door, but you didn't hear me knock,\"\nI reply timidly. She closes the door, and clinging to me, she leads\nme to the red damask ottoman on which she had been resting. The\nentire arrangement of the room is in red damask--wall-paper,\ncurtains, portieres, hangings of the bed. A magnificent painting of\nSamson and Delilah forms the ceiling.\n\nWanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille. Her white satin\ndress flows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body,\nleaving her arms and breast bare, and carelessly they nestle amid the\ndark hair of the great fur of sable, lined with green velvet. Her red\nhair falls down her back as far as the hips, only half held by\nstrings of black pearls.\n\n\"Venus in Furs,\" I whisper, while she draws me to her breast and\nthreatens to stifle me with her kisses. Then I no longer speak and\nneither do I think; everything is drowned out in an ocean of\nunimagined bliss.\n\n\"Do you still love me?\" she asks, her eye softening in passionate\ntenderness.\n\n\"You ask!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"You still remember your oath,\" she continued with an alluring\nsmile, \"now that everything is prepared, everything in readiness, I\nask you once more, is it still your serious wish to become my slave?\"\n\n\"Am I not ready?\" I asked in surprise.\n\n\"You have not yet signed the papers.\"\n\n\"Papers--what papers?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see, you want to give it up,\" she said, \"well then, we will\nlet it go.\"\n\n\"But Wanda,\" I said, \"you know that nothing gives me greater\nhappiness than to serve you, to be your slave. I would give\neverything for the sake of feeling myself wholly in your power, even\nunto death--\"\n\n\"How beautiful you are,\" she whispered, \"when you speak so\nenthusiastically, so passionately. I am more in love with you than\never and you want me to be dominant, stern, and cruel. I am afraid,\nit will be impossible for me to be so.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" I replied smiling, \"where are the papers?'\"\n\n\"So that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power, I\nhave drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have\ndecided to kill yourself. In that way I can even kill you, if I so\ndesire.\"\n\n\"Give them to me.\"\n\nWhile I was unfolding the documents and reading them, Wanda got pen\nand ink. She then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck, and\nlooked over my shoulder at the paper.\n\nThe first one read:\n\nAGREEMENT BETWEEN MME. VON DUNAJEW AND SEVERIN VON KUSIEMSKI\n\n\"Severin von Kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced\nof Mme. Wanda von Dunajew, and renounces all the rights appertaining\nthereunto; he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a\nman and nobleman, that hereafter he will be her _slave_ until such\ntime that she herself sets him at liberty again.\n\n\"As the slave of Mme. von Dunajew he is to bear the name Gregor, and\nhe is unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes, and to\nobey every one of her commands; he is always to be submissive to his\nmistress, and is to consider her every sign of favor as an\nextraordinary mercy.\n\n\"Mme. von Dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she\ndeems best, even for the slightest inadvertence or fault, but also\nis herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her\nor merely for the sake of whiling away the time. Should she so desire,\nshe may kill him whenever she wishes; in short, he is her\nunrestricted property.\n\n\"Should Mme. von Dunajew ever set her slave at liberty, Severin von\nKusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or\nsuffered as her slave, and promises _never under any circumstances and\nin no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation_.\n\n\"Mme. von Dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as\noften as possible in her furs, especially when she purposes some\ncruelty toward her slave.\"\n\nAppended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present\nday.\n\nThe second document contained only a few words.\n\n\"Having since many years become weary of existence and its\nillusions, I have of my own free will put an end to my worthless\nlife.\"\n\nI was seized with a deep horror when I had finished. There was still\ntime, I could still withdraw, but the madness of passion and the\nsight of the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder\ncarried me away.\n\n\"This one you will have to copy, Severin,\" said Wanda, indicating\nthe second document. \"It has to be entirely in your own handwriting;\nthis, of course, isn't necessary in the case of the agreement.\"\n\nI quickly copied the few lines in which I designated myself a\nsuicide, and handed them to Wanda. She read them, and put them on the\ntable with a smile.\n\n\"Now have you the courage to sign it?\" she asked with a crafty\nsmile, inclining her head.\n\nI took the pen.\n\n\"Let me sign first,\" said Wanda, \"your hand is trembling, are you\nafraid of the happiness that is to be yours?\"\n\nShe took the agreement and pen. While engaging in my internal struggle,\nI looked upward for a moment. It occurred to me that the painting on the\nceiling, like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools, was\nutterly unhistorical, but this very fact gave it a strange mood which\nhad an almost uncanny effect on me. Delilah, an opulent woman with\nflaming red hair, lay extended, half-disrobed, in a dark fur-cloak, upon\na red ottoman, and bent smiling over Samson who had been overthrown and\nbound by the Philistines. Her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of\na diabolical cruelty; her eyes, half-closed, met Samson's, and his with\na last look of insane passion cling to hers, for already one of his\nenemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot iron to blind him.\n\n\"Now--\" said Wanda. \"Why you are all lost in thought. What is the\nmatter with you, everything will remain just as it was, even after\nyou have signed, don't you know me yet, dear heart?\"\n\nI looked at the agreement. Her name was written there in bold\nletters. I peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic,\nthen I took the pen and quickly signed the agreement.\n\n\"You are trembling,\" said Wanda calmly, \"shall I help you?\"\n\nShe gently took hold of my hand, and my name appeared at the bottom\nof the second paper. Wanda looked once more at the two documents, and\nthen locked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman.\n\n\"Now then, give me your passport and money.\"\n\nI took out my wallet and handed it to her. She inspected it, nodded,\nand put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness I kneeled\nbefore her leaning my head against her breast.\n\nSuddenly she thrusts me away with her foot, leaps up, and pulls the\nbell-rope. In answer to its sound three young, slender negresses\nenter; they are as if carved of ebony, and are dressed from head to\nfoot in red satin; each one has a rope in her hand.\n\nSuddenly I realize my position, and am about to rise. Wanda stands\nproudly erect, her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and\ncontemptous eyes is turned toward me. She stands before me as\nmistress, commanding, gives a sign with her hand, and before I really\nknow what has happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the\nground, and have tied me hand and foot. As in the case of one about\nto be executed my arms are bound behind my back, so that I can\nscarcely move.\n\n\"Give me the whip, Haydee,\" commands Wanda, with unearthly calm.\n\nThe negress hands it to her mistress, kneeling.\n\n\"And now take off my heavy furs,\" she continues, \"they impede me.\"\n\nThe negress obeyed.\n\n\"The jacket there!\" Wanda commanded.\n\nHaydee quickly brought her the _kazabaika_, set with ermine, which lay\non the bed, and Wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful\nmovements.\n\n\"Now tie him to the pillar here!\"\n\nThe negresses lifted me up, and twisting a heavy rope around my\nbody, tied me standing against one of the massive pillars which\nsupported the top of the wide Italian bed.\n\nThen they suddenly disappeared, as if the earth had swallowed them.\n\nWanda swiftly approached me. Her white satin dress flowed behind her\nin a long train, like silver, like moonlight; her hair flared like\nflames against the white fur of her jacket. Now she stood in front\nof me with her left hand firmly planted on her hips, in her right hand\nshe held the whip. She uttered an abrupt laugh.\n\n\"Now play has come to an end between us,\" she said with heartless\ncoldness. \"Now we will begin in dead earnest. You fool, I laugh at you\nand despise you; you who in your insane infatuation have given\nyourself as a plaything to _me_, the frivolous and capricious woman.\nYou are no longer the man I love, but _my slave_, at my mercy even\nunto life and death.\n\n\"You shall know me!\n\n\"First of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness,\nwithout having done anything to deserve it, so that you may\nunderstand what to expect, if you are awkward, disobedient, or\nrefractory.\"\n\nWith a wild grace she rolled back her fur-lined sleeve, and struck\nme across the back.\n\nI winced, for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh.\n\n\"Well, how do you like that?\" she exclaimed.\n\nI was silent.\n\n\"Just wait, you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip,\" she\nthreatened, and simultaneously began to strike me again.\n\nThe blows fell quickly, in rapid succession, with terrific force\nupon my back, arms, and neck; I had to grit my teeth not to scream\naloud. Now she struck me in the face, warm blood ran down, but she\nlaughed, and continued her blows.\n\n\"It is only now I understand you,\" she exclaimed. \"It really is a\njoy to have some one so completely in one's power, and a man at that,\nwho loves you--you do love me?--No--Oh! I'll tear you to shreds yet,\nand with each blow my pleasure will grow. Now, twist like a worm,\nscream, whine! You will find no mercy in me!\"\n\nFinally she seemed tired.\n\nShe tossed the whip aside, stretched out on the ottoman, and rang.\n\nThe negresses entered.\n\n\"Untie him!\"\n\nAs they loosened the rope, I fell to the floor like a lump of wood.\nThe black women grinned, showing their white teeth.\n\n\"Untie the rope around his feet.\"\n\nThey did it, but I was unable to rise.\n\n\"Come over here, Gregor.\"\n\nI approached the beautiful woman. Never did she seem more seductive\nto me than to-day in spite of all her cruelty and contempt.\n\n\"One step further,\" Wanda commanded. \"Now kneel down, and kiss my\nfoot.\"\n\nShe extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin, and I, the\nsupersensual fool, pressed my lips upon it.\n\n\"Now, you won't lay eyes on me for an entire month, Gregor,\" she\nsaid seriously. \"I want to become a stranger to you, so you will more\neasily adjust yourself to our new relationship. In the meantime you\nwill work in the garden, and await my orders. Now, off with you,\nslave!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA month has passed with monotonous regularity, heavy work, and a\nmelancholy hunger, hunger for her, who is inflicting all these\ntorments on me.\n\nI am under the gardener's orders; I help him lop the trees and prune\nthe hedges, transplant flowers, turn over the flower beds, sweep the\ngravel paths; I share his coarse food and his hard cot; I rise and\ngo to bed with the chickens. Now and then I hear that our mistress\nis amusing herself, surrounded by admirers. Once I heard her gay\nlaughter even down here in the garden.\n\nI seem awfully stupid to myself. Was it the result of my present\nlife, or was I so before? The month is drawing to a close--the day\nafter to-morrow. What will she do with me now, or has she forgotten\nme, and left me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day?\n\nA written order.\n\n\"The slave Gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service.\n\nWanda Dunajew.\"\n\nWith a beating heart I draw aside the damask curtain on the\nfollowing morning, and enter the bed-room of my divinity. It is still\nfilled with a pleasant half darkness.\n\n\"Is it you, Gregor?\" she asks, while I kneel before the fire-place,\nbuilding a fire. I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice. I\ncannot see her herself; she is invisible behind the curtains of the\nfour-poster bed.\n\n\"Yes, my mistress,\" I reply.\n\n\"How late is it?\"\n\n\"Past nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"Breakfast.\"\n\nI hasten to get it, and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed.\n\n\"Here is breakfast, my mistress.\"\n\nWanda draws back the curtains, and curiously enough at the first\nglance when I see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair,\nshe seems an absolute stranger, a beautiful woman, but the beloved\nsoft lines are gone. This face is hard and has an expression of\nweariness and satiety.\n\nOr is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this?\n\nShe fixes her green eyes upon me, more with curiosity than with\nmenace, perhaps even somewhat pityingly, and lazily pulls the dark\nsleeping fur on which she lies over the bared shoulder.\n\nAt this moment she is very charming, very maddening, and I feel my\nblood rising to my head and heart. The tray in my hands begins to\nsway. She notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on\nthe toilet-table.\n\n\"You are awkward, slave,\" she says furrowing her brow.\n\nI lower my looks to the ground, and hold the tray as steadily as\npossible. She eats her breakfast, yawns, and stretches her opulent\nlimbs in the magnificent furs.\n\nShe has rung. I enter.\n\n\"Take this letter to Prince Corsini.\"\n\nI hurry into the city, and hand the letter to the Prince. He is a\nhandsome young man with glowing black eyes. Consumed with jealousy,\nI take his answer to her.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she asks with lurking spitefulness.\n\"You are very pale.\"\n\n\"Nothing, mistress, I merely walked rather fast.\"\n\nAt luncheon the prince is at her side, and I am condemned to serve\nboth her and him. They joke, and I am, as if non-existent, for both.\nFor a brief moment I see black; I was just pouring some Bordeaux into\nhis glass, and spilled it over the table-cloth and her gown.\n\n\"How awkward,\" Wanda exclaimed and slapped my face. The prince\nlaughed, and she also, but I felt the blood rising to my face.\n\nAfter luncheon she drove in the Cascine. She has a little carriage\nwith a handsome, brown English horse, and holds the reins herself.\nI sit behind and notice how coquettishly she acts, and nods with a\nsmile when one of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her.\n\nAs I help her out of the carriage, she leans lightly on my arm; the\ncontact runs through me like an electric shock. She _is_ a wonderful\nwoman, and I love her more than ever.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women. I\nserve, but this time I do not spill any wine over the table-cloth.\n\nA slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures. It makes you\nunderstand very quickly, especially when the instruction is by the\nway of a small woman's hand.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter dinner she drives to the Pergola Theater. As she descends the\nstairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and\nwith a diadem of white roses on her hair, she is literally stunning.\nI open the carriage-door, and help her in. In front of the theater\nI leap from the driver's seat, and in alighting she leaned on my arm,\nwhich trembled under the sweet burden. I open the door of her box,\nand then wait in the vestibule. The performance lasts four hours; she\nreceives visits from her cavaliers, the while I grit my teeth with\nrage.\n\nIt is way beyond midnight when my mistress's bell sounds for the\nlast time.\n\n\"Fire!\" she orders abruptly, and when the fire-place crackles, \"Tea!\"\n\nWhen I return with the samovar, she has already undressed, and with\nthe aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee.\n\nHaydee thereupon leaves.\n\n\"Hand me the sleeping-furs,\" says Wanda, sleepily stretching her\nlovely limbs. I take them from the arm-chair, and hold them while she\nslowly and lazily slides into the sleeves. She then throws herself\ndown on the cushions of the ottoman.\n\n\"Take off my shoes, and put on my velvet slippers.\"\n\nI kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts.\n\"Hurry, hurry!\" Wanda exclaims, \"you are hurting me! just you wait--I\nwill teach you.\" She strikes me with the whip, but now the shoe is\noff.\n\n\"Now get out!\" Still a kick--and then I can go to bed.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-night I accompanied her to a soiree. In the entrance-hall she\nordered me to help her out of her furs; then with a proud smile,\nconfident of victory, she entered the brilliantly illuminated room.\nI again waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts, watching hour after\nhour run by. From time to time the sounds of music reached me, when\nthe door remained open for a moment. Several servants tried to start\na conversation with me, but soon desisted, since I knew only a few\nwords of Italian.\n\nFinally I fell asleep, and dreamed that I murdered Wanda in a\nviolent attack of jealousy. I was condemned to death, and saw myself\nstrapped on the board; the knife fell, I felt it on my neck, but I\nwas still alive--\n\nThen the executioner slapped my face.\n\nNo, it wasn't the executioner; it was Wanda who stood wrathfully\nbefore me demanding her furs. I am at her side in a moment, and help\nher on with it.\n\nThere is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs, and\nin seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in\nthe precious soft furs, and to lift the flowing hair over the collar.\nWhen she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her\nbody still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable. It is enough to\ndrive one mad.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFinally a day came when there were neither guests, nor theater, nor\nother company. I breathed a sigh of relief. Wanda sat in the gallery,\nreading, and apparently had no orders for me. At dusk when the\nsilvery evening mists fell she withdrew. I served her at dinner, she\nate by herself, but had not a look, not a syllable for me, not even\na slap in the face.\n\nI actually desire a slap from her hand. Tears fill my eyes, and I\nfeel that she has humiliated me so deeply, that she doesn't even find\nit worth while to torture or maltreat me any further.\n\nBefore she goes to bed, her bell calls me.\n\n\"You will sleep here to-night, I had horrible dreams last night, and\nam afraid of being alone. Take one of the cushions from the ottoman,\nand lie down on the bearskin at my feet.\"\n\nThen Wanda put out the lights. The only illumination in the room was\nfrom a small lamp suspended from the ceiling. She herself got into\nbed. \"Don't stir, so as not to wake me.\"\n\nI did as she had commanded, but could not fall asleep for a long\ntime. I saw the beautiful woman, beautiful as a goddess, lying on her\nback on the dark sleeping-furs; her arms beneath her neck, with a\nflood of red hair over them. I heard her magnificent breast rise in\ndeep regular breathing, and whenever she moved ever so slightly. I\nwoke up and listened to see whether she needed me.\n\nBut she did not require me.\n\nNo task was required of me; I meant no more to her than a night-lamp, or\na revolver which one places under one's pillow.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAm I mad or is she? Does all this arise out of an inventive, wanton\nwoman's brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual\nfantasies, or is this woman really one of those Neronian characters\nwho take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot, like a worm,\nhuman beings, who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs?\n\nWhat have I experienced?\n\nWhen I knelt with the coffee-tray beside her bed, Wanda suddenly\nplaced her hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine.\n\n\"What beautiful eyes you have,\" she said softly, \"and especially now\nsince you suffer. Are you very unhappy?\"\n\nI bowed my head, and kept silent.\n\n\"Severin, do you still love me,\" she suddenly exclaimed\npassionately, \"can you still love me?\"\n\nShe drew me close with such vehemence that the coffee-tray upset,\nthe can and cups fell to the floor, and the coffee ran over the\ncarpet.\n\n\"Wanda--my Wanda,\" I cried out and held her passionately against me;\nI covered her mouth, face, and breast with kisses.\n\n\"It is my unhappiness that I love you more and more madly the worse\nyou treat me, the more frequently you betray me. Oh, I shall die of\npain and love and jealousy.\"\n\n\"But I haven't betrayed you, as yet, Severin,\" replied Wanda smiling.\n\n\"Not? Wanda! Don't jest so mercilessly with me,\" I cried. \"Haven't\nI myself taken the letter to the Prince--\"\n\n\"Of course, it was an invitation for luncheon.\"\n\n\"You have, since we have been in Florence--\"\n\n\"I have been absolutely faithful to you,\" replied Wanda, \"I swear it\nby all that is holy to me. All that I have done was merely to fulfill\nyour dream and it was done for your sake.\n\n\"However, I shall take a lover, otherwise things will be only half\naccomplished, and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having\ntreated you cruelly enough, my dear beautiful slave! But to-day you\nshall be Severin again, the only one I love. I haven't given away\nyour clothes. They are here in the chest. Go and dress as you used\nto in the little Carpathian health-resort when our love was so intimate.\nForget everything that has happened since; oh, you will forget it\neasily in my arms; I shall kiss away all your sorrows.\"\n\nShe began to treat me tenderly like a child, to kiss me and caress\nme. Finally she said with a gracious smile, \"Go now and dress, I too\nwill dress. Shall I put on my fur-jacket? Oh yes, I know, now run\nalong!\"\n\nWhen I returned she was standing in the center of the room in her\nwhite satin dress, and the red _kazabaika_ edged with ermine; her hair\nwas white with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond\ndiadem. For a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of Catherine\nthe Second, but she did not give me much time for reminiscences. She\ndrew me down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful\nhours. She was no longer the stern capricious mistress, she was\nentirely a fine lady, a tender sweetheart. She showed me photographs\nand books which had just appeared, and talked about them with so much\nintelligence, clarity, and good taste, that I more than once carried\nher hand to my lips, enraptured. She then had me recite several of\nLermontov's poems, and when I was all afire with enthusiasm, she\nplaced her small hand gently on mine. Her expression was soft, and her\neyes were filled with tender pleasure.\n\n\"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nShe then leaned back on the cushions, and slowly opened her\n_kazabaika_.\n\nBut I quickly covered the half-bared breast again with the ermine.\n\"You are driving me mad.\" I stammered.\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nI was already lying in her arms, and like a serpent she was kissing\nme with her tongue, when again she whispered, \"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"Infinitely!\" I exclaimed.\n\nShe laughed aloud. It was an evil, shrill laugh which made cold\nshivers run down by back.\n\n\"You used to dream of being the slave, the plaything of a beautiful\nwoman, and now you imagine you are a free human being, a man, my\nlover-you fool! A sign from me, and you are a slave again. Down on\nyour knees!\"\n\nI sank down from the ottoman to her feet, but my eye still clung\ndoubtingly on hers.\n\n\"You can't believe it,\" she said, looking at me with her arms folded\nacross her breast. \"I am bored, and you will just do to while away\na couple of hours of time. Don't look at me that way--\"\n\nShe kicked me with her foot.\n\n\"You are just what I want, a human being, a thing, an animal--\"\n\nShe rang. The three negresses entered.\n\n\"Tie his hands behind his back.\"\n\nI remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this. They led me\ninto the garden, down to the little vineyard, which forms the\nsouthern boundary. Corn had been planted between the espaliers, and\nhere and there a few dead stalks still stood. To one side was a\nplough.\n\nThe negresses tied me to a post, and amused themselves sticking me\nwith their golden hair-needles. But this did not last long, before\nWanda appeared with her ermine cap on her head, and with her hands\nin the pockets of her jacket. She had me untied, and then my hands\nwere fastened together on my back. She finally had a yoke put around\nmy neck, and harnessed me to the plough.\n\nThen her black demons drove me out into the field. One of them held\nthe plough, the other one led me by a line, the third applied the\nwhip, and Venus in Furs stood to one side and looked on.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I was serving dinner on the following day Wanda said: \"Bring\nanother cover, I want you to dine with me to-day,\" and when I was\nabout to sit down opposite her, she added, \"No, over here, close by\nmy side.\"\n\nShe is in the best of humors, gives me soup with her spoon, feeds me\nwith her fork, and places her head on the table like a playful kitten\nand flirts with me. I have the misfortune of looking at Haydee, who\nserves in my place, perhaps a little longer than is necessary. It is\nonly now that I noticed her noble, almost European cast of\ncountenance and her magnificent statuesque bust, which is as if hewn\nout of black marble. The black devil observes that she pleases me,\nand, grinning, shows her teeth. She has hardly left the room, before\nWanda leaps up in a rage.\n\n\"What, you dare to look at another woman besides me! Perhaps you\nlike her even better than you do me, she is even more demonic!\"\n\nI am frightened; I have never seen her like this before; she is\nsuddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles. Venus in\nFurs is jealous of her slave. She snatches the whip from its hook and\nstrikes me in the face; then she calls her black servants, who bind\nme, and carry me down into the cellar, where they throw me into a\ndark, dank, subterranean compartment, a veritable prison-cell.\n\nThen the lock of the door clicks, the bolts are drawn, a key sings\nin the lock. I am a prisoner, buried.\n\nI have been lying here for I don't know how long, bound like a calf\nabout to be hauled to the slaughter, on a bundle of damp straw,\nwithout any light, without food, without drink, without sleep. It\nwould be like her to let me starve to death, if I don't freeze to\ndeath before then. I am shaking with cold. Or is it fever? I believe\nI am beginning to hate this woman.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA red streak, like blood, floods across the floor; it is a light\nfalling through the door which is now thrust open.\n\nWanda appears on the threshold, wrapped in her sables, holding a\nlighted torch.\n\n\"Are you still alive?\" she asks.\n\n\"Are you coming to kill me?\" I reply with a low, hoarse voice.\n\nWith two rapid strides Wanda reaches my side, she kneels down beside\nme, and places my head in her lap. \"Are you ill? Your eyes glow so,\ndo you love me? I want you to love me.\"\n\nShe draws forth a short dagger. I start with fright when its blade\ngleams in front of my eyes. I actually believe that she is about to\nkill me. She laughs, and cuts the ropes that bind me.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery evening after dinner she now has me called. I have to read to\nher, and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and\nsubjects. She seems entirely transformed; it is as if she were\nashamed of the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty\nwith which she treated me. A touching gentleness transfigures her\nentire being, and when at the good-night she gives me her hand, a\nsuperhuman power of goodness and love lies in her eyes, of the kind\nwhich calls forth tears in us and causes us to forget all the\nmiseries of existence and all the terrors of death.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI am reading _Manon l'Escault_ to her. She feels the association, she\ndoesn't say a word, but she smiles from time to time, and finally she\nshuts up the little book.\n\n\"Don't you want to go on reading?\"\n\n\"Not to-day. We will ourselves act _Manon l'Escault_ to-day. I have a\nrendezvous in the Cascine, and you, my dear Chevalier, will accompany\nme; I know, you will do it, won't you?\"\n\n\"You command it.\"\n\n\"I do not command it, I beg it of you,\" she says with irresistible\ncharm. She then rises, puts her hands on my shoulders, and looks at\nme.\n\n\"Your eyes!\" she exclaims. \"I love you, Severin, you have no idea\nhow I love you!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have!\" I replied bitterly, \"so much so that you have\narranged for a rendezvous with some one else.\"\n\n\"I do this only to allure you the more,\" she replied vivaciously. \"I\nmust have admirers, so as not to lose you. I don't ever want to lose\nyou, never, do you hear, for I love only you, you alone.\"\n\nShe clung passionately to my lips.\n\n\"Oh, if I only could, as I would, give you all of my soul in a kiss--\nthus--but now come.\"\n\nShe slipped into a simple black velvet coat, and put a dark _bashlyk_\n[Footnote: A kind of Russian cap.] on her head. Then she rapidly went\nthrough the gallery, and entered the carriage.\n\n\"Gregor will drive,\" she called out to the coachman who withdrew in\nsurprise.\n\nI ascended the driver's seat, and angrily whipped up the horses.\n\nIn the Cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path, Wanda\ngot out. It was night, only occasional stars shone through the gray\nclouds that fled across the sky. By the bank of the Arno stood a man\nin a dark cloak, with a brigand's hat, and looked at the yellow\nwaves. Wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery, and tapped him on\nthe shoulder. I saw him turn and seize her hand, and then they\ndisappeared behind the green wall.\n\nAn hour full of torments. Finally there was a rustling in the bushes\nto one side, and they returned.\n\nThe man accompanied her to the carriage. The light of the lamp fell\nfull and glaringly upon an infinitely young, soft and dreamy face\nwhich I had never before seen, and played in his long, blond curls.\n\nShe held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect, then she\nsignaled to me, and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy\nwall which follows the river like a long green screen.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bell at the garden-gate rings. It is a familiar face. The man\nfrom the Cascine.\n\n\"Whom shall I announce?\" I ask him in French. He timidly shakes his\nhead.\n\n\"Do you, perhaps, understand some German?\" he asks shyly.\n\n\"Yes. Your name, please.\"\n\n\"Oh! I haven't any yet,\" he replies, embarrassed--\"Tell your\nmistress the German painter from the Cascine is here and would like--\nbut there she is herself.\"\n\nWanda had stepped out on the balcony, and nodded toward the stranger.\n\n\"Gregor, show the gentleman in!\" she called to me.\n\nI showed the painter the stairs.\n\n\"Thanks, I'll find her now, thanks, thanks very much.\" He ran up the\nsteps. I remained standing below, and looked with deep pity on the\npoor German.\n\nVenus in Furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair. He will\npaint her, and go mad.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is a sunny winter's day. Something that looks like gold trembles\non the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level\nof the meadow. The camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious\nin their abundant buds. Wanda is sitting in the loggia; she is\ndrawing. The German painter stands opposite her with his hands folded\nas in adoration, and looks at her. No, he rather looks at her face,\nand is entirely absorbed in it, enraptured.\n\nBut she does not see him, neither does she see me, who with the\nspade in my hand am turning over the flower-bed, solely that I may\nsee her and feel her nearness, which produces an effect on me like\npoetry, like music.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe painter has gone. It is a hazardous thing to do, but I risk it.\nI go up to the gallery, quite close, and ask Wanda \"Do you love the\npainter, mistress?\"\n\nShe looks at me without getting angry, shakes her head, and finally\neven smiles.\n\n\"I feel sorry for him,\" she replies, \"but I do not love him. I love no\none. _I used to love you, as ardently, as passionately, as deeply as\nit was possible for me to love,_ but now I don't love even you any\nmore; my heart is a void, dead, and this makes me sad.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I exclaimed, deeply moved.\n\n\"Soon, you too will no longer love me,\" she continued, \"tell me when\nyou have reached that point, and I will give back to you your\nfreedom.\"\n\n\"Then I shall remain your slave, all my life long, for I adore you\nand shall always adore you,\" I cried, seized by that fanaticism of\nlove which has repeatedly been so fatal to me.\n\nWanda looked at me with a curious pleasure. \"Consider well what you\ndo,\" she said. \"I have loved you infinitely and have been despotic\ntowards you so that I might fulfil your dream. Something of my old\nfeeling, a sort of real sympathy for you, still trembles in my\nbreast. When that too has gone who knows whether then I shall give\nyou your liberty; whether I shall not then become really cruel,\nmerciless, even brutal toward; whether I shall not take a diabolical\npleasure in tormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships\nme idolatrously, the while I remain indifferent or love someone else;\nperhaps, I shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me. Consider\nthis well.\"\n\n\"I have long since considered all that,\" I replied as in a glow of\nfever. \"I cannot exist, cannot live without you; I shall die if you\nset me at liberty; let me remain your slave, kill me, but do not\ndrive me away.\"\n\n\"Very well then, be my slave,\" she replied, \"but don't forget that\nI no longer love you, and your love doesn't mean any more to me than\na dog's, and dogs are kicked.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day I visited the Venus of Medici.\n\nIt was still early, and the little octagonal room in the Tribuna was\nfilled with half-lights like a sanctuary; I stood with folded hands\nin deep adoration before the silent image of the divinity.\n\nBut I did not stand for long.\n\nNot a human soul was in the gallery, not even an Englishman, and I\nfell down on my knees. I looked up at the lovely slender body, the\nbudding breasts, the virginal and yet voluptuous face, the fragrant\ncurls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMy mistress's bell.\n\nIt is noonday. She, however, is still abed with her arms intertwined\nbehind her neck.\n\n\"I want to bathe,\" she says, \"and you will attend me. Lock the door!\"\n\nI obey.\n\n\"Now go downstairs and make sure the door below is also locked.\"\n\nI descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the\nbath; my feet gave way beneath me, and I had to support myself\nagainst the iron banister. After having ascertained that the door\nleading to the Loggia and the garden was locked, I returned. Wanda\nwas now sitting on the bed with loosened hair, wrapped in her green\nvelvet furs. When she made a rapid movement, I noticed that the furs\nwere her only covering. It made me start terribly, I don't know why?\nI was like one condemned to death, who knows he is on the way to the\nscaffold, and yet begins to tremble when he sees it.\n\n\"Come, Gregor, take me on your arms.\"\n\n\"You mean, mistress?\"\n\n\"You are to carry me, don't you understand?\"\n\nI lifted her up, so that she rested in my arms, while she twined\nhers around my neck. Slowly, step by step, I went down the stairs\nwith her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her\nfoot sought support against my knee. I trembled under the beautiful\nburden I was carrying, and every moment it seemed as if I had to\nbreak down beneath it.\n\nThe bath consisted of a wide, high rotunda, which received a soft\nquiet light from a red glass cupola above. Two palms extended their\nbroad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions. From here\nsteps covered with Turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which\noccupied the center.\n\n\"There is a green ribbon on my toilet-table upstairs,\" said Wanda,\nas I let her down on the couch, \"go get it, and also bring the whip.\"\n\nI flew upstairs and back again, and kneeling put both in my mistress's\nhands. She then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot\nwhich I fastened with the green ribbon. Then I prepared the bath. I did\nthis very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me. Again\nand again I had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet\ncushions, and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and\nthere beneath the furs. Some magnetic power stronger than my will\ncompelled me to look. I felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies in\nthat which is half-concealed or intentionally disclosed; and the truth\nof this I recognized even more acutely, when the basin at last was full,\nand Wanda threw off the fur-cloak with a single gesture, and stood\nbefore me like the goddess in the Tribuna.\n\nAt that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled\nbeauty, as did the divinity of long ago. I sank down on my knees\nbefore her, and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot.\n\nMy soul which had been storm-tossed only a little while earlier,\nsuddenly was perfectly calm, and I now felt no element of cruelty in\nWanda.\n\nShe slowly descended the stairs, and I could watch her with a\ncalmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire was\nintermingled. I could see her plunge into and rise out of the\ncrystalline water, and the wavelets which she herself raised played\nabout her like tender lovers.\n\nOur nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says: a real apple is\nmore beautiful than a painted one, and a living woman is more\nbeautiful than a Venus of stone.\n\nAnd when she left the bath, and the silvery drops and the roseate\nlight rippled down her body, I was seized with silent rapture. I\nwrapped the linen sheets about her, drying her glorious body. The\ncalm bliss remained with me, even now when one foot upon me as upon\na footstool, she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak.\nThe lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marble-like body.\nHer left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan\nin the dark fur of the sleeve, while her left hand played carelessly\nwith the whip.\n\nBy chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite,\nand I cried out, for I saw the two of us in its golden frame as in\na picture. The picture was so marvellously beautiful, so strange, so\nimaginative, that I was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that\nits lines and colors would have to dissolve like mist.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.\n\nI pointed to the mirror.\n\n\"Ah, that is really beautiful,\" she exclaimed, \"too bad one can't\ncapture the moment and make it permanent.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" I asked. \"Would not any artist, even the most famous,\nbe proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by\nmeans of his brush.\n\n\"The very thought that this extra-ordinary beauty is to be lost to\nthe world,\" I continued still watching her enthusiastically, \"is\nhorrible--all this glorious facial expression, this mysterious eye\nwith its green fires, this demonic hair, this magnificence of body.\nThe idea fills me with a horror of death, of annihilation. But the\nhand of an artist shall snatch you from this. You shall not like the\nrest of us disappear absolutely and forever, without leaving a trace\nof your having been. Your picture must live, even when you yourself\nhave long fallen to dust; your beauty must triumph beyond death!\"\n\nWanda smiled.\n\n\"Too bad, that present-day Italy hasn't a Titian or Raphael,\" she\nsaid, \"but, perhaps, love will make amends for genius, who knows; our\nlittle German might do?\" She pondered.\n\n\"Yes, he shall paint you, and I will see to it that the god of love\nmixes his colors.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young painter has established his studio in her villa; he is\ncompletely in her net. He has just begun a Madonna, a Madonna with\nred hair and green eyes! Only the idealism of a German would attempt\nto use this thorough-bred woman as a model for a picture of\nvirginity. The poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than I\nam. Our misfortune is that our Titania has discovered our ass's ears\ntoo soon.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nNow she laughs derisively at us, and how she laughs! I hear her\ninsolent melodious laughter in his studio, under the open window of\nwhich I stand, jealously listening.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Are you mad, me--ah, it is unbelievable, me as the Mother of God!\"\nshe exclaimed and laughed again. \"Wait a moment, I will show you\nanother picture of myself, one that I myself have painted, and you\nshall copy it.\"\n\nHer head appeared in the window, luminous like a flame under the\nsunlight.\n\n\"Gregor!\"\n\nI hurried up the stairs, through the gallery, into the studio.\n\n\"Lead him to the bath,\" Wanda commanded, while she herself hurried\naway.\n\nA few moments passed and Wanda arrived; dressed in nothing but the\nsable fur, with the whip in her hand; she descended the stairs and\nstretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion. I lay\nat her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me; her right hand\nplayed with the whip. \"Look at me,\" she said, \"with your deep,\nfanatical look, that's it.\"\n\nThe painter had turned terribly pale. He devoured the scene with his\nbeautiful dreamy blue eyes; his lips opened, but he remained dumb.\n\n\"Well, how do you like the picture?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is how I want to paint you,\" said the German, but it was\nreally not a spoken language; it was the eloquent moaning, the\nweeping of a sick soul, a soul sick unto death.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe charcoal outline of the painting is done; the heads and flesh\nparts are painted in. Her diabolical face is already becoming visible\nunder a few bold strokes, life flashes in her green eyes.\n\nWanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her\nbreast.\n\n\"This picture, like many of those of the Venetian school, is\nsimultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story,\"\nexplained the painter, who again had become pale as death.\n\n\"And what will you call it?\" she asked, \"but what is the matter with\nyou, are you ill?\"\n\n\"I am afraid--\" he answered with a consuming look fixed on the\nbeautiful woman in furs, \"but let us talk of the picture.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us talk about the picture.\"\n\n\"I imagine the goddess of love as having descended from Mount Olympus\nfor the sake of some mortal man. And always cold in this modern world\nof ours, she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur\nand her feet in the lap of her lover. I imagine the favorite of a\nbeautiful despot, who whips her slave, when she is tired of kissing\nhim, and the more she treads him underfoot, the more insanely he loves\nher. And so I shall call the picture: _Venus in Furs_.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe painter paints slowly, but his passion grows more and more\nrapidly. I am afraid he will end up by committing suicide. She plays\nwith him and propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve, and he\nfeels his blood congealing in the process, but it amuses her.\n\nDuring the sitting she nibbles at candies, and rolls the paper-wrappers\ninto little pellets with which she bombards him.\n\n\"I am glad you are in such good humor,\" said the painter, \"but your face\nhas lost the expression which I need for my picture.\"\n\n\"The expression which you need for your picture,\" she replied,\nsmiling. \"Wait a moment.\"\n\nShe rose, and dealt me a blow with the whip. The painter looked at\nher with stupefaction, and a child-like surprise showed on his face,\nmingled with disgust and admiration.\n\nWhile whipping me, Wanda's face acquired more and more of the cruel,\ncontemptuous character, which so haunts and intoxicates me.\n\n\"Is this the expression you need for your picture?\" she exclaimed.\nThe painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her\neye.\n\n\"It is the expression--\" he stammered, \"but I can't paint now--\"\n\n\"What?\" said Wanda, scornfully, \"perhaps I can help you?\"\n\n\"Yes--\" cried the German, as if taken with madness, \"whip me too.\"\n\n\"Oh! With pleasure,\" she replied, shrugging her shoulders, \"but if\nI am to whip you I want to do it in sober earnest.\"\n\n\"Whip me to death,\" cried the painter.\n\n\"Will you let me tie you?\" she asked, smiling.\n\n\"Yes--\" he moaned--\n\nWanda left the room for a moment, and returned with ropes.\n\n\"Well--are you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of\nVenus in Furs, the beautiful despot, for better or worse?\" she began\nironically.\n\n\"Yes, tie me,\" the painter replied dully. Wanda tied his hands on\nhis back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his\nbody, and fettered him to the cross-bars of the window. Then she\nrolled back the fur, seized the whip, and stepped in front of him.\n\nThe scene had a grim attraction for me, which I cannot describe. I\nfelt my heart beat, when, with a smile, she drew back her arm for the\nfirst blow, and the whip hissed through the air. He winced slightly\nunder the blow. Then she let blow after blow rain upon him, with her\nmouth half-opened and her teeth flashing between her red lips, until\nhe finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous, blue eyes. It\nwas indescribable.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe is sitting for him now, alone. He is working on her head.\n\nShe has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain,\nwhere I can't be seen, but can see everything.\n\nWhat does she intend now?\n\nIs she afraid of him? She has driven him insane enough to be sure,\nor is she hatching a new torment for me? My knees tremble.\n\nThey are talking. He has lowered his voice so that I cannot\nunderstand a word, and she replies in the same way. What is the\nmeaning of this? Is there an understanding between them?\n\nI suffer frightful torments; my heart seems about to burst.\n\nHe kneels down before her, embraces her, and presses his head\nagainst her breast, and she--in her heartlessness--laughs--and now\nI hear her saying aloud:\n\n\"Ah! You need another application of the whip.\"\n\n\"Woman! Goddess! Are you without a heart--can't you love,\" exclaimed\nthe German, \"don't you even know, what it means to love, to be\nconsumed with desire and passion, can't you even imagine what I\nsuffer? Have you no pity for me?\"\n\n\"No!\" she replied proudly and mockingly, \"but I have the whip.\"\n\nShe drew it quickly from the pocket of her fur-coat, and struck him\nin the face with the handle. He rose, and drew back a couple of paces.\n\n\"Now, are you ready to paint again?\" she asked indifferently. He did\nnot reply, but again went to the easel and took up his brush and\npalette.\n\nThe painting is marvellously successful. It is a portrait which as\nfar as the likeness goes couldn't be better, and at the same time it\nseems to have an ideal quality. The colors glow, are supernatural;\nalmost diabolical, I would call them.\n\nThe painter has put all his sufferings, his adoration, and all his\nexecration into the picture.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nNow he is painting me; we are alone together for several hours every\nday. To-day he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said:\n\n\"You love this woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I also love her.\" His eyes were bathed in tears. He remained silent\nfor a while, and continued painting.\n\n\"We have a mountain at home in Germany within which she dwells,\" he\nmurmured to himself. \"She is a demon.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe picture is finished. She insisted on paying him for it,\nmunificently, in the manner of queens.\n\n\"Oh, you have already paid me,\" he said, with a tormented smile,\nrefusing her offer.\n\nBefore he left, he secretly opened his portfolio, and let me look\ninside. I was startled. Her head looked at me as if out of a mirror\nand seemed actually to be alive.\n\n\"I shall take it along,\" he said, \"it is mine; she can't take it\naway from me. I have earned it with my heart's blood.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I am really rather sorry for the poor painter,\" she said to me to-day,\n\"it is absurd to be as virtuous as I am. Don't you think so too?\"\n\nI did not dare to reply to her.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot that I am talking with a slave; I need some fresh air,\nI want to be diverted, I want to forget.\n\n\"The carriage, quick!\"\n\nHer new dress is extravagant: Russian half-boots of violet-blue\nvelvet trimmed with ermine, and a skirt of the same material,\ndecorated with narrow stripes and rosettes of furs. Above it is an\nappropriate, close-fitting jacket, also richly trimmed and lined with\nermine. The headdress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of\nCatherine the Second, with a small aigrette, held in place by a\ndiamond-agraffe; her red hair falls loose down her back. She ascends\non the driver's seat, and holds the reins herself; I take my seat\nbehind. How she lashes on the horses! The carriage flies along like\nmad.\n\nApparently it is her intention to attract attention to-day, to make\nconquests, and she succeeds completely. She is the lioness of the\nCascine. People nod to her from carriages; on the footpath people\ngather in groups to discuss her. She pays no attention to anyone,\nexcept now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen\nwith a slight nod.\n\nSuddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed.\nAs soon as he sees Wanda, he stops his horse and makes it walk. When\nhe is quite close, he stops entirely and lets her pass. And she too\nsees him--the lioness, the lion. Their eyes meet. She madly drives\npast him, but she cannot tear herself free from the magic power of\nhis look, and she turns her head after him.\n\nMy heart stops when I see the half-surprised, half-enraptured look\nwith which she devours him, but he is worthy of it.\n\nFor he is, indeed, a magnificent specimen of man, No, rather, he is\na man whose like I have never yet seen among the living. He is in the\nBelvedere, graven in marble, with the same slender, yet steely\nmusculature, with the same face and the same waving curls. What makes\nhim particularly beautiful is that he is beardless. If his hips were\nless narrow, one might take him for a woman in disguise. The curious\nexpression about the mouth, the lion's lip which slightly discloses\nthe teeth beneath, lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful\nface--\n\nApollo flaying Marsyas.\n\nHe wears high black boots, closely fitting breeches of white\nleather, short fur coat of black cloth, of the kind worn by Italian\ncavalry officers, trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops; on his\nblack locks is a red fez.\n\nI now understand the masculine Eros, and I marvel at Socrates for\nhaving remained virtuous in view of an Alcibiades like this.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have never seen my lioness so excited. Her cheeks flamed when she\nleft from the carriage at her villa. She hurried upstairs, and with\nan imperious gesture ordered me to follow.\n\nWalking up and down her room with long strides, she began to talk so\nrapidly, that I was frightened.\n\n\"You are to find out who the man in the Cascine was, immediately--\n\n\"Oh, what a man! Did you see him? What do you think of him? Tell me.\"\n\n\"The man is beautiful,\" I replied dully.\n\n\"He is so beautiful,\" she paused, supporting herself on the arm of\na chair, \"that he has taken my breath away.\"\n\n\"I can understand the impression he has made on you,\" I replied, my\nimagination carrying me away in a mad whirl. \"I am quite lost in\nadmiration myself, and I can imagine--\"\n\n\"You may imagine,\" she laughed aloud, \"that this man is my lover,\nand that he will apply the lash to you, and that you will enjoy being\npunished by him.\n\n\"But now go, go.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore evening fell, I had the desired information.\n\nWanda was still fully dressed when I returned. She reclined on the\nottoman, her face buried in her hands, her hair in a wild tangle,\nlike the red mane of a lioness.\n\n\"What is his name?\" she asked, uncanny calm.\n\n\"Alexis Papadopolis.\"\n\n\"A Greek, then,\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"He is very young?\"\n\n\"Scarcely older than you. They say he was educated in Paris, and\nthat he is an atheist. He fought against the Turks in Candia, and is\nsaid to have distinguished himself there no less by his race-hatred\nand cruelty, than by his bravery.\"\n\n\"All in all, then, a man,\" she cried with sparkling eyes.\n\n\"At present he is living in Florence,\" I continued, \"he is said to\nbe tremendously rich--\"\n\n\"I didn't ask you about that,\" she interrupted quickly and sharply.\n\"The man is dangerous. Aren't you afraid of him? I am afraid of him.\nHas he a wife?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A mistress?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What theaters does he attend?\"\n\n\"To-night he will be at the Nicolini Theater, where Virginia Marini\nand Salvini are acting; they are the greatest living artists in\nItaly, perhaps in Europe.\n\n\"See that you get a box--and be quick about it!\" she commanded.\n\n\"But, mistress--\"\n\n\"Do you want a taste of the whip?\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You can wait down in the lobby,\" she said when I had placed the\nopera-glasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted\nthe footstool.\n\nI am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so\nas not to fall down with envy and rage--no, rage isn't the right\nword; it was a mortal fear.\n\nI saw her in her box dressed in blue moire, with a huge ermine cloak\nabout her bare shoulders; he sat opposite. I saw them devour each\nother with their eyes. For both of them the stage, Goldoni's _Pamela,_\nSalvini, Marini, the public, even the entire world, were non-existant\nto-night. And I--what was I at that moment?--\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day she is attending the ball at the Greek ambassador's. Does she\nknow, that she will meet him there?\n\nAt any rate she dressed, as if she did. A heavy sea-green silk dress\nplastically encloses her divine form, leaving the bust and arms bare. In\nher hair, which is done into a single flaming knot, a white water-lily\nblossoms; from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few loose\nstrands fall down toward her neck. There no longer is any trace of\nagitation or trembling feverishness in her being. She is calm, so calm,\nthat I feel my blood congealing and my heart growing cold under her\nglance. Slowly, with a weary, indolent majesty, she ascends the marble\nstaircase, lets her precious wrap slide off, and listlessly enters the\nhall, where the smoke of a hundred candles has formed a silvery mist.\n\nFor a few moments my eyes follow her in a daze, then I pick up her\nfurs, which without my being aware, had slipped from my hands. They\nare still warm from her shoulders.\n\nI kiss the spot, and my eyes fill with tears.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nHe has arrived.\n\nIn his black velvet coat extravagantly trimmed with sable, he is a\nbeautiful, haughty despot who plays with the lives and souls of men.\nHe stands in the ante-room, looking around proudly, and his eyes rest\non me for an uncomfortably long time.\n\nUnder his icy glance I am again seized by a mortal fear. I have a\npresentiment that this man can enchain her, captivate her, subjugate\nher, and I feel inferior in contrast with his savage masculinity; I\nam filled with envy, with jealousy.\n\nI feel that I am a queer weakly creature of brains, merely! And what\nis most humiliating, I want to hate him, but I can't. Why is that\namong all the host of servants he has chosen me.\n\nWith an inimitably aristocratic nod of the head he calls me over to\nhim, and I--I obey his call--against my own will.\n\n\"Take my furs,\" he quickly commands.\n\nMy entire body trembles with resentment, but I obey, abjectly like\na slave.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll night long I waited in the ante-room, raving as in a fever.\nStrange images hovered past my inner eye. I saw their meeting--their\nlong exchange of looks. I saw her float through the hall in his arms,\ndrunken, lying with half-closed lids against his breast. I saw him\nin the holy of holies of love, lying on the ottoman, not as slave,\nbut as master, and she at his feet. On my knees I served them, the\ntea-tray faltering in my hands, and I saw him reach for the whip.\nBut now the servants are talking about him.\n\nHe is a man who is like a woman; he knows that he is beautiful, and\nhe acts accordingly. He changes his clothes four or five times a day,\nlike a vain courtesan.\n\nIn Paris he appeared first in woman's dress, and the men assailed\nhim with love-letters. An Italian singer, famous equally for his art\nand his passionate intensity, even invaded his home, and lying on his\nknees before him threatened to commit suicide if he wouldn't be his.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he replied, smiling, \"I should like to do you the\nfavor, but you will have to carry out your threat, for I am a man.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe drawing-room has already thinned out to a marked degree, but she\napparently has no thought of leaving.\n\nMorning is already peering through the blinds.\n\nAt last I hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows along\nbehind her like green waves. She advances step by step, engaged in\nconversation with him.\n\nI hardly exist for her any longer; she doesn't even trouble to give\nme an order.\n\n\"The cloak for madame,\" he commands. He, of course, doesn't think of\nlooking after her himself.\n\nWhile I put her furs about her, he stands to one side with his arms\ncrossed. While I am on my knees putting on her fur over-shoes, she\nlightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder. She asks:\n\n\"And what about the lioness?\"\n\n\"When the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives is\nattacked by another,\" the Greek went on with his narrative, \"the\nlioness quietly lies down and watches the battle. Even if her mate\nis worsted she does not go to his aid. She looks on indifferently as\nhe bleeds to death under his opponent's claws, and follows the victor,\nthe stronger--that is the female's nature.\"\n\nAt this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at me.\n\nIt made me shudder, though I didn't know why--and the red dawn\nimmerses me and her and him in blood.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe did not go to bed, but merely threw off her ball-dress and undid\nher hair; then she ordered me to build a fire, and she sat by the\nfire-place, and stared into the flames.\n\n\"Do you need me any longer, mistress?\" I asked, my voice failed me\nat the last word.\n\nWanda shook her head.\n\nI left the room, passed through the gallery, and sat down on one of\nthe steps, leading from there down into the garden. A gentle north\nwind brought a fresh, damp coolness from the Arno, the green hills\nextended into the distance in a rosy mist, a golden haze hovered over\nthe city, over the round cupola of the Duomo.\n\nA few stars still tremble in the pale-blue sky.\n\nI tore open my coat, and pressed my burning forehead against the\nmarble. Everything that had happened so far seemed to me a mere\nchild's play; but now things were beginning to be serious, terribly\nserious.\n\nI anticipated a catastrophe, I visualized it, I could lay hold of it\nwith my hands, but I lacked the courage to meet it. My strength was\nbroken. And if I am honest with myself, neither the pains and\nsufferings that threatened me, not the humiliations that impended,\nwere the thing that frightened me.\n\nI merely felt a fear, the fear of losing her whom I loved with a\nsort of fanatical devotion; but it was so overwhelming, so crushing\nthat I suddenly began to sob like a child.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the day she remained locked in her room, and had the negress\nattend her. When the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky, I saw\nher pass through the garden, and, carefully following her at a\ndistance, watched her enter the shrine of Venus. I stealthily\nfollowed and peered through the chink in the door.\n\nShe stood before the divine image of the goddess, her hands folded\nas in prayer, and the sacred light of the star of love casts its blue\nrays over her.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took such\npowerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me. I\nlighted the little red oil-lamp which hung in the corridor beneath\na saint's image, and entered her bedroom, covering the light with one\nhand.\n\nThe lioness had been hunted and driven until she was exhausted. She\nhad fallen asleep among her pillows, lying on her back, her hands\nclenched, breathing heavily. A dream seemed to oppress her. I slowly\nwithdrew my hand, and let the red light fall full on her wonderful\nface.\n\nBut she did not awaken.\n\nI gently set the lamp on the floor, sank down beside Wanda's bed,\nand rested my head on her soft, glowing arm.\n\nShe moved slightly, but even now did not awaken. I do not know how\nlong I lay thus in the middle of the night, turned as into a stone\nby horrible torments.\n\nFinally a severe trembling seized me, and I was able to cry. My\ntears flowed over her arm. She quivered several times and finally sat\nup; she brushed her hand across her eyes, and looked at me.\n\n\"Severin,\" she exclaimed, more frightened than angry.\n\nI was unable to reply.\n\n\"Severin,\" she continued softly, \"what is the matter? Are you ill?\"\n\nHer voice sounded so sympathetic, so kind, so full of love, that it\nclutched my breast like red-hot tongs and I began to sob aloud.\n\n\"Severin,\" she began anew. \"My poor unhappy friend.\" Her hand gently\nstroked my hair. \"I am sorry, very sorry for you; but I can't help\nyou; with the best intention in the world I know of nothing that\nwould cure you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Wanda, must it be?\" I moaned in my agony.\n\n\"What, Severin? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any more?\" I continued. \"Haven't you even a\nlittle bit of pity for me? Has the beautiful stranger taken complete\npossession of you?\"\n\n\"I cannot lie,\" she replied softly after a short pause. \"He has made\nan impression on me which I haven't yet been able to analyse, further\nthan that I suffer and tremble beneath it. It is an impression of the\nsort I have met with in the works of poets or on the stage, but I\nalways thought it was a figment of the imagination. Oh, he is a man\nlike a lion, strong and beautiful and yet gentle, not brutal like the\nmen of our northern world. I am sorry for you, Severin, I am; but I\nmust possess him. What am I saying? I must give myself to him, if he\nwill have me.\"\n\n\"Consider your reputation, Wanda, which so far has remained\nspotless,\" I exclaimed, \"even if I no longer mean anything to you.\"\n\n\"I am considering it,\" she replied, \"I intend to be strong, as long\nas it is possible, I want--\" she buried her head shyly in the pillows\n--\"I want to become his wife--if he will have me.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I cried, seized again by that mortal fear, which always\nrobs me of my breath, makes me lose possession of myself, \"you want\nto be his wife, belong to him for always. Oh! Do not drive me away!\nHe does not love you--\"\n\n\"Who says that?\" she exclaimed, flaring up.\n\n\"He does not love you,\" I went on passionately, \"but I love you, I\nadore you, I am your slave, I let you tread me underfoot, I want to\ncarry you on my arms through life.\"\n\n\"Who says that he doesn't love me?\" she interrupted vehemently.\n\n\"Oh! be mine,\" I replied, \"be mine! I cannot exist, cannot live\nwithout you. Have mercy on me, Wanda, have mercy!\"\n\nShe looked at me again, and her face had her cold heartless\nexpression, her evil smile.\n\n\"You say he doesn't love me,\" she said, scornfully. \"Very well then,\nget what consolation you can out of it.\"\n\nWith this she turned over on the other side, and contemptuously\nshowed me her back.\n\n\"Good God, are you a woman without flesh or blood, haven't you a\nheart as well as I!\" I cried, while my breast heaved convulsively.\n\n\"You know what I am,\" she replied, coldly. \"I am a woman of stone,\n_Venus in Furs_, your ideal, kneel down, and pray to me.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I implored, \"mercy!\"\n\nShe began to laugh. I buried my face in her pillows. Pain had\nloosened the floodgates of my tears and I let them flow.\n\nFor a long time silence reigned, then Wanda slowly raised herself.\n\n\"You bore me,\" she began.\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"I am tired, let me go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Mercy,\" I implored. \"Do not drive me away. No man, no one, will\nlove you as I do.\"\n\n\"Let me go to sleep,\"--she turned her back to me again.\n\nI leaped up, and snatched the poinard, which hung beside her bed,\nfrom its sheath, and placed its point against my breast.\n\n\"I shall kill myself here before your eyes,\" I murmured dully.\n\n\"Do what you please,\" Wanda replied with complete indifference. \"But\nlet me go to sleep.\" She yawned aloud. \"I am very sleepy.\"\n\nFor a moment I stood as if petrified. Then I began to laugh and cry\nat the same time. Finally I placed the poinard in my belt, and again\nfell on my knees before her.\n\n\"Wanda, listen to me, only for a few moments,\" I begged.\n\n\"I want to go to sleep! Don't you hear!\" she cried, leaping angrily\nout of bed and pushing me away with her foot. \"You forget that I am\nyour mistress?\" When I didn't budge, she seized the whip and struck\nme. I rose; she struck me again--this time right in the face.\n\n\"Wretch, slave!\"\n\nWith clenched fist held heavenward, I left her bedroom with a sudden\nresolve. She tossed the whip aside, and broke out into clear\nlaughter. I can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have been\nvery droll.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman, who\nhas treated me so cruelly, and is now about to break faith and betray\nme, as a reward for all my slavish devotion, for everything I have\nsuffered from her. I packed my few belongings into a bundle, and then\nwrote her as follows:\n\n\"Dear Madam,--\n\nI have loved you even to madness, I have given myself to you as no man\never has given himself to a woman. You have abused my most sacred\nemotions, and played an impudent, frivolous game with me. However, as\nlong as you were merely cruel and merciless, it was still possible for\nme to love you. Now you are about to become _cheap_. I am no longer\nthe slave whom you can kick about and whip. You yourself have set me\nfree, and I am leaving a woman I can only hate and despise.\n\nSeverin Kusiemski.\"\n\nI handed these lines to the negress, and hastened away as fast as I\ncould go. I arrived at the railway-station all out of breath.\nSuddenly I felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped. I began to\nweep. It is humiliating that I want to flee and I can't. I turn back--\nwhither?--to her, whom I abhor, and yet, at the same time, adore.\n\nAgain I pause. I cannot go back. I dare not.\n\nBut how am I to leave Florence. I remember that I haven't any money,\nnot a penny. Very well then, on foot; it is better to be an honest\nbeggar than to eat the bread of a courtesan.\n\nBut still I can't leave.\n\nShe has my pledge, my word of honor. I have to return. Perhaps she\nwill release me.\n\nAfter a few rapid strides, I stop again.\n\nShe has my word of honor and my bond, that I shall remain her slave\nas long as she desires, until she herself gives me my freedom. But\nI might kill myself.\n\nI go through the Cascine down to the Arno, where its yellow waters\nplash monotonously about a couple of stray willows. There I sit, and\ncast up my final accounts with existence. I let my entire life pass\nbefore me in review. On the whole, it is rather a wretched affair--a\nfew joys, an endless number of indifferent and worthless things, and\nbetween these an abundant harvest of pains, miseries, fears,\ndisappointments, shipwrecked hopes, afflictions, sorrow and grief.\n\nI thought of my mother, whom I loved so deeply and whom I had to\nwatch waste away beneath a horrible disease; of my brother, who full\nof the promise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youth,\nwithout even having put his lips to the cup of life. I thought of my\ndead nurse, my childhood playmates, the friends that had striven and\nstudied with me; of all those, covered by the cold, dead, indifferent\nearth. I thought of my turtle-dove, who not infrequently made his\ncooing bows to me, instead of to his mate.--All have returned, dust\nunto dust.\n\nI laughed aloud, and slid down into the water, but at the same\nmoment I caught hold of one of the willow-branches, hanging above the\nyellow waves. As in a vision, I see the woman who has caused all my\nmisery. She hovers above the level of the water, luminous in the\nsunlight as though she were transparent, with red flames about her\nhead and neck. She turns her face toward me and smiles.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI am back again, dripping, wet through, glowing with shame and\nfever. The negress has delivered my letter; I am judged, lost, in the\npower of a heartless, affronted woman.\n\nWell, let her kill me. I am unable to do it myself, and yet I have\nno wish to go on living.\n\nAs I walk around the house, she is standing in the gallery, leaning\nover the railing. Her face is full in the light of the sun, and her\ngreen eyes sparkle.\n\n\"Still alive?\" she asked, without moving. I stood silent, with bowed\nhead.\n\n\"Give me back my poinard,\" she continued. \"It is of no use to you.\nYou haven't even the courage to take your own life.\"\n\n\"I have lost it,\" I replied, trembling, shaken by chills.\n\nShe looked me over with a proud, scornful glance.\n\n\"I suppose you lost it in the Arno?\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"No\nmatter. Well, and why didn't you leave?\"\n\nI mumbled something which neither she nor I myself could understand.\n\n\"Oh! you haven't any money,\" she cried. \"Here!\" With an\nindescribably disdainful gesture she tossed me her purse.\n\nI did not pick it up.\n\nBoth of us were silent for some time.\n\n\"You don't want to leave then?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWanda drives in the Cascine without me, and goes to the theater\nwithout me; she receives company, and the negress serves her. No one\nasks after me. I stray about the garden, irresolutely, like an animal\nthat has lost its master.\n\nLying among the bushes, I watch a couple of sparrows, fighting over\na seed.\n\nSuddenly I hear the swish of a woman's dress.\n\nWanda approaches in a gown of dark silk, modestly closed up to the\nneck; the Greek is with her. They are in an eager discussion, but I\ncannot as yet understand a word of what they are saying. He stamps\nhis foot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions, and he\nlashes the air with his riding whip. Wanda startles.\n\nIs she afraid that he will strike her?\n\nHave they gone that far?\n\nHe has left her, she calls him; he does not hear her, does not want\nto hear her.\n\nWanda sadly lowers her head, and then sits down on the nearest\nstone-bench. She sits for a long time, lost in thought. I watch her with\na sort of malevolent pleasure, finally I pull myself together by sheer\nforce of will, and ironically step before her. She startles, and\ntrembles all over.\n\n\"I come to wish you happiness,\" I said, bowing, \"I see, my dear\nlady, too, has found a master.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank God!\" she exclaimed, \"not a new slave, I have had enough\nof them. A master! Woman needs a master, and she adores him.\"\n\n\"You adore him, Wanda?\" I cried, \"this brutal person--\"\n\n\"Yes, I love him, as I have never loved any one else.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I clenched my fists, but tears already filled my eyes, and\nI was seized by the delirium of passion, as by a sweet madness. \"Very\nwell, take him as your husband, let him be your master, but I want\nto remain your slave, as long as I live.\"\n\n\"You want to remain my slave, even then?\" she said, \"that would be\ninteresting, but I am afraid he wouldn't permit it.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is already jealous of you,\" she exclaimed, \"he, of you! He\ndemanded that I dismiss you immediately, and when I told him who you\nwere--\"\n\n\"You told him--\" I repeated, thunderstruck.\n\n\"I told him everything,\" she replied, \"our whole story, all your\nqueerness, everything--and he, instead of being amused, grew angry,\nand stamped his foot.\"\n\n\"And threatened to strike you?\"\n\nWanda looked to the ground, and remained silent.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" I said with mocking bitterness, \"you are afraid of\nhim, Wanda!\" I threw myself down at her feet, and in my agitation\nembraced her knees. \"I don't want anything of you, except to be your\nslave, to be always near you! I will be your dog-\"\n\n\"Do you know, you bore me?\" said Wanda, indifferently.\n\nI leaped up. Everything within me was seething.\n\n\"You are now no longer cruel, but cheap,\" I said, clearly and\ndistinctly, accentuating every word.\n\n\"You have already written that in your letter,\" Wanda replied, with\na proud shrug of the shoulders. \"A man of brains should never repeat\nhimself.\"\n\n\"The way you are treating me,\" I broke out, \"what would you call it?\"\n\n\"I might punish you,\" she replied ironically, \"but I prefer this\ntime to reply with reasons instead of lashes. You have no right to\naccuse me. Haven't I always been honest with you? Haven't I warned\nyou more than once? Didn't I love you with all my heart, even\npassionately, and did I conceal the fact from you, that it was\ndangerous to give yourself into my power, to abase yourself before\nme, and that I want to be dominated? But you wished to be my\nplaything, my slave! You found the highest pleasure in feeling the\nfoot, the whip of an arrogant, cruel woman. What do you want now?\n\n\"Dangerous potentialities were slumbering in me, but you were the\nfirst to awaken them. If I now take pleasure in torturing you,\nabusing you, it is your fault; you have made of me what I now am, and\nnow you are even unmanly, weak, and miserable enough to accuse me.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am guilty,\" I said, \"but haven't I suffered because of it?\nLet us put an end now to the cruel game.\"\n\n\"That is my wish, too,\" she replied with a curious deceitful look.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I exclaimed violently, \"don't drive me to extremes; you see\nthat I am a man again.\"\n\n\"A fire of straw,\" she replied, \"which makes a lot of stir for a\nmoment, and goes out as quickly as it flared up. You imagine you can\nintimidate me, and you only make yourself ridiculous. Had you been\nthe man I first thought you were, serious, reserved, stern, I would\nhave loved you faithfully, and become your wife. Woman demands that\nshe can look up to a man, but one like you who voluntarily places his\nneck under her foot, she uses as a welcome plaything, only to toss\nit aside when she is tired of it.\"\n\n\"Try to toss me aside,\" I said, jeeringly. \"Some toys are dangerous.\"\n\n\"Don't challenge me,\" exclaimed Wanda. Her eyes began to flash, and\na flush entered her cheeks.\n\n\"If you won't be mine now,\" I continued, with a voice stifled with\nrage, \"no one else shall possess you either.\"\n\n\"What play is this from?\" she mocked, seizing me by the breast. She\nwas pale with anger at this moment. \"Don't challenge me,\" she\ncontinued, \"I am not cruel, but I don't know whether I may not become\nso and whether then there will be any bounds.\"\n\n\"What worse can you do, than to make your lover, your husband?\" I\nexclaimed, more and more enraged.\n\n\"I might make you _his_ slave,\" she replied quickly, \"are you not in\nmy power? Haven't I the agreement? But, of course, you will merely\ntake pleasure in it, if I have you bound, and say to him.\n\n\"Do with him what you please.\"\n\n\"Woman, are you mad!\" I cried.\n\n\"I am entirely rational,\" she said, calmly. \"I warn you for the last\ntime. Don't offer any resistance, one who has gone as far as I have\ngone might easily go still further. I feel a sort of hatred for you,\nand would find a real joy in seeing him beat you to death; I am still\nrestraining myself, but--\"\n\nScarcely master of myself any longer, I seized her by the wrist and\nforced her to the ground, so that she lay on her knees before me.\n\n\"Severin!\" she cried. Rage and terror were painted on her face.\n\n\"I shall kill you if you marry him,\" I threatened; the words came\nhoarsely and dully from my breast. \"You are mine, I won't let you go,\nI love you too much.\" Then I clutched her and pressed her close to\nme; my right hand involuntarily seized the dagger which I still had\nin my belt.\n\nWanda fixed a large, calm, incomprehensible look on me.\n\n\"I like you that way,\" she said, carelessly. \"Now you are a man, and\nat this moment I know I still love you.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I wept with rapture, and bent down over her, covering her\ndear face with kisses, and she, suddenly breaking into a loud gay\nlaugh, said, \"Have you finished with your ideal now, are you\nsatisfied with me?\"\n\n\"You mean?\" I stammered, \"that you weren't serious?\"\n\n\"I am very serious,\" she gaily continued. \"I love you, only you, and\nyou--you foolish, little man, didn't know that everything was only\nmake-believe and play-acting. How hard it often was for me to strike\nyou with the whip, when I would have rather taken your head and\ncovered it with kisses. But now we are through with that, aren't we?\nI have played my cruel role better than you expected, and now you\nwill be satisfied with my being a good, little wife who isn't\naltogether unattractive. Isn't that so? We will live like rational\npeople--\"\n\n\"You will marry me!\" I cried, overflowing with happiness.\n\n\"Yes--marry you--you dear, darling man,\" whispered Wanda, kissing my\nhands.\n\nI drew her up to my breast.\n\n\"Now, you are no longer Gregor, my slave,\" said she, \"but Severin,\nthe dear man I love--\"\n\n\"And he--you don't love him?\" I asked in agitation.\n\n\"How could you imagine my loving a man of his brutal type? You were\nblind to everything, I was really afraid for you.\"\n\n\"I almost killed myself for your sake.\"\n\n\"Really?\" she cried, \"ah, I still tremble at the thought, that you\nwere already in the Arno.\"\n\n\"But you saved me,\" I replied, tenderly. \"You hovered over the\nwaters and smiled, and your smile called me back to life.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have a curious feeling when I now hold her in my arms and she lies\nsilently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles. I feel\nlike one who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium, or\nlike a shipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves that\nmomentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safe\nshore.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hate this Florence, where you have been so unhappy,\" she\ndeclared, as I was saying good-night to her. \"I want to leave\nimmediately, tomorrow, you will be good enough to write a couple of\nletters for me, and, while you are doing that, I will drive to the\ncity to pay my farewell visits. Is that satisfactory to you?\"\n\n\"Of course, you dear, sweet, beautiful woman.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how I had slept.\nHer tenderness is positively wonderful. I should never have believed\nthat she could be so tender.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe has now been gone for over four hours. I have long since\nfinished the letters, and am now sitting in the gallery, looking down\nthe street to see whether I cannot discover her carriage in the\ndistance. I am a little worried about her, and yet I know there is\nno reason under heaven why I should doubt or fear. However, a feeling\nof oppression weighs me down, and I cannot rid myself of it. It is\nprobably the sufferings of the past days, which still cast their\nshadows into my soul.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe is back, radiant with happiness and contentment.\n\n\"Well, has everything gone as you wished?\" I asked tenderly, kissing\nher hand.\n\n\"Yes, dear heart,\" she replied, \"and we shall leave to-night. Help\nme pack my trunks.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nToward evening she asked me to go to the post-office and mail her\nletters myself. I took her carriage, and was back within an hour.\n\n\"Mistress has asked for you,\" said the negress, with a grin, as I\nascended the wide marble stairs.\n\n\"Has anyone been here?\"\n\n\"No one,\" she replied, crouching down on the steps like a black cat.\n\nI slowly passed through the drawing-room, and then stood before her\nbedroom door.\n\nWhy does my heart beat so? Am I not perfectly happy?\n\nOpening the door softly, I draw back the portiere. Wanda is lying on\nthe ottoman, and does not seem to notice me. How beautiful she looks,\nin her silver-gray dress, which fits closely, and while displaying\nin tell-tale fashion her splendid figure, leaves her wonderful bust\nand arms bare.\n\nHer hair is interwoven with, and held up by a black velvet ribbon.\nA mighty fire is burning in the fire-place, the hanging lamp casts\na reddish glow, and the whole room is as if drowned in blood.\n\n\"Wanda,\" I said at last.\n\n\"Oh Severin,\" she cried out joyously. \"I have been impatiently\nwaiting for you.\" She leaped up, and folded me in her arms. She sat\ndown again on the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to her\nside, but I softly slid down to her feet and placed my head in her\nlap.\n\n\"Do you know I am very much in love with you to-day?\" she whispered,\nbrushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful your eyes are, I have always loved them as the best\nof you, but to-day they fairly intoxicate me. I am all--\" She\nextended her magnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneath\nher red lashes.\n\n\"And you--you are cold--you hold me like a block of wood; wait, I'll\nstir you with the fire of love,\" she said, and again clung fawningly\nand caressingly to my lips.\n\n\"I no longer please you; I suppose I'll have to be cruel to you\nagain, evidently I have been too kind to you to-day. Do you know, you\nlittle fool, what I shall do, I shall whip you for a while--\"\n\n\"But child--\"\n\n\"I want to.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Come, let me bind you,\" she continued, and ran gaily through the\nroom. \"I want to see you very much in love, do you understand? Here\nare the ropes. I wonder if I can still do it?\"\n\nShe began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behind\nmy back, pinioning my arms like those of a prisoner.\n\n\"So,\" she said, with gay eagerness. \"Can you still move?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Fine--\"\n\nShe then tied a noose in a stout rope, threw it over my head, and\nlet it slip down as far as the hips. She drew it tight, and bound me\nto a pillar.\n\nA curious tremor seized me at that moment.\n\n\"I have a feeling as if I were about to be executed,\" I said with a\nlow voice.\n\n\"Well, you shall have a thorough punishment to-day,\" exclaimed Wanda.\n\n\"But put on your fur-jacket, please,\" I said.\n\n\"I shall gladly give you that pleasure,\" she replied. She got her\n_kazabaika_, and put it on. Then she stood in front of me with\nher arms folded across her chest, and looked at me out of half-closed\neyes.\n\n\"Do you remember the story of the ox of Dionysius?\" she asked.\n\n\"I remember it only vaguely, what about it?\"\n\n\"A courtier invented a new implement of torture for the Tyrant of\nSyracuse. It was an iron ox in which those condemned to death were\nto be shut, and then pushed into a mighty furnace.\n\n\"As soon as the iron ox began to get hot, and the condemned person\nbegan to cry out in his torment, his wails sounded like the bellowing\nof an ox.\n\n\"Dionysius nodded graciously to the inventor, and to put his\ninvention to an immediate test had him shut up in the iron ox.\n\n\"It is a very instructive story.\n\n\"It was you who innoculated me with selfishness, pride, and cruelty,\nand _you shall be their first victim._ I now literally enjoy having a\nhuman being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my power;\nI love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than I,\nespecially a man who loves me.\n\n\"Do you still love me?\"\n\n\"Even to madness,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"So much the better,\" she replied, \"and so much the more will you\nenjoy what I am about to do with you now.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" I asked. \"I don't understand you,\nthere is a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes to-day, and you are\nstrangely beautiful--completely _Venus in Furs.\"_\n\nWithout replying Wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed me.\nI was again seized by my fanatical passion.\n\n\"Where is the whip?\" I asked.\n\nWanda laughed, and withdrew a couple of steps.\n\n\"You really insist upon being punished?\" she exclaimed, proudly\ntossing back her head.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSuddenly Wanda's face was completely transformed. It was as if\ndisfigured by rage; for a moment she seemed even ugly to me.\n\n\"Very well, then _you_ whip him!\" she called loudly.\n\nAt the same instant the beautiful Greek stuck his head of black\ncurls through the curtains of her four-poster bed. At first I was\nspeechless, petrified. There was a horribly comic element in the\nsituation. I would have laughed aloud, had not my position been at\nthe same time so terribly cruel and humiliating.\n\nIt went beyond anything I had imagined. A cold shudder ran down my\nback, when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots, his\ntight-fitting white breeches, and his short velvet jacket, and I saw\nhis athletic limbs.\n\n\"You are indeed cruel,\" he said, turning to Wanda.\n\n\"Only inordinately fond of pleasure,\" she replied with a wild sort\nof humor. \"Pleasure alone lends value to existence; whoever enjoys\ndoes not easily part from life, whoever suffers or is needy meets\ndeath like a friend.\n\n\"But whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of the\nancient world; he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of others;\nhe must never feel pity; he must be ready to harness others to his\ncarriage or his plough as though they were animals. He must know how to\nmake slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does, and use them for\nhis service and pleasure without remorse. It is not his affair whether\nthey like it, or whether they go to rack and ruin. He must always\nremember this, that if they had him in their power, as he has them they\nwould act in exactly the same way, and he would have to pay for their\npleasure with his sweat and blood and soul. That was the world of the\nancients: pleasure and cruelty, liberty and slavery went hand in hand.\nPeople who want to live like the gods of Olympus must of necessity have\nslaves whom they can toss into their fish-ponds, and gladiators who will\ndo battle, the while they banquet, and they must not mind if by chance a\nbit of blood bespatters them.\"\n\nHer words brought back my complete self-possession.\n\n\"Unloosen me!\" I exclaimed angrily.\n\n\"Aren't you my slave, my property?\" replied Wanda. \"Do you want me\nto show you the agreement?\"\n\n\"Untie me!\" I threatened, \"otherwise--\" I tugged at the ropes.\n\n\"Can he tear himself free?\" she asked. \"He has threatened to kill me.\"\n\n\"Be entirely at ease,\" said the Greek, testing my fetters.\n\n\"I shall call for help,\" I began again.\n\n\"No one will hear you,\" replied Wanda, \"and no one will hinder me\nfrom abusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous game\nwith you.\" she continued, repeating with satanic mockery phrases from\nmy letter to her.\n\n\"Do you think I am at this moment merely cruel and merciless, or am\nI also about to become cheap? What? Do you still love me, or do you\nalready hate and despise me? Here is the whip--\" She handed it to the\nGreek who quickly stepped closer.\n\n\"Don't you dare!\" I exclaimed, trembling with indignation, \"I won't\npermit it--\"\n\n\"Oh, because I don't wear furs,\" the Greek replied with an ironical\nsmile, and he took his short sable from the bed.\n\n\"You are adorable,\" exclaimed Wanda, kissing him, and helping him\ninto his furs.\n\n\"May I really whip him?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do with him what you please,\" replied Wanda.\n\n\"Beast!\" I exclaimed, utterly revolted.\n\nThe Greek fixed his cold tigerish look upon me and tried out the\nwhip. His muscles swelled when he drew back his arms, and made the\nwhip hiss through the air. I was bound like Marsyas while Apollo was\ngetting ready to flay me.\n\nMy look wandered about the room and remained fixed on the ceiling,\nwhere Samson, lying at Delilah's feet, was about to have his eyes put\nout by the Philistines. The picture at that moment seemed to me like\na symbol, an eternal parable of passion and lust, of the love of man\nfor woman. \"Each one of us in the end is a Samson,\" I thought, \"and\nultimately for better or worse is betrayed by the woman he loves,\nwhether he wears an ordinary coat or sables.\"\n\n\"Now watch me break him in,\" said the Greek. He showed his teeth,\nand his face acquired the blood-thirsty expression, which startled\nme the first time I saw him.\n\nAnd he began to apply the lash--so mercilessly, with such frightful\nforce that I quivered under each blow, and began to tremble all over\nwith pain. Tears rolled down over my cheeks. In the meantime Wanda\nlay on the ottoman in her fur-jacket, supporting herself on her arm;\nshe looked on with cruel curiosity, and was convulsed with laughter.\n\nThe sensation of being whipped by a successful rival before the eyes\nof an adored woman cannot be described. I almost went mad with shame\nand despair.\n\nWhat was most humiliating was that at first I felt a certain wild,\nsupersensual stimulation under Apollo's whip and the cruel laughter\nof my Venus, no matter how horrible my position was. But Apollo\nwhipped on and on, blow after blow, until I forgot all about poetry,\nand finally gritted my teeth in impotent rage, and cursed my wild\ndreams, woman, and love.\n\nAll of a sudden I saw with horrible clarity whither blind passion\nand lust have led man, ever since Holofernes and Agamemnon--into a\nblind alley, into the net of woman's treachery, into misery, slavery,\nand death.\n\nIt was as though I were awakening from a dream.\n\nBlood was already flowing under the whip. I wound like a worm that\nis trodden on, but he whipped on without mercy, and she continued to\nlaugh without mercy. In the meantime she locked her packed trunk and\nslipped into her travelling furs, and was still laughing, when she\nwent downstairs on his arm and entered the carriage.\n\nThen everything was silent for a moment.\n\nI listened breathlessly.\n\nThe carriage door slammed, the horse began to pull--the rolling of\nthe carriage for a short time--then all was over.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment I thought of taking vengeance, of killing him, but I\nwas bound by the abominable agreement. So nothing was left for me to\ndo except to keep my pledged word and grit my teeth.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMy first impulse after this, the most cruel catastrophe of my life,\nwas to seek laborious tasks, dangers, and privations. I wanted to\nbecome a soldier and go to Asia or Algiers, but my father was old and\nill and wanted me.\n\nSo I quietly returned home and for two years helped him bear his\nburdens, and learned how to look after the estate which I had never\ndone before. To _labor_ and to _do my duty_ was comforting like a\ndrink of fresh water. Then my father died, and I inherited the estate,\nbut it meant no change.\n\nI had put on my own Spanish boots and went on living just as\nrationally as if the old man were standing behind me, looking over\nmy shoulder with his large wise eyes.\n\nOne day a box arrived, accompanied by a letter. I recognized Wanda's\nwriting.\n\nCuriously moved, I opened it, and read.\n\n\"Sir.--\n\nNow that over three years have passed since that night in Florence,\nI suppose, I may confess to you that I loved you deeply. You\nyourself, however, stifled my love by your fantastic devotion and\nyour insane passion. From the moment that you became my slave, I knew\nit would be impossible for you ever to become my husband. However,\nI found it interesting to have you realize your ideal in my own person,\nand, while I gloriously amused myself, perhaps, to cure you.\n\nI found the strong man for whom I felt a need, and I was as happy\nwith him as, I suppose, it is possible for any one to be on this\nfunny ball of clay.\n\nBut my happiness, like all things mortal, was of short duration.\nAbout a year ago he fell in a duel, and since then I have been living\nin Paris, like an Aspasia--\n\nAnd you?--Your life surely is not without its sunshine, if you have\ngained control of your imagination, and those qualities in you have\nmaterialized, which at first so attracted me to you--your clarity of\nintellect, kindness of heart, and, above all else, your--_moral\nseriousness_.\n\nI hope you have been cured under my whip; the cure was cruel, but\nradical. In memory of that time and of a woman who loved you\npassionately, I am sending you the portrait by the poor German.\n\n_Venus in Furs_.\"\n\nI had to smile, and as I fell to musing the beautiful woman suddenly\nstood before me in her velvet jacket trimmed with ermine, with the\nwhip in her hand. And I continued to smile at the woman I had once\nloved so insanely, at the fur-jacket that had once so entranced me,\nat the whip, and ended by smiling at myself and saying: The cure was\ncruel, but radical; but the main point is, I have been cured.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And the moral of the story?\" I said to Severin when I put the\nmanuscript down on the table.\n\n\"That I was a donkey,\" he exclaimed without turning around, for he\nseemed to be embarrassed. \"If only I had beaten her!\"\n\n\"A curious remedy,\" I exclaimed, \"which might answer with your\npeasant-women--\"\n\n\"Oh, they are used to it,\" he replied eagerly, \"but imagine the\neffect upon one of our delicate, nervous, hysterical ladies--\"\n\n\"But the moral?\"\n\n\"That woman, as nature has created her and as man is at present\neducating her, is his enemy. She can only be his slave or his despot,\nbut _never his companion._ This she can become only when she has\nthe same rights as he, and is his equal in education and work.\n\n\"At present we have only the choice of being hammer or anvil, and I\nwas the kind of donkey who let a woman make a slave of him, do you\nunderstand?\n\n\"The moral of the tale is this: whoever allows himself to be\nwhipped, deserves to be whipped.\n\n\"The blows, as you see, have agreed with me; the roseate supersensual\nmist has dissolved, and no one can ever make me believe again that\nthese 'sacred apes of Benares' [Footnote: One of Schopenhauer's\ndesignations for women.] or Plato's rooster [Footnote: Diogenes\nthrew a plucked rooster into Plato's school and exclaimed: \"Here\nyou have Plato's human being.\"] are the image of God.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Venus in Furs, by Ritter von Leopold Sacher-Masoch\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VENUS IN FURS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6852-8.txt or 6852-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/6/8/5/6852/\n\nProduced by Avinash Kothare, Tom Allen, Tiffany Vergon,\nCharles Aldarondo, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\nChief Executive and Director\ngbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 502, "api_path": "/songs/141146", "artist_names": "James Joyce", "full_title": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "id": 141146, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 149810, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1654772452, "path": "/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-annotated", "pyongs_count": 10, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1922, "month": 2, "day": 2}, "release_date_for_display": "February 2, 1922", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 2, 1922", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 361, "hot": false, "pageviews": 50072}, "title": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe)", "title_with_featured": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe)", "updated_by_human_at": 1654772453, "url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-15-circe-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22971", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/98f10611fc0aa6a525b9fbcab2ffa297.1000x600x1.jpg", "id": 22971, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9997f2e769ef85b9f941405cac99d1af.570x570x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Joyce", "slug": "James-joyce", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-joyce"}, "artist": "James Joyce", "lyrics": "Ulysses (Chap. 15 - Circe) LyricsThe Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him.

Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.)

After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads. Women whisper eagerly.)\n\nA MILLIONAIRESS (Richly.) Isn't he simply wonderful?\n\nA NOBLEWOMAN (Nobly.) All that man has seen!\n\nA FEMINIST (Masculinely.) And done!\n\nA BELLHANGER A classic face! He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

(He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all!

I call it a sacrament.\n\nALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?\n\nBLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood. No more patriotism of barspongers and dropsical impostors. Free money, free love and a free lay church in a free lay state.\n\nO'MADDEN BURKE Free fox in a free henroost.\n\nDAVY BYRNE (Yawning.) Iiiiiiiiiaaaaaaach!\n\nBLOOM Mixed races and mixed marriage.\n\nLENEHAN What about mixed bathing?\n\n(Bloom explains to those near him his schemes for social regeneration. All agree with him. The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)\n\nFATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.\n\nMRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.)

Down with Bloom!\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S.

Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.)

Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear.

He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos.

Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!\n\nBLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\n\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.) Rmm Rmm Rmm Rrr rrrmmmmm.\n\nSTEPHEN (Gobbles, with marionette jerks. ) Thousand places of entertainment to expenses your evenings with lovely ladies saling gloves and other things perhaps her heart beerchops perfect fashionable house very eccentric where lots cocottes beautiful dressed much about princesses like are dancing cancan and walking there parisian clowneries extra foolish for bachelors foreigns the same if talking a poor english how much smart they are on things love and sensations voluptuous.

Hillyho!\n\n(Simon Dedalus' voice hilloes in answer, somewhat sleepy but ready.)\n\nSIMON That's all right. (He swoops uncertainly through the air, wheeling, uttering cries of heartening, on strong ponderous buzzard wings.) Ho, boy! Are you going to win? Hoop! Pschatt! Stable with those halfcastes. Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!\n\n(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.) Per vias rectas!\n\n(A yoke of buckets leopards all over him and his rearing nag, a torrent of mutton broth with dancing coins of carrots, barley, onions, turnips, potatoes.)\n\nTHE GREEN LODGES Soft day, sir John!

(He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)\n\nZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.\n\n(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis. Cavaliers behind them arch and suspend their arms, with hands descending to, touching, rising from their shoulders.)\n\nHOURS You may touch my.\n\nCAVALIERS May I touch your?\n\nHOURS O, but lightly!\n\nCAVALIERS O, so lightly!\n\nTHE PIANOLA My little shy little lass has a waist.\n\n(Zoe and Stephen turn boldly with looser swing. The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!\n\n(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements.

Remerciez!\n\nTHE PIANOLA\n\nBest, best of all,\nBaraabum!\n\n\nKITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!\n\n(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks. Groangrousegurgling Toft's cumbersome whirligig turns slowly the room right roundabout the room.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA My girl's a Yorkshire girl.\n\nZOE Yorkshire through and through.

Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

He's white.\n\n\nBLOOM (Goes to the window to open it more.) Giddy.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With smouldering eyes.) Repent! O, the fire of hell!\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Panting.) The corpsechewer! Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4726876", "artist_names": "The Klowns", "full_title": "Lady Love

through the depths of hell wondering where is God?\nIf there's a heaven, and a power's that's so higher\nWhy babies die from gunshot wounds and house fires\nSometimes I hit the weed and just meditate\nCould be ahead in life, if I ain't hesitate\nNearly losing my life for fake street resumes\nAshamed, probably why I smoke til I levitate\nTryna forget memories that bring nothing but misery\nSuicidal thoughts, these flashbacks be killing me\nMake me drink the Hennessey and mastermind the end of me\nBut I'll leave that in the hands of my enemies\nThey say everyone is born with a purpose\nWhat happens when you're born feeling worthless\nAnd insecure, in another 24 without Jack Bauer\nPainful, would've been better off on a towel\nApparently, I'm a disappointment to my parents\nMy speculations caused me to stop caring\nMy heart stopped beating on a November evening\nThe day my grandma gave up and stopped breathing\nRight after my last visit, and the news was heavy on my heart\nStill a nigga had to get lifted\nI loss control so how you think you controlling me nigga\nYou think you know but you don't know me like I know me nigga\n(Hook)\nThe ups and downs, the highs and lows\nWasted time wondering where it go\nHiding my pain so the smiles will show\nYou clueless for sho, you shouldn't speak on things you don't know\nI be singing the blues like (crooning)\nI be singing the blues like (crooning )\n\n(Jeff Smith: 2nd Verse)\nI've been homeless, broke, suicidal and underpaid\nI was more of a loose cannon in my younger days\nKept a lot of things hidden from my mama\nMy life was like a movie, I was addicted to drama\nI pitched a little coke, I pitched a little weed\nEven participated in a few B&E's\nBeing a follower lead me to bad places\nBut lucky me, I avoided death and catching cases\nAnother day to show my strength and my stamina\nNever thought I'd see the day that I'll become a janitor\nAnd I feel taken advantage of\nThey won't promote a nigga to full time so fuck being manager\nI need benefits along with a bigger check\nAnd moms wonder why I still smoke cigarettes\nSometimes I think I'm better dead off\nIntoxicated late nights contemplating blowing my head off\nMaybe I need a shrink, maybe I need a friend\nMaybe I need a piece of Heaven just to breathe again\nCause mentally I was just in Hell\nAnd happiness ain't for sell, gotta find it through self\nI'm just a little nigga with a big heart\nLife us a big show and I'm just playing my part\nIt took years for me to see the light standing in the dark\nGiving it up is easy but surviving is hella hard\nBut what you know nigga\nYou might also like(Hook)\nThe ups and downs, the highs and lows\nWasted time wondering where it go\nHiding my pain so the smiles will show\nYou clueless for sho, you shouldn't speak on things you don't know\nI be singing the blues like (crooning)\nI be singing the blues like (crooning)\n\n(Bless Picasso: 3rd Verse)\nYeah\nYou get a glimpse when you look through IG\nBut wasn't at the spital when I was hooked to IVs\nYo, but I salute my lady and my Gs\n(One time) They showed love, that's the main ingredient\nBut let's really get into it, needed blood transfusions\nSo peace to those who kept me breathing\nLook I had to raise babies, had to make sure granny won't freezing\nSo I pumped a little work and flipped my cash like a heathen\nLet's go back, I'm from where sewing Gators on your Polo\nLike B.I. was the number one 'No No'\nMy friends had the military fours, I was rocking Reeboks -- the Classics\nBut now I'm laughing while I'm cruising in a T-top\nBut at the time I had a complex\nI seen the kids was fly but living in the projects\nLet's fast forward, sophomore year caught up in beef with hoe niggas\nPig slammed me on a patrol car, go figure\nDropped out, hit the Commonwealth challenge with some kids I knew\nGraduated early,  couldn't fail and be miserable\nStarted getting serious with rap\nMoms paid for the first few joints, she had my back\n(That's love) Between time I had two seeds by two women\nSix months apart that shows you how I was living\nLook, I played my part for the better or the worse\nOnly the tip of the iceberg I could fit up in a verse\nWordEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1497297", "artist_names": "Laura Nyro", "full_title": "Up On the Roof by\u00a0Laura\u00a0Nyro",

just drift right into space\n\n[Chorus]\nOn the roof, the only place I know\nWhere you just have to wish to make it so\nUp on the roof\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I get home feeling tired and beat\nI go up where the air is fresh and sweet (Up on the roof)\nI get away from the hustling crowds\nAnd all that rat-race noise down in the street\n\n[Chorus]\nAt night the stars put on a show for free\nDarling, you can share it all with me\nLet's go, I keep telling you\n\n[Verse 3]\nRight smack dab in the middle of town\nI've found a paradise that's trouble proof\nAnd if this world starts getting you

transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement.

He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him.

Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.)

Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.)

He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear!

I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father!

The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)\n\nFATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.\n\nMRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.)

I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.)

Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.)

(With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.)

Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear.

He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos.

Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve.

Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way. (He touches the keys again.) Minor chord comes now. Yes. Not much however.\n\n(Almidano Artifoni holds out a batonroll of music with vigorous moustachework.)\n\nARTIFONI Ci rifletta. Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.) Qui vous a mis dans cette fichue position, Philippe?\n\nPHILIP SOBER (Gaily.) C'\u00e9tait le sacr\u00e9 pigeon, Philippe.\n\n(Kitty unpins her hat and sets it down calmly, patting her henna hair. And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks.\n\nHENRY All is lost now.\n\n(Virag unscrews his head in a trice and holds it under his arm.)\n\nVIRAG'S HEAD Quack!\n\n(Exeunt severally.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Over his shoulder to Zoe.) You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O! Weeshwashtkissima, pooisthnapoohuck!\n\nBLOOM (His eyes wildly dilated, clasps himself) Show! Hide! Show! Plough her! More! Shoot!\n\nBELLA, ZOE, FLORRY. KITTY Ho ho! Ha ha! Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.) When will I hear the joke?\n\nZOE Before you're twice married and once a widower.\n\nBLOOM Lapses are condoned. Even the great Napoleon, when measurements were taken near the skin after his death...\n\n(Mrs Dignam, widow woman, her snubnose and cheeks flushed with deathtalk, tears and Tunny's tawny sherry, hurries by in her weeds, her bonnet awry, rouging and powdering her cheeks, lips and nose, a pen chivvying her brood of cygnets. Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside. Under the umbrella appears Mrs Cunningham in Merry Widow hat and kimono gown. She glides sidling and bowing, twisting japanesily.)\n\nMRS CUNNINGHAM (Sings.) And they call me the jewel of Asia.\n\nMARTIN CUNNINGHAM\n\n(Gazes on her impassive.) Immense! Most bloody awful demirep!\n\nSTEPHEN Et exaltabuntur cornua iusti. Queens lay with prize bulls. Remember Pasiphae for whose lust my grandoldgross father made the first confessionbox. Forget not Madam Grissel Steevens nor the suine scions of the house of Lambert. And Noah was drunk with wine. And his ark was open.\n\nBELLA None of that here. Come to the wrong shop.\n\nLYNCH Let him alone. He's back from Paris.\n\nZOE (Runs to Stephen and links him.) O go on! Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

Wouldn't let them within the bawl of an ass. Head up! Keep our flag flying! An eagle gules volant in a field argent displayed. Ulster king at arms! hai hoop! (He makes the beagle's call giving tongue.) Bulbul! Burblblbrurblbl! Hai, boy!\n\n(The fronds and spaces of the wallpaper file rapidly across country. A stout fox drawn from covert, brush pointed, having buried his grandmother, runs swift for the open, bright-eyed, seeking badger earth, under the leaves. The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.)

(He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)\n\nZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.\n\n(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!\n\n(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements.

Remerciez!\n\nTHE PIANOLA\n\nBest, best of all,\nBaraabum!\n\n\nKITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!\n\n(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks.

Room whirls back. Eyes closed, he totters. Red rails fly spacewards. Stars all around suns turn roundabout. Bright midges dance on wall. He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work.

(A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.)

I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/338069", "artist_names": "Skyzoo", "full_title": "Along The Way

if you waited too long\nThen that's you, that's on you and the time that's in the air\nBut if you need what it be the rewind button is there\nI tried rushing you here but you was kinda content\nAnd now shit's getting thick and its you that's climbing the fence\nI did it from day one, I never took off a night\nI never shook off the light, in the midst of a great run\nI told you what I was on and showed you double or nothing\nThe ones who really heard are the ones who cut the discussion\nLike \"nah, Sky got it, there's nothing for him to prove\nIf he ever laced 'em up you'd be running outta ya shoes\"\nYou being whoever,the name of them doesn't matter\nThey know I'm not for play, I'm raising them up as rappers\nBut the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust\nAnd then it gets tough to say I'm a fucking rapper\n2 for 2 with the classics and got a 3rd coming\nAnd I ain't drop one verse that didn't earth something\nEven the throw always was shit you would go to play\nAnd say that the only thing beside it that you kno is jay\nThe day ones, all of them know how me do\nI'm pretty much Earl Manigault but no needles\nSo when you talking Kareem or Wilt or Connie Hawk\nRemember who they was modeling when they stepped on the court\nStand for the city?, I done stood forever\nEvery record was Brooklyn bridge overlooking together\nEvery record was Southside or the X or Harlem\nOr the islands, I was about 'em so I'm begging your pardon\nBut lets say I went and did it, brought him straight to the work\nAnd at the end was an arrow to point him straight to a hearse\nWould the power circle of the city stand tall\nAnd recognize the real and how they handle support?\nDoubt it, and I can jump for the bait that he leaves\nI'm NY to the death when they was changing they teams\nBut they opened up the doors for him to say what he please\nIt don't help that the real king went and gave him the keys\nDoing verses on a remix, shit why wouldn't he think he's it?\nI would think the same with all them reach ins\nNot a shot it's a drop of honesty\nAnd if I pour the whole glass that's more that you gotta clean\nSo I'll leave it there and you know where I stand\nTalking music for my friends and one love to my fans\nSo I'll leave it there and you know where I stand\nTalking music for my friends and one love to my fans\nHook:\nIf you're with us along the way\nThen act like you was with us along the way\n(2x)You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4726783", "artist_names": "White Plains", "full_title": "Lovin' You

sincere\nYou were so gentle in your ways, I had to keep you [?]\nI remember momma sending me out to go play\nOn the radio I'd hear something about the O' Jays\nCouldn't help but listen to every way that they sang\nI wanna stay away to have fun and make my day\n\n[Bridge: Ayanda Jiya]\nEven though I was a child\nI understood the feeling that came over me\nI understood that you and I were meant to be\nEven though I was a child\nI understood my purpose and kids accusing me\n\n[Chorus: Ayanda Jiya]\nGet a love affair you'll see\nSomething that you can't control\nYou are the only love I got\n(You are my lover, you)\n(You are my lover for life)\n\nGet a love affair you'll see\nSomething that you can't control\nYou are the only love I got\n(You are my lover, you)\n(You are my lover for life)\n\n[Verse 2: Ayanda Jiya]\nGirl, and then I turned sixteen\nDidn't know another thing that hit you like me\nI'd listen to the radio till the clock struck three\nDj please play me Mr. Dollar [?]\nLook at, look at what yo did to me\nLook what you did, you put that soul in me\nCame to mind I was a soul sister\nFelt so good I so glad to meet ya\n(Oh, nobody touched my heart and felt like)\nJill Scott, my inspiration\nHer soul became my motivation\n(Oh, and as I go on)\n(I only can be greater)\n'Cause you are my life\nAnd if I have to choose I'd choose you again\nYou might also like[Chorus: Ayanda Jiya]\nGet a love affair you'll see\nSomething that you can't control\nYou are the only love I got\n(You are my lover, you)\n(You are my lover for life)\n\nGet a love affair you'll see\nSomething that you can't control\nYou are the only love I got\n(You are my lover, you)\n(You are my lover)\n\nStogie T...\n\n[Verse : Stogie T]\nUh, ey, how so damn interesting\nThis is the best thing since Smif N Wessun\nMay 1995, Dah Shinin'\nBut she didn't get the reference\nBut that's the lesson towards collide hard and [?]\nI know a verse for every vibe we share, boo\nLike John 15 chapter 12, the Bible tells you\nLove each other as I have loved you\nGot me thinking back to all this fire between us\nTell me that we are mad too\n[Bridge: Ayanda Jiya]\nI wanna speak so highly of you\nAnd thank you for your love 'cause it got me through\nYou pull me together, always and forever\nI would not know what to do without you\nI'm so grateful for you\n\n[Chorus: Ayanda Jiya]\nGet a love affair you'll see\nSomething that you can't control\nYou are the only love I got\n(You are my lover, you)\n(You are my lover for life)\n\nGet a love affair you'll see\nSomething that you can't control\nYou are the only love I got\n(You are my lover, you)\n(You are my lover for life)\n\nGet a love affair you'll see\nSomething that you can't control\nYou are the only love I got\n(You are my

I move like Spragga\nIn my whip, listening to French Montana\n357 (ummm), black bandana\nCocaine in a duffel bag in the boot\nYo it came from Ghana (straight), hold tight Nana\nAny time my niggas touch down in the booth\nIt's a straight up banger (banger), swear down brother (brother)\nI've done a lot of dirt for my team, ask Bada (ask Bada)\n357, in my jeans all summer (all summer)\nI break down bricks into Zs in the trap (ummm)\nThen I make two phone calls, drop it on the runner (drop it on the runner)\nEverybody knows what I'm on, I'm a gunner (I'm a gunner)\nSee me on your ends in a Benz, take cover (bang)\nSearch me boss, I'll make moves when I wanna\nHollow tips in my clip, I'm gonna turn man a goner\nMy nigga Super's got the 40 caliber to snap a nigga\nLike a camera, the trigger give an automatic dosage (boss)\nMy niggas all ferocious, everybody know this\nYou'll always hear me screaming free Jazzi, he's the closest (boss)\nCatch me in the kitchen with some dope, I'm the dopest (boss)\nDuffel bag straps, I'm the opposite of hopeless\nBack in 06, you would've seen me in a Focus\nYou'll soon see me pull up in a Bimmer with the sofas (boss)\nBlackjack ting, I get rid of the jokers\nI used to buy packs and distribute it to the smokers\nNow I buy packs and distribute it to my soldiers\nI told my young bucks to start moving like your olders (olders)\nTake this rucksack and put it on your shoulders (shoulders)\nAnd always check your rear view for the rollers (rollers)\nAnd just remember money is the motive\nWe're heading to the top, just in case you never noticed\nYou might also like[Chorus: Giggs]\nWe got the rocks, we got the rocks rolling\nWe got them rocks, we got the flocks phoning\nEat off the top and watch the prof roll in (jheez)\nBack of the net like ch, slip that goal in\n\n[Verse 2: Giggs]\nHe's got the spot, he's got the spot (yeah)\nHe's got the Yak, she's got Ciroc (Ciroc)\nBreeze off the Glock, squeeze off the Glock (yeah)\nHe's not as hot, he got forgot (forgot)\nHe's not the boss\nWhen we roll up on man, we popped it off\nWe're too grown up for man, let's pop the Scotch (yes)\nThey're just donuts for man, you're wash, you're wash (you're washed)\nThe shot of your clap take man's hand off\nNiggas ride at em with gangster-like stanos (stanos)\nI'm talking a strap to strap stand-off\nNiggas get clap, I'm back, the rap mammoth (umm!)\nWe're back to just rolling\nWe got the crack, the packs are just flowing in\nWe don't respond to prats, we disown him\nKnock down them pricks like pins, this shit's bowling (jheez!)\nThat man just kept phoning\nBefore on apps, I check my shit's roaming (roaming)\nWe don't beat round the bush, I just told him\nAin't got the Ps, it's not for disclosing (oof)\nHad to lock up the trap, the shop's closing\nThen I took hold of this rap and just owned him (owned him)\nMan who got pushed to the side, just postponed him\nNiggas went like the machine, I push close him ('low it)\nWish man would stop moaning\nAin't me that chose this path, I'm just chosen\nI'm like that sleeping giant that's been woken\nLight up my ganja spliff and sip potion (potion)\n[Chorus: Giggs]\nWe got the rocks, we got the rocks rolling\nWe got them rocks, we got the flocks phoning\nEat off the top and watch the prof roll in\nBack of the net like ch, slip that goal in\n\n[Outro: DJ Big Ryde]\nAhh, shit man I told you man\nThat's what happens when two bosses link up you know\nSo big up Skrapz, don't forget Skrapz Is Back Part 2 out now\nMake sure you look out for 80's Baby, out soon

for a song to come)\nLost without a melody\nThat I can never hear\nSince you're gone\nLook how sad the carousel\nThat turns with no one on\nAnd all the dappled ponies\nLong for children who are gone\n\nLook into my mind\nIt spins, and then it goes nowhere\nWhen first I think you're coming\nThen I find that you're not there\n\nBut I'm waiting for a song that never comes\n(Waiting for a song to come)\nLost without a melody\nThat I can never hear\nSince you're gone\n\nI'm waiting for a summer day\nIn the middle of the fall\nHoping that you're coming back\nWhen I know you're never coming back at all\n\nI'm waiting for a song that never comes\n(Waiting for a song to come)\nYes, I'm waiting for a song that never comes\n(Waiting for a song to come)\nWell, I'm waiting for a song that

My little man.\nI'd been in Manhattan a week,\nmaking my plans; staying at 2 quiet hotels\nin the Village, where people were used to strangers\nand more or less left you alone. To this day\nI'm especially fond of pastrami on rye.\nI digress. As you see, this island's a paradise.\nHe'd arrived, my man, with a documentary team\nto make a film. (There's a particular toad\nthat lays its eggs only here.) I found him alone\nin a clearing, scooped him up in my palm,\nand held his wriggling, shouting life till he calmed.\nFor me, it was absolutely love at first sight.\nI'd been so lonely. Long nights in the heat\nof my own pelt, rumbling an animal blues.\nAll right, he was small, but perfectly formed\nand gorgeous. There were things he could do\nfor me with the sweet finesse of those hands\nthat no gorilla could. I swore in my huge heart\nto follow him then to the ends of the earth.\n\nFor he wouldn't stay here. He was nervous.\nI'd go to his camp each night at dusk,\ncrouch by the delicate tents, and wait. His colleagues\nalways sent him out pretty quick. He'd climb\ninto my open hand, sit down; and then I'd gently pick\nat his shirt and his trews, peel him, put\nthe tip of my tongue to the grape of his flesh.\n\nBliss. But when he'd finished his prize-winning film,\nhe packed his case; hopped up and down\non my heartline, miming the flight back home\nto New York. Big metal bird. Didn't he know\nI could swat his plane from these skies like a gnat?\nBut I let him go, my man. I watched him fly\ninto the sun as I thumped at my breast, distraught.\nI lasted a month. I slept for a week,\nthen woke to binge for a fortnight. I didn't wash.\nThe parrots clacked their migraine chant.\nThe swinging monkeys whinged. Fevered, I drank\nhandfuls of river right by the spot where he'd bathed.\nI bled with a fat, red moon rolled on the jungle roof.\nAnd after that, I decided to get him back.\nSo I came to sail up the Hudson one June night,\nwith the New York skyline a concrete rainforest\nof light; and felt, lovesick and vast, the first\nglimmer of hope in weeks. I was discreet, prowled\nthose streets in darkness, pressing my passionate eye\nto a thousand windows, each with its modest peep-show\nof boredom or pain, of drama, consolation, remorse.\n\nI found him, of course. At 3 a.m. on a Sunday,\ndreaming alone in his single bed; over his lovely head\na blown-up photograph of myself. I stared for a long time\ntill my big brown eyes grew moist; then I padded away\nthrough Central Park, under the stars. He was mine.\nNext day, I shopped. Clothes for my main, mainly,\nbut one or two treats for myself from Bloomingdale's.\n\nI picked him, like a chocolate from the top layer\nof a box, one Friday night, out of his room\nand let him dangle in the air between my finger\nand my thumb in a teasing, lover's way. Then we sat\non the tip of the Empire State Building, saying farewell\nto the Brooklyn Bridge, to the winking yellow cabs,\nto the helicopters over the river, dragonflies.\nTwelve happy years. He slept in my fur, woke early\nto massage the heavy lids of my eyes. I liked that.\nHe liked me to gently blow on him; or scratch,\nwith care, the length of his back with my nail.\nThen I'd ask him to play on the wooden pipes he'd made\nin our first year. He'd sit, cross-legged, near my ear\nfor hours: his plaintive, lost tunes making me cry.\nWhen he died, I held him all night, shaking him\nlike a doll, licking his face, breast, soles of his feet,\nhis little rod. But then, heartsore as I was, I set to work.\nHe would be pleased. I wear him now around my neck,\nperfect, preserved, with tiny emeralds for eyes. No man\nhas been loved more. I'm sure that, sometimes, in his silent death,\nagainst my massive, breathing lungs, he hears me roar.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/134468", "artist_names": "Neal Stephenson", "full_title": "Cryptonomicon by\u00a0Neal\u00a0Stephenson", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "id": 134468, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 271820, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1622734920, "path": "/Neal-stephenson-cryptonomicon-annotated", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Neal-stephenson-cryptonomicon-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/359ecf36015c4a0d30880d5242eee66f.275x275x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 2, "hot": false, "pageviews": 9564}, "title": "Cryptonomicon", "title_with_featured": "Cryptonomicon", "updated_by_human_at": 1666840692, "url": "https://genius.com/Neal-stephenson-cryptonomicon-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/43884", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d2e1321ecfe1389e38f2f40337c5c870.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 43884, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d2e1321ecfe1389e38f2f40337c5c870.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "n", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Neal Stephenson", "slug": "Neal-stephenson", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Neal-stephenson"}, "artist": "Neal Stephenson", "lyrics": "Cryptonomicon LyricsPROLOGUE\n\nTwo tires fly. Two wail.\n\nA bamboo grove, all chopped down\n\nFrom it, warring songs\n\n....IS THE BEST THAT CORPORAL BOBBY SHAFTOE CAN DO ON short notice--he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question. Is ``tires'' one syllable or two? How about ``wail?'' The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail--and the moment--are lost. Bobby can still hear the coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: ``Electrical generator'' is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto the second line!\n\n\"Are we allowed to run over people?'' Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation:\nShanghai, 1645 hours, Friday, the 28th of November 1941. Bobby Shaftoe, and the other half-dozen Marines on his truck, are staring down the length of Kiukiang Road, onto which they've just made this careening high-speed turn. Cathedral's going by to the right, so that means they are, what? two blocks away from the Bund. A Yangtze River Patrol gunboat is tied up there, waiting for the stuff they've got in the back of this truck. The only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million Chinese people.\n\nNow these Chinese are sophisticated urbanites, not suntanned yokels who've never seen cars before--they'll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn. And indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other, producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty-three miles an hour shown on its speedometer.\n\nBut the bamboo grove in Bobby Shaftoe's haiku has not been added just to put a little Oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in Oconomowoc. There is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck, dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river, for the officers of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, and of the Fourth Marines, who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the Friday Afternoon factor into account. As Bobby Shaftoe could've explained to them, if only they'd bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead, their route took them through the heart of the banking district. Here you've got the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank of course, City Bank, Chase Manhattan, the Bank of America, and BBME and the Agricultural Bank of China and any number of crappy little provincial banks, and several of those banks have contracts with what's left of the Chinese Government to print currency. It must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers, and if you know how to read Chinese, you can see last year's news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender.\n\nAs every chicken-peddler and rickshaw operator in Shanghai knows, the money-printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such-and-such an amount of silver; i.e., anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of Kiukiang Road and slap down a pile of bills and (provided that those bills were printed by that same bank) receive actual metallic silver in exchange.\n\nNow if China weren't right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the Empire of Nippon, it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks' vaults, and it would all be quiet and orderly. But as it stands, the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks.\n\nHere's how they do it: during the normal course of business, lots of paper money will pass over the counters of (say) Chase Manhattan Bank. They'll take it into a back room and sort it, throwing into money boxes (a couple of feet square and a yard deep, with ropes on the four corners) all of the bills that were printed by (say) Bank of America in one, all of the City Bank bills into another. Then, on Friday afternoon they will bring in coolies. Each coolie, or pair of coolies, will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him--a coolie without his pole is like a China Marine without his nickel-plated bayonet--and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box. Then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole, hoisting the box into the air. They have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack. So as they head towards their destination--whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box--they sing to each other, and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music. The pole's pretty long, so they are that far apart, and they have to sing loud to hear each other, and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song, trying to drown out all of the others so that they don't get out of step.\n\nSo ten minutes before closing time on Friday afternoon, the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing, like the curtain-raiser on a fucking Broadway musical, slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down, and demand silver in exchange. All of the banks do this to each other. Sometimes, they'll all do it on the same Friday, particularly at times like 28 November 1941, when even a grunt like Bobby Shaftoe can understand that it's better to be holding silver than piles of old cut-up newspaper. And that is why, once the normal pedestrians and food-cart operators and furious Sikh cops have scurried out of the way, and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on Kiukiang Road, Bobby Shaftoe and the other Marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination, because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles. They cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing. This ain't just your regular Friday P.M. Shanghai bank-district money-rush. This is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole Eastern Hemisphere catches fire. The millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes; actual pieces of silver and gold will move, or they won't. It is some kind of fiduciary Judgment Day.\n\n``Jesus Christ, I can't--'' Private Wiley hollers.\n\n\"The captain said don't stop for any reason whatsofuckinever,'' Shaftoe reminds him. He's not telling Wiley to run over the coolies, he's reminding Wiley that if he refrains from running over them, they will have some explaining to do--which will be complicated by the fact that the captain's right behind them in a car stuffed with Tommy Gun-toting China Marines. And from the way the captain's been acting about this Station Alpha thing, it's pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass, courtesy of some admiral in Pearl Harbor or even (drumroll) Marine Barracks, Eight and Eye Streets Southeast, Washington, D.C.\n\nShaftoe and the other Marines have always known Station Alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil-necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the International Settlement in a shack of knot-pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way. If you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving, zeroing in on something out to sea. Shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it:\n\nAntenna searches\n\nRetriever's nose in the wind\n\nEther's far secrets\nThis was only his second haiku ever--clearly not up to November 1941 standards--and he cringes to remember it.\n\nBut in no way did any of the Marines comprehend what a big deal Station Alpha was until today. Their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors. Then they spent Thursday tearing the shack apart, making it into a bonfire, and burning certain books and papers.\n\n``Sheeeyit!'' Private Wiley hollers. Only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way, or even seen them. But then there is this fantastic boom from the river, like the sound of a mile-thick bamboo pole being snapped over God's knee. Half a second later there're no coolies in the street anymore--just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter-tottering on them, bonging into the streets like wind-chimes. Above, a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat. Wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it. Shaftoe cringes against the truck's door and lowers his head, hoping that his campy Great War doughboy helmet will be good for something. Then money-boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them. Shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront.\n\nThe leaves of Shanghai:\n\nPale doorways in a steel sky.\n\nWinter has begun.\n\n\nBARRENS\n\nLet's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.\n\n\n\nAs nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. In the tradition of his namesake (the Puritan writer John Bunyan, who spent much of his life in jail, or trying to avoid it) the Rev. Waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long. The church moved him from one small town in the Dakotas to another every year or two. It is possible that Godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating, for, sometime during the course of his studies at Fargo Congregational College, he bolted from the fold and, to the enduring agony of his parents, fell into worldy pursuits, and ended up, somehow, getting a Ph.D. in Classics from a small private university in Ohio. Academics being no less nomadic than Congregational preachers, he took work where he could find it. He became a Professor of Greek and Latin at Bolger Christian College (enrollment 322) in West Point, Virginia, where the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers came together to form the estuarial James, and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer, every closet, even the interior pages of books. Godfrey's young bride, nee Alice Pritchard, who had grown up following her itinerant-preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern Montana--where air smelt of snow and sage--threw up for three months. Six months later she gave birth to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.\n\n\n\nThe boy had a peculiar relationship with sound. When a fire engine passed, he was not troubled by the siren's howl or the bell's clang. But when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad Lissajous, droning almost inaudibly, he cried in pain at the noise. And if he saw or smelled something that scared him, he would clap his hands over his ears.\n\n\nOne noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at Bolger Christian College. The chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning, but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size. It nicely complemented the organist, a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the Lord (violence and capriciousness in the Old Testament, majesty and triumph in the New) could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation. That he ran the risk of blowing out the stained-glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway, and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead. But after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service, reeling from tinnitus, and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music, the organist was replaced.\n\nNevertheless, he continued to give lessons on the instrument. Students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano, and when this was explained to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, he taught himself, in three weeks, how to play a Bach fugue, and signed up for organ lessons. Since he was only five years old at the time, he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals, and had to play standing--or rather strolling, from pedal to pedal.\n\nWhen Lawrence was twelve, the organ broke down. That paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance, so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it. He was in poor health and required a nimble assistant: Lawrence, who helped him open up the hood of the thing. For the first time in all those years, the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys.\n\nFor each stop--each timbre, or type of sound, that the organ could make (viz. blockflote, trumpet, piccolo)--there was a separate row of pipes, arranged in a line from long to short. Long pipes made low notes, short high. The tops of the pipes defined a graph: not a straight line but an upward-tending curve. The organist/math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes, a pencil, and paper, and helped Lawrence figure out why. When Lawrence understood, it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor on a pipe organ the size of the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda--the part where Uncle Johann dissects the architecture of the Universe in one merciless descending ever-mutating chord, as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock. In particular, the final steps of the organist's explanation were like a falcon's dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion, thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were. The heavens were riven open. Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity.\n\nThe pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air. All of the pipes for a given note--but belonging to different stops--lined up with each other along one axis. All of the pipes for a given stop--but tuned at different pitches--lined up with each other along the other, perpendicular axis. Down there in the flat box of air, then, was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times. When a key or pedal was depressed, all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak, as long as their stops were pulled out.\n\nMechanically, all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear, simple, and logical. Lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it. Now he had learned that a machine, simple in its design, could produce results of infinite complexity.\n\nStops were rarely used alone. They tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics (more tasty mathematics here!). Certain combinations in particular were used over and over again. Lots of blockflo[autes, in varying lengths, for the quiet Offertory, for example. The organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset, which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops--stops he himself had chosen--instantly. He would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console, driven by pneumatic pressure, and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres.\n\nThe next summer both Lawrence and Alice, his mother, were colonized by a distant cousin--a stupendous badass of a virus. Lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet. Alice wound up in an iron lung. Later, unable to cough effectively, she got pneumonia and died.\n\nLawrence's father Godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders. He resigned from his position at the small college in Virginia and moved, with his son, to a small house in Moorhead, Minnesota, next door to where Bunyan and Blanche had settled. Later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school.\n\nAt this point, all of the responsible adults in Lawrence's life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him--certainly the easiest--was to leave him alone. On the rare occasions when Lawrence requested adult intervention in his life, he was usually asking questions that no one could answer. At the age of sixteen, having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse went off to college. He matriculated at Iowa State College, which among other things was the site of a Naval ROTC installation in which he was forcibly enrolled.\n\nThe Iowa State Naval ROTC had a band, and was delighted to hear that Lawrence had an interest in music. Since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ, they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers.\n\nWhen not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the Skunk River making loud dinging noises, Lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering. He ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a Bulgarian professor named John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations.\n\nThe basic problem for Lawrence was that he was lazy. He had figured out that everything was much simpler if, like Superman with his X-ray vision, you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton. Once you found the math in a thing, you knew everything about it, and you could manipulate it to your heart's content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin. He saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel, saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor-studded drum of Atanasoff and Berry's computing machine. Actually pounding on the glockenspiel, riveting the bridge together, or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn't working were not as interesting to him.\n\nConsequently he got poor grades. From time to time, though, he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile. Word got around.\n\nAt the same time, his grandmother Blanche was invoking her extensive Congregational connections, working the angles on Lawrence's behalf, totally unbeknownst to him. Her efforts culminated in triumph when Lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship, endowed by a St. Paul oat-processing heir, whose purpose was to send Midwestern Congregationalists to the Ivy League for one year, which (evidently) was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their IQs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them. So Lawrence got to be a sophomore in Princeton.\n\nNow Princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor, but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to Lawrence, who had no way of knowing. This had bad and good consequences. He accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord. On the other hand, he adjusted to Princeton easily because it was just another place. It reminded him of the nicer bits of Virginia, and there were some nice pipe organs in town, though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge-designing and sprocket-cutting problems. As always, these eventually came down to math, most of which he could handle easily. From time to time he would get stuck, though, which led him to the Fine Hall: the headquarters of the Math Department.\n\nThere was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in Fine Hall, many sporting British or European accents. Administratively speaking, many of these fellows were not members of the Math Department at all, but a separate thing called IAS, which stood for Institute for Advanced something-or-other. But they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math, so the distinction didn't exist for Lawrence.\n\nQuite a few of these men would pretend shyness when Lawrence sought their advice, but others were at least willing to hear him out. For example: he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that, as normally solved by engineers, would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations. Lawrence's solution would provide exact results. The only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide-rule operators a quintillion years to solve. Lawrence was working on a radically different approach that, if it worked, would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively. Unfortunately, Lawrence was unable to interest anyone at Fine Hall in anything as prosaic as gears, until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic British fellow, whose name he promptly forgot, but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket-making himself lately. This fellow was trying to build, of all things, a mechanical calculating machine--specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.\n\n\ncertain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.\n\n[equation cannot be rendered in text]\n\nwhere s is a complex number.\n\nLawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important, and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades. The two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to Lawrence's sprocket problem. Lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor, who snidely rejected it, on grounds of practicality, and gave him a poor grade for his troubles.\n\nLawrence finally remembered, after several more contacts, that the name of the friendly Brit was Al something-or-other. Because Al was a passionate cyclist, he and Al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the Garden State. As they rode around New Jersey, they talked about math, and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands.\n\nBut Al had been thinking about this subject for longer than Lawrence, and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor-saving devices. He'd been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever, as long as you knew how to write the problem down. From a pure logic standpoint, he had already figured out everything there was to know about this (as yet hypothetical) machine, though he had yet to build one. Lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at Cambridge (England, that is, where this Al character was based) or for that matter at Fine Hall. Al was thrilled to have found, in Lawrence, someone who did not share this view.\n\nAl delicately asked him, one day, if Lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name, which was Alan and not Al. Lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind.\n\nOne day a couple of weeks later, as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the Delaware Water Gap, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing.\n\nLawrence decided that he was probably one of those people.\n\nAlan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out. They went directly back to a discussion of computing machines, and their friendship continued unchanged. But on their next bicycle ride--an overnight camping trip to the Pine Barrens--they were joined by a new fellow, a German named Rudy von something-or-other.\n\nAlan and Rudy's relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence's. Lawrence concluded that Alan's penis scheme must have finally found a taker.\n\nIt got Lawrence to thinking. From an evolution standpoint, what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring? There must be some good, and fairly subtle, reason for it.\n\nThe only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people--societies--rather than individual creatures, who were now trying to out-reproduce and/or kill each other, and that, in a society, there was plenty of room for someone who didn't have kids as long as he was up to something useful.\n\nAlan and Rudy and Lawrence rode south, anyway, looking for the Pine Barrens. After a while the towns became very far apart, and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble, spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to Florida--blocking their view, but not the headwind. ``Where are the Pine Barrens I wonder?'' Lawrence asked a couple of times. He even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question. His companions began to make fun of him.\n\n``Vere are ze Pine Barrens?'' Rudy inquired, looking about quizzically.\n\n``I should look for something rather barren-looking, with numerous pine trees,'' Alan mused.\n\nThere was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast, with Alan in the middle.\n\n``A forest, as Kafka would imagine it,'' Rudy muttered.\n\nBy this point Lawrence had figured out that they were, in fact, in the Pine Barrens. But he didn't know who Kafka was. ``A mathematician?'' he guessed.\n\n``Zat is a scary sing to sink of,'' Rudy said.\n\n``He is a writer,'' Alan said. ``Lawrence, please don't be offended that I ask you this, but: do you recognize any other people's names at all? Other than family and close friends, I mean.''\n\nLawrence must have looked baffled. ``I'm trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here,'' Alan said, reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of Lawrence's head, ``or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings?''\n\n\n``When I was a little boy, I saw angels in a church in Virginia,'' Lawrence said, ``but I think that they came from inside my head.''\n\n``Very well,'' Alan said.\n\nBut later Alan had another go at it. They had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment: just an alienated staircase leading nowhere, and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles. They pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust-colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies. Then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math.\n\n\nAlan said, ``Look, it's like this: Bertrand Russell and another chap named Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica...''\n\n\n``Now I know you're pulling my leg,'' Waterhouse said. ``Even I know that Sir Isaac Newton wrote that.''\n\n\n``Newton wrote a different book, also called Principia Mathematica, which isn't really about mathematics at all; it's about what we would today call physics.''\n\n\n``Then why did he call it Principia Mathematica?''\n\n\n``Because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn't especially clear in Newton's day--''\n\n\n``Or maybe even in zis day,'' Rudy said.\n\n\n``--which is directly relevant to what I'm talking about,'' Alan continued. ``I am talking about Russell's P.M., in which he and Whitehead started absolutely from scratch, I mean from nothing, and built it all up--all mathematics--from a small number of first principles. And why I am telling you this, Lawrence, is that--Lawrence! Pay attention!''\n\n\n``Hmmm?''\n\n\n``Rudy--take this stick, here--that's right--and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!''\n\n\n``Zis is not an English school, you can't do zese kind of sing.''\n\n\n``I'm listening,'' Lawrence said.\n\n\n``What came out of P.M., which was terrifically radical, was the ability to say that all of math, really, can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols.''\n\n``Leibniz said it a long time before zen!'' protested Rudy.\n\n``Er, Leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus, but--''\n\n``I'm not talking about zat!''\n\n``And he invented matrices, but--''\n\n``I'm not talking about zat eezer!''\n\n``And he did some work with binary arithmetic, but--''\n\n``Zat is completely different!''\n\n``Well, what the hell are you talking about, then, Rudy?''\n\n``Leibniz invented ze basic alphabet--wrote down a set of symbols, for expressing statements about logic.''\n\n``Well, I wasn't aware that Herr Leibniz counted formal logic among his interests, but--''\n\n``Of course! He wanted to do what Russell and Whitehead did, except not just with mathematics, but with everything in ze whole world!''\n\n``Well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet, Rudy, who seems to know about this undertaking of Leibniz's, can we assume that he failed?''\n\n``You can assume anything that pleases your fancy, Alan,'' Rudy responded, ``but I am a mathematician and I do not assume anything.''\n\nAlan sighed woundedly, and gave Rudy a Significant Look which Waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later. ``If I may just make some headway, here,'' he said, ``all I'm really trying to get you to agree on, is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols,'' (he snatched the Lawrence-poking stick and began drawing things like  the dirt) ``and frankly I could not care less whether they happen to be Leibniz's symbols, or Russell's, or the hexagrams of the I Ching....''\n\n``Leibniz was fascinated by the I Ching!'' Rudy began.\n\n``Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You--Rudy--and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others. And our friend Lawrence is running alongside the train, trying to keep up with us--it's not that we're smarter than he is, necessarily, but that he's a farmer who didn't get a ticket. And I, Rudy, am simply reaching out through the open window here, trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way.''\n\n``All right, Alan.''\n\n``Won't take a minute if you will just stop interrupting.''\n\n``But there is a locomotive too named Leibniz.''\n\n``Is it that you don't think I give enough credit to Germans? Because I am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut.''\n\n``Oh, would it be Herr Turing?'' Rudy said slyly.\n\n``Herr Turing comes later. I was actually thinking of Godel.''\n\n``But he's not German! He's Austrian!''\n\n``I'm afraid that it's all the same now, isn't it?''\n\n``Ze Anschluss wasn't my idea, you don't have to look at me that way, I think Hitler is appalling.''\n\n``I've heard of Godel,'' Waterhouse put in helpfully. ``But could we back up just a sec?''\n\n``Of course Lawrence.''\n\n``Why bother? Why did Russell do it? Was there something wrong with math? I mean, two plus two equals four, right?''\n\nAlan picked up two bottlecaps and set them down on the ground. ``Two. One-two. Plus--'' He set down two more. ``Another two. One-two. Equals four. One-two-three-four.''\n\n``What's so bad about that?'' Lawrence said.\n\n``But Lawrence--when you really do math, in an abstract way, you're not counting bottlecaps, are you?''\n\n``I'm not counting anything.''\n\nRudy broke the following news: ``Zat is a very modern position for you to take.''\n\n``It is?''\n\nAlan said, ``There was this implicit belief, for a long time, that math was a sort of physics of bottlecaps. That any mathematical operation you could do on paper, no matter how complicated, could be reduced--in theory, anyway--to messing about with actual physical counters, such as bottlecaps, in the real world.''\n\n``But you can't have two point one bottlecaps.''\n\n``All right, all right, say we use bottlecaps for integers, and for real numbers like two point one, we use physical measurements, like the length of this stick.'' Alan tossed the stick down next to the bottlecaps.\n\n``Well what about pi, then? You can't have a stick that's exactly pi inches long.''\n\n``Pi is from geometry--ze same story,'' Rudy put in.\n\n``Yes, it was believed that Euclid's geometry was really a kind of physics, that his lines and so on represented properties of the physical world. But--you know Einstein?''\n\n``I'm not very good with names.''\n\n``That white-haired chap with the big mustache?''\n\n``Oh, yeah,'' Lawrence said dimly, ``I tried to ask him my sprocket question. He claimed he was late for an appointment or something.''\n\n``That fellow has come up with a general relativity theory, which is sort of a practical application, not of Euclid's, but of Riemann's geometry--''\n\n``The same Riemann of your zeta function?''\n\n``Same Riemann, different subject. Now let's not get sidetracked here Lawrence--''\n\n``Riemann showed you could have many many different geometries that were not the geometry of Euclid but that still made sense internally,'' Rudy explained.\n\n``All right, so back to P.M. then,'' Lawrence said.\n\n``Yes! Russell and Whitehead. It's like this: when mathematicians began fooling around with things like the square root of negative one, and quaternions, then they were no longer dealing with things that you could translate into sticks and bottlecaps. And yet they were still getting sound results.''\n\n``Or at least internally consistent results,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Okay. Meaning that math was more than a physics of bottlecaps.''\n\n``It appeared that way, Lawrence, but this raised the question of was mathematics really true or was it just a game played with symbols? In other words--are we discovering Truth, or just wanking?''\n\n``It has to be true because if you do physics with it, it all works out! I've heard of that general relativity thing, and I know they did experiments and figured out it was true.''\n\n``Ze great majority of mathematics does not lend itself to experimental testing,'' Rudy said.\n\n``The whole idea of this project is to sever the ties to physics,'' Alan said.\n\n``And yet not to be vanking ourselves.''\n\n``That's what P.M. was trying to do?''\n\n``Russell and Whitehead broke all mathematical concepts down into brutally simple things like sets. From there they got to integers, and so on.''\n\n``But how can you break something like pi down into a set?''\n\n``You can't,'' Alan said, ``but you can express it as a long string of digits. Three point one four one five nine, and so on.''\n\n``And digits are integers,'' Rudy said.\n\n``But no fair! Pi itself is not an integer!''\n\n``But you can calculate the digits of pi, one at a time, by using certain formulas. And you can write down the formulas like so!'' Alan scratches this in the dirt:\n\n\n\n``I have used the Leibniz series in order to placate our friend. See, Lawrence? It is a string of symbols.''\n\n``Okay. I see the string of symbols,'' Lawrence said reluctantly.\n\n``Can we move on? Godel said, just a few years ago, `Say! If you buy into this business about mathematics being just strings of symbols, guess what?' And he pointed out that any string of symbols--such as this very formula, here--can be translated into integers.''\n\n``How?''\n\n``Nothing fancy, Lawrence--it's just simple encryption. Arbitrary. The number `538' might be written down instead of this great ugly \u00a3, and so on.''\n\n``Seems pretty close to wanking, now.''\n\n``No, no. Because then Godel sprang the trap! Formulas can act on numbers, right?''\n\n``Sure. Like 2x.''\n\n``Yes. You can substitute any number for x and the formula 2x will double it. But if another mathematical formula, such as this one right here, for calculating pi, can be encoded as a number, then you can have another formula act on it. Formulas acting on formulas!''\n\n``Is that all?''\n\n``No. Then he showed, really through a very simple argument, that if formulas really can refer to themselves, it's possible to write one down saying `this statement cannot be proved.' Which was tremendously startling to Hilbert and everyone else, who expected the opposite result.''\n\n``Have you mentioned this Hilbert guy before?''\n\n``No, he is new to this discussion, Lawrence.''\n\n``Who is he?''\n\n``A man who asks difficult questions. He asked a whole list of them once. Go[audel answered one of them.''\n\n``And Turing answered another,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Who's that?''\n\n``It's me,'' Alan said. ``But Rudy's joking. `Turing' doesn't really have an umlaut in it.''\n\n``He's going to have an umlaut in him later tonight,'' Rudy said, looking at Alan in a way that, in retrospect, years later, Lawrence would understand to have been smoldering.\n\n``Well, don't keep me in suspense. Which one of his questions did you answer?''\n\n``The Entscheidungsproblem,'' Rudy said.\n\n``Meaning?''\n\nAlan explained, ``Hilbert wanted to know whether any given statement could, in principle, be found true or false.''\n\n``But after Godel got finished, it changed,'' Rudy pointed out.\n\n``That's true--after Godel it became `Can we determine whether any given statement is provable or non-provable?' In other words, is there some sort of mechanical process we could use to separate the provable statements from the nonprovable ones?''\n\n`` `Mechanical process' is supposed to be a metaphor, Alan....''\n\n``Oh, stop it, Rudy! Lawrence and I are quite comfortable with machinery.''\n\n``I get it,'' Lawrence said.\n\n``What do you mean, you get it?'' Alan said.\n\n``Your machine--not the zeta-function calculator, but the other one. The one we've been talking about building--''\n\n``It is called Universal Turing Machine,'' Rudy said.\n\n``The whole point of that gizmo is to separate provable from nonprovable statements, isn't it?''\n\n``That's why I came up with the basic idea for it,'' Alan said. ``So Hilbert's question has been answered. Now I just want to actually build one so that I can beat Rudy at chess.''\n\n``You haven't told poor Lawrence the answer yet!'' Rudy protested.\n\n``Lawrence can figure it out,'' Alan said. ``It'll give him something to do.''\n\nSoon it became clear that Alan really meant: It'll give him something to do while we're fucking. Lawrence shoved a notebook into the waistband of his trousers and rode his bicycle a few hundred yards to the fire tower, then climbed up the stairs to the platform at the top and sat down, back to the setting sun, notebook propped up on his knees to catch the light.\n\nHe could not collect his thoughts, and then he was distracted by a false sunrise that lit up the clouds off to the northeast. He thought at first that some low clouds were bouncing fragments of the sunset back to him, but it was too concentrated and flickering for that. Then he thought it was lightning. But the color of the light was not blue enough. It fluctuated sharply, modulated by (one had to assume) great, startling events that were occulted by the horizon. As the sun went down on the opposite side of the world, the light on the New Jersey horizon focused to a steady, lambent core the color of a flashlight when you shine it through the palm of your hand under the bedsheets.\n\nLawrence climbed down the stairs and got on his bicycle and rode through the Pine Barrens. Before long he came to a road that led in the general direction of the light. Most of the time he could not see anything, not even the road, but after a couple of hours the glow bouncing off the low cloud layer lit up flat stones in the road, and turned the barrens' wandering rivulets into glowing crevices.\n\nThe road began to tend in the wrong direction and so Lawrence cut directly into the woods, because he was very close now, and the light in the sky was strong enough that he could see it through the sparse carpet of scrubby pines--black sticks that appeared to have been burned, though they hadn't. The ground had turned into sand, but it was damp and compacted, and his bicycle had fat tires that rode over it well. At one point he had to stop and throw the bike over a barbed-wire fence. Then he broke out of the sticks and onto a perfectly flat expanse of white sand, stitched down with tufts of beach grass, and just then he was dazzled by a low fence of quiet steady flames that ran across a part of the horizon about as wide as the harvest moon when it sinks into the sea. Its brightness made it difficult to see anything else--Lawrence kept riding into little ditches and creeks that meandered across the flats. He learned not to stare directly at the flames. Looking off to the sides was more interesting anyway: the table-land was marked at wide intervals by the largest buildings he had ever seen, cracker-box structures built by Pharaohs, and in the mile-wide plazas between them, gnomons of triangulated steel were planted in wide stances: the internal skeletons of pyramids. The largest of these pierced the center of a perfectly circular railway line a few hundred feet in diameter: two argent curves scored on the dull ground, interrupted in one place where the tower's shadow, a stopped sundial, told the time. He rode by a building smaller than the others, with oval tanks standing next to it. Steam murmured from valves on the tops of the tanks, but instead of rising into the air it dribbled down the sides and struck the ground and spread out, coating the sea-grass with jackets of silver.\n\nA thousand sailors in white were standing in a ring around the long flame. One of them held up his hand and waved Lawrence down. Lawrence came to a stop next to the sailor and planted one foot on the sand to steady himself. He and the sailor stared at each other for a moment and then Lawrence, who could not think of anything else, said, ``I am in the Navy also.'' Then the sailor seemed to make up his mind about something. He saluted Lawrence through, and pointed him towards a small building off to the side of the fire.\n\nThe building looked only like a wall glowing in the firelight, but sometimes a barrage of magnesium blue light made its windowframes jump out of the darkness, a rectangular lightning-bolt that echoed many times across the night. Lawrence started pedaling again and rode past that building: a spiraling flock of alert fedoras, prodding at slim terse notebooks with stately Ticonderogas, crab-walking photogs turning their huge chrome daisies, crisp rows of people sleeping with blankets over their faces, a sweating man with Brilliantined hair chalking umlauted names on a blackboard. Finally coming around this building he smelled hot fuel oil, felt the heat of the flames on his face and saw beach-glass curled toward it and desiccated.\n\nHe stared down upon the world's globe, not the globe fleshed with continents and oceans but only its skeleton: a burst of meridians, curving backwards to cage an inner dome of orange flame. Against the light of the burning oil those longitudes were thin and crisp as a draftsman's ink-strokes. But coming closer he saw them resolve into clever works of rings and struts, hollow as a bird's bones. As they spread away from the pole they sooner or later began to wander, or split into bent parts, or just broke off and hung in the fire oscillating like dry stalks. The perfect geometry was also mottled, here and there, by webs of cable and harnesses of electrical wiring. Lawrence almost rode over a broken wine bottle and decided he should now walk, to spare his bicycle's tires, so he laid the bike down, the front wheel covering an aluminum vase that appeared to have been spun on a lathe, with a few charred roses hanging out of it. Some sailors had joined their hands to form a sort of throne, and were bearing along a human-shaped piece of charcoal dressed in a coverall of immaculate asbestos. As they walked the toes of their shoes caught in vast, ramified snarls of ropes and piano-wires, cables and wires, creative furtive movements in the grass and the sand dozens of yards every direction. Lawrence began planting his feet very thoughtfully one in front of the other, trying to measure the greatness of what he had come and seen. A rocket-shaped pod stuck askew from the sand, supporting an umbrella of bent-back propellers. The duralumin struts and catwalks rambled on above him for miles. There was a suitcase spilled open, with a pair of women's shoes displayed as if in the window of a downtown store, and a menu that had been charred to an oval glow, and then some tousled wall-slabs, like a whole room that had dropped out of the sky--these were decorated, one with a giant map of the world, great circles arcing away from Berlin to pounce on cities near and far, and another with a photograph of a famous, fat German in a uniform, grinning on a flowered platform, the giant horizon of a new Zeppelin behind him.\n\nAfter a while he stopped seeing new things. Then he got on his bicycle and rode back through the Pine Barrens. He got lost in the dark and so didn't find his way back to the fire tower until dawn. But he didn't mind being lost because while he rode around in the dark he thought about the Turing machine. Finally he came back to the shore of the pond where they had camped. The dawn-light shining on the saucer of calm reddish water made it look like a pool of blood. Alan Mathison Turing and Rudolf von Hacklheber were lying together like spoons on the shore, still smudged a little bit from their swim yesterday. Lawrence started a little fire and made some tea and they woke up eventually.\n\n``Did you solve the problem?'' Alan asked him.\n\n``Well you can turn that Universal Turing Machine of yours into any machine by changing the presets--''\n\n``Presets?''\n\n``Sorry, Alan, I think of your U.T.M. as being kind of like a pipe organ.''\n\n``Oh.''\n\n``Once you've done that, anyway, you can do any calculation you please, if the tape is long enough. But gosh, Alan, making a tape that's long enough, and that you can write symbols on, and erase them, is going to be sort of tricky--Atanasoff's capacitor drum would only work up to a certain size--you'd have to--''\n\n``This is a digression,'' Alan said gently.\n\n``Yeah, okay, well--if you had a machine like that, then any given preset could be represented by a number--a string of symbols. And the tape that you would feed into it to start the calculation would contain another string of symbols. So it's Go[audel's proof all over again--if any possible combination of machine and data can be represented by a string of numbers, then you can just arrange all of the possible strings of numbers into a big table, and then it turns into a Cantor diagonal type of argument, and the answer is that there must be some numbers that cannot be computed.''\n\n``And ze Entscheidungsproblem?'' Rudy reminded him.\n\n``Proving or disproving a formula--once you've encrypted the formula into numbers, that is--is just a calculation on that number. So it means that the answer to the question is, no! Some formulas cannot be proved or disproved by any mechanical process! So I guess there's some point in being human after all!''\n\nAlan looked pleased until Lawrence said this last thing, and then his face collapsed. ``Now there you go making unwarranted assumptions.''\n\n``Don't listen to him, Lawrence!'' Rudy said. ``He's going to tell you that our brains are Turing machines.''\n\n``Thank you, Rudy,'' Alan said patiently. ``Lawrence, I submit that our brains are Turing machines.''\n\n``But you proved that there's a whole lot of formulas that a Turing machine can't process!''\n\n``And you have proved it too, Lawrence.''\n\n``But don't you think that we can do some things that a Turing machine couldn't?''\n\n``Godel agrees with you, Lawrence,'' Rudy put in, ``and so does Hardy.''\n\n``Give me one example,'' Alan said.\n\n``Of a noncomputable function that a human can do, and a Turing machine can't?''\n\n``Yes. And don't give me any sentimental nonsense about creativity. I believe that a Universal Turing Machine could show behaviors that we would construe as creative.''\n\n``Well, I don't know then... I'll try to keep my eye out for that kind of thing in the future.''\n\nBut later, as they were riding back towards Princeton, he said, ``What about dreams?''\n\n``Like those angels in Virginia?''\n\n``I guess so.''\n\n``Just noise in the neurons, Lawrence.''\n\n``Also I dreamed last night that a zeppelin was burning.''\n\n\n\nSoon, Alan got his Ph.D. and went back to England. He wrote Lawrence a couple of letters. The last of these stated, simply, that he would not be able to write Lawrence any more letters ``of substance'' and that Lawrence should not take it personally. Lawrence perceived right away that Alan's society had put him to work doing something useful--probably figuring out how to keep it from being eaten alive by certain of its neighbors. Lawrence wondered what use America would find for him.\n\nHe went back to Iowa State, considered changing his major to mathematics, but didn't. It was the consensus of all whom he consulted that mathematics, like pipe-organ restoration, was a fine thing, but that one needed some way to put bread on the table. He remained in engineering and did more and more poorly at it until the middle of his senior year, when the university suggested that he enter a useful line of work, such as roofing. He walked straight out of college into the waiting arms of the Navy.\n\nThey gave him an intelligence test. The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back?\n\nLawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat. Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river. Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations. Along the way, he realized that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem. If that didn't prove his intelligence, what would?\n\nThen the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal.\n\nLawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada. The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else.\n\nThe sack of mail carrying Lawrence's contribution to the mathematical literature arrived just in the nick of time. Lawrence's ship, and quite a few of her sisters, had until then been based in California. But at just this moment, all of them were transferred to some place called Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in order to show the Nips who was boss.\n\nLawrence had never really known what he wanted to do with his life, but he quickly decided that being glockenspiel player on a battleship in Hawaii during peacetime was a long way from the worst life you could possibly have. The harshest part of the job was sometimes having to sit or march in very warm conditions, and enduring occasional fluffed notes by other band members. He had abundant free time, which he spent working on a series of new theorems in the field of information theory. The field had been invented and pretty much encompassed by his friend Alan, but there was much detail work to be done. He and Alan and Rudy had sketched out a general plan of what needed to be proved or disproved. Lawrence tore through the list. He wondered what Alan and Rudy were up to in Britain and Germany, but he couldn't write to them and find out, so he kept his work to himself. When he wasn't playing the glockenspiel or working out theorems, there were bars and dances to go to. Waterhouse did some penis work of his own, got the clap, had it cured,* bought condoms. All of the sailors did this. They were like three-year olds who shove pencils in their ears, discover that it hurts, and stop doing it. Lawrence's first year went by almost instantly. Time just blazed by. Nowhere could be sunnier, more relaxing, than Hawaii.\n\n*1940 being a good year to begin experimenting with venereal diseases in that the new injectable penicillin was just becoming available\n\n\n\nNOVUS ORDO SECLORUM\n\n``Filipinos are a warm, gentle, caring, giving people,'' avi says, ``which is a good thing since so many of them carry concealed weapons.''\n\nRandy is in Tokyo's airport, ambling down a concourse with a slowness that is infuriating to his fellow travelers. They have all spent the last half-day strapped into bad chairs, stuffed into an aluminum tube aslosh with jet fuel. Over the safety-engineered nubs molded into the jetway floor, their rolling suitcases drone like fighter planes. They graze the backs of his knees as they bank around his husky columnar body. Randy is holding his new GSM phone to the side of his head. Supposedly it works anywhere in the world, except for the United States. This is his first chance to try it out.\n\n``You sound clear as a bell,'' Avi says. ``How was the flight over?''\n\n``All right,'' Randy says. ``They had one of those animated maps up on the video screen.''\n\nAvi sighs. ``All the airlines have those now,'' he announces monotonically.\n\n``The only feature between San Francisco and Tokyo was Midway Island.''\n\n``So?''\n\n``It kind of hung there for hours. MIDWAY. Mute embarrassment all around.''\n\nRandy reaches the departure gate for Manila, and pauses to admire a five-foot-wide high-definition TV set bearing the logo of a major Nipponese consumer-electronics company. It is running a video in which a wacky cartoon professor and his adorable canine sidekick cheerfully tick off the three transmission routes of the AIDS virus.\n\n``I have a fingerprint for you,'' Randy says.\n\n``Shoot.''\n\nRandy stares at the palm of his hand, on which he has written a string of numbers and letters in ballpoint pen. ``AF 10 06 E9 99 BA 11 07 64 C1 89 E3 40 8C 72 55.''\n\n``Got it,'' Avi says. ``That's from Ordo, right?''\n\n``Right. I e-mailed you the key from SFO.''\n\n``The apartment situation is still resolving,'' Avi says. ``So I just reserved you a suite at the Manila Hotel.''\n\n``What do you mean, it's still resolving?''\n\n``The Philippines is one of those post-Spanish countries with no clear boundaries between business and personal relationships,'' Avi says. ``I don't think you can secure lodgings there without marrying into a family with a major street named after it.''\n\nRandy takes a seat in the departure area. Perky gate attendants in jaunty, improbable hats zero in on Filipinos with too many carry-ons, and subject them to a public ritual of filling out little tags and surrendering their possessions. The Filipinos roll their eyes and stare longingly out the windows. But most of the waiting passengers are Nipponese--some businessmen, mostly vacationers. They are watching an educational video about how to get mugged in foreign countries.\n\n``Huh,'' Randy says, looking out the window, ``got another 747 down to Manila.''\n\n``In Asia, no decent airline bothers to dick around anything smaller than a 747,'' Avi snaps. ``If someone tries to pack you on board a 737 or god forbid an Airbus, run, don't walk, away from the boarding lounge, and call me on my Sky Pager and I'll send in a chopper to evacuate you.''\n\nRandy laughs.\n\nAvi continues. ``Now, listen. This hotel you're going to is very old, very grand, but it's in the middle of nowhere.''\n\n``Why would they build a grand hotel in the middle of nowhere?''\n\n``It used to be a happening place--it's on the waterfront, right on the edge of Intramuros.''\n\nRandy's high-school Spanish is enough to translate that: Inside the Walls.\n\n``But Intramuros was annihilated by the Nipponese in 1945,'' Avi continues. ``Systematically. All of the business hotels and office buildings are in a new neighborhood called Makati, much closer to the airport.''\n\n``So you want to put our office in Intramuros.''\n\n``How'd you guess?'' Avi says, sounding a little spooked. He prides himself on unpredictability.\n\n``I'm not an intuitive guy generally,'' Randy says, ``but I've been on a plane for thirteen hours and my brain has been turned inside out and hung up to dry.''\n\nAvi rattles off canned justifications: office space is much cheaper in Intramuros. Government ministries are closer. Makati, the gleaming new business district, is too isolated from the real Philippines. Randy pays no attention to it.\n\n``You want to work out of Intramuros because it was systematically annihilated, and because you're obsessed with the Holocaust,'' Randy finally says, quietly and without rancor.\n\n``Yeah. So?'' Avi says.\n\nRandy stares out the window of the Manila-bound 747, sipping on a fluorescent green Nipponese soft drink made from bee extracts (at least, it has pictures of bees on it) and munching on something that a flight attendant handed him called Japanese Snack. Sky and ocean are the same color, a shade of blue that makes his teeth freeze. The plane is so high that, whether he looks up or down, he sees foreshortened views of boiling cumulonimbus stacks. The clouds erupt from the hot Pacific as if immense warships were exploding all over the place. The speed and power of their growth is alarming, the forms they adopt as bizarre and varied as those of deep-sea organisms, and all of them, he supposes, are as dangerous to an airplane as punji stakes to a barefoot pedestrian. The red-orange meatball painted on the wingtip startles him when he notices it. He feels like he's been thrown into an old war film.\n\nHe turns on his laptop. Electronic mail from Avi, encrypted to a fare-thee-well, has been piling up in his in-box. It is a gradual accumulation of tiny files, thrown at him by Avi whenever a thought popped into his head over the last three days; it would be obvious, even if Randy didn't know it, that Avi owns a portable e-mail machine that talks to the Internet by radio. Randy fires up a piece of software that is technically called Novus Ordo Seclorum but that everyone calls Ordo for short. It is a fairly strained pun based on the fact that Ordo's job, as a piece of cryptographic software, is to put a message's bits in a New Order and that it will take Centuries for nosy governments to decrypt it. A scanned image of a Great Pyramid appears in the middle of his screen, and a single eye gradually materializes at its apex.\n\nOrdo can handle this in one of two ways. The obvious way is to decrypt all of the messages and convert them into plaintext files on his hard disk, which he can then read any time he wants. The problem with this (if you are paranoid) is that anyone who gets his hands on Randy's hard disk can then read the files. For all he knows, the customs officials in Manila will decide to ransack his computer for child pornography. Or, fogged by jet lag, he'll leave his laptop in a taxi. So instead he puts Ordo into a streaming mode where it will decrypt the files just long enough for him to read them and then, when he closes the windows, expunge the plaintext from the computer's memory and from its hard drive.\n\nThe subject heading of Avi's first message is: ``Guideline 1.''\n\nWe look for places where the math is right. Meaning what? Meaning that pop. is about to explode---we can predict that just by looking at age histogram---and per capita income is about to take off the way it did in Nippon, Taiwan, Singapore. Multiply those two things together and you get the kind of exponential growth that should get us all into fuck-you money before we turn forty.\n\nThis is an allusion to a Randy/Avi conversation of two years ago wherein Avi actually calculated a specific numerical value for ``fuck-you money.'' It was not a fixed constant, however, but rather a cell in a spreadsheet linked to any number of continually fluctuating economic indicators. Sometimes when Avi is working at his computer he will leave the spreadsheet running in a tiny window in the corner so that he can see the current value of ``fuck-you money'' at a glance.\n\nThe second message, sent a couple of hours later, is called ``Guideline 2.''\n\nTwo: pick a tech where no one can compete with us. Right now, that=networking. We're kicking the crap out of everyone else in the world when it comes to networking. It's not even funny.\n\nThe next day, Avi sent a message called, simply, ``More.'' Perhaps he had lost track of the number of guidelines he'd issued so far.\n\nAnother principle: this time we retain control of the corporation. That means that we keep at least fifty percent of the shares---which means little to no outside investment until we've built up some value.\n\n``You don't have to convince me,'' Randy mumbles to himself, as he reads this.\n\nThis shapes the kinds of businesses we can get into. Forget anything that requires a big initial investment.\n\nLuzon is green-black jungle mountains gouged with rivers that would appear to be avalanches of silt. As the navy-blue ocean verges on its khaki beaches, the water takes on the shocking iridescent hue of a suburban swimming pool. Farther south, the mountains are swidden-scarred--the soil beneath is bright red and so these parts look like fresh lacerations. But most is covered with foliage that looks like the nubby green stuff that model railroaders put over their papier-mache hills, and in vast stretches of the mountains there are no signs whatsoever that human beings have ever existed. Closer to Manila, some of the slopes are deforested, sprinkled with structures, ribboned with power-line cuts. Rice paddies line the basins. The towns are accretions of shanties, nucleated around large cross-shaped churches with good roofs.\n\nThe view gets blurry as they belly down into the pall of sweaty smog above the city. The plane begins to sweat like a giant glass of iced tea. The water streams off in sheets, collects in crevices, whips off the flaps' trailing edges.\n\nSuddenly they are banking over Manila Bay, which is marked with endless streaks of brilliant red--some kind of algal bloom. Oil tankers trail long time-delayed rainbows that flourish in their wakes. Every cove is jammed with long skinny boats with dual outriggers, looking like brightly painted water skaters.\n\nAnd then they are down on the runway at NAIA, Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Guards and cops of various stripes are ambling around with M-16s or pistol-handled pump shotguns, wearing burnooses fashioned from handkerchiefs clamped to the head with American baseball caps. A man dressed in a radiant white uniform stands below the ragged maw of the jetway holding his hands downwards with fluorescent orange sticks in them, like Christ dispensing mercy on a world of sinners. Sulfurous, fulminating tropical air begins to leak in through the jumbo's air vents. Everything moistens and wilts.\n\nHe is in Manila. He takes his passport out of his shirt pocket. It says, RANDALL LAWRENCE WATERHOUSE.\n\n\n\nThis is how Epiphyte Corporation came into existence:\n\n``I am channeling the bad shit!'' Avi said.\n\nThe number came through on Randy's pager while he was sitting around a table in a grubhouse along the coast with his girlfriend's crowd. A place where, every day, they laser-printed fresh menus on 100% recycled imitation parchment, where oscilloscope tracings of neon-colored sauces scribbled across the plates, and the entrees were towering, architectonic stacks of rare ingredients carved into gemlike prisms. Randy had spent the entire meal trying to resist the temptation to invite one of Charlene's friends (any one of them, it didn't matter) out on the sidewalk for a fistfight.\n\nHe glanced at his pager expecting to see the number of the Three Siblings Computer Center, which was where he worked (technically, still does). The fell digits of Avi's phone number penetrated the core of his being in the same way that 666 would a fundamentalist's.\n\nFifteen seconds later, Randy was out on the sidewalk, swiping his card through a pay phone like an assassin drawing a single-edged razor blade across the throat of a tubby politician.\n\n``The power is coming down from On High,'' Avi continued. ``Tonight, it happens to be coming through me--you poor bastard.''\n\n``What do you want me to do?'' Randy asked, adopting a cold, almost hostile tone to mask sick excitement.\n\n``Buy a ticket to Manila,'' Avi said.\n\n``I have to talk it over with Charlene first,'' Randy said.\n\n``You don't even believe that yourself,'' Avi said.\n\n``Charlene and I have a long-standing relationsh--''\n\n``It's been ten years. You haven't married her. Fill in the fucking blanks.''\n\n(Seventy-two hours later, he would be in Manila, looking at the One-Note Flute.)\n\n``Everyone in Asia is wondering when the Philippines is finally going to get its shit together,'' Avi said, ``it's the question of the nineties.''\n\n(The One-Note Flute is the first thing you see when you make it through passport control.)\n\n``I flashed on this when I was standing in line at Passport Control at Ninoy Aquino International Airport,'' Avi said, compressing that entire name into a single, sharply articulated burst. ``You know how they have different lanes?''\n\n``I guess so,'' Randy said. A parallelpiped of seared tuna did a barrel roll in his gullet. He felt a perverse craving for a double ice-cream cone. He did not travel as much as Avi, and had only a vague idea of what he meant by lanes.\n\n``You know. One lane for citizens. One for foreigners. Maybe one for diplomats.''\n\n(Now, standing there waiting to have his passport stamped, Randy can see it clearly. For once he doesn't mind the wait. He gets in a lane next to the OCW lane and studies them. They are Epiphyte Corp.'s market. Mostly young women, many of them fashionably dressed, but still with a kind of Catholic boarding-school demureness. Exhausted from long flights, tired of the wait, they slump, then suddenly straighten up and elevate their fine chins, as if an invisible nun were making her way up the line whacking their manicured knuckles with a ruler.)\n\nBut seventy-two hours ago he hadn't really understood what Avi meant by lanes, so he just said, ``Yeah, I've seen the lane thing.''\n\n``At Manila, they have a whole lane just for returning OCWs!''\n\n``OCWs?''\n\n``Overseas Contract Workers. Filipinos working abroad--because the economy of the Philippines is so lame. As maids and nannies in Saudi. Nurses and anesthesiologists in the States. Singers in Hong Kong, whores in Bangkok.''\n\n``Whores in Bangkok?'' Randy had been there, at least, and his mind reeled at the concept of importing prostitutes to Thailand.\n\n``The Filipino women are more beautiful,'' Avi said quietly, ``and have a ferocity that makes them more interesting, to the innately masochistic business traveler, than all those grinning Thai bimbos.'' Both of them knew that this was complete bullshit; Avi was a family man and had no firsthand experience whereof he spoke. Randy didn't call him on it, though. As long as Avi retained this extemporaneous bullshitting ability there was a better than even chance of all of them making fuck-you money.\n\n(Now that he's here, it is tempting to speculate as to which of the girls in the OCW lane are hustlers. But he can't see that going anywhere but wrong, so he squares his shoulders and marches toward the yellow line.\n\nThe government has set up glass display cases in the concourse leading from passport control to the security barrier. The cases contain artifacts demonstrating the glories of pre-Magellan Filipino culture. The first one of these contains the piece de resistance: a rustic hand-carved musical instrument labeled with a long and unreadable name in Tagalog. Underneath that, in smaller letters, is the English translation: ONE-NOTE FLUTE.)\n\n``See? The Philippines is innately hedged,'' Avi said. ``You know how rare that is? When you find an innately hedged environment, Randy, you lunge into it like a rabid ferret going into a pipe full of raw meat.''\n\nA word about Avi: his father's people had just barely gotten out of Prague. As Central European Jews went, they were fairly typical. The only thing about them that was really anomalous was that they were still alive. But his mother's people were unbelievably peculiar New Mexican crypto-Jews who had been living on mesas, dodging Jesuits, shooting rattlesnakes and eating jimson weed for three hundred years; they looked like Indians and talked like cowboys. In his relations with other people, therefore, Avi dithered. Most of the time he was courtly and correct in a way that was deeply impressive to businesspeople--Nipponese ones expecially--but there were these eruptions, from time to time, as if he'd been dipping into the loco weed. Randy had learned to deal with it, which is why Avi called him at times like this.\n\n``Oh, calm down!'' Randy said. He watched a tanned girl rollerblade past him, on her way up from the beach. ``Innately hedged?''\n\n``As long as the Philippines don't have their shit together, there'll be plenty of OCWs. They will want to communicate with their families--the Filipinos are incredibly family-oriented. They make Jews look like a bunch of alienated loners.''\n\n``Okay. You know more about both groups than I do.''\n\n``They are sentimental and affectionate in a way that's very easy for us to sneer at.''\n\n``You don't have to be defensive,'' Randy said, ``I'm not sneering at them.''\n\n``When you hear their song dedications on the radio, you'll sneer,'' Avi said. ``But frankly, we could take some pointers from the Pinoys on this front.''\n\n``You are so close to being sanctimonious right now--''\n\n``I apologize,'' Avi said, with absolute sincerity. Avi's wife had been pregnant almost continuously for the four years they'd been married. He was getting more religiously observant daily and couldn't make it through a conversation without mentioning the Holocaust. Randy was a bachelor who was just about to break up with the chick he'd been living with.\n\n``I believe you, Avi,'' Randy said. ``Is it a problem with you if I buy a business-class ticket?''\n\nAvi didn't hear him, so Randy assumed that meant yes. ``As long as that's the case, there will be a big market for Pinoy-grams.''\n\n``Pinoy-grams?''\n\n``For god's sake, don't say it out loud! I'm filling out the trademark application as we speak,'' Avi said. Randy could hear a rattling sound in the background, computer keys impacting so rapidly it sounded like Avi was simply holding the keyboard between his pale, spindly hands and shaking it violently up and down. ``But if the Filipinos do get their shit together, then we see explosive growth in telecoms, as in any other Arday.''\n\n``Arday?''\n\n``R-D-A-E. Rapidly Developing Asian Economy. Either way, we win.''\n\n``I gather you want to do something with telecoms?''\n\n``Bingo.'' In the background, a baby began to cough and cry. ``Gotta go,'' Avi said, ``Shlomo's asthma is spiking again. Take down this fingerprint.''\n\n``Fingerprint?''\n\n``For my encryption key. For e-mail.''\n\n``Ordo?''\n\n``Yeah.''\n\nRandy took out a ballpoint pen and, finding no paper in his pocket, poised it over the palm of his hand. ``Shoot.''\n\n``67 81 A4 AE FF 40 25 9B 43 0E 29 8D 56 60 E3 2F.'' Then Avi hung up the phone.\n\nRandy went back into the restaurant. On his way back, he asked the waiter to bring him a half-bottle of good red wine. Charlene heard him, and glowered. Randy was still thinking about innate ferocity, and did not see it in her face; only a schoolmarmishness common among all of her friends. My god! I have to get out of California, he realized.\n\n\nSEAWEED\n\nWoman holds baby\n\nEyes pale as a muzzle flash\n\nBand chimes frozen tears\n\nThe fourth marines is marching downhill to the strains of John Philip Sousa, which ought to be second nature to a Marine. But the Fourth Marines have been in Shanghai (which ain't no halls of Montezuma nor shores of Tripoli) for too long, longer than Marines should ever stay in one place, and Bobby's already seen his sergeant, one Frick, throw up from opium withdrawal.\n\nA Marine band is several Shanghai blocks ahead. Bobby's platoon can hear the thumpity-thump of the big drums and the piercing noises from piccolos and glockenspiels but he can't follow the tune. Corporal Shaftoe is effectively their leader, because Sergeant Frick is useless.\n\nShaftoe marches alongside the formation, supposedly to keep an eye on his men, but mostly he's just staring at Shanghai.\n\nShanghai stares back, and mostly gives them a standing ovation. Of course there is a type of young street rowdy who makes it a point of honor to let the Marines know he isn't scared of them, and they are jeering the Marines from a safe distance, and setting off strings of firecrackers, which does nothing to steady anyone's nerves. The Europeans are applauding--a whole chorus line of Russian dancing girls from Delmonte's is showing thigh and blowing kisses. But most of the Chinese look pretty stonefaced, which--Bobby suspects--means they're scared shitless.\n\nThe worst thing is the women carrying half-white babies. A few of these women are rabid, hysterical, throwing themselves into formations of massed Marines, undeterred by rifle butts. But most of them are stoic: they stand with their light-eyed babies and glare, searching the ranks and files for the guilty party. They've all heard about what happened upriver in Nanjing when the Nips came there, and they know that when it's all over, the only trace that they and their babies ever existed may be a really bad memory in the mind of some American Marine.\n\nIt works for Shaftoe: he has hunted deer in Wisconsin and seen them limping across the snow, bleeding to death. He saw a man die in basic training at Parris Island. He has seen whole tangles of bodies in the Yangtze, downstream of where the Nipponese were prosecuting the China Incident, and he has seen refugees from places like Nanjing starve to death in the gutters of Shanghai. He has himself killed people who were trying to storm the riverboats it was his duty to protect. He thinks that he has never seen, and will never see, anything as terrible as those stone-faced Chinese women holding their white babies, not even blinking as the firecrackers explode all around them.\n\nUntil, that is, he looks into the faces of certain Marines who stare into that crowd and see their own faces looking back at them, pudgy with baby fat and streaked with tears. Some of them seem to think it's all a joke. But many of the Marines who march out of their empty barracks that morning sane and solid men, have, by the time they reach the gunboats waiting for them at the Bund, gone mad. They don't show it. But Shaftoe can see in their eyes that something has given way inside.\n\nThe very best men in the regiment are in a foul mood. The ones like Shaftoe, who didn't get involved with the Chinese women, are still leaving plenty behind: houses with maids and shoeshine boys and coolies, with women and opium for almost nothing. They don't know where they are being shipped off to, but it's safe to say that their twenty-one dollars a month won't go as far. They'll be in barracks and they'll have to learn to polish their own boots again. When the gangplanks are drawn in from the stone edge of the Bund, they are cut off from a whole world that they'll never see again, a world where they were kings. Now they are Marines again. It's okay with Shaftoe, who wants to be a Marine. But many of the men have become middle-aged here, and don't.\n\nThe guilty men duck belowdecks. Shaftoe remains on the deck of the gunboat, which casts off from the Bund, headed for the cruiser Augusta, which awaits in mid-channel.\n\nThe Bund is jammed with onlookers in a riot of differently colored clothing, so one patch of uniform drab catches his eye: a group of Nip soldiers who've come down to bid their Yank counterparts a sarcastic farewell. Shaftoe scans the group looking for someone tall and bulky, and picks him out easily. Goto Dengo's waving to him.\n\nShaftoe takes his helmet off and waves back. Then, on impulse, just for the hell of it, he winds up and flings the helmet directly at Goto Dengo's head. The throw goes awry and Goto Dengo has to knock down about a dozen of his comrades in order to catch it. All of them seem to think that it is a high honor, as well as tremendously amusing, to be knocked down by Goto Dengo.\n\nTwenty seconds later, a comet sails up out of the flesh cosmos of the Bund and bounces on the wooden deck of the gunboat--a hell of a throw. Goto Dengo is showing off his follow-through. The projectile is a rock with a white streamer wrapped around it. Shaftoe runs over and snatches it. The streamer is one of those thousand-stitch headbands (supposedly; he's taken a few off of unconscious Nips, but he's never bothered to count the stitches) that they tie around their heads as a good-luck charm; it has a meatball in the center and some Nip writing to either side. He unties it from around the rock. In so doing he realizes, suddenly, that it's not a rock after all; it is a hand grenade! But good old Goto Dengo was just joking--he didn't pull the pin. A nice souvenir for Bobby Shaftoe.\n\nShaftoe's first haiku (December 1940) was a quick and dirty adaptation of the Marine Creed:\n\nThis is my rifle\n\nThere are many like it but\n\nThis rifle is mine.\n\nHe wrote it under the following circumstances: Shaftoe and the rest of Fourth Marines were stationed in Shanghai so that they could guard the International Settlement and work as muscle on the gunboats of the Yangtze River Patrol. His platoon had just come back from the Last Patrol: a thousand-mile reconnaissance-in-force all the way up past what was left of Nanjing, to Hankow, and back. Marines had been doing this ever since the Boxer Rebellion, through civil wars and everything else. But towards the end of 1940, what with the Nips basically running all of northeast China now, the politicians back in D.C. had finally thrown in the towel and told the China Marines not to steam up the Yangtze any more.\n\nNow, the Old Breed Marines like Frick claimed they could tell the difference between organized brigands; armed mobs of starving peasants; rogue Nationalists; Communist guerrillas; and the irregular forces in the pay of warlords. But to Bobby Shaftoe they were all just crazy, armed slopes who wanted a piece of the Yangtze River Patrol. The Last Patrol had been a wild trip. But it was over and they were back in Shanghai now, the safest place you could be in China, and about a hundred times more dangerous than the most dangerous place you could be in America. They had climbed off the gunboat six hours ago, gone to a bar, and not come out until just now, when they had decided it was high time they went to a whorehouse. On their way, they happened to pass this Nip restaurant.\n\nBobby Shaftoe had looked in the windows of the place before, and watched the man with the knife, trying to figure out what the hell he was doing. It looked a hell of a lot like he was cutting up uncooked fish and putting the raw meat on bullets of rice and handing it over to the Nips on the other side of the counter, who were wolfing it down.\n\nIt had to be some kind of optical illusion. The fish must have been precooked in the back room.\n\nThis had been nagging at Shaftoe for about a year. As he and the other horny drunk Marines went by the place, he slowed down to peer through the window, trying to gather more evidence. He could swear that some of that fish looked ruby red, which it wouldn't have been if it were cooked.\n\nOne of his buddies, Rhodes from Shreveport, noticed him looking. He dared Shaftoe to go in there and sit down at that bar. Then another private, Gowicki from Pittsburgh, double-dared him!\n\nShaftoe sucked his teeth and considered the matter. He had already made up his mind that he was going to do it. He was a sniper scout, and it was in his nature to do crazy shit like this; but it was also part of his training to scan the terrain carefully before venturing in.\n\nThe restaurant was three-quarters full, and everyone in the place was a uniformed member of the Nipponese military. At the bar where the man was cutting up the apparently raw fish, there was a marked concentration of officers; if you only had one grenade, that's where you'd throw it. Most of the place was filled with long tables where enlisted men sat, drinking noodle soup from steaming urns. Shaftoe paid particular attention to these, because they were the ones who were going to be beating the shit out of him in about sixty seconds. Some were there alone, with reading material. A cluster of them, back in one corner, were paying attention to one fellow who was apparently telling a joke or story.\n\nThe longer Shaftoe spent reconnoitering the place, the more convinced Rhodes and Gowicki became that he was actually going to do it. They became excited and called for the other Marines, who had gone ahead of them down the block, headed for that whorehouse.\n\nShaftoe saw the others coming back--his tactical reserve. ``What the fuck,'' he said, and went into the restaurant. Behind him, he could hear the others shouting excitedly; they couldn't believe he was doing it. When Shaftoe stepped over the threshold of that Nip restaurant, he passed into the realm of legend.\n\nAll the Nips looked up at him when he came in the door. If they were surprised, they didn't show it. The chef behind the counter began to holler out some kind of ritual greeting, which faltered and trailed off as he got a look at what had just come in. The fellow in the back of the room--a husky, pink-cheeked Nip--continued telling his joke or story or whatever it was.\n\nShaftoe nodded to no one in particular, then stepped to the nearest empty chair at the bar and sat down.\n\nOther Marines would have waited until the whole squad had assembled. Then they would have invaded the restaurant en masse, knocked over a few chairs, spilled some soup. But Shaftoe had seized the initiative before the others could do any such thing and gone in by himself, as a sniper scout was supposed to do. It was not just because he was a sniper scout, though. It was also because he was Bobby Shaftoe, and he was sincerely curious about this place, and if he could, he wanted to spend a few calm minutes in here and learn a few things about it before the fun started.\n\nIt helped, of course, that Shaftoe was a quiet and contemplative drunk, not a dangerous explosive drunk. He must have reeked of beer (those Krauts in Tsingtao cranked out a brew whose taste took him right back to Wisconsin, and he was homesick). But he wasn't hollering or knocking things over.\n\nThe chef was busy crafting one of his little morsels and pretended to ignore Shaftoe. The other men at the counter stared coldly at Shaftoe for a while, then turned their attentions back to their food. Shaftoe looked at the array of raw fish laid out on shaved ice behind the bar, then looked around the room. The guy back in the corner was talking in short bursts, reading from a notebook. He would speak maybe ten or twenty words, and then his little audience would turn to one another and grin, or grimace, or sometimes even make a patter of applause. He wasn't delivering his material like a dirty joke. He spoke precisely and expressively.\n\nFuck! He was reading poetry! Shaftoe had no idea what he was saying, but he could tell, by the sound of it, that it must be poetry. Didn't rhyme though. But the Nips did everything queerly.\n\nHe noticed that the chef was glaring at him. He cleared his throat, which was useless since he couldn't speak Nip. He looked at some of that ruby red fish behind the bar, pointed to it, held up two fingers.\n\nEveryone was startled that the American had actually placed an order. The tension was broken, only a little. The chef went to work and produced two morsels, which he served up on a wooden pedestal.\n\nShaftoe had been trained to eat insects, and to bite the heads off chickens, so he figured he could handle this. He picked the morsels up in his fingers, just like the Nips were doing, and ate them. They were good. He ordered two more, of another variety. The guy in the corner kept reading poetry. Shaftoe ate his morsels and then ordered some more. For perhaps ten seconds, between the taste of the fish and the sound of the poetry, he actually felt comfortable here, and forgot that he was merely instigating a vicious racial brawl.\n\nThe third order looked different: laid over the top of the raw fish were thin translucent sheets of some kind of moist, glistening material. It looked sort of like butcher paper soaked in oil. Shaftoe gawked at it for a while, trying to identify it, but it looked like no foodstuff he knew of. He glanced left and right, hoping that one of the Nips had ordered the same stuff, so that he could watch and learn the right way to eat it. No luck.\n\nHell, they were officers. Maybe one of them spoke a little English. `` 'Scuse me. What's this?'' Shaftoe said, peeling up one corner of the eerie membrane.\n\nThe chef looked up at him nervously, then scanned the bar, polling the customers. Discussion ensued. Finally, a Nip officer at the end of the bar, a naval lieutenant, stood up and spoke to Bobby Shaftoe.\n\n``Seaweed.''\n\nShaftoe did not particularly like the lieutenant's tone of voice--hostile and sullen. This, combined with the look on his face, seemed to say, You'll never understand it, you farmer, so why don't you just think of it as seaweed.\n\nShaftoe folded his hands primly in his lap, regarded the seaweed for a few moments, and then looked up at the lieutenant, who was still gazing at him expressionlessly. ``What kind of seaweed, sir?'' he said.\n\nSignificant glances began flying around the restaurant, like semaphores before a naval engagement. The poetry reading seemed to have stopped, and a migration of enlisted men had begun from the back of the room. Meanwhile the lieutenant translated Shaftoe's inquiry to the others, who discussed it in some detail, as if it were a major policy initiative from Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\n\nThe lieutenant and the chef exchanged words. Then the lieutenant looked at Shaftoe again. ``He say, you pay now.'' The chef held up one hand and rubbed his fingers and thumb together.\n\nA year of working the Yangtze River Patrol had given Bobby Shaftoe nerves of titanium, and unlimited faith in his comrades, and so he resisted the impulse to turn his head and look out the window. He already knew exactly what he would see: Marines, shoulder to shoulder, ready to die for him. He scratched the new tattoo on his forearm: a dragon. His dirty fingernails, passing over the fresh scabs, made a rasping sound in the utterly silent restaurant.\n\n``You didn't answer my question,'' Shaftoe said, pronouncing the words with a drunk's precision.\n\nThe lieutenant translated this into Nipponese. More discussion. But this time it was curt and decisive. Shaftoe could tell that they were about to bounce him. He squared his shoulders.\n\nThe Nips were good; they mounted an organized charge out the door, onto the sidewalk, and engaged the Marines, before anyone actually laid a hand on Shaftoe. This spoiling attack prevented the Marines from invading the restaurant proper, which would have disturbed the officers' meal and, with any luck, led to untold property damage. Shaftoe then felt himself being grabbed from behind by at least three people and hoisted into the air. He made eye contact with the lieutenant while this was happening, and shouted: ``Are you bullshitting me about the seaweed?''\n\nAs brawls went, the only remarkable part of this one was the way he was carried out to the street before he could actually get started. Then it was like all the other street fights he'd been in with Nip soldiers in Shanghai. These all came down to American brawn (you didn't get picked for the Fourth Regiment unless you were an impressive-looking six-footer) versus that Nipponese chop-socky.\n\nShaftoe wasn't a boxer. He was a wrestler. This was to his advantage. The other Marines would put up their dukes and try to fight it out--Marquis of Queensberry style--no match for chop-socky. Shaftoe had no illusions about his boxing, so he would just put his head down and charge like a bull, take a few blows to the face on his way in, but usually get a solid hold on his opponent and slam him into the cobblestones. Usually that shook the Nip up enough that Shaftoe could get him in a full-nelson or a hammerlock and get him to cry uncle.\n\nThe guys who were carrying him out of the restaurant got jumped by Marines as soon as they were in the open. Shaftoe found himself going up against an opponent who was at least as tall as he was, which was unusual. This one had a solid build, too. Not like a sumo wrestler. More like a football player--a lineman, with a bit of a gut. He was a strong S.O.B. and Shaftoe knew right away that he was in for a real scrape. The guy had a different style of wrestling from the American, which (as Shaftoe learned the hard way) included some illegal maneuvers: partial strangulation and powerful, short punches to major nerve centers. The gulf between Shaftoe's mind and body, already wedged open by alcohol, was yanked open to a chasm by these techniques. He ended up lying on the sidewalk, helpless and paralyzed, staring up into the chubby face of his opponent. This was (he realized) the same guy who'd been sitting in the corner of the restaurant reading poetry. He was a good wrestler for a poet. Or maybe vice versa.\n\n``It is not seaweed,'' said the big Nip. He had a look on his face like a naughty schoolkid getting away with something. ``The English word is maybe calabash?'' Then he turned and walked back into the restaurant.\n\nSo much for legend. What none of the other Marines knows is that this was not the last encounter between Bobby Shaftoe and Goto Dengo. The incident left Shaftoe with any number of nagging questions about subjects as diverse as seaweed, poetry, and chop-socky. He sought out Goto Dengo after that, which was not that hard--he just paid some Chinese boys to follow the conspicuous Nip around town and file daily reports. From this he learned that Goto Dengo and some of his comrades gathered every morning in a certain park to practice their chop-socky. After making sure that his will was in order and writing a last letter to his parents and siblings in Oconomowoc, Shaftoe went to that park one morning, reintroduced himself to the surprised Goto Dengo, and made arrangements to serve as human punching bag. They found his self-defense skills hilariously primitive but admired his resilience, and so, for the small cost of a few broken ribs and digits, Bobby Shaftoe got a preliminary course in the particular type of chop-socky favored by Goto Dengo, which is called judo. Over time, this even led to a few social engagements in bars, and restaurants, where Shaftoe learned to recognize four types of seaweed, three types of fish eggs, and several flavors of Nip poetry. Of course he had no idea what the fuck they were saying, but he could count syllables, which, as far as he could tell, is about all there is to Nip poetry appreciation.\n\nNot that this--or any other knowledge of their culture--is going to do him any good now that it will soon be his job to kill them.\n\nIn return, Shaftoe taught Goto Dengo how not to throw like a girl. A lot of the Nips are good at baseball and so it was hilarious, even to them, to see their burly friend pushing ineffectually at a baseball. But it was Shaftoe who taught Goto Dengo to stand sideways, to rotate his shoulders, and to follow through. He's paid a lot of attention to the big Nip's throwing form during the last year, and maybe that's why the image of Goto Dengo planting his feet on the ashlars of the Bund, winding up, throwing the streamer-wrapped grenade, and following through almost daintily on one combat-booted foot stays in Shaftoe's mind all the way to Manila and beyond.\n\n\n\nA couple of days into the voyage it becomes apparent that Sergeant Frick has forgotten how to shine his boots. Every night he puts them on the deck beside his bunk, like he's expecting a coolie to come around and shine them up during the night. Every morning he wakes up and finds them in a sorrier state than before. After a few days he starts to draw reprimands from On High, starts to get a lot of potato-peeling duty.\n\nNow in and of itself this is forgivable. Frick started out his career chasing bandolier-draped desperadoes away from mail trains on the High Chaparral, for God's sake. In '27 he got shipped off to Shanghai on very short notice, and no doubt had to display some adaptability. Fine. And now he's on this miserable pre-Great War cruiser and it's a little hard on him. Fine. But he does not take all of this with the dignity that is demanded of Marines by Marines. He whines about it. He lets himself get humiliated. He gets angry. A lot of the other old China Marines see things his way.\n\nOne day Bobby Shaftoe is up on the deck of the destroyer tossing the old horsehide around with a couple of the other young Marines when he sees a few of these older guys accumulating into a sort of human booger on the afterdeck. He can tell by the looks on their faces and by their gestures that they are bellyaching.\n\nShaftoe hears a couple of the ship's crew talking to each other nearby. ``What the hell is wrong with those Marines?'' one of them says. The other one shakes his head sadly, like a doctor who has just seen a patient's eyeballs roll up into their sockets. ``Those poor bastards have gone Asiatic,'' he says.\n\nAnd then they turn and look at Shaftoe.\n\nThat evening, at mess, Bobby Shaftoe gulps his food down double-time, then stands up and approaches the table where those Old Breed Marines are sullenly gathered. ``Begging your pardon, Sergeant!'' he hollers. ``Request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''\n\nFrick's mouth drops open, revealing a half-chewed plug of boiled beef. ``Whud you say, Corporal?''\n\nThe mess has gone silent. ``Respectfully request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''\n\nFrick is not the quickest guy in the world even when he's sober, and it's pretty obvious, just from looking at his pupils, that he and his comrades have brought some opium aboard. ``Wull, uh, I guess so,'' he says. He looks around at his crew of gripers, who are a little confused and a little amused. He unlaces his boots. Bobby Shaftoe takes those disgraceful things away and returns a bit later with them resplendently shined. By this time, Frick has gotten high and mighty. ``Wull, those boots look real good, Corporal Shaftoe,'' he says in a brassy voice. ``Darned if you ain't as good a shoe-shiner as my coolie boy was.''\n\nAt lights out, Frick and crew are short-sheeted. Various other, ruder practical jokes ensue during the nighttime. One of them gets jumped in his bunk and beaten by unspecified attackers. The brass call a surprise inspection the next morning and cuss them out. The ``gone Asiatic'' crew spend most of the next day gathered in a cluster, watching each other's backs.\n\nAround midday, Frick finally gets it through his head that all of this was triggered by Shaftoe's gesture, and that Shaftoe knew, all along, what was going to happen. So he rushes Bobby Shaftoe up on the deck and tries to throw him over the rail.\n\nShaftoe's warned at the last minute by one of his compadres, and spins around just enough to throw off Frick's attack. Frick caroms off the rail, turns around, and tries to grab Shaftoe's nuts. Shaftoe pokes him in the eye, which straightens him right up. They back away from each other. The opening formalities having been finished; they put up their dukes.\n\nFrick and Shaftoe box for a couple of rounds. A large crowd of Marines gathers. On most of their cards, Frick is winning the fight. Frick was always dim-witted, and is now crazy to boot, but he knows his way around a boxing ring, and he has forty pounds on Shaftoe.\n\nShaftoe puts up with it until Frick socks him pretty hard in the mouth and gives him a bloody lip.\n\n``How far are we from Manila?'' Shaftoe hollers. This question, as usual, leaves Sergeant Frick confused and bewildered, and straightens him up for a moment.\n\n``Two days,'' answers one of the ship's officers.\n\n``Well, goddamn,'' Bobby Shaftoe says. ``How'm I gonna kiss my girl with this fat lip?''\n\nFrick answers, ``Just go out and find a cheaper one.''\n\nThat's all he needs. Shaftoe puts his head down and charges in on Frick, hollering like a Nip. Before Frick can get his brain in gear, Bobby Shaftoe has him wrapped up in one of those chop-socky holds that Goto Dengo taught him in Shanghai. He works his way up Frick's body to a choke-hold and then clamps down until Sergeant Frick's lips turn the color of the inside of an oyster shell. Then he hangs Frick over the rail, holding him upside-down by the ankles, until Frick recovers enough to shout, ``Uncle!''\n\nA disciplinary proceeding is hastily called. Shaftoe is found guilty of being courteous (by shining Frick's boots) and defending the life of a Marine (himself) from a crazed attacker. The crazed attacker goes straight to the brig. Within a few hours, the noises Frick makes lets all of the Marines know what opium withdrawal feels like.\n\nSo Sergeant Frick does not get to see their entrance into Manila Bay. Shaftoe almost feels sorry for the poor bastard.\n\nThe island of Luzon lies to port all day long, a black hulk barely visible through the haze, with glimpses of palm trees and beaches down below. All of the Marines have been this way before and so they can pick out the Cordillera Central up north, and later the Zambales Mountains, which eventually plunge down to meet the sea near Subic Bay. Subic triggers a barrage of salty anecdotes. The ship does not put in there, but continues to swing southward around Bata'an, turning inland toward the entrance of Manila Bay. The ship reeks of shoe polish, talcum powder, and after-shave lotion; the Fourth Marines may have specialized in whoring and opium abuse, but they've always been known as the best-looking Marines in the Corps.\n\nThey pass by Corregidor. An island shaped like a bead of water on a waxed boot, it is gently rounded in the middle but steeply sloping into the water. It has a long, bony, dry tail that trails off at one end. The Marines know that the island is riddled with tunnels and bristling with terrible guns, but the only sign of these fortifications is the clusters of concrete barracks up in the hills, housing the men who serve the weapons. A tangle of antennas rises up above Topside. Their shapes are familiar to Shaftoe, because many of the same antennas rose above Station Alpha in Shanghai, and he had to take them apart and load them into the truck.\n\nThere is a giant limestone cliff descending nearly into the sea, and at the base of it is the entrance to the tunnel where all the spooks and radio men have their hideaway. Nearby is a dock, quite busy at the moment, with supplies being offloaded from civilian transports and stacked right there on the beach. This detail is noticed by all of the Marines as a positive sign of approaching war. Augusta drops anchor in the cove, and all of that tarp-wrapped radio stuff is unloaded into launches and taken to that dock, along with all of the odd pencil-necked Navy men who tended that gear in Shanghai.\n\nThe swell dies as they pass Corregidor and enter the bay. Greenish-brown algae floats in swirls and curlicues near the surface. Navy ships lay brown ropes of smoke across the still sea. Undisturbed by wind, these unfold into rugged shapes like translucent mountain ranges. They pass the big military base at Cavite--a sheet of land so low and flat that its boundary with the water would be invisible except for the picket line of palm trees. A few hangars and water towers rise from it, and low dark clusters of barracks farther inland. Manila is dead ahead of them, still veiled in haze. It is getting on toward evening.\n\nThen the haze dissolves, the atmosphere suddenly becomes as limpid as a child's eyes, and for about an hour they can see to infinity. They are steaming into an arena of immense thunderheads with lightning corkscrewing down through them all around. Flat grey clouds like shards of broken slate peek out between anvils. Behind them are higher clouds vaulting halfway to the moon, glowing pink and salmon in the light of the setting sun. Behind that, more clouds nestled within banks of humidity like Christmas ornaments wrapped in tissue paper, expanses of blue sky, more thunderheads exchanging bolts of lightning twenty miles long. Skies nested within skies nested within skies.\n\nIt was cold up there in Shanghai, and it's gotten warmer every day since. Some days it's even been hot and muggy. But around the time Manila heaves into view, a warm breeze springs up over the deck and all of the Marines sigh, as if they have all ejaculated in unison.\n\nManila's perfume\n\nFanned by the coconut palms\n\nThe thighs of Glory\n\nManila's spreading tile roofs have a mestizo shape about them, half-Spanish and half-Chinese. The city has a concave seawall with a flat promenade on the top. Strollers turn and wave to the Marines; some of them blow kisses. A wedding party is gushing down the steps of a church and across the boulevard to the seawall, where they are getting their pictures taken in the flattering peach-colored light of the sunset. The men are in their fancy, gauzy Filipino shirts, or in U.S. military uniforms. The women are in spectacular gowns and dresses. The Marines holler and whistle at them and the women turn towards them, hitching up their skirts slightly so that they won't trip, and wave enthusiastically. The Marines get woozy and practically fall overboard.\n\nAs their ship is easing into its dock, a crescent-shaped formation of flying fish erupts from the water. It moves away like a dune being blown across the desert. The fish are silver and leaf-shaped. Each one strikes the water with a metallic click, and the clicks merge into a crisp ripping noise. The crescent glides beneath a pier, flowing around its pilings, and disappears in the shadows underneath.\n\nManila, the Pearl of the Orient, early on a Sunday evening, the 7th of December, 1941. In Hawaii, on the other side of the Date Line, it is only just past midnight. Bobby Shaftoe and his comrades have a few hours of freedom. The city is modern, prosperous, English-speaking, and Christian, by far the wealthiest and most advanced city in Asia, practically like being back home in the States. For all its Catholicity, it has areas that seem to have been designed, from the foundation-stones upwards, to the specifications of horny sailors. You get to those parts of town by turning right once your feet are on dry land.\n\nBobby Shaftoe turns left, politely excuses himself past a legion of excited prostitutes, and sets his course on the looming walls of Intramuros. He stops only to buy a sheaf of roses from a vendor in the park, who is doing land-office business. The park and the walls above it are crowded with strolling lovers, the men mostly in uniforms and the women in demure but stunning dresses, twirling parasols on their shoulders.\n\nA couple of fellows driving horse-drawn taxis want to do business with Bobby Shaftoe but he turns them down. A taxi will only get him there faster, and he is too nervous to get there fast. He walks through a gate in the wall and into the old Spanish city.\n\nIntramuros is a maze of buff-colored stone walls rising abruptly from narrow streets. The first-floor windows along the sidewalks are guarded by black ironwork cages. The bars swell, swirl, and sprout finedly hammered leaves. The second stories hang out overhead, sporting gas lights that are just now being lit by servants with long, smoking poles. The sound of laughter and music drifts out of the windows above, and when he passes by the archways that open into the inner courtyards, he can smell flowers back in the gardens.\n\nDamned if he can tell these places apart. He remembers the street name of Magallanes, because Glory told him once it was the same thing as ``Magellan.'' And he remembers the view of the cathedral from the Pascuals' window. He wanders around a block a couple of times, certain that he is close. Then he hears an exaltation of girlish laughter coming from a second-story window, and moves toward it like a jellyfish sucked into an intake pipe. It all comes together. This is the place. The girls are all gossiping, in English, about one of their instructors. He does not hear Glory's voice but he thinks he hears her laughter.\n\n``Glory!'' he says. Then he says it louder. If they hear him, they pay him no mind. Finally he winds up and flings the bouquet of roses like a potato-masher grenade over the wooden railing, through a narrow gap between the mother-of-pearl shutters, and into the room.\n\nMiraculous silence from within the room, and then gales of laughter. The nacre shutters part with slow, agonizing coyness. A girl of nineteen steps out onto the balcony. She is dressed in the uniform of a nursing student. It is as white as starlight shining on the North Pole. She has let her long black hair down to brush it, and it stirs languidly in the evening breeze. The last ruddy light of the sunset makes her face glow like a coal. She hides behind the bouquet for a moment, buries her nose in it, inhales deeply, peeking out at him over the blossoms with her black eyes. Then she lowers the bouquet gradually to reveal her high cheeks, her perfect little nose, the fantastic sculpture of her lips, and teeth, white but fetchingly crooked, barely visible. She is smiling.\n\n``Jesus H. Christ,'' Bobby Shaftoe says, ``your cheekbones are like a fucking snowplow.''\n\nShe puts her finger to her lips. The gesture of anything touching Glory's lips puts an invisible spear through Shaftoe's chest. She eyes him for a while, establishing, in her own mind, that she has the boy's attention and that he is not going anywhere. Then she turns her back on him. The light grazes her buttocks, showing nothing but suggesting cleavage. She goes back inside and the shutter glides shut behind her.\n\nSuddenly the room full of girls becomes quiet, except for occasional ripples of suppressed laughter. Shaftoe bites his tongue. They are screwing it all up. Mr. or Mrs. Pascual will notice their silence and become suspicious.\n\nIronwork clangs and a big gate swings open. The porter beckons him inside. Shaftoe follows the old fellow down the black, arched tunnel of the porte-cochere. The hard soles of his shiny black shoes skid on the cobblestones. A horse back in the stable whinnies at the smell of his aftershave. Sleepy American music, slow-dance stuff from the Armed Forces station, spills tinnily from a radio in the porter's nook.\n\nFlowering vines grow up the stone walls of the courtyard. It is a tidy, quiet, enclosed world, almost like being indoors. The porter waves him in the direction of one of the stairways that lead up to the second floor. Glory calls it the entresuelo and says that it's really a floor between the floors, but it looks like a full-fledged, regular floor to Bobby Shaftoe. He mounts the steps and looks up to see Mr. Pascual standing there, a tiny bald man with glasses and a trim little mustache. He is wearing a short-sleeved shirt, American style, and khaki trousers, and slippers, and is holding a glass of San Miguel in one hand and a cigarette in the other. ``Private Shaftoe! Welcome back,'' he says.\n\nSo. Glory has decided to play this one by the book. The Pascuals have been alerted. A few hours of socializing now stand between Bobby Shaftoe and his girl. But a Marine is never fazed by such setbacks.\n\n``Begging your pardon, Mr. Pascual, but I am a corporal now.''\n\nMr. Pascual puts his cigarette in his mouth and shakes Corporal Shaftoe's hand. ``Well, congratulations! I just saw your uncle Jack last week. I don't think he had any idea you were on your way back.''\n\n``It was a surprise to everyone, sir,'' Bobby Shaftoe says.\n\nNow they are on a raised walkway that runs around the courtyard. Only livestock and servants live at ground level. Mr. Pascual leads them around to a door that takes them into the entresuelo. The walls here are rough stone, the ceilings are simple painted planks. They pass through a dark, somber office where Mr. Pascual's father and grandfather used to receive the managers of the family's haciendas and plantations. For a moment, Bobby Shaftoe gets his hopes up. This level has a few rooms that back in the old days were apartments for high-ranking servants, bachelor uncles, and spinster aunts. Now that the hacienda business ain't what it used to be, the Pascuals are renting them out to female students. Perhaps Mr. Pascual is leading him directly to Glory.\n\nBut this goes the way of all foolish, horny illusions as Shaftoe finds himself at the foot of a vast staircase of polished nara wood. He can see pressed-tin ceiling up there, chandeliers, and the imposing superstructure of Mrs. Pascual, contained within a mighty bodice that looks like something dreamed up by naval engineers. They ascend the stairs into the antesala, which according to Glory is strictly for casual, drop-in visitors but is fancier than any room Bobby Shaftoe has ever seen. There are big vases and pots all over the place, supposedly old, and supposedly from Japan and China. A fresh breeze runs through; he looks out a window and sees, neatly framed in it, the green dome of the cathedral with its Celtic cross on top, just as he remembered it. Mrs. Pascual holds out her hand and Shaftoe clasps it. ``Mrs. Pascual,'' he says, ``thank you for welcoming me into your home.''\n\n``Please sit down,'' she says, ``we want to hear everything.''\n\nShaftoe sits in a fancy chair next to the piano, adjust his trousers a bit so that they will not cramp his erect penis, checks his shave. It probably has a few good hours left. A wing of airplanes drones overhead. Mrs. Pascual is giving instructions to the maid in Tagalog. Shaftoe examines the crusted lacerations on his knuckles and wonders whether Mrs. Pascual has the slightest idea of what she would be in for if he really told her everything. Perhaps a little anecdote about hand-to-hand combat with Chinese river pirates on the banks of the Yangtze would break the ice. Through a door and down the hall, he can see a corner of the family chapel, all Gothic arches, a gilded altar, and in front of it an embroidered kneeler worn threadbare by the patellas of Mrs. Pascual.\n\nCigarettes are brought round, stacked in a large lacquer box like artillery shells in a crate. They drink tea and exchange small talk for what seems like about thirty-six hours. Mrs. Pascual wants to be reassured, over and over again, that everything is fine and that there will not be a war. Mr. Pascual obviously believes that war is just around the corner, and mostly broods. Business has been good lately. He and Jack Shaftoe, Bobby's uncle, have been shipping a lot of stuff between here and Singapore. But business will get a lot worse soon, he thinks.\n\nGlory appears. She has changed out of her student's uniform and into a dress. Bobby Shaftoe nearly topples backward out of the window. Mrs. Pascual formally reintroduces them. Bobby Shaftoe kisses Glory's hand in what he thinks is more than likely a very gallant gesture. He's glad he did, because Glory is palming a tiny wadded-up note which ends up in his hand.\n\nGlory takes a seat and is duly issued her own teacup. Another eternity of small talk. Mr. Pascual asks him for the eighty-seventh time whether he has touched base with Uncle Jack yet, and Shaftoe reiterates that he literally just stepped off the boat and will certainly see Uncle Jack tomorrow morning. He excuses himself to the bathroom, which is an old-fashioned two-holer mounted above deep shafts that must descend all the way to hell. He unwads and reads Glory's note, memorizes the instructions, tears it up and sprinkles it down the hole.\n\nMrs. Pascual allows the two young lovers a full half hour of ``private'' time together, meaning that the Pascuals leave the room and only come back every five minutes or so to check up on them. There is a painfully elaborate and lengthy good-bye ceremony which ends in Shaftoe returning to the street and Glory waving to him from her balcony.\n\nHalf an hour later, they are doing tongue judo in the back of a horse-drawn taxi galloping over the cobblestones toward the nightclubs of Malate. The extraction of Glory from the Pascual residence was a simple matter for a highly motivated China Marine and a squadron of saucy nursing students.\n\nBut Glory must be kissing him with her eyes open because all of a sudden she wriggles loose and says to the taxi driver, ``Stop! Please stop, sir!''\n\n``What is it?'' Shaftoe says blurrily. He looks around and sees nothing but a great big old stone church looming up above them. This brings a preliminary stab of fear. But the church is dark, there's no Filipinas in long dresses, no Marines in dress uniforms, it can't be his wedding.\n\n``I want to show you something,'' Glory says, and clambers down out of the taxi. Shaftoe has to pursue her into the place--the Church of San Augustin. He's gone by this pile many times but he never reckoned he would come inside--on a date.\n\nShe stands at the bottom of a huge staircase and says, ``See?''\n\nShaftoe looks up into darkness, thinks there might be a stained-glass window or two up there, maybe a Laceration of Christ or an Impalement of the Blessed Thorax, but--\n\n``Look down,'' Glory says, and taps one miniature foot against the first tread of the staircase. It is a single great big huge slab of granite.\n\n``Looks like ten or twenty tons of rock there I'd estimate,'' he says authoritatively.\n\n``It came from Mexico.''\n\n``Ah, go on!''\n\nGlory smiles at him. ``Carry me up the stairs.'' And in case Shaftoe's thinking of refusing, she sort of falls into him, and he has no choice but to catch her up in his arms. She traps his nape in the crook of her arm, the better to pull her face close to his, but what he remembers is how the silk of her sleeve feels against the freshly shaved skin of his neck. He begins the ascent. Glory doesn't weigh much, but after four steps he has broken a fine sweat. She is watching him, from four inches away, for signs of fatigue, and he feels himself blushing. Good thing that the whole staircase is lit up by about two candles. There's a lovely bust of a thorn-crowned Jesus with long parallel blood-drops running down his face, and on the right--\n\n``These giant stones you are walking on were quarried in Mexico, centuries and centuries ago, before America was even a country. They were brought over in the bottoms of the Manila Galleons, as ballast.'' She pronounces it bayast.\n\n``I'll be damned.''\n\n``When those galleons arrived, the stones were brought out of their bellies, one by one, and taken here to the Church of San Agustin, and piled up. Each stone on top of the last year's stone. Until finally after many, many years this staircase was finished.''\n\nAfter a while it seems to Shaftoe as though it's going to take at least that many years to reach the top of the damn thing. The summit is adorned with a life-sized Jesus carrying a cross that appears to be at least as heavy as one of those stair-treads. So who's he to complain? Then Glory says, ``Now carry me down, so you will remember the story.''\n\n``You think I'm some horny jarhead who won't remember a story unless it's got a pretty girl in it?''\n\n``Yes,'' Glory says, and laughs in his face. He carries her down to the bottom again. Then, before she goes off on some other tangent, he carries her straight out the door and into the taxi.\n\nBobby Shaftoe is not one to lose his cool in the heat of action, but the rest of the evening is a blurry fever dream to him. Only a few impressions penetrate the haze: alighting from the taxi in front of a waterfront hotel; all of the other boys gaping at Glory; Bobby Shaftoe glaring at them, threatening to teach them some manners. Slow dancing with Glory in the ballroom, Glory's silk-clad thigh gradually slipping between his legs, her firm body pressing harder and harder against his. Strolling along the seawall, hand in hand beneath the starlight. Noticing that the tide is out. Exchanging a look. Carrying her down from the seawall to the thin strip of rocky beach beneath it.\n\nBy the time he is actually fucking her, he has more or less lost consciousness, he is off in some fantastic, libidinal dream. He and Glory fuck without the slightest hesitation, without any doubts, without any troublesome thinking whatsoever. Their bodies have spontaneously merged, like a pair of drops running together on a windowpane. If he is thinking anything at all, it is that his entire life has culminated in this moment. His upbringing in Oconomowoc, high school prom night, deer hunting in the Upper Peninsula, Parris Island boot camp, all of the brawls and struggles in China, his duel with Sergeant Frick, they are wood behind the point of a spear.\n\nSirens are blowing somewhere. He startles back to awareness. Has he been here all night long, holding Glory up against the seawall, her thighs wrapped around his waist? That would not be possible. The tide hasn't come in at all.\n\n``What is it?'' she says. Her hands are clasped around the back of his neck. She lets go and runs them down his chest.\n\nStill holding her up, his hands making a sling under her warm and flawless ass, Shaftoe backs away from the seawall and turns around on the beach, looking at the sky. He sees searchlights beginning to come on. And it ain't no Hollywood premiere.\n\n``It's war, baby,'' he says.\n\n\n\nFORAYS\n\nThe lobby of the manila hotel is about the size of a football field. It smells like last year's perfume, rare tropical orchids, and bug spray. There is a metal detector set up at the front door, because the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe happens to be staying here for a couple of days. Big Africans in good suits stand around the place in clusters of two and three. Mini-throngs of Nipponese tourists, in their Bermuda shorts, sandals and white socks, have lodged themselves in the deep, thick, wide sofas and sit quietly, waiting for a prearranged signal. Upper-class Filipino children brandish cylindrical potato chip canisters like tribal chieftains carrying ceremonial maces. A dignified old bellman carrying a hand-pumped tank circulates around the defensive perimeter and silently sprays insecticide against the baseboard. Enter Randall Lawrence Waterhouse, in a turquoise polo shirt embroidered with the logo of one of the bankrupt high-tech companies that he and Avi have founded, and relaxed-fit blue jeans held up with suspenders, and bulky athletic shoes that once were white.\n\nAs soon as he got through the formalities at the airport, he perceived that the Philippines are, like Mexico, one of those countries where Shoes Matter. He approaches the registration counter quickly so that the ravishing young woman in the navy-blue uniform will not see his feet. A couple of bellhops are engaged in a pathetic, Sisyphean contest with his bag, which has roughly the dimensions and mass of a two-drawer filing cabinet. ``You will not be able to find technical books there,'' Avi told him, ``bring anything you might conceivably need.''\n\nRandy's suite is a bedroom and living room, both with fourteen-foot ceilings, and a corridor along one side containing several closets and various plumbing-related technologies. The entire thing is lined in some kind of tropical hardwood stained to a lovely glowing auburn, which would be dismal in the northern latitudes but, here, gives it a cozy and cool feeling. The two main rooms each have huge windows with tiny signs by the latch handles warning of tropical insects. Each room is defended from its windows by a multilayered system of interlocking barriers: incredibly massive wooden shutters that rumble back and forth on tracks, like freight trains maneuvering in a switching yard; a second layer of shutters consisting of two-inch squares of nacre held in a polished wooden grid, sliding on its own set of tracks; window sheers, and finally, heavy-gauge blackout curtains, each suspended from its own set of clanging industrial rails.\n\nHe orders up a large pot of coffee, which barely keeps him awake long enough to unpack. It is late afternoon. Purple clouds tumble out of the surrounding mountains with the palpable momentum of volcanic mudflows and turn half of the sky into a blank wall striped with vertical bolts of lightning; the walls of the hotel room flash with it as though paparazzi are working outside the window. Below, food vendors in Rizal Park run up and down the sidewalks to get out of the rain, which falls, as it has been doing for about half a millennium, on the sloping black walls of Intramuros. If those walls did not run in straight lines they could be mistaken for a natural freak of geology: ridges of bare, dark volcanic rock erupting from the grass like teeth from gums. The walls have dovetail-shaped notches that converge to old gun emplacements, providing interlocking fields of fire across a dry moat.\n\nLiving in the States, you never see anything older than about two and a half centuries, and you have to visit the eastern fringe of the country to see that. The business traveler's world of airports and taxicabs looks the same everywhere. Randy never really believes he's in a different country until he sees something like Intramuros, and then he has to stand there like an idiot for a long time, ruminating.\n\nRight now, across the Pacific Ocean, in a small, tasteful Victorian town located a third of the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles, computers are seizing up, crucial files are disappearing, and e-mail is careening into intergalactic space, because Randy Waterhouse is not there to keep an eye on things. The town in question sports three small colleges: one founded by the State of California and two founded by Protestant denominations that are now actively reviled by the majority of their faculty. Taken together these colleges--the Three Siblings--comprise an academic center of middling importance. Their computer systems are linked into one. They exchange teachers and students. From time to time they host academic conferences. This part of California has beaches, mountains, redwood forests, vineyards, golf courses, and sprawling penal facilities all over the place. There are plenty of three- and four-star hotel rooms, and the Three Siblings, taken together, have enough auditoria and meeting rooms to host a conference of several thousand.\n\nAvi's telephone call, some eighty hours ago, arrived in the middle of a major interdisciplinary conference called ``The Intermediate Phase (1939\u203a45) of the Global Hegemony Struggle of the Twentieth Century (Common Era).'' This is a bit of a mouthful and so it has been given a pithy nickname: ``War as Text.''\n\nPeople are coming from places like Amsterdam and Milan. The conference's organizing committee--which includes Randy's girlfriend, Charlene, who actually gives every indication of being his ex-girlfriend now--hired an artist in San Francisco to come up with a poster. He started with a black-and-white halftone photo of a haggard World War Two infantryman with a cigarette dangling from his lower lip. He worked this image over using a photocopier, blowing the halftone dots up into rough lumps, like rubber balls chewed by a dog, and wreaking any number of other distortions on it until it had an amazingly stark, striking, jagged appearance; the soldier's pale eyes turned an eerie white. Then he added a few elements in color: red lipstick, blue eyeshadow, and a trace of a red brassiere strap peeking out from the soldier's unbuttoned uniform shirt.\n\nThe poster won some kind of an award almost the moment it came out. This led to a press release, which in turn led to the poster's being enshrined by the news media as an Official Object of Controversy. An enterprising journalist managed to track down the soldier depicted in the original photograph--a decorated combat veteran and retired tool-and-die maker who, as it happened, was not merely alive but in excellent health, and, since the death of his wife from breast cancer, had spent his retirement roaming around the Deep South in his pickup truck, helping to rebuild black churches that had been torched by drunken yahoos.\n\nThe artist who had designed the poster then confessed that he had simply copied it from a book and had made no effort whatsoever to obtain permission--the entire concept of getting permission to use other people's work was faulty, since all art was derivative of other art. High-powered trial lawyers converged, like dive bombers, on the small town in Kentucky where the aggrieved veteran was up on the roof of a black church with a mouthful of nails, hammering down slabs of A/D exterior plywood and mumbling ``no comment'' to a horde of reporters down on the lawn. After a series of conferences in a room at the town's Holiday Inn, the veteran emerged, accompanied by one of the five most famous lawyers on the face of the planet, and announced that he was filing a civil suit against the Three Siblings that would, if it succeeded, turn them and their entire community into a flat, smoking abrasion in the earth's crust. He promised to split the proceeds between the black churches and various disabled veterans' and breast cancer research groups.\n\nThe organizing committee pulled the poster from circulation, which caused thousands of bootleg copies to go up on the World Wide Web and, in general, brought it to the attention of millions who never would have seen it otherwise. They also filed suit against the artist, whose net worth could be tallied up on the back of a ticket stub: he had assets of about a thousand dollars and debts (mostly student loans) amounting to sixty-five thousand.\n\nAll of this happened before the conference even began. Randy was aware of it only because Charlene had roped him into providing computer support for the conference, which meant setting up a Web site and e-mail access for the attendees. When all of this hit the news, e-mail began to flood in, and quickly jammed up all of the lines and filled up all of the disk capacity that Randy had spent the last month setting up.\n\nConferees began to arrive. A lot of them seemed to be sleeping in the house where Randy and Charlene had been living together for seven years. It was a big old Victorian house and there was plenty of room. They stumbled in from Heidelberg and Paris and Berkeley and Boston, then sat around Randy and Charlene's kitchen table drinking coffee and talking at great length about the Spectacle. Randy inferred that the Spectacle meant the poster furor, but as they went on and on about it, he sensed that they were using the word not in a conventional sense but as part of some academic jargon; that it carried a heavy load of shadings and connotations to them, none of which Randy would ever understand unless he became one of them.\n\nTo Charlene, and to all of the people attending War as Text, it was self-evident that the veteran who filed the lawsuit was the very worst kind of human being--just the sort they had gathered together to debunk, burn in effigy, and sweep into the ash-bin of posthistorical discourse. Randy had spent a lot of time around these people, and thought he'd gotten used to them, but during those days he had a headache all the time, from clenching his teeth, and he kept jumping to his feet in the middle of meals or conversations and going out for solitary walks. This was partly to keep himself from saying something undiplomatic, and partly as a childish but fruitless tactic to get the attention he craved from Charlene.\n\nHe knew the whole poster saga was going to be a disaster from early on. He kept warning Charlene and the others. They listened coolly, clinically, as if Randy were a test subject on the wrong side of a one-way mirror.\n\n\n\nRandy forces himself to stay awake long enough for it to get dark. Then he lies in bed for a few hours trying to sleep. The container port is just north of the hotel, and all night long, Rizal Boulevard, along the base of the old Spanish wall, is jammed from one end to the other with container-carrying semis. The whole city is a cauldron of internal combustion. Manila seems to have more pistons and exhaust pipes than the rest of the world combined. Even at two in the morning the hotel's seemingly unshakable mass hums and rattles from the seismic energy pouring from all of those motors. The noise detonates car alarms down in the hotel's lot. The noise of one alarm triggers others, and so on. It is not the noise that keeps Randy awake so much as the insane stupidity of this chain reaction. It is an object lesson: the kind of nightmarish, snowballing technological fuck-up that keeps hackers awake at night even when they can't hear the results.\n\nHe paws open a Heineken from his minibar and stands in front of the window, looking. Many of the trucks are adorned with brilliant displays of multicolored lights--not quite as flashy as those of the few jeepneys that scurry and jostle among them. Seeing so many people awake and working puts sleep out of the question.\n\nHe is too jet-lagged to accomplish anything that requires actual thought--but there is one important job he can do, which requires no thinking whatsoever. He starts up his laptop again. Seeming to levitate in the center of his dark room, the screen is a perfect rectangle of light the color of diluted milk, of a Nordic dawn. This light originates in small fluorescent tubes imprisoned in the polycarbonate coffin of his computer's display. It can only escape through a pane of glass, facing Randy, which is entirely covered by small transistors arranged in a grid, which let photons through, or don't, or let through only those of a particular wavelength, cracking the pale light into colors. By turning those transistors on and off according to some systematic plan, meaning is conveyed to Randy Waterhouse. A good filmmaker could convey a whole story to Randy by seizing control of those transistors for a couple of hours.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a lot more laptop computers floating around than there are filmmakers worth paying attention to. The transistors are almost never put into the hands of human beings. They are controlled, instead, by software. Randy used to be fascinated by software, but now he isn't. It's hard enough to find human beings who are interesting.\n\nThe pyramid and the eyeball appear. Randy spends so much time using Ordo now that he has his machine boot it up automatically.\n\nNowadays the laptop has only one function for Randy: he uses it to communicate with other people, through e-mail. When he communicates with Avi, he has to use Ordo, which is a tool for taking his ideas and converting them into streams of bits that are almost indistinguishable from white noise, so that they can be sent to Avi in privacy. In exchange, it receives noise from Avi and converts it into Avi's thoughts. At the moment, Epiphyte has no assets other than information--it is an idea, with some facts and data to back it up. This makes it eminently stealable. So encryption is definitely a good idea. The question is: how much paranoia is really appropriate?\n\nAvi sent him encrypted e-mail:\n\nWhen you get to Manila I would like you to generate a 4096-bit key pair and keep it on a floppy disk that you carry on your person at all times. Do not keep it on your hard disk. Anyone could break into your hotel room while you're out and steal that key.\n\nNow, Randy pulls down a menu and picks an item labeled: ``New key. . . . ''\n\nA box pops up giving him several KEY LENGTH options: 768 bits, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, or Custom. Randy picks the latter option and then, wearily, types in 4096.\n\nEven a 768-bit key requires vast resources to break. Add one bit, to make it 769 bits long, and it becomes twice as difficult. A 770-bit key is twice as difficult yet, and so on. By using 768-bit keys, Randy and Avi could keep their communications secret from nearly every entity in the world for at least the next several years. A 1024-bit key would be vastly, astronomically more difficult to break.\n\nSome people go so far as to use keys 2048 or even 3072 bits in length. These will stop the very best codebreakers on the face of the earth for astronomical periods of time, barring the invention of otherworldly technologies such as quantum computers. Most encryption software--even stuff written by extremely security-conscious cryptography experts--can't even handle keys larger than that. But Avi insists on using Ordo, generally considered the best encryption software in the world, because it can handle keys of unlimited length--as long as you don't mind waiting for it to crunch all the numbers.\n\nRandy begins typing. He is not bothering to look at the screen; he is staring out the window at the lights on the trucks and the jeepneys. He is only using one hand, just flailing away loosely at the keyboard.\n\nInside Randy's computer is a precise clock. Whenever he strikes a key, Ordo uses that clock to record the current time, down to microseconds. He hits a key at 03:05:56.935788 and he hits another one at 03:05:57.290664, or about .354876 seconds later. Another .372307 seconds later, he hits another one. Ordo keeps track of all of these intervals and discards the more significant digits (in this example the .35 and the .37) because these parts will tend to be similar from one event to the next.\n\nOrdo wants randomness. It only wants the least significant digits--say, the 76 and the 07 at the very ends of these numbers. It wants a whole lot of random numbers, and it wants them to be very, very random. It is taking somewhat random numbers and feeding them through hash functions that make them even more random. It is running statistical routines on the results to make sure that they contain no hidden patterns. It has breathtakingly high standards for randomness, and it will not stop asking Randy to whack on the keyboard until those standards are met.\n\nThe longer the key you are trying to generate, the longer this takes. Randy is trying to generate one that is ridiculously long. He has pointed out to Avi, in an encrypted e-mail message, that if every particle of matter in the universe could be used to construct one single cosmic supercomputer, and this computer was put to work trying to break a 4096-bit encryption key, it would take longer than the lifespan of the universe.\n\n``Using today's technology,'' Avi shot back, ``that is true. But what about quantum computers? And what if new mathematical techniques are developed that can simplify the factoring of large prime numbers?''\n\n``How long do you want these messages to remain secret?'' Randy asked, in his last message before leaving San Francisco. ``Five years? Ten years? Twenty-five years?''\n\nAfter he got to the hotel this afternoon, Randy decrypted and read Avi's answer. It is still hanging in front of his eyes, like the afterimage of a strobe:\n\nI want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.\n\nThe computer finally beeps. Randy rests his tired hand. Ordo politely warns him that it may be busy for a while, and then goes to work. It is searching the cosmos of pure numbers, looking for two big primes that can be multiplied by each other to produce a number 4096 bits long.\n\nIf you want your secrets to remain secret past the end of your life expectancy, then, in order to choose a key length, you have to be a futurist. You have to anticipate how much faster computers will get during this time. You must also be a student of politics. Because if the entire world were to become a police state obsessed with recovering old secrets, then vast resources might be thrown at the problem of factoring large prime numbers.\n\nSo the length of the key that you use is, in and of itself, a code of sorts. A knowledgeable government eavesdropper, noting Randy's and Avi's use of a 4096-bit key, will conclude one of the following:\n\n--Avi doesn't know what he's talking about. This can be ruled out with a bit of research into his past accomplishments. Or,\n\n--Avi is clinically paranoid. This can also be ruled out with some research. Or,\n\n--Avi is extremely optimistic about the future development of computer technology, or pessimistic about the political climate, or both. Or,\n\n--Avi has a planning horizon that extends over a period of at least a century.\n\nRandy paces around his room while his computer soars through number space. The shipping containers on the backs of those trucks bear exactly the same logos as the ones that used to fill the streets of South Seattle when a ship was unloading. To Randy this is oddly satisfying, as if, by making this crazy lunge across the Pacific, he has brought some kind of antipodal symmetry to his life. He has gone from the place where things are consumed to where they are produced, from a land where onanism has been enshrined at the highest levels of the society to one where cars have ``NO to contraception!'' stickers in their windows. It feels bizarrely right. He has not felt this way since Avi and he founded their first doomed business venture twelve years ago.\n\n\n\nRandy grew up in a college town in eastern Washington State, graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, and landed a Clerk Typist II job at the library there--specifically the Interlibrary Loan Department--where his job was to process incoming loan requests mailed in from smaller libraries all over the region and, conversely, to mail out requests to other libraries. If nine-year-old Randy Waterhouse had been able to look into the future and see himself in this career, he would have been delighted beyond measure: the primary tool of the Interlibrary Loan Department was the Staple Remover. Young Randy had seen one of these devices in the hands of his fourth-grade teacher and been enthralled by its cunning and deadly appearance, so like the jaws of some futuristic robot dragon. He had, in fact, gone out of his way to staple things incorrectly just so he could prevail on his teacher to unstaple them, giving him another glimpse of the blood-chilling mandibles in action. He had gone so far as to steal a staple remover from an untended desk at church and then incorporate it into an Erector-set robot hunter-killer device with which he terrorized much of the neighborhood; its pit-viper yawn separated many a cheap plastic toy from its parts and accessories before the theft was discovered and Randy made an example of before God and man. Now, in the Interlibrary Loan office, Randy had not just one but several staple removers in his desk drawer and was actually obligated to use them for an hour or two a day.\n\nSince the UW library was well-endowed, its patrons didn't request books from other libraries unless they had been stolen from their own or were, in some way, peculiar. The ILL office (as Randy and his coworkers affectionately called it) had its regulars--people who had a whole lot of peculiar books on their wish lists. These people tended to be either tedious or scary or both. Randy always ended up dealing with the ``both'' subgroup, because Randy was the only Clerk Typist in the office who was not a lifer. It seemed clear that Randy, with his astronomy degree and his extensive knowledge of computers, would one day move on, whereas his coworkers did not harbor further ambitions. His larger sphere of interests, his somewhat broader concept of normalcy, was useful when certain patrons came into the office.\n\nBy the standards of many, Randy was himself a tedious, scary, obsessed character. He was not merely obsessed with science but also with fantasy role-playing games. The only way he could tolerate working at such a stupid job for a couple of years was that his off time was completely occupied with enacting fantasy scenarios of a depth and complexity that exercised all of the cranial circuitry that was so conspicuously going to waste in the ILL office. He was part of a group that would meet every Friday night and play until sometime on Sunday. The other stalwarts in the group were a computer science/music double major named Chester, and a history grad student named Avi.\n\nWhen a new master's degree candidate named Andrew Loeb walked into the ILL office one day, with a certain glint in his eye, and produced a three-inch-thick stack of precisely typed request forms from his shitty old knapsack, he was recognized immediately as being of a particular type, and shunted in the direction of Randy Waterhouse. It was an instant meeting of minds, though Randy did not fully realize this until the books that Loeb had requested began to arrive on the trolley from the mail room.\n\nAndy Loeb's project was to figure out the energy budgets of the local Indian tribes. A human body has to expend a certain amount of energy just to keep breathing and to maintain its body temperature. This figure goes up when it gets cold or when the body in question is doing work. The only way to obtain that energy is by eating food. Some foods have a higher energy content than others. For example, trout is highly nutritious but so low in fat and carbohydrates that you can starve to death eating it three times a day. Other foods might have lots of energy, but might require so much work to obtain and prepare that eating them would be a losing proposition, BTU-wise. Andy Loeb was trying to figure out what foods had historically been eaten by certain Northwest Indian tribes, how much energy they expended to get these foods and how much they obtained by eating them. He wanted to do this calculation for coastal Indians like the Salish (who had easy access to seafood) and for inland ones like the Cayuse (who didn't) as part of an extremely convoluted plan to prove some sort of point about the relative standards of living of these tribes and how this affected their cultural development (coastal tribes made lots of fantastically detailed art and inland ones occasionally scratched stick figures on rocks).\n\nTo Andrew Loeb it was an exercise in meta-historical scholarship. To Randy Waterhouse, it sounded like the beginnings of a pretty cool game. Strangle a muskrat and you get 136 Energy Points. Lose the muskrat and your core temp drops another degree.\n\nAndy was nothing if not methodical and so he had simply looked up every book that had ever been written on such topics, and every book mentioned in those books' bibliographies, yea, even unto four or five generations; checked out all of them that were available locally; and ordered the rest from ILL. All of the latter passed across Randy's desk. Randy read some and skimmed all. He got to learn about how much blubber the Arctic explorers had to eat in order to keep from starving to death. He perused detailed specifications for Army C-rations. After a while, he actually began sneaking into the photocopy room and making copies of key data.\n\nIn order to run a realistic fantasy role-playing game, you had to keep track of how much food the imaginary characters were getting and how much trouble was involved in getting it. Characters passing across the Gobi desert in November of the year 5000 B.C. would have to spend more time worrying about food than, say, ones who were traveling across central Illinois in 1950.\n\nRandy was hardly the first game designer to notice this. There were a few incredibly stupid games in which you didn't have to think about food, but Randy and his friends disdained them. In all of the games that he participated in, or that he himself designed, you had to devote a realistic amount of effort to getting food for your character. But it was not easy to determine what was realistic. Like most designers, Randy got over the problem by slapping together a few rudimentary equations that he basically just pulled out of thin air. But in the books, articles, and dissertations that Andrew Loeb was borrowing through ILL, he found exactly the raw data that a mathematically inclined person would need to come up with a sophisticated rules system based on scientific fact.\n\nStimulating all of the physical processes going on in each character's body was out of the question, especially in a game where you might be dealing with armies of a hundred thousand men. Even a crude simulation, tracking only a few variables and using simple equations, would involve a nightmarish amount of paperwork if you did it all by hand. But all of this was happening in the mid-1980s, when personal computers had become cheap and ubiquitous. A computer could automatically track a large database and tell you whether each character was well-fed or starving. There was no reason not to do it on a computer.\n\nUnless, like Randy Waterhouse, you had such a shitty job that you couldn't afford a computer.\n\nOf course, there's a way to dodge any problem. The university had lots of computers. If Randy could get an account on one of them, he could write his program there and run it for free.\n\nUnfortunately, accounts were only available to students or faculty members, and Randy was neither.\n\nFortunately, he started dating a grad student named Charlene at just about this time.\n\nHow the hell did a generally keg-shaped guy, a hard scientist, working a dead-end Clerk Typist job, and spending all his spare time in the consummately nerdy pastime of fantasy role-playing games, end up in a relationship with a slender and not unattractive young liberal arts student who spent her spare time sea kayaking and going to foreign films? It must have been one of those opposites-attract kind of deals, a complementary relationship. They met, naturally, in the ILL office, where the highly intelligent but steady and soothing Randy helped the highly intelligent but scattered and flighty Charlene organize a messy heap of loan requests. He should have asked her out then and there, but he was shy. Second and third opportunities came along when the books she'd requested began to filter up from the mailroom, and finally he asked her out and they went to see a film together. Both of them turned out to be not just willing but eager, and possibly even desperate. Before they knew it, Randy had given Charlene a key to his apartment, and Charlene had given Randy the password to her free university computer account, and everything was just delightful.\n\nThe university computer system was better than no computer at all. But Randy was humiliated. Like every other high-powered academic computing network, this one was based on an industrial-strength operating system called UNIX, which had a learning curve like the Matterhorn, and lacked the cuddly and stylish features of the personal computers then coming into vogue. Randy had used it quite a bit as an undergraduate and knew his way around. Even so, learning how to write good code on the thing required a lot of time. His life had changed when Charlene had come along, and now it changed more: he dropped out of the fantasy role-playing game circuit altogether, stopped going to meetings of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and began to spend all of his free time either with Charlene or in front of a computer terminal. All in all, this was probably a change for the better. With Charlene, he did things he wouldn't have done otherwise, like getting exercise, or going to see live music. And at the computer, he was learning new skills, and he was creating something. It might be something completely useless, but at least he was creating.\n\nHe spent a lot of time talking to Andrew Loeb, who actually went out and did the stuff he was writing programs for; he'd disappear for a few days and come back all wobbly and haggard, with fish scales caught in his whiskers or dried animal blood under his fingernails. He'd ram down a couple of Big Macs, sleep for twenty-four hours, then meet Randy in a bar (Charlene wasn't comfortable with having him in the house) and talk learnedly of the difficulties of day-to-day life, aboriginal style. They argued about whether aborigines would eat the more disgusting parts of certain animals or throw them away. Andrew voted for yes. Randy disagreed--just because they were primitive didn't mean they couldn't have taste. Andrew accused him of being a romantic. Finally, to settle it, they went up into the mountains together, armed with nothing but knives and Andrew's collection of exquisitely crafted vermin snares. By the third night, Randy found himself seriously thinking about eating some insects. ``Q.E.D.,'' Andrew said.\n\nAnyway, Randy finished his software after a year and a half. It was a success; Chester and Avi liked it. Randy was moderately pleased at having built something so complicated that actually worked, but he had no illusions about its being good for anything. He was sort of embarrassed at having wasted so much time and mental energy on the project. But he knew that if he hadn't been writing code, he'd have spent the same amount of time playing games or going to Society for Creative Anachronism meetings in medieval drag, so it all zeroed out in the end. Spending the time in front of the computer was arguably better, because it had honed his programming skills, which had been pretty sharp to begin with. On the other hand, he'd done it all on the UNIX system, which was for scientists and engineers--not a savvy move in an age when all the money was in personal computers.\n\nChester and Randy had nicknamed Avi ``Avid,'' because he really, really liked fantasy games. Avi had always claimed that he played them as a way of understanding what it was really like to live in ancient times, and he was a maniac about historical authenticity. That was okay; they all had half-assed excuses, and Avi's historical acumen frequently came in handy.\n\nNot long after this, Avi graduated and disappeared, and popped up a few months later in Minneapolis, where he had gotten a job with a major publisher of fantasy role-playing games. He offered to buy Randy's game software for the astonishingly large sum of $1000 plus a small cut of future profits. Randy accepted the offer in its general outlines, asked Avi to send him a contract, then went out and found Andrew boiling some fish guts in a birchbark kettle atop a Weber grill on the roof of the apartment building where he lived. He wanted to give Andrew the good news, and to cut him in on the proceeds. What ensued was a really unpleasant conversation, standing up there in a pelting, spitting, wind-blown rain.\n\nTo begin with, Andrew took this deal far more seriously than Randy did. Randy saw it as a windfall, a lark. Andrew, who was the son of a lawyer, treated it as if it were a major corporate merger, and asked many tedious and niggling questions about the contract, which did not exist yet and which would probably cover a single piece of paper when it did. Randy didn't realize it at the time, but by asking so many questions for which Randy had no answers, Andrew was, in effect, arrogating to himself the role of Business Manager. He was implicitly forming a business partnership with Randy that did not, in fact, exist.\n\nFurthermore, Andrew didn't have the first notion of how much time and effort Randy had put into writing the code. Or (as Randy was to realize later) maybe he did. In any case, Andrew assumed from the get-go that he would share a fifty-fifty split with Randy, which was wildly out of proportion to the work he'd actually done on the project. Basically, Andrew acted as if all of the work he'd ever done on the subject of aboriginal dining habits was a part of this undertaking, and that it entitled him to an equal split.\n\nBy the time Randy extricated himself from this conversation, his mind was reeling. He had gone in with one view of reality and been radically challenged by another one that was clearly preposterous; but after an hour of Andrew's browbeating he was beginning to doubt himself. After two or three sleepless nights, he decided to call the whole thing off. A paltry few hundred dollars wasn't worth all of this agony.\n\nBut Andrew (who was, by now, represented by an associate of his father's Santa Barbara law firm) vehemently objected. He and Randy had, according to his lawyer, jointly created something that had economic value, and a failure on Randy's part to sell it at market value amounted to taking money out of Andrew's pocket. It had become an unbelievable Kafkaesque nightmare, and Randy could only withdraw to a corner table at his favorite pub, drink pints of stout (frequently in the company of Chester) and watch this fantastic psychodrama unfold. He had, he now realized, blundered into some serious domestic weirdness involving Andrew's family. It turned out that Andrew's parents were divorced and, long ago, had fought savagely over custody of him, their only child. Mom had turned into a hippie and joined a religious cult in Oregon and taken Andrew with her. It was rumored that this cult engaged in sexual abuse of children. Dad had hired private dicks to kidnap Andrew back and then showered him with material possessions to demonstrate his superior love. There had followed an interminable legal battle in which Dad had hired some rather fringey psychotherapists to hypnotize Andrew and get him to dredge up repressed memories of unspeakable and improbable horrors.\n\nThis was just the executive summary of a weird life that Randy only learned about in bits and pieces as the years went on. Later, he was to decide that Andrew's life had been fractally weird. That is, you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it, in and of itself, would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the whole thing in its entirety.\n\nAnyway Randy had blundered into this life and become enveloped in the weirdness. One of the young eager beavers in Andrew's dad's law firm decided, as a preemptive move, to obtain copies of all of Randy's computer files, which were still stored on the UW computer system. Needless to say, he went about it in a heavy-handed way, and when the university's legal department began to receive his sullen letters, it responded by informing both Andrew's lawyer, and Randy, that anyone who used the university's computer system to create a commercial product had to split the proceeds with the university. So now Randy was getting ominous letters from not one but two groups of deadly lawyers. Andrew then threatened to sue him for having made this blunder, which had halved the value of Andrew's share!\n\nIn the end, just to cut his losses and get out of it clean, Randy had to hire a lawyer of his own. The final cost to him was a hair more than five thousand dollars. The software was never sold to anyone, and indeed could not have been; it was so legally encumbered by that point that it would have been like trying to sell someone a rusty Volkswagen that had been dismantled and its parts hidden in attack dog kennels all over the world.\n\nIt was the only time in his life when he had ever thought about suicide. He did not think about it very hard, or very seriously, but he did think about it.\n\nWhen it was all over, Avi sent him a handwritten letter saying, ``I enjoyed doing business with you and look forward to continuing our relationship both as friends and, should opportunities arise, as creative partners.''\n\n\nINDIGO\n\n\n\nLawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the band are up on the deck of the Nevada one morning, playing the national anthem and watching the Stars and Stripes ratchet up the mast, when they are startled to find themselves in the midst of one hundred and ninety airplanes of unfamiliar design. Some of them are down low, traveling horizontally, and others are up high, plunging nearly straight down. The latter are going so fast that they appear to be falling apart; little bits are dropping off of them. It is terrible to see--some training exercise gone miserably awry. But they pull out of their suicidal trajectories in plenty of time. The bits that have fallen off of them plunge smoothly and purposefully, not tumbling and fluttering as chunks of debris would. They are coming down all over the place. Perversely, they all seem to be headed for the berthed ships. It is incredibly dangerous--they might hit someone! Lawrence is outraged.\n\nThere is a short-lived phenomenon taking place in one of the ships down the line. Lawrence turns to look at it. This is the first real explosion he's ever seen and so it takes him a long time to recognize it as such. He can play the very hardest glockenspiel parts with his eyes closed, and The Star Spangled Banner is much easier to ding than to sing.\n\nHis scanning eyes fasten, not on the source of the explosion, but on a couple of airplanes that are headed right toward them, skimming just above the water. Each drops a long skinny egg and then their tailplanes visibly move and they angle upwards and pass overhead. The rising sun shines directly through the glass of their canopies. Lawrence is able to look into the eyes of the pilot of one of the planes. He notes that it appears to be some sort of Asian gentleman.\n\nThis is an incredibly realistic training exercise--even down to the point of using ethnically correct pilots, and detonating fake explosives on the ships. Lawrence heartily approves. Things have just been too lax around this place.\n\nA tremendous shock comes up through the deck of the ship, making his feet and legs feel as if he had just jumped off a ten-foot precipice onto solid concrete. But he's just standing there flatfooted. It makes no sense at all.\n\nThe band have finished playing the national anthem and are looking about at the spectacle. Sirens and horns are speaking up all over the place, from the Nevada, from the Arizona in the next berth, from buildings onshore. Lawrence doesn't see any antiaircraft fire going up, doesn't see any familiar planes in the air. The explosions just keep coming. Lawrence wanders over to the rail and stares across a few yards of open water towards the Arizona.\n\nAnother one of those plunging airplanes drops a projectile that shoots straight down onto Arizona's deck but then, strangely, vanishes. Lawrence blinks and sees that it has left a neat bomb-shaped hole in the deck, just like a panicky Warner Brothers cartoon character passing at high speed through a planar structure such as a wall or ceiling. Fire jets from that hole for about a microsecond before the whole deck bulges up, disintegrating, and turns into a burgeoning globe of fire and blackness. Waterhouse is vaguely aware of a lot of stuff coming at him really fast. It is so big that he feels more like he is falling into it. He freezes up. It goes by him, over him, and through him. A terrible noise pierces his skull, a chord randomly struck, discordant but not without some kind of deranged harmony. Musical qualities aside, it is so goddamned loud that it almost kills him. He claps his hands over his ears.\n\nStill the noise is there, like red-hot knitting needles through the eardrums. Hell's Bells. He spins away from it, but it follows him. He has this big thick strap around his neck, sewn together at groin level where it supports a cup. Thrust into the cup is the central support of his glockenspiel, which stands in front of him like a lyre-shaped breastplate, huge fluffy tassels dangling gaily from the upper corners. Oddly, one of the tassels is burning. That isn't the only thing now wrong with the glockenspiel, but he can't quite make it out because his vision keeps getting obscured by something that must be wiped away every few moments. All he knows is that the glockenspiel has eaten a huge quantum of pure energy and been kicked up to some incredibly high state never before achieved by such an instrument; it is a burning, glowing, shrieking, ringing, radiating monster, a comet, an archangel, a tree of flaming magnesium, strapped to his body, standing on his groin. The energy is transmitted down its humming, buzzing central axis, through the cup, and into his genitals, which would be tumescing in other circumstances.\n\nLawrence spends some time wandering aimlessly around the deck. Eventually he has to help open a hatch for some men, and then he realizes that his hands are still clapped over his ears, and have been for a long time except for when he was wiping stuff out of his eyes. When he takes them off, the ringing has stopped, and he no longer hears airplanes. He was thinking that he wanted to go belowdecks, because the bad things are coming from the sky and he would like to get some big heavy permanent-seeming stuff between him and it, but a lot of sailors are taking the opposite view. He hears that they have been hit by one and maybe two of something that rhymes with ``torpedoes,'' and that they are trying to raise steam. Officers and noncoms, black and red with smoke and blood, keep deputizing him for different, extremely urgent tasks that he doesn't quite understand, not least because he keeps putting his hands over his ears.\n\nProbably half an hour goes by before he hits upon the idea of discarding his glockenspiel, which is, after all, just getting in the way. It was issued to him by the Navy with any number of stern warnings about the consequences of misusing it. Lawrence is conscientious about this kind of thing, dating back to when he was first given organ-playing privileges in West Point, Virginia. But at this point, for the first time in his life, as he stands there watching the Arizona burn and sink, he just says to himself: Well, to heck with it! He takes that glockenspiel out of its socket and has one last look at it, it is the last time in his life he will ever touch a glockenspiel. There is no point in saving it now anyway, he realizes; several of the bars have been bent. He flips it around and discovers that chunks of blackened, distorted metal have been impact-welded onto several of the bars. Really throwing caution to the winds now, he flings it overboard in the general direction of the Arizona, a military lyre of burnished steel that sings a thousand men to their resting places on the bottom of the harbor.\n\nAs it vanishes into a patch of burning oil, the second wave of attacking airplanes arrives. The Navy's antiaircraft guns finally open up and begin to rain shells down into the surrounding community and blow up occupied buildings. He can see human-shaped flames running around in the streets, pursued by people with blankets.\n\nThe rest of the day is spent, by Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the Navy, grappling with the fact that many two-dimensional structures on this and other ships, which were put into place to prevent various fluids from commingling (e.g. fuel and air) have holes in them, and not only that but a lot of shit is on fire too and things are more than a little smoky. Certain objects that are supposed to (a) remain horizontal and (b) support heavy things have ceased to do either.\n\nNevada's engineering section manages to raise steam in a couple of boilers and the captain tries to get the ship out of the harbor. As soon as she gets underway, she comes under concerted attack, mostly by dive bombers who are eager to sink her in the channel and block the harbor altogether. Eventually, the captain runs her aground rather than see this happen. Unfortunately, what Nevada has in common with most other naval vessels is that she is not really engineered to work from a stationary position, and consequently she is hit three more times by dive bombers. So it is a pretty exciting morning overall. As a member of the band who does not even have his instrument any more, Lawrence's duties are quite poorly defined, and he spends more time than he should watching the airplanes and the explosions. He has gone back to his earlier train of thought regarding societies and their efforts to outdo each other. It is very clear to him, as wave after wave of Nipponese dive bombers hurl themselves, with calligraphic precision, at the ship he is standing on, and as the cream of his society's navy burns and explodes and sinks, putting up virtually no resistance, that his society is going to have to rethink a thing or two.\n\n\n\nAt some point he burns his hand on something. It is his right hand, which is preferable--he is left-handed. Also, he becomes more clearly aware that a portion of Arizona has tried to take his scalp off. These are minor injuries by Pearl Harbor standards and he does not stay long in the hospital. The doctor warns him that the skin on his hand might contract and limit his fingers' range of motion. As soon as he can withstand the pain, Lawrence begins to play Bach's Art of Fugue in his lap whenever he is not otherwise occupied. Most of those tunes start out simple; you can easily picture old Johann Sebastian sitting there on the bench on a cold morning in Leipzig, one or two blockflote stops yanked out, left hand in his lap, a fat choirboy or two over in the corner heaving away on the bellows, faint gasping noises coming from all the leaks in the works, and Johann's right hand wandering aimlessly across the forbidding simplicity of the Great manual, stroking those cracked and yellowed elephant tusks, searching for some melody he hadn't already invented. That is good stuff for Lawrence right now, and so he makes his right hand go through the same motions as Johann's, even though it is a gauze-wrapped hand and he is using an upside-down dinner tray as a substitute for the keyboard, and he has to hum the music under his breath. When he really gets into it, his feet skid around and piston under the sheets, playing imaginary pedals, and his neighbors complain.\n\nHe is out of the hospital in a few days, just in time for him and the rest of Nevada's band to begin their new, wartime assignment. This was evidently something of a poser for the Navy's manpower experts. These musicians were (from a killing-Nips point of view) completely useless to begin with. As of 7 December, they no longer have even a functioning ship and most of them have lost their clarinets.\n\nStill, it isn't all about loading shells and pulling triggers. No large organization can kill Nips in any kind of systematic way without doing a nearly unbelievable amount of typing and filing. It is logical to suppose that men who can play the clarinet will not botch that kind of work any worse than anyone else. And so Waterhouse and his bandmates receive orders assigning them to what would appear to be one of the typing-and-filing branches of the Navy.\n\nThis is located in a building, not a ship. There are quite a few Navy people who sneer at the whole idea of working in a building, and Lawrence and some of the other recent recruits, eager to fit in, have gotten into the habit of copping the same attitude. But now that they have seen what happens to a ship when you detonate hundreds of pounds of high explosive on, in, and around it, Waterhouse and many others are reassessing their feelings about working in buildings. They report to their new post with high morale.\n\nTheir new commanding officer is not so cheerful, and his feelings appear to be shared by everyone in the entire section. The musicians are greeted without being welcomed and saluted without being honored. The people who have been working in this building--far from being overawed by their status as guys who not only worked on an actual ship until recently but furthermore have been very close to things that were exploding, burning, etc., and not as the result of routine lapses in judgment but because bad men deliberately made it happen--do not seem to feel that Lawrence and his bandmates deserve to be entrusted with this new work, whatever the hell it is.\n\nGlumly, almost despairingly, the commanding officer and his subordinates get the musicians squared away. Even if they don't have enough desks to go around, each man can at least have a chair at a table or counter. Some ingenuity is displayed in finding places for all the new arrivals. It is clear that these people are trying their best at what they considered to be a hopeless task.\n\nThen there is some talk about secrecy. A great deal of talk about it. They run through drills intended to test their ability to throw things away properly. This goes on for a long time and the longer it continues, without an explanation as to why, the more mysterious it becomes. The musicians, who were at first a little put out by their chilly reception, start to speculate amongst themselves as to what kind of an operation they have gotten themselves into now.\n\nFinally, one morning, the musicians are assembled in a classroom in front of the cleanest chalkboard Waterhouse has ever seen. The last few days have imbued him with just enough paranoia that he suspects it is that clean for a reason--erasing chalkboards is not to be taken lightly during wartime.\n\nThey are seated in little chairs with desks attached to them, desks designed for right-handers. Lawrence puts his notepad in his lap, then rests his bandaged right hand on the desk and begins to play a ditty from Art of Fugue, grimacing and even grunting with pain as his burned skin stretches and slides over his knuckles.\n\nSomeone chucks him on the shoulder. He opens his eyes to see that he is the only person in the room sitting down; an officer is on the deck. He stands up and his weak leg nearly buckles. When he finally gets himself fully to his feet, he sees that the officer (if he even is an officer) is out of uniform. Way out of uniform. He's wearing a bathrobe and smoking a pipe. The bathrobe is extraordinarily worn, and not in the sense of, say, a hospital or hotel bathrobe that gets laundered frequently. This thing hasn't been laundered in a long time, but boy has it seen some use. The elbows are worn out and the bottom of the right sleeve is ashy grey and slippery with graphite from being dragged back and forth, tens of thousands of times, across sheets of paper dense with number-two pencil work. The terrycloth has a dandruffy appearance, but it has nothing to do with exfoliation of the scalp; these flakes are way too big, and too geometric: rectangles and circular dots of oaktag, punched out of cards and tape respectively. The pipe went out a long time ago and the officer (or whatever he is) is not even pretending to worry about getting it relit. It is there just to give him something to bite down on, which he does as vigorously as a civil war infantryman having a leg sawed off.\n\nSome other fellow--one who actually bothered to shave, shower, and put on a uniform--introduces bathrobe man as Commander Shane-spelled-s-c-h-o-e-n, but Schoen is having none of it; he turns his back on them, exposing the back side of his bathrobe, which around the buttocks is worn transparent as a negligee. Reading from a notebook, he writes out the following in block letters:\n\n19 17 17 19 14 20 23 18 19 8 12 16 19 8 3\n\n21 8 25 18 14 18 6 3 18 8 15 18 22 18 11\n\nAround the time that the fourth or fifth number is going up on the chalkboard, Waterhouse feels the hairs standing up on the back of his neck. By the time the third group of five numbers is written out, he has not failed to notice that none of them is larger than 26--that being the number of letters in the alphabet. His heart is pounding more wildly than it did when Nipponese bombs were tracing parabolic trajectories toward the deck of the grounded Nevada. He pulls a pencil out of his pocket. Finding no paper handy, he writes down the numbers from 1 to 26 on the surface of his little writing desk.\n\nBy the time the man in the bathrobe is done writing out the last group of numbers, Waterhouse is already well into his frequency count. He wraps it up as Bathrobe Man is saying something along the lines of ``this might look like a meaningless sequence of numbers to you, but to a Nip naval officer it might look like something entirely different.'' Then the man laughs nervously, shakes his head sadly, squares his jaw resolutely, and runs through a litany of other emotion-laden expressions not a single one of which is appropriate here.\n\nWaterhouse's frequency count is simply a tally of how frequently each number appears on the blackboard. It looks like this:\n\n1  14 ||\n2  15 |\n3 ||  16 |\n4  17 ||\n5  18 ||||||\n6 |  19 ||||\n7  20 |\n8 ||||  21 |\n9  22 |\n10  23 |\n11 |  24\n12 |  25 |\n13  26\n\nThe most interesting thing about this is that ten of the possible symbols (viz. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 24, and 26) are not even used. Only sixteen different numbers appear in the message. Assuming each of those sixteen represents one and only one letter of the alphabet, this message has (Lawrence reckons in his head) 111136315345735680000 possible meanings. This is a funny number because it begins with four ones and ends with four zeroes; Lawrence snickers, wipes his nose, and gets on with it.\n\nThe most common number is 18. It probably represents the letter E. If he substitutes E into the message everywhere he sees an 18, then--\n\nWell, to be honest, then he'll have to write out the whole message again, substituting Es for 18s, and it will take a long time, and it might be time wasted because he might have guessed wrong. On the other hand, if he just restrains his mind to construe 18s as Es--an operation that he thinks of as being loosely analogous to changing the presets on a pipe organ's console--then what he sees in his mind's eye when he looks at the blackboard is\n\n19 17 17 19 14 20 23 E 19 8 12 16 19 8 3\n\n21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\nwhich only has 10103301395066880000 possible meanings. This is a funny number too because of all those ones and zeroes--but it is an absolutely meaningless coincidence.\n\n``The science of making secret codes is called cryptography,'' Commander Schoen says, ``and the science of breaking them is cryptanalysis.'' Then he sighs, grapples visibly with some more widely divergent emotional states, and resignedly plods into the mandatory exercise of breaking these words down into their roots, which are either Latin or Greek (Lawrence isn't paying attention, doesn't care, only glimpses the stark word CRYPTO written in handsized capitals).\n\nThe opening sequence ``19 17 17 19'' is peculiar. 19, along with 8, is the second most common number in the list. 17 is only half as common. You can't have four vowels or four consonants in a row (unless the words are German) so either 17 is a vowel and 19 a consonant or the other way round. Since 19 appears more frequently (four times) in the message, it is more likely to be the vowel than 17 (which only appears twice). A is the most common vowel after E, so if he assumes that 19 is A, he gets\n\nA 17 17 A 14 20 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3\n\n21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\n\nThis narrows it down quite a bit, to a mere 841941782922240000 possible answers. He's already reduced the solution space by a couple of orders of magnitude!\n\nSchoen has talked himself up into a disturbingly heavy sweat, now, and is almost bodily flinging himself into a historical overview of the science of CRYPTOLOGY, as the union of cryptography and cryptanalysis is called. There's some talk about an English fellow name of Wilkins, and book called Cryptonomicon that he wrote hundreds of years ago, but (perhaps because he doesn't rate the intelligence of his audience too highly) he goes very easy on the historical background, and jumps directly from Wilkins to Paul Revere's ``one if by land, two if by sea'' code. He even makes a mathematics in-joke about this being one of the earliest practical applications of binary notation. Lawrence dutifully brays and snorts, drawing an appalled look from the saxophonist seated in front of him.\n\nEarlier in his talk, the Schoen mentioned that this message was (in what's obviously a fictional scenario ginned up to make this mathematical exercise more interesting to a bunch of musicians who are assumed not to give a shit about math) addressed to a Nip naval officer. Given that context, Lawrence cannot but guess that the first word of the message is ATTACK. This would mean that 17 represented T, 14 C, and 20 K. When he fills these in, he gets\n\nA T T A C K 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3\n\n21 T 25 E C E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11\n\n\nand then the rest is so obvious he doesn't bother to write it out. He cannot restrain himself from jumping to his feet. He's so excited he forgets about the weak legs and topples over across a couple of his neighbors' desks, which makes a lot of noise.\n\n``Do you have a problem, sailor?'' says one of the officers in the corner, one who actually bothered to wear a uniform.\n\n``Sir! The message is, `Attack Pearl Harbor December Seven!' Sir!'' Lawrence shouts, and then sits down. His whole body is quivering with excitement. Adrenalin has taken over his body and mind. He could strangle twenty sumo wrestlers on the spot.\n\nCommander Schoen is completely impassive except that he blinks once, very slowly. He turns to one of his subordinates, who is standing against the wall with his hands clasped behind his back, and says, ``Get this one a copy of the Cryptonomicon. And a desk--as close to the coffee machine as possible. And why don't you promote the son of a bitch as long as you're at it.''\n\nThe part about the promotion turns out to be either military humor or further evidence of Commander Schoen's mental instability. Other than that small bit of drollery, the story of Waterhouse past this point, for the next ten months, is not much more complicated than the story of a bomb that has just been released from the belly of a plunging airplane. The barriers placed in his path (working his way through the Cryptonomicon, breaking the Nipponese Air Force Meteorological Code, breaking the Coral naval attache machine cipher, breaking Unnamed Nipponese Army Water Transport Code 3A, breaking the Greater East Asia Ministry Code) present about as much resistance as successive decks of a worm-eaten wooden frigate. Within a couple of months he is actually writing new chapters of the Cryptonomicon. People speak of it as though it were a book, but it's not. It is basically a compilation of all of the papers and notes that have drifted up in a particular corner of Commander Schoen's office over the roughly two-year period that he's been situated at Station Hypo, as this place is called.* It is everything that Commander Schoen knows about breaking codes, which amounts to everything that the United States of America knows. At any moment it could have been annihilated if a janitor had stepped into the room for a few minutes and tidied the place up. Understanding this, Commander Schoen's colleagues in the officers' ranks of Station Hypo have devised strenuous measures to prevent any type of tidying or hygienic operations, of any description, in the entire wing of the building that contains Commander Schoen's office. They know enough, in other words, to understand that the Cryptonomicon is terribly important, and they have the wit to take the measures necessary to keep it safe. Some of them actually consult it from time to time, and use its wisdom to break Nipponese messages, or even solve whole cryptosystems. But Waterhouse is the first guy to come along who is good enough to (at first) point out errors in what Schoen has written, and (soon) assemble the contents of the pile into something like an orderly work, and (eventually) add original material onto it.\n\n*``Hypo'' is a military way of saying the letter H. Bright boy Waterhouse infers that there must be at least seven others: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.\n\nAt some point Schoen takes him downstairs and leads him to the end of a long windowless corridor to a slab of a door guarded by hulking Myrmidons and lets him see the second coolest thing they've got at Pearl Harbor, a roomful of machinery from the Electrical Till Corporation that they use mainly for doing frequency counts on Nip intercepts.\n\nThe most remarkable machine* at Station Hypo, however--and the first coolest thing in Pearl Harbor--is even deeper in the cloaca of the building. It is contained in something that might be likened to a bank vault if it weren't all wired up with explosives so that its contents can be vaporized in the event of a total Nip invasion.\n\n*Assuming, provisionally, that Alan is wrong and that human brains are not machines.\n\nThis is the machine that Commander Schoen made, more than a year ago, for breaking the Nipponese cipher called Indigo. Apparently, as of the beginning of 1940, Schoen was a well-adjusted and mentally healthy young man into whose lap was dumped some great big long lists of numbers compiled from intercept stations around the Pacific (perhaps, Waterhouse thinks, Alpha, Bravo, etc.). These numbers were Nipponese messages that had been encrypted somehow--circumstantial evidence suggested that it had been done by some kind of machine. But absolutely nothing was known about the machine: whether it used gears or rotary switches or plugboards, or some combination thereof, or some other kind of mechanism that hadn't even been thought of by white people yet; how many such mechanisms it did or didn't use; specific details of how it used them. All that could be said was that these numbers, which seemed completely random, had been transmitted, perhaps even incorrectly. Other than that, Schoen had nothing--nothing--to work on.\n\nAs of the middle of 1941, then, this machine existed in this vault, here at Station Hypo. It existed because Schoen had built it. The machine perfectly decrypted every Indigo message that the intercept stations picked up, and was, therefore, necessarily an exact functional duplication of the Nipponese Indigo code machine, though neither Schoen nor any other American had ever laid eyes on one. Schoen had built the thing simply by looking at those great big long lists of essentially random numbers, and using some process of induction to figure it out. Somewhere along the line he had become totally debilitated psychologically, and begun to suffer nervous breakdowns at the rate of about one every week or two.\n\nAs of the actual outbreak of war with Nippon, Schoen is on disability, and taking lots of drugs. Waterhouse spends as much time with Schoen as he is allowed to, because he's pretty sure that whatever happened inside of Schoen's head, between when the lists of apparently random numbers were dumped into his lap and when he finished building his machine, is an example of a noncomputable process.\n\nWaterhouse's security clearance is upgraded about once a month, until it reaches the highest conceivable level (or so he thinks) which is Ultra/Magic. Ultra is what the Brits call the intelligence they get from having broken the German Enigma machine. Magic is what the Yanks call the intelligence they get from Indigo. In any case, Lawrence now gets to see the Ultra/Magic summaries, which are bound documents with dramatic, alternating red and black paragraphs printed on the front cover. Paragraph number three states:\n\nNO ACTION IS TO BE TAKEN ON INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED, REGARDLESS OF TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE, IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY.\n\nSeems clear enough, right? But Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is not so damn sure.\n\n. . . IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING . . .\n\nAt about the same time, Waterhouse has made a realization about himself. He has found that he works best when he is not horny, which is to say in the day or so following ejaculation. So as a part of his duty to the United States he has begun to spend a lot of time in whorehouses. But he can't have that much actual sex on what is still a glockenspiel player's pay and so he limits himself to what are euphemistically called massages.\n\n. . . ACTION. . . EFFECT . . .REVEALING . . .\n\nThe words stay with him like the clap. He lies on his back during these massages, arms crossed over his eyes, mumbling the words to himself. Something bothers him. He has learned that when something bothers him in this particular way it usually leads to his writing a new paper. But first he has to do a lot of hard mental pick-and-shovel work.\n\nIt all comes to him, explosively, during the Battle of Midway, while he and his comrades are spending twenty-four hours a day down among those ETC machines, decrypting Yamamoto's messages, telling Nimitz exactly where to find the Nip fleet.\n\nWhat are the chances of Nimitz finding that fleet by accident? That's what Yamamoto must be asking himself.\n\nIt is all a question (oddly enough!) of information theory.\n\n. . .ACTION . . .\n\nWhat is an action? It might be anything. It might be something obvious like bombing a Nipponese military installation. Everyone would agree that this would constitute an action. But it might also be something like changing the course of an aircraft carrier by five degrees--or not doing so. Or having exactly the right package of forces off Midway to hammer the Nipponese invasion fleet. It could mean something much less dramatic, like canceling plans for an action. An action, in a certain sense, might even be the total absence of activity. Any of these might be rational responses, on the part of some commander, to INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED. But any of them might be observable by the Nipponese--and hence any of them would impart information to the Nipponese. How good might those Nips be at abstracting information from a noisy channel? Do they have any Schoens?\n\n. . . EFFECT . . .\n\nSo what if the Nips did observe it? What would the effect be exactly? And under what circumstances might the effect be REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY?\n\nIf the action is one that could never have happened unless the Americans were breaking Indigo, then it will constitute proof, to the Nipponese, that the Americans have broken it. The existence of the source--the machine that Commander Schoen built--will be revealed.\n\nWaterhouse trusts that no Americans will be that stupid. But what if it isn't that clear-cut? What if the action is one that would merely be really improbable unless the Americans were breaking the code? What if the Americans, in the long run, are just too damn lucky?\n\nAnd how closely can you play that game? A pair of loaded dice that comes up sevens every time is detected in a few throws. A pair that comes up sevens only one percent more frequently than a straight pair is harder to detect--you have to throw the dice many more times in order for your opponent to prove anything.\n\nIf the Nips keep getting ambushed--if they keep finding their own ambushes spoiled--if their merchant ships happen to cross paths with American subs more often than pure probability would suggest--how long until they figure it out?\n\nWaterhouse writes papers on the subject, keeps pestering people with them. Then, one day, Waterhouse receives a new set of orders.\n\nThe orders arrive encrypted into groups of five random-looking letters, printed out on the blue tissue paper that is used for top-secret cablegrams. The message has been encrypted in Washington using a one-time pad, which is a slow and awkward but, in theory, perfectly unbreakable cipher used for the most important messages. Waterhouse knows this because he is one of the only two persons in Pearl Harbor who has clearance to decrypt it. The other one is Commander Schoen, and he is under sedation today. The duty officer opens up the appropriate safe and gives him the one-time pad for the day, which is basically a piece of graph paper covered with numbers printed in groups of five. The numbers have been chosen by secretaries in a basement in Washington by shuffling cards or drawing chits out of a hat. They are pure noise. One copy of the pure noise is in Waterhouse's hands, and the other copy is used by the person who encrypted this message in Washington.\n\nWaterhouse sits down and gets to work, subtracting noise from ciphertext to produce plaintext.\n\nThe first thing he sees is that this message's classification is not merely Top Secret, or even Ultra, but something entirely new: ULTRA MEGA.\n\nThe messages states that after thoroughly destroying this message, he--Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse--is to proceed to London, England, by the fastest available means. All ships, trains, and airplanes, even submarines, will be made available to him. Though a member of the U.S. Navy, he is even to be provided with an extra uniform--an Army uniform--in case it simplifies matters for him.\n\nThe one thing he must never, ever do is place himself in a situation where he could be captured by the enemy. In this sense, the war is suddenly over for Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1091847", "artist_names": "The Turtles", "full_title":
