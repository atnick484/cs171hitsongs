They'd abounded with treasure?\nMan, that doesn't give me pleasure\nI don't know how to measure\nHow I feel about that shit\nBut that won't make me quit\nIn my quest, to scour the deep sea\nLike, you and me?\nSearching for an angle, mangled\nThe corpse in the Bermuda Triangle\nMaybe looking for Amelia Earhart's plane\nWe're like \"oh, shit, what remains\"\nAnd\nThen we get to the bottom\nAmelia Earhart's like \"oh, shit, got em!\"\nYou didn't know, but I was an immortal\nI just stepped through this fucking spacetime portal\nShuffled off my fucking mortal coil\nMortal Kombat, you know that I'm oil\nAll my fuckin' blood, but I got a loyal\nAnd you know, I am not gonna take a foil\nTo my head in a little tin cap shape\nBecause you know I'm great\nI popped the grape\nBut I'm not on some conspiracies\nI'm just trying to see what's up in the seas\nI believe that I will not cease and desist\nYou cannot resist\nWhen I'm stepping through like gorillas in the mist\nI am in Manila, in Hong Kong\nIn San Francisco, doing a disco\nPop it hot like it's Crisco\nBut I gotta pace myself\nIf we're gonna raise this wealth\nThat's why I flow at this tempo\nHello, I do kempo\nIn my mind, that's a form of martial arts\nBut I take, partial starts\nAnd I just gave little partial farts\nWhen I'm shitting on the mic\n'Cause you know I got this heart\nAnd you know I got the K-Mart\nState-of-the-art mind\nBut I'm not be-hind\nNo, I'm way out in the front\nRolling up a 30-foot blunt\nAnd you know I'm not gonna bunt\nIn a baseball game, I'm gonna hit the dinger\nBecause I am the rap ringer\nI never make the wrong call\nAnd you know, chicks dig the long ball!\nI am like (Ah)\nThey are like (Wow)\nWatsky, you cannot stop me\nI got no paparazzi\nI'm a fucking doorstep\nI'm gonna take one more step\nAnd then, take another\nWord, to ya mother, word to ya fatha'\nHere I am, man, fuckin' camp Granada\nJust keep rappin', yada yada yada\nHey, shout-out to fuckin' Jerry Seinfeld\nMe and him, it's like a fuckin' mind meld\nOr maybe it's more like Larry David\nBecause you know we're not playing\nShoutout to the Jews, the chosen people\nYou know that you cannot fuckin' lose\nBut also, shoutout to the Christians\nShoutout to the agnostics, starting their own missions\nYou know you cannot stop it\nAlso, fuckin' shoutout to the Baha'i Faith\nWho know we're gonna make way\nFor the Jehovah's Witnesses\nThey got their hit list-esses\nWalking up to the different fuckin' doors\nSaying \"Would you like to love God a little more?\"\nBut it kinda sucks, just because of COVID\nThey can't be making no bids\nI heard they're not doing that door-knockin'\nBut, you know, we're not stoppin'\nHowever you appraise 'em\nNo, we are fuckin' raising\nOn the mic I'm fuckin' blazing\nIf the sun is blazing\nI turn into a raisin\nI'm bringing this whole craze\nFor almost two whole days\nI don't think that's possible\nI don't think that's wise\nI don't think that's probable\nThat is what they say when they look in to my eyes\nMy momma was afraid for me\nShe busted in like the ma\u00eetre d\nShe said \"Hello umm\"\nI don't think you wanna sit here\nI don't think you wanna get here\n'Cause you might die\nYou know but then I was like \"I gotta try\"\nI gotta try to do the right thing\nShoutout to Spike Lee\nI'm gonna try to get the ring\nTry to get the bling\nTry to be the king of the long raps\nLike I was the dude with the ass raps\nDoesn't matter\nAs long as the people fuckin' clap\nAs long as we give a little joy\nGive em dat'\nThen I will cut the crap\nI guess I am a believer\nAnd I don't care that I got seizures\nI got my fuckin' pills\nI'm gonna take 'em right around midnight\nSo I can get right\nI think that's what I gotta do\nShout out to the medical commun-\nItty I just get gritty\nI hope my rhymes are not shitty\nUmm, mic check are you with me?\nShout-out Bobby and Whitney\nBut not shout out to the bad things he did\nI don't know if I'm gonna have a kid\nI don't know if I'm gonna raise a child\nBut it might be fun they'd be fuckin' wild\nThey would make be fuckin' smile\nThey got fuckin' bile and some guts\nEverybody does\nEverybody got guts\nEverybody got nuts\nOr half the people maybe like 48.7%\nThat's about how it went\nI think that is the percentage-ish\nOf the gender fuckin' separation\nAlthough we know in this nation\nThings are fuckin' changin' and you gotta be patient\nIf you don't understand\nI got my fuckin' rhymes on demand\nI can run it back\nBut I'm not allowed to under the rules of Guinness\nIf I'm trying to fuckin' win this\nI will not get winded, I have not rescinded\nAnything that I've fucking said\nBy the end of this shit I'll be fuckin' dead\nI'll be seeing red like I said gotta take my meds\nThat is like Right Said Fred\nYou just gotta relax\nIf you wanna come and swing your lyrical battle axe\nI don't get lyrical cataracts\nSo I can see clearly, so I can be dearly\nReceived, I've got to achieve\nWhatever I've got up my sleeve\nWhatever I've got in my pouch\nShoutout to pouch, ouch\nI pricked my finger, that is not true\nBut on this mic I will linger for you\nAnd for my crew\nThis is what I've got to do\nI've got to drop it hot for you\n'Cause this is why I'm hot\nThis is why I'm not\nShoutout to Mims\nShoutout to Hims\nThat's that brand of underwear\nThat I saw advertised everywhere on the New York subway\nI'm drivin' down the one way\nI'm cruisin' up the runway\nSpreading my wings\nLike I am a Cessna\nLike I am a chestnut\nRoastin' on an open fire, bing!\nCrosby, you got me\nMe, hot see?\nMe Watsky\nSee?\nSittin' in the hot seat\nNo, I'm sittin' in the cat-bird seat\nBut that word, beats droppin' me\nAnd meha coppin'\nShoutout to Frank Macoppin\nPlayground\nIn the fuckin' San Francisco SFC\nBecause you know how this go\nWe are the best in Dolores Park\nWe have a chorus singin' in the dark\nHark, the angel\nShoutout to Chuck Rangel\nRangel, I don't remember how to pronounce his name but\nIn December maybe I will be dismembered\nBy a fuckin' psychotic type of Santa\nComin' down my chimney\nWavin' fuckin' butcher knives\nThat\u2019d be fucking crazy\nWho is he\nWho is this robotic crazy Santa\nOh my \u2018lanta\nI can\u2019t believe that he\u2019s tryna get me\nInstead of giving me presents\nI can't believe that he got me on the ground\nBut I'm like \"no I'm Watsky\"\nAnd Santa said \"oh I was just tryna do this shit to a fucked up type of dude\"\nBut I'm like \"that's rude\nSanta you've got to improve your fuckin' additude'\nPlus I was in the nude\nHe got me tackled on the ground\nMy fuckin' whole brood around me\nAnd I got my whole butt out\nHe's like damn I guess I'll put this knife away\nCut-out\nCut it out like on Full House\nJohn Stamos\nJohn Stains-Most in his pants\nBut that's okay\nWe don't judge people who like to dance away the day\nIf they need a Pepto-Bismol\nMy throat is not abysmal\nThis all that I can do is just give this my not screwed-up attempt\nI will not repent\nAnd I\u2019m not demented\nBut I meant it\nWhen I sent it\nFrom my brain\nI'm not plain\nIm not fuckin' around\nI\u2019m not cluckin' the ground\nJust right there it\u2019s only two feet\nThat\u2019s pretty cool man I eat\nFrom that cup right there\nThe one that\u2019s floatin' up in the air\nIt\u2019s got a fuckin' strawber-\n-ry smoothie\nI flow very smoothly\nBut you

just remain\nOn the ground\nEven the cat\u2019s eye\nThat is my favorite fuckin' marble that passed by\nDid you know at places\nPeople on the internet watch marble races\nI watched one\nIt was mad fun\nI picked the fuckin' blue marble\nAnd my pick wasn't all garbled\nIt came down the shoot\nIt was going all fuckin' cool\nAnd then it fuckin scooted past the red one\nThat kid from The Shining like Red-Rum\nMeaning murder\nWorder\nWordier\nAll my flows are so dirtier\nThan you could even fuckin' guess\nI'm not even fucking stressed\nI'm so damn relaxy\nShout out to a Maxi-Pad\nFor being so absorbent\nThat's a good fuckin' fuction\nMy girl's not in her head 'cause she knows it\nPut her hands in the air\nMaxi Pads doing what they do down there\nIf you are shaved or if you've got hair\nIt doesn't matter if you've got a bush or are bare\nDo what you wanna\nWord to your mama\nYour dude can't tell you what you gotta do\nGotta do what you wanna\nMake your own choice\nWith your body or your voice\nIf you are moist\nI know some people don't like that word\nPalabra\nBut you know you gotta like what you like\nThere was this one time this dude named Ike\nRan to be Prez\nAnd he fuckin' won\nEisenhower, that's what I said\nI's a power-rapper\nYes I am\nSo fuckin' dapper\nThe clapper\nDoesn't work on the lights on this green screen\nMan, that would be a dream scene\nIf I could fuckin' clap and things would fuckin' do what they want\nWhat I want, damn\nThat would be no scam\nI don't eat no Spam\nThat's 'cause I am a soft boy\nAnd I only eat Bok-Choy\n'Cause I'm a little veggie human\nAnd that's what I be doin'\nLet me clarify\nLike clarified butter\nAgain, word to your mother\nAnd also not to digress\nBut I gotta get it off of my chest\nWord to Mark Wahlberg\nWord to ballers\nWait, okay, let me make my main point\nAs I rap over this joint\nAnd that is that I don't only eat Bok-Choy\nI also eat soy\nI also as a Jewish type dude not a goy\nGet lots of joy out of eatin' carrots\nOut of eatin' broccoli\nOut of eatin' lots of trees\nOut of smokin' lots of trees\nThat is true\nThat is not\nI don't smoke a lot\nBut I do when I party\nBut during COVID, I party hardly\nAnd I guess that's kinda sad\nBut I've had some calls with my dad\nPaul Watsky\nAnd Claire Watsky\nIt's rare, stop me\nIt's not, lots of Sundays\nI call my parentals\nAnd I just steal out my fuckin' mentals\nBut I don't pull out my dentals\nI go sometimes I do in a dream\nWhen I am on the scene\nAnd the ghost come and make me scream\nIt's like you are doing the most\nAnd I gotta fuckin' boast\nShout out to the host, to the boast, the most roast\nThat is some shit if you take a gander\nThat was said by Mr. Ned Flanders\nMr. Homer Simpson\nI'm the type of dude lots of dudes simps on\nThey're like \u201cWatsky, I'll do everything for you\nI'll white knight for you and your fucking crew\u201d\nI'm like \u201cDude, don't be a simp\nActually, DO be a simp\nYou could be pimp\nYou could be wimp\nYou could fucking walk with a limp\nYou can have a crimp in your dimp-le\u201d\nI just get the whole tent pole\nUp in the sky cause I meant\nLots of people can come in\nCause I got a big tent\nSo if you are a lame\nFucking get bent\nAnd by lame, what I mean in this game\nIs the type of person who says that you're lame\nIs the type of person who judges\nIs the type of person who never budges\nWhen they get stubborn\nCause you know we got to put our fears in the cupboard\n[?] 00:18:04\nWord!\nI think I got this whole thing turn-ed up\nBut that is bound to happen\n34 hours when you keep on rappin'\nSome words are going to collide like trains\nComing head to head, but it remains\nTo be seen that I get back on the track\nWith the *ratatat* *tat* *tat* when they *clap clap clap*\nWith my fucking clapping gums\nSo don't judge me too much if what I say is dumb\nSometimes\nCause I'm not trying to kick any dumb rhymes\nBut it happens and I think that is the lesson\nThat you cannot achieve perfection\nAnd it's not even a worthy goal\nYou just gotta try to put that ball in the hole\nMore times than not\nThis is why I'm hot, as I said\nBut, you know Man's Not Hot?\nAlthough the truth is, I kinda fuckin' am\n'Cause I'm goin' kinda fuckin' ham\nOn the microphone-o oh no\nCan't believe he's like Apollo Anton Ohno\nIce skatin' all over the beat\nMakin' it repeat\nI do not want to beat my meat, on the camera\nThat would be a bad fuckin' PR move\nWhen I'm all up in the groove with my meat out\nThey would be like \"oh, shout out\nThat will ruin my career\nIs that fuckin' clear?\nShowin' his whole rear?\nHe got fuckin' nakey\nMake me, take me\nYou cannot bake me\nIn my EZ bake oven\nNo Sara Lee\nI just keep on flowing, so merrily\nVerily, forsooth, did he do that

hoo when I rhymed\n[00:20:00]\n'Cause you could not rhyme\nLike I do, do the crime and you know that I'm\nJust puttin' lime on top of this shit\nAnd that's lyme with the L-Y-M-E, envy me\n'Cause you know when I put it on top\nThat I am going to make it drop\nTo the bottom of the urinal\nYou're all in my brain\nAnd I'm hearing y'all\nBut I'm not 'cause I'm not seeing comments\nI be too scared to see the tools\nBut I got to just remain bold\nAnd I've got to stay in the hold\nMy whole nuts life, oh, my nuts\nRemember that shit? Remember Gobble Guts?\nRemember jungle?\n[00:20:41]\n\n[00:30:00]\nThey got lots of range, they fuckin' levitate\nVerbally, vocally, stoking the fire\nOf the couress I retired\nI feel one year\n'Cause

and, entering deftly, seated himself. Mr Power stepped in after him, curving his height with care.\n\n\u2014Come on, Simon.\n\n\u2014After you, Mr Bloom said.\n\nMr Dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:\n\nYes, yes.\n\n\u2014Are we all here now? Martin Cunningham asked. Come along, Bloom.\nMr Bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. He pulled the door to after him and slammed it twice till it shut tight. He passed an arm through the armstrap and looked seriously from the open carriagewindow at the lowered blinds of the avenue. One dragged aside: an old woman peeping. Nose whiteflattened against the pane. Thanking her stars she was passed over. Extraordinary the interest they take in a corpse. Glad to see us go we give them such trouble coming. Job seems to suit them. Huggermugger in corners. Slop about in slipperslappers for fear he'd wake. Then getting it ready. Laying it out. Molly and Mrs Fleming making the bed. Pull it more to your side. Our windingsheet. Never know who will touch you dead. Wash and shampoo. I believe they clip the nails and the hair. Keep a bit in an envelope. Grows all the same after. Unclean job.\n\nAll waited. Nothing was said. Stowing in the wreaths probably. I am sitting on something hard. Ah, that soap: in my hip pocket. Better shift it out of that. Wait for an opportunity.\n\nAll waited. Then wheels were heard from in front, turning: then nearer: then horses' hoofs. A jolt. Their carriage began to move, creaking and swaying. Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind. The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker, door ajar. At walking pace.\n\nThey waited still, their knees jogging, till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks. Tritonville road. Quicker. The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes.\n\n\u2014What way is he taking us? Mr Power asked through both windows.\n\n\u2014Irishtown, Martin Cunningham said. Ringsend. Brunswick street.\n\nMr Dedalus nodded, looking out.\n\n\u2014That's a fine old custom, he said. I am glad to see it has not died out.\nAll watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers. Respect. The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane. Mr Bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man, clad in mourning, a wide hat.\n\n\u2014There's a friend of yours gone by, Dedalus, he said.\n\n\u2014Who is that?\n\n\u2014Your son and heir.\n\n\u2014Where is he? Mr Dedalus said, stretching over across.\n\nThe carriage, passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses, lurched round the corner and, swerving back to the tramtrack, rolled on noisily with chattering wheels. Mr Dedalus fell back, saying:\n\u2014Was that Mulligan cad with him? His fidus Achates!\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said. He was alone.\n\n\u2014Down with his aunt Sally, I suppose, Mr Dedalus said, the Goulding faction, the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie, papa's little lump of dung, the wise child that knows her own father.\n\nMr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road. Wallace Bros: the bottleworks: Dodder bridge.\n\nRichie Goulding and the legal bag. Goulding, Collis and Ward he calls the firm. His jokes are getting a bit damp. Great card he was. Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning, the landlady's two hats pinned on his head. Out on the rampage all night. Beginning to tell on him now: that backache of his, I fear. Wife ironing his back. Thinks he'll cure it with pills. All breadcrumbs they are. About six hundred per cent profit.\n\n\u2014He's in with a lowdown crowd, Mr Dedalus snarled. That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts. His name stinks all over Dublin. But with the help of God and His blessed mother I'll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate. I'll tickle his catastrophe, believe you me.\n\nHe cried above the clatter of the wheels:\n\n\u2014I won't have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son. A counterjumper's son. Selling tapes in my cousin, Peter Paul M'Swiney's. Not likely.\n\nHe ceased. Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power's mild face and Martin Cunningham's eyes and beard, gravely shaking. Noisy selfwilled man. Full of his son. He is right. Something to hand on. If little Rudy had lived. See him grow up. Hear his voice in the house. Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit. My son. Me in his eyes. Strange feeling it would be. From me. Just a chance. Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil. And the sergeant grinning up. She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched. Give us a touch, Poldy. God, I'm dying for it. How life begins.\n\nGot big then. Had to refuse the Greystones concert. My son inside her. I could have helped him on in life. I could. Make him independent. Learn German too.\n\n\u2014Are we late? Mr Power asked.\n\n\u2014Ten minutes, Martin Cunningham said, looking at his watch.\n\nMolly. Milly. Same thing watered down. Her tomboy oaths. O jumping Jupiter! Ye gods and little fishes! Still, she's a dear girl. Soon be a woman. Mullingar. Dearest Papli. Young student. Yes, yes: a woman too. Life, life.\nThe carriage heeled over and back, their four trunks swaying.\n\n\u2014Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014He might, Mr Dedalus said, if he hadn't that squint troubling him. Do you follow me?\n\nHe closed his left eye. Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs.\n\n\u2014What is this, he said, in the name of God? Crumbs?\n\n\u2014Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, Mr Power said.\n\nAll raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats. Mr Dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward and said:\n\n\u2014Unless I'm greatly mistaken. What do you think, Martin?\n\n\u2014It struck me too, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nMr Bloom set his thigh down. Glad I took that bath. Feel my feet quite clean. But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better.\n\nMr Dedalus sighed resignedly.\n\n\u2014After all, he said, it's the most natural thing in the world.\n\n\u2014Did Tom Kernan turn up? Martin Cunningham asked, twirling the peak of his beard gently.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom answered. He's behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes.\n\n\u2014And Corny Kelleher himself? Mr Power asked.\n\n\u2014At the cemetery, Martin Cunningham said.\n\n\u2014I met M'Coy this morning, Mr Bloom said. He said he'd try to come.\n\nThe carriage halted short.\n\n\u2014What's wrong?\n\n\u2014We're stopped.\n\n\u2014Where are we?\n\nMr Bloom put his head out of the window.\n\n\u2014The grand canal, he said.\n\nGasworks. Whooping cough they say it cures. Good job Milly never got it. Poor children! Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions. Shame really. Got off lightly with illnesses compared. Only measles. Flaxseed tea. Scarlatina, influenza epidemics. Canvassing for death. Don't miss this chance. Dogs' home over there. Poor old Athos! Be good to Athos, Leopold, is my last wish. Thy will be done. We obey them in the grave. A dying scrawl. He took it to heart, pined away. Quiet brute. Old men's dogs usually are.\n\nA raindrop spat on his hat. He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags. Apart. Curious. Like through a colander. I thought it would. My boots were creaking I remember now.\n\n\u2014The weather is changing, he said quietly.\n\n\u2014A pity it did not keep up fine, Martin Cunningham said.\n\n\u2014Wanted for the country, Mr Power said. There's the sun again coming out.\n\nMr Dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a mute curse at the sky.\n\n\u2014It's as uncertain as a child's bottom, he said.\n\n\u2014We're off again.\n\nThe carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently. Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.\n\n\u2014Tom Kernan was immense last night, he said. And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face.\n\n\u2014O, draw him out, Martin, Mr Power said eagerly. Wait till you hear him, Simon, on Ben Dollard's singing of The Croppy Boy.\n\n\u2014Immense, Martin Cunningham said pompously. His singing of that simple ballad, Martin, is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience.\n\n\u2014Trenchant, Mr Power said laughing. He's dead nuts on that. And the retrospective arrangement.\n\n\u2014Did you read Dan Dawson's speech? Martin Cunningham asked.\n\n\u2014I did not then, Mr Dedalus said. Where is it?\n\n\u2014In the paper this morning.\n\nMr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. That book I must change for her.\n\n\u2014No, no, Mr Dedalus said quickly. Later on please.\n\nMr Bloom's glance travelled down the edge of the paper, scanning the deaths: Callan, Coleman, Dignam, Fawcett, Lowry, Naumann, Peake, what Peake is that? is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne's? no, Sexton, Urbright. Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper. Thanks to the Little Flower. Sadly missed. To the inexpressible grief of his. Aged 88 after a long and tedious illness. Month's mind: Quinlan. On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy.\nIt is now a month since dear Henry fled To his home up above in the sky While his family weeps and mourns his loss Hoping some day to meet him on high.\n\nI tore up the envelope? Yes. Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath? He patted his waistcoatpocket. There all right. Dear Henry fled. Before my patience are exhausted.\n\nNational school. Meade's yard. The hazard. Only two there now. Nodding. Full as a tick. Too much bone in their skulls. The other trotting round with a fare. An hour ago I was passing there. The jarvies raised their hats.\n\nA pointsman's back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom's window. Couldn't they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier? Well but that fellow would lose his job then? Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention?\n\nAntient concert rooms. Nothing on there. A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet. Not much grief there. Quarter mourning. People in law perhaps.\n\nThey went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark's, under the railway bridge, past the Queen's theatre: in silence. Hoardings: Eugene Stratton, Mrs Bandmann Palmer. Could I go to see LEAH tonight, I wonder. I said I. Or the Lily of Killarney? Elster Grimes Opera Company. Big powerful change. Wet bright bills for next week. Fun on the Bristol. Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety. Have to stand a drink or two. As broad as it's long.\n\nHe's coming in the afternoon. Her songs.\n\nPlasto's. Sir Philip Crampton's memorial fountain bust. Who was he?\n\n\u2014How do you do? Martin Cunningham said, raising his palm to his brow in salute.\n\n\u2014He doesn't see us, Mr Power said. Yes, he does. How do you do?\n\n\u2014Who? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\n\u2014Blazes Boylan, Mr Power said. There he is airing his quiff.\n\nJust that moment I was thinking.\n\nMr Dedalus bent across to salute. From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply: spruce figure: passed.\n\nMr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand, then those of his right hand. The nails, yes. Is there anything more in him that they she sees? Fascination. Worst man in Dublin. That keeps him alive. They sometimes feel what a person is. Instinct. But a type like that. My nails. I am just looking at them: well pared. And after: thinking alone. Body getting a bit softy. I would notice that: from remembering. What causes that? I suppose the skin can't contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off. But the shape is there. The shape is there still. Shoulders. Hips. Plump. Night of the dance dressing. Shift stuck between the cheeks behind.\n\nHe clasped his hands between his knees and, satisfied, sent his vacant glance over their faces.\n\nMr Power asked:\n\n\u2014How is the concert tour getting on, Bloom?\n\n\u2014O, very well, Mr Bloom said. I hear great accounts of it. It's a good idea, you see...\n\n\u2014Are you going yourself?\n\n\u2014Well no, Mr Bloom said. In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business. You see the idea is to tour the chief towns. What you lose on one you can make up on the other.\n\n\u2014Quite so, Martin Cunningham said. Mary Anderson is up there now.\n\nHave you good artists?\n\n\u2014Louis Werner is touring her, Mr Bloom said. O yes, we'll have all topnobbers. J. C. Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and. The best, in fact.\n\n\u2014And Madame, Mr Power said smiling. Last but not least.\n\nMr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them. Smith O'Brien. Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there. Woman. Must be his deathday. For many happy returns. The carriage wheeling by Farrell's statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees.\n\nOot: a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares, his mouth opening: oot.\n\n\u2014Four bootlaces for a penny.\n\nWonder why he was struck off the rolls. Had his office in Hume street. Same house as Molly's namesake, Tweedy, crown solicitor for Waterford. Has that silk hat ever since. Relics of old decency. Mourning too. Terrible comedown, poor wretch! Kicked about like snuff at a wake. O'Callaghan on his last legs.\n\nAnd Madame. Twenty past eleven. Up. Mrs Fleming is in to clean. Doing her hair, humming. voglio e non vorrei. No. vorrei e non. Looking at the tips of her hairs to see if they are split. Mi trema un poco il. Beautiful on that tre her voice is: weeping tone. A thrush. A throstle. There is a word throstle that expresses that.\n\nHis eyes passed lightly over Mr Power's goodlooking face. Greyish over the ears. Madame: smiling. I smiled back. A smile goes a long way. Only politeness perhaps. Nice fellow. Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps? Not pleasant for the wife. Yet they say, who was it told me, there is no carnal. You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick. Yes, it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak. What is this she was? Barmaid in Jury's. Or the Moira, was it?\n\nThey passed under the hugecloaked Liberator's form.\n\nMartin Cunningham nudged Mr Power.\n\n\u2014Of the tribe of Reuben, he said.\n\nA tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner of Elvery's Elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.\n\n\u2014In all his pristine beauty, Mr Power said.\n\nMr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:\n\n\u2014The devil break the hasp of your back!\n\nMr Power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray's statue.\n\n\u2014We have all been there, Martin Cunningham said broadly.\n\nHis eyes met Mr Bloom's eyes. He caressed his beard, adding:\n\n\u2014Well, nearly all of us.\n\nMr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions' faces.\n\n\u2014That's an awfully good one that's going the rounds about Reuben J and the son.\n\n\u2014About the boatman? Mr Power asked.\n\n\u2014Yes. Isn't it awfully good?\n\n\u2014What is that? Mr Dedalus asked. I didn't hear it.\n\n\u2014There was a girl in the case, Mr Bloom began, and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm's way but when they were both ...\n\n\u2014What? Mr Dedalus asked. That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it?\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown...\n\n\u2014Drown Barabbas! Mr Dedalus cried. I wish to Christ he did!\n\nMr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom said, the son himself...\n\nMartin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:\n\n\u2014Reuben and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey.\n\n\u2014For God's sake! Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright. Is he dead?\n\n\u2014Dead! Martin Cunningham cried. Not he! A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive. Half the town was there.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said. But the funny part is...\n\n\u2014And Reuben J, Martin Cunningham said, gave the boatman a florin for saving his son's life.\n\nA stifled sigh came from under Mr Power's hand.\n\n\u2014O, he did, Martin Cunningham affirmed. Like a hero. A silver florin.\n\n\u2014Isn't it awfully good? Mr Bloom said eagerly.\n\n\u2014One and eightpence too much, Mr Dedalus said drily.\n\nMr Power's choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.\n\nNelson's pillar.\n\n\u2014Eight plums a penny! Eight for a penny!\n\n\u2014We had better look a little serious, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nMr Dedalus sighed.\n\n\u2014Ah then indeed, he said, poor little Paddy wouldn't grudge us a laugh. Many a good one he told himself.\n\n\u2014The Lord forgive me! Mr Power said, wiping his wet eyes with his fingers. Poor Paddy! I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I'd be driving after him like this. He's gone from us.\n\n\u2014As decent a little man as ever wore a hat, Mr Dedalus said. He went very suddenly.\n\n\u2014Breakdown, Martin Cunningham said. Heart.\n\nHe tapped his chest sadly.\n\nBlazing face: redhot. Too much John Barleycorn. Cure for a red nose. Drink like the devil till it turns adelite. A lot of money he spent colouring it.\n\nMr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension.\n\n\u2014He had a sudden death, poor fellow, he said.\n\n\u2014The best death, Mr Bloom said.\n\nTheir wide open eyes looked at him.\n\n\u2014No suffering, he said. A moment and all is over. Like dying in sleep.\n\nNo-one spoke.\n\nDead side of the street this. Dull business by day, land agents, temperance hotel, Falconer's railway guide, civil service college, Gill's, catholic club, the industrious blind. Why? Some reason. Sun or wind. At night too. Chummies and slaveys. Under the patronage of the late Father Mathew. Foundation stone for Parnell. Breakdown. Heart.\n\nWhite horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner, galloping. A tiny coffin flashed by. In a hurry to bury. A mourning coach. Unmarried. Black for the married. Piebald for bachelors. Dun for a nun.\n\n\u2014Sad, Martin Cunningham said. A child.\n\nA dwarf's face, mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy's was. Dwarf's body, weak as putty, in a whitelined deal box. Burial friendly society pays. Penny a week for a sod of turf. Our. Little. Beggar. Baby. Meant nothing. Mistake of nature. If it's healthy it's from the mother. If not from the man. Better luck next time.\n\n\u2014Poor little thing, Mr Dedalus said. It's well out of it.\n\nThe carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square. Rattle his bones. Over the stones. Only a pauper. Nobody owns.\n\n\u2014In the midst of life, Martin Cunningham said.\n\n\u2014But the worst of all, Mr Power said, is the man who takes his own life.\n\nMartin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly, coughed and put it back.\n\n\u2014The greatest disgrace to have in the family, Mr Power added.\n\n\u2014Temporary insanity, of course, Martin Cunningham said decisively. We must take a charitable view of it.\n\n\u2014They say a man who does it is a coward, Mr Dedalus said.\n\n\u2014It is not for us to judge, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nMr Bloom, about to speak, closed his lips again. Martin Cunningham's large eyes. Looking away now. Sympathetic human man he is. Intelligent. Like Shakespeare's face. Always a good word to say. They have no mercy on that here or infanticide. Refuse christian burial. They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave. As if it wasn't broken already. Yet sometimes they repent too late. Found in the riverbed clutching rushes. He looked at me. And that awful drunkard of a wife of his. Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost. Leading him the life of the damned. Wear the heart out of a stone, that. Monday morning. Start afresh. Shoulder to the wheel. Lord, she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there. Drunk about the place and capering with Martin's umbrella.\n\nAnd they call me the jewel of Asia,\nOf Asia,\nThe Geisha.\n\nHe looked away from me. He knows. Rattle his bones.\n\nThat afternoon of the inquest. The redlabelled bottle on the table. The room in the hotel with hunting pictures. Stuffy it was. Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind. The coroner's sunlit ears, big and hairy. Boots giving evidence. Thought he was asleep first. Then saw like yellow streaks on his face. Had slipped down to the foot of the bed. Verdict: overdose. Death by misadventure. The letter. For my son Leopold.\n\nNo more pain. Wake no more. Nobody owns.\n\nThe carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street. Over the stones.\n\n\u2014We are going the pace, I think, Martin Cunningham said.\n\n\u2014God grant he doesn't upset us on the road, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014I hope not, Martin Cunningham said. That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany. The Gordon Bennett.\n\n\u2014Yes, by Jove, Mr Dedalus said. That will be worth seeing, faith.\n\nAs they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls. Has anybody here seen Kelly? Kay ee double ell wy. Dead March from Saul. He's as bad as old Antonio. He left me on my ownio. Pirouette! The Mater Misericordiae. Eccles street. My house down there. Big place. Ward for incurables there. Very encouraging. Our Lady's Hospice for the dying. Deadhouse handy underneath. Where old Mrs Riordan died. They look terrible the women. Her feeding cup and rubbing her mouth with the spoon. Then the screen round her bed for her to die. Nice young student that was dressed that bite the bee gave me. He's gone over to the lying-in hospital they told me. From one extreme to the other. The carriage galloped round a corner: stopped.\n\n\u2014What's wrong now?\n\nA divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows, lowing, slouching by on padded hoofs, whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups. Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear.\n\n\u2014Emigrants, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014Huuuh! the drover's voice cried, his switch sounding on their flanks.\n\nHuuuh! out of that!\n\nThursday, of course. Tomorrow is killing day. Springers. Cuffe sold them about twentyseven quid each. For Liverpool probably. Roastbeef for old England. They buy up all the juicy ones. And then the fifth quarter lost: all that raw stuff, hide, hair, horns. Comes to a big thing in a year. Dead meat trade. Byproducts of the slaughterhouses for tanneries, soap, margarine. Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla.\n\nThe carriage moved on through the drove.\n\n\u2014I can't make out why the corporation doesn't run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays, Mr Bloom said. All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats.\n\n\u2014Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare, Martin Cunningham said. Quite right. They ought to.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom said, and another thing I often thought, is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan, you know. Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams, hearse and carriage and all. Don't you see what I mean?\n\n\u2014O, that be damned for a story, Mr Dedalus said. Pullman car and saloon diningroom.\n\n\u2014A poor lookout for Corny, Mr Power added.\n\n\u2014Why? Mr Bloom asked, turning to Mr Dedalus. Wouldn't it be more decent than galloping two abreast?\n\n\u2014Well, there's something in that, Mr Dedalus granted.\n\n\u2014And, Martin Cunningham said, we wouldn't have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy's and upset the coffin on to the road.\n\n\u2014That was terrible, Mr Power's shocked face said, and the corpse fell about the road. Terrible!\n\n\u2014First round Dunphy's, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Gordon Bennett cup.\n\n\u2014Praises be to God! Martin Cunningham said piously.\n\nBom! Upset. A coffin bumped out on to the road. Burst open. Paddy Dignam shot out and rolling over stiff in the dust in a brown habit too large for him. Red face: grey now. Mouth fallen open. Asking what's up now. Quite right to close it. Looks horrid open. Then the insides decompose quickly. Much better to close up all the orifices. Yes, also. With wax. The sphincter loose. Seal up all.\n\n\u2014Dunphy's, Mr Power announced as the carriage turned right.\n\nDunphy's corner. Mourning coaches drawn up, drowning their grief. A pause by the wayside. Tiptop position for a pub. Expect we'll pull up here on the way back to drink his health. Pass round the consolation. Elixir of life.\n\nBut suppose now it did happen. Would he bleed if a nail say cut him in the knocking about? He would and he wouldn't, I suppose. Depends on where. The circulation stops. Still some might ooze out of an artery. It would be better to bury them in red: a dark red.\n\nIn silence they drove along Phibsborough road. An empty hearse trotted by, coming from the cemetery: looks relieved.\nCrossguns bridge: the royal canal.\n\nWater rushed roaring through the sluices. A man stood on his dropping barge, between clamps of turf. On the towpath by the lock a slacktethered horse. Aboard of the Bugabu.\n\nTheir eyes watched him. On the slow weedy waterway he had floated on his raft coastward over Ireland drawn by a haulage rope past beds of reeds, over slime, mudchoked bottles, carrion dogs. Athlone, Mullingar, Moyvalley, I could make a walking tour to see Milly by the canal. Or cycle down. Hire some old crock, safety. Wren had one the other day at the auction but a lady's. Developing waterways. James M'Cann's hobby to row me o'er the ferry. Cheaper transit. By easy stages. Houseboats. Camping out. Also hearses. To heaven by water. Perhaps I will without writing. Come as a surprise, Leixlip, Clonsilla. Dropping down lock by lock to Dublin. With turf from the midland bogs. Salute. He lifted his brown straw hat, saluting Paddy Dignam.\n\nThey drove on past Brian Boroimhe house. Near it now.\n\n\u2014I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014Better ask Tom Kernan, Mr Dedalus said.\n\n\u2014How is that? Martin Cunningham said. Left him weeping, I suppose?\n\n\u2014Though lost to sight, Mr Dedalus said, to memory dear.\n\nThe carriage steered left for Finglas road.\n\nThe stonecutter's yard on the right. Last lap. Crowded on the spit of land silent shapes appeared, white, sorrowful, holding out calm hands, knelt in grief, pointing. Fragments of shapes, hewn. In white silence: appealing. The best obtainable. Thos. H. Dennany, monumental builder and sculptor.\n\nPassed.\n\nOn the curbstone before Jimmy Geary, the sexton's, an old tramp sat, grumbling, emptying the dirt and stones out of his huge dustbrown yawning boot. After life's journey.\n\nGloomy gardens then went by: one by one: gloomy houses.\n\nMr Power pointed.\n\n\u2014That is where Childs was murdered, he said. The last house.\n\n\u2014So it is, Mr Dedalus said. A gruesome case. Seymour Bushe got him off. Murdered his brother. Or so they said.\n\n\u2014The crown had no evidence, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014Only circumstantial, Martin Cunningham added. That's the maxim of the law. Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned.\n\nThey looked. Murderer's ground. It passed darkly. Shuttered, tenantless, unweeded garden. Whole place gone to hell. Wrongfully condemned. Murder. The murderer's image in the eye of the murdered. They love reading about it. Man's head found in a garden. Her clothing consisted of. How she met her death. Recent outrage. The weapon used. Murderer is still at large. Clues. A shoelace. The body to be exhumed. Murder will out.\n\nCramped in this carriage. She mightn't like me to come that way without letting her know. Must be careful about women. Catch them once with their pants down. Never forgive you after. Fifteen.\n\nThe high railings of Prospect rippled past their gaze. Dark poplars, rare white forms. Forms more frequent, white shapes thronged amid the trees, white forms and fragments streaming by mutely, sustaining vain gestures on the air.\n\nThe felly harshed against the curbstone: stopped. Martin Cunningham put out his arm and, wrenching back the handle, shoved the door open with his knee. He stepped out. Mr Power and Mr Dedalus followed.\n\nChange that soap now. Mr Bloom's hand unbuttoned his hip pocket swiftly and transferred the paperstuck soap to his inner handkerchief pocket. He stepped out of the carriage, replacing the newspaper his other hand still held.\n\nPaltry funeral: coach and three carriages. It's all the same. Pallbearers, gold reins, requiem mass, firing a volley. Pomp of death. Beyond the hind carriage a hawker stood by his barrow of cakes and fruit. Simnel cakes those are, stuck together: cakes for the dead. Dogbiscuits. Who ate them? Mourners coming out.\n\nHe followed his companions. Mr Kernan and Ned Lambert followed, Hynes walking after them. Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths. He handed one to the boy.\n\nWhere is that child's funeral disappeared to?\n\nA team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread, dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block. The waggoner marching at their head saluted.\n\nCoffin now. Got here before us, dead as he is. Horse looking round at it with his plume skeowways. Dull eye: collar tight on his neck, pressing on a bloodvessel or something. Do they know what they cart out here every day? Must be twenty or thirty funerals every day. Then Mount Jerome for the protestants. Funerals all over the world everywhere every minute. Shovelling them under by the cartload doublequick. Thousands every hour. Too many in the world.\n\nMourners came out through the gates: woman and a girl. Leanjawed harpy, hard woman at a bargain, her bonnet awry. Girl's face stained with dirt and tears, holding the woman's arm, looking up at her for a sign to cry. Fish's face, bloodless and livid.\n\nThe mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates. So much dead weight. Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath. First the stiff: then the friends of the stiff. Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths. Who is that beside them? Ah, the brother-in-law.\n\nAll walked after.\n\nMartin Cunningham whispered:\n\n\u2014I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom.\n\n\u2014What? Mr Power whispered. How so?\n\n\u2014His father poisoned himself, Martin Cunningham whispered. Had the Queen's hotel in Ennis. You heard him say he was going to Clare. Anniversary.\n\n\u2014O God! Mr Power whispered. First I heard of it. Poisoned himself?\n\nHe glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal's mausoleum. Speaking.\n\n\u2014Was he insured? Mr Bloom asked.\n\n\u2014I believe so, Mr Kernan answered. But the policy was heavily mortgaged. Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane.\n\n\u2014How many children did he leave?\n\n\u2014Five. Ned Lambert says he'll try to get one of the girls into Todd's.\n\n\u2014A sad case, Mr Bloom said gently. Five young children.\n\n\u2014A great blow to the poor wife, Mr Kernan added.\n\n\u2014Indeed yes, Mr Bloom agreed.\n\nHas the laugh at him now.\n\nHe looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished. She had outlived him. Lost her husband. More dead for her than for me. One must outlive the other. Wise men say. There are more women than men in the world. Condole with her. Your terrible loss. I hope you'll soon follow him. For Hindu widows only. She would marry another. Him? No. Yet who knows after. Widowhood not the thing since the old queen died. Drawn on a guncarriage. Victoria and Albert. Frogmore memorial mourning. But in the end she put a few violets in her bonnet. Vain in her heart of hearts. All for a shadow. Consort not even a king. Her son was the substance. Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back, waiting. It never comes. One must go first: alone, under the ground: and lie no more in her warm bed.\n\n\u2014How are you, Simon? Ned Lambert said softly, clasping hands. Haven't seen you for a month of Sundays.\n\n\u2014Never better. How are all in Cork's own town?\n\n\u2014I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday, Ned Lambert said. Same old six and eightpence. Stopped with Dick Tivy.\n\n\u2014And how is Dick, the solid man?\n\n\u2014Nothing between himself and heaven, Ned Lambert answered.\n\n\u2014By the holy Paul! Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder. Dick Tivy bald?\n\n\u2014Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters, Ned Lambert said, pointing ahead. A few bob a skull. Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up.\n\n\u2014Yes, yes, Mr Dedalus said dubiously. Is that the eldest boy in front?\n\n\u2014Yes, Ned Lambert said, with the wife's brother. John Henry Menton is behind. He put down his name for a quid.\n\n\u2014I'll engage he did, Mr Dedalus said. I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job. John Henry is not the worst in the world.\n\n\u2014How did he lose it? Ned Lambert asked. Liquor, what?\n\n\u2014Many a good man's fault, Mr Dedalus said with a sigh.\n\nThey halted about the door of the mortuary chapel. Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar. Poor boy! Was he there when the father? Both unconscious. Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time. All he might have done. I owe three shillings to O'Grady. Would he understand? The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel. Which end is his head?\n\nAfter a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened light. The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow candles at its corners. Always in front of us. Corny Kelleher, laying a wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks. Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.\n\nA server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door. The whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole with one hand, balancing with the other a little book against his toad's belly. Who'll read the book? I, said the rook.\n\nThey halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak.\n\nFather Coffey. I knew his name was like a coffin. Domine-namine. Bully about the muzzle he looks. Bosses the show. Muscular christian. Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him: priest. Thou art Peter. Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will. With a belly on him like a poisoned pup. Most amusing expressions that man finds. Hhhn: burst sideways.\n\n\u2014Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine.\n\nMakes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin. Requiem mass. Crape weepers. Blackedged notepaper. Your name on the altarlist. Chilly place this. Want to feed well, sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please. Eyes of a toad too. What swells him up that way? Molly gets swelled after cabbage. Air of the place maybe. Looks full up of bad gas. Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place. Butchers, for instance: they get like raw beefsteaks. Who was telling me? Mervyn Browne. Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh's lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it. Out it rushes: blue. One whiff of that and you're a goner.\n\nMy kneecap is hurting me. Ow. That's better.\n\nThe priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy's bucket and shook it over the coffin. Then he walked to the other end and shook it again. Then he came back and put it back in the bucket. As you were before you rested. It's all written down: he has to do it.\n\n\u2014Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.\n\nThe server piped the answers in the treble. I often thought it would be better to have boy servants. Up to fifteen or so. After that, of course ...\n\nHoly water that was, I expect. Shaking sleep out of it. He must be fed up with that job, shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up. What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over. Every mortal day a fresh batch: middleaged men, old women, children, women dead in childbirth, men with beards, baldheaded businessmen, consumptive girls with little sparrows' breasts. All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them: sleep. On Dignam now.\n\n\u2014In paradisum.\n\nSaid he was going to paradise or is in paradise. Says that over everybody. Tiresome kind of a job. But he has to say something.\n\nThe priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket. He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.\n\nThe ree the ra the ree the ra the roo. Lord, I mustn't lilt here.\n\n\u2014The O'Connell circle, Mr Dedalus said about him.\n\nMr Power's soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone.\n\n\u2014He's at rest, he said, in the middle of his people, old Dan O'. But his heart is buried in Rome. How many broken hearts are buried here, Simon!\n\n\u2014Her grave is over there, Jack, Mr Dedalus said. I'll soon be stretched beside her. Let Him take me whenever He likes.\n\nBreaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little in his walk. Mr Power took his arm.\n\n\u2014She's better where she is, he said kindly.\n\n\u2014I suppose so, Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp. I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven.\n\nCorny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by.\n\n\u2014Sad occasions, Mr Kernan began politely.\n\nMr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.\n\n\u2014The others are putting on their hats, Mr Kernan said. I suppose we can do so too. We are the last. This cemetery is a treacherous place.\n\nThey covered their heads.\n\n\u2014The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, don't you think? Mr Kernan said with reproof.\n\nMr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes. Secret eyes, secretsearching. Mason, I think: not sure. Beside him again. We are the last. In the same boat. Hope he'll say something else.\n\nMr Kernan added:\n\n\u2014The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler, more impressive I must say.\n\nMr Bloom gave prudent assent. The language of course was another thing.\n\nMr Kernan said with solemnity:\n\n\u2014I am the resurrection and the life. That touches a man's inmost heart.\n\n\u2014It does, Mr Bloom said.\n\nYour heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies? No touching that. Seat of the affections. Broken heart. A pump after all, pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day. One fine day it gets bunged up: and there you are. Lots of them lying around here: lungs, hearts, livers. Old rusty pumps: damn the thing else. The resurrection and the life. Once you are dead you are dead. That last day idea. Knocking them all up out of their graves. Come forth, Lazarus! And he came fifth and lost the job. Get up! Last day! Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps. Find damn all of himself that morning. Pennyweight of powder in a skull. Twelve grammes one pennyweight. Troy measure.\n\nCorny Kelleher fell into step at their side.\n\n\u2014Everything went off A1, he said. What?\n\nHe looked on them from his drawling eye. Policeman's shoulders. With your tooraloom tooraloom.\n\n\u2014As it should be, Mr Kernan said.\n\n\u2014What? Eh? Corny Kelleher said.\n\nMr Kernan assured him.\n\n\u2014Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan? John Henry Menton asked. I know his face.\n\nNed Lambert glanced back.\n\n\u2014Bloom, he said, Madame Marion Tweedy that was, is, I mean, the soprano. She's his wife.\n\n\u2014O, to be sure, John Henry Menton said. I haven't seen her for some time. He was a finelooking woman. I danced with her, wait, fifteen seventeen golden years ago, at Mat Dillon's in Roundtown. And a good armful she was.\n\nHe looked behind through the others.\n\n\u2014What is he? he asked. What does he do? Wasn't he in the stationery line? I fell foul of him one evening, I remember, at bowls.\n\nNed Lambert smiled.\n\n\u2014Yes, he was, he said, in Wisdom Hely's. A traveller for blottingpaper.\n\n\u2014In God's name, John Henry Menton said, what did she marry a coon like that for? She had plenty of game in her then.\n\n\u2014Has still, Ned Lambert said. He does some canvassing for ads.\n\nJohn Henry Menton's large eyes stared ahead.\n\nThe barrow turned into a side lane. A portly man, ambushed among the grasses, raised his hat in homage. The gravediggers touched their caps.\n\n\u2014John O'Connell, Mr Power said pleased. He never forgets a friend.\n\nMr O'Connell shook all their hands in silence. Mr Dedalus said:\n\n\u2014I am come to pay you another visit.\n\n\u2014My dear Simon, the caretaker answered in a low voice. I don't want your custom at all.\n\nSaluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham's side puzzling two long keys at his back.\n\n\u2014Did you hear that one, he asked them, about Mulcahy from the Coombe?\n\n\u2014I did not, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nThey bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear. The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.\n\n\u2014They tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried. After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. One of the drunks spelt out the name: Terence Mulcahy. The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up.\n\nThe caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. He resumed:\n\n\u2014And, after blinking up at the sacred figure, Not a bloody bit like the man, says he. That's not Mulcahy, says he, whoever done it.\n\nRewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher, accepting the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.\n\n\u2014That's all done with a purpose, Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes.\n\n\u2014I know, Hynes said. I know that.\n\n\u2014To cheer a fellow up, Martin Cunningham said. It's pure goodheartedness: damn the thing else.\n\nMr Bloom admired the caretaker's prosperous bulk. All want to be on good terms with him. Decent fellow, John O'Connell, real good sort. Keys: like Keyes's ad: no fear of anyone getting out. No passout checks. Habeas corpus. I must see about that ad after the funeral. Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha? Hope it's not chucked in the dead letter office. Be the better of a shave. Grey sprouting beard. That's the first sign when the hairs come out grey. And temper getting cross. Silver threads among the grey. Fancy being his wife. Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl. Come out and live in the graveyard. Dangle that before her. It might thrill her first. Courting death... Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about. The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O'Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark. Will o' the wisp. Gas of graves. Want to keep her mind off it to conceive at all. Women especially are so touchy. Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep. Have you ever seen a ghost? Well, I have. It was a pitchdark night. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. Still they'd kiss all right if properly keyed up. Whores in Turkish graveyards. Learn anything if taken young. You might pick up a young widow here. Men like that. Love among the tombstones. Romeo. Spice of pleasure. In the midst of death we are in life. Both ends meet. Tantalising for the poor dead. Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving. Gnawing their vitals. Desire to grig people. Molly wanting to do it at the window. Eight children he has anyway.\n\nHe has seen a fair share go under in his time, lying around him field after field. Holy fields. More room if they buried them standing. Sitting or kneeling you couldn't. Standing? His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing. All honeycombed the ground must be: oblong cells. And very neat he keeps it too: trim grass and edgings. His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome. Well, so it is. Ought to be flowers of sleep. Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me. The Botanic Gardens are just over there. It's the blood sinking in the earth gives new life. Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy. Every man his price. Well preserved fat corpse, gentleman, epicure, invaluable for fruit garden. A bargain. By carcass of William Wilkinson, auditor and accountant, lately deceased, three pounds thirteen and six. With thanks.\n\nI daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure, bones, flesh, nails. Charnelhouses. Dreadful. Turning green and pink decomposing. Rot quick in damp earth. The lean old ones tougher. Then a kind of a tallowy kind of a cheesy. Then begin to get black, black treacle oozing out of them. Then dried up. Deathmoths. Of course the cells or whatever they are go on living. Changing about. Live for ever practically. Nothing to feed on feed on themselves.\n\nBut they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots. Soil must be simply swirling with them. Your head it simply swurls. Those pretty little seaside gurls. He looks cheerful enough over it. Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first. Wonder how he looks at life. Cracking his jokes too: warms the cockles of his heart. The one about the bulletin. Spurgeon went to heaven 4 a.m. this morning. 11 p.m. (closing time). Not arrived yet. Peter. The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what's in fashion. A juicy pear or ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. Keep out the damp. You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way. Gravediggers in Hamlet. Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart. Daren't joke about the dead for two years at least. De mortuis nil nisi prius. Go out of mourning first. Hard to imagine his funeral. Seems a sort of a joke. Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer. Gives you second wind. New lease of life.\n\n\u2014How many have-you for tomorrow? the caretaker asked.\n\n\u2014Two, Corny Kelleher said. Half ten and eleven.\n\nThe caretaker put the papers in his pocket. The barrow had ceased to trundle. The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping with care round the graves. The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.\n\nBurying him. We come to bury Caesar. His ides of March or June. He doesn't know who is here nor care. Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh? Now who is he I'd like to know? Now I'd give a trifle to know who he is. Always someone turns up you never dreamt of. A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life. Yes, he could. Still he'd have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave. We all do. Only man buries. No, ants too. First thing strikes anybody. Bury the dead. Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life. Well then Friday buried him. Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it.\nO, poor Robinson Crusoe!\nHow could you possibly do so?\n\nPoor Dignam! His last lie on the earth in his box. When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood. All gnawed through. They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding, let it down that way. Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow's. They're so particular. Lay me in my native earth. Bit of clay from the holy land. Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin. I see what it means. I see. To protect him as long as possible even in the earth. The Irishman's house is his coffin. Embalming in catacombs, mummies the same idea.\n\nMr Bloom stood far back, his hat in his hand, counting the bared heads. Twelve. I'm thirteen. No. The chap in the macintosh is thirteen. Death's number. Where the deuce did he pop out of? He wasn't in the chapel, that I'll swear. Silly superstition that about thirteen.\n\nNice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit. Tinge of purple. I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west. Dressy fellow he was once. Used to change three suits in the day. Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias. Hello. It's dyed. His wife I forgot he's not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him.\n\nThe coffin dived out of sight, eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles. They struggled up and out: and all uncovered. Twenty.\n\nPause.\n\nIf we were all suddenly somebody else.\n\nFar away a donkey brayed. Rain. No such ass. Never see a dead one, they say. Shame of death. They hide. Also poor papa went away.\n\nGentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper. Whisper. The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space. Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker. Wellcut frockcoat. Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next. Well, it is a long rest. Feel no more. It's the moment you feel. Must be damned unpleasant. Can't believe it at first. Mistake must be: someone else. Try the house opposite. Wait, I wanted to. I haven't yet. Then darkened deathchamber. Light they want. Whispering around you. Would you like to see a priest? Then rambling and wandering. Delirium all you hid all your life. The death struggle. His sleep is not natural. Press his lower eyelid. Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow. Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he's doomed. Devil in that picture of sinner's death showing him a woman. Dying to embrace her in his shirt. Last act of Lucia. Shall I nevermore behold thee? Bam! He expires. Gone at last. People talk about you a bit: forget you. Don't forget to pray for him. Remember him in your prayers. Even Parnell. Ivy day dying out. Then they follow: dropping into a hole, one after the other.\n\nWe are praying now for the repose of his soul. Hoping you're well and not in hell. Nice change of air. Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory.\n\nDoes he ever think of the hole waiting for himself? They say you do when you shiver in the sun. Someone walking over it. Callboy's warning. Near you. Mine over there towards Finglas, the plot I bought. Mamma, poor mamma, and little Rudy.\n\nThe gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin. Mr Bloom turned away his face. And if he was alive all the time? Whew! By jingo, that would be awful! No, no: he is dead, of course. Of course he is dead. Monday he died. They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole. Flag of distress. Three days. Rather long to keep them in summer. Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there's no.\n\nThe clay fell softer. Begin to be forgotten. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nThe caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat. Had enough of it. The mourners took heart of grace, one by one, covering themselves without show. Mr Bloom put on his hat and saw the portly figure make its way deftly through the maze of graves. Quietly, sure of his ground, he traversed the dismal fields.\n\nHynes jotting down something in his notebook. Ah, the names. But he knows them all. No: coming to me.\n\n\u2014I am just taking the names, Hynes said below his breath. What is your christian name? I'm not sure.\n\n\u2014L, Mr Bloom said. Leopold. And you might put down M'Coy's name too. He asked me to.\n\n\u2014Charley, Hynes said writing. I know. He was on the Freeman once.\n\nSo he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne. Good idea a postmortem for doctors. Find out what they imagine they know. He died of a Tuesday. Got the run. Levanted with the cash of a few ads. Charley, you're my darling. That was why he asked me to. O well, does no harm. I saw to that, M'Coy. Thanks, old chap: much obliged. Leave him under an obligation: costs nothing.\n\n\u2014And tell us, Hynes said, do you know that fellow in the, fellow was over there in the...\n\nHe looked around.\n\n\u2014Macintosh. Yes, I saw him, Mr Bloom said. Where is he now?\n\n\u2014M'Intosh, Hynes said scribbling. I don't know who he is. Is that his name?\n\nHe moved away, looking about him.\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom began, turning and stopping. I say, Hynes!\n\nDidn't hear. What? Where has he disappeared to? Not a sign. Well of all the. Has anybody here seen? Kay ee double ell. Become invisible. Good Lord, what became of him?\n\nA seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade.\n\n\u2014O, excuse me!\n\nHe stepped aside nimbly.\n\nClay, brown, damp, began to be seen in the hole. It rose. Nearly over. A mound of damp clods rose more, rose, and the gravediggers rested their spades. All uncovered again for a few instants. The boy propped his wreath against a corner: the brother-in-law his on a lump. The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow. Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf: clean. One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass. One, leaving his mates, walked slowly on with shouldered weapon, its blade blueglancing. Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband. His navelcord. The brother-in-law, turning away, placed something in his free hand. Thanks in silence. Sorry, sir: trouble. Headshake. I know that. For yourselves just.\n\nThe mourners moved away slowly without aim, by devious paths, staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb.\n\n\u2014Let us go round by the chief's grave, Hynes said. We have time.\n\n\u2014Let us, Mr Power said.\n\nThey turned to the right, following their slow thoughts. With awe Mr Power's blank voice spoke:\n\n\u2014Some say he is not in that grave at all. That the coffin was filled with stones. That one day he will come again.\n\nHynes shook his head.\n\n\u2014Parnell will never come again, he said. He's there, all that was mortal of him. Peace to his ashes.\n\nMr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels, crosses, broken pillars, family vaults, stone hopes praying with upcast eyes, old Ireland's hearts and hands. More sensible to spend the money on some charity for the living. Pray for the repose of the soul of. Does anybody really? Plant him and have done with him. Like down a coalshoot. Then lump them together to save time. All souls' day. Twentyseventh I'll be at his grave. Ten shillings for the gardener. He keeps it free of weeds. Old man himself. Bent down double with his shears clipping. Near death's door. Who passed away. Who departed this life. As if they did it of their own accord. Got the shove, all of them. Who kicked the bucket. More interesting if they told you what they were. So and So, wheelwright. I travelled for cork lino. I paid five shillings in the pound. Or a woman's with her saucepan. I cooked good Irish stew. Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell. Entered into rest the protestants put it. Old Dr Murren's. The great physician called him home. Well it's God's acre for them. Nice country residence. Newly plastered and painted. Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Church Times. Marriage ads they never try to beautify. Rusty wreaths hung on knobs, garlands of bronzefoil. Better value that for the money. Still, the flowers are more poetical. The other gets rather tiresome, never withering. Expresses nothing. Immortelles.\n\nA bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch. Like stuffed. Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us. Hoo! Not a budge out of him. Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him. Dead animal even sadder. Silly-Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox, a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave.\n\nThe Sacred Heart that is: showing it. Heart on his sleeve. Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart. Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that. Seems anything but pleased. Why this infliction? Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy. Apollo that was.\n\nHow many! All these here once walked round Dublin. Faithful departed. As you are now so once were we.\n\nBesides how could you remember everybody? Eyes, walk, voice. Well, the voice, yes: gramophone. Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house. After dinner on a Sunday. Put on poor old greatgrandfather. Kraahraark! Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth. Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face. Otherwise you couldn't remember the face after fifteen years, say. For instance who? For instance some fellow that died when I was in Wisdom Hely's.\n\nRtststr! A rattle of pebbles. Wait. Stop!\n\nHe looked down intently into a stone crypt. Some animal. Wait. There he goes.\n\nAn obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt, moving the pebbles. An old stager: greatgrandfather: he knows the ropes. The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth, wriggled itself in under it. Good hidingplace for treasure.\n\nWho lives there? Are laid the remains of Robert Emery. Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight, wasn't he? Making his rounds.\n\nTail gone now.\n\nOne of those chaps would make short work of a fellow. Pick the bones clean no matter who it was. Ordinary meat for them. A corpse is meat gone bad. Well and what's cheese? Corpse of milk. I read in that Voyages in China that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse. Cremation better. Priests dead against it. Devilling for the other firm. Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers. Time of the plague. Quicklime feverpits to eat them. Lethal chamber. Ashes to ashes. Or bury at sea. Where is that Parsee tower of silence? Eaten by birds. Earth, fire, water. Drowning they say is the pleasantest. See your whole life in a flash. But being brought back to life no. Can't bury in the air however. Out of a flying machine. Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down. Underground communication. We learned that from them. Wouldn't be surprised. Regular square feed for them. Flies come before he's well dead. Got wind of Dignam. They wouldn't care about the smell of it. Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse: smell, taste like raw white turnips.\n\nThe gates glimmered in front: still open. Back to the world again. Enough of this place. Brings you a bit nearer every time. Last time I was here was Mrs Sinico's funeral. Poor papa too. The love that kills. And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores. Give you the creeps after a bit. I will appear to you after death. You will see my ghost after death. My ghost will haunt you after death. There is another world after death named hell. I do not like that other world she wrote. No more do I. Plenty to see and hear and feel yet. Feel live warm beings near you. Let them sleep in their maggoty beds. They are not going to get me this innings. Warm beds: warm fullblooded life.\n\nMartin Cunningham emerged from a sidepath, talking gravely.\n\nSolicitor, I think. I know his face. Menton, John Henry, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits. Dignam used to be in his office. Mat Dillon's long ago. Jolly Mat. Convivial evenings. Cold fowl, cigars, the Tantalus glasses. Heart of gold really. Yes, Menton. Got his rag out that evening on the bowlinggreen because I sailed inside him. Pure fluke of mine: the bias. Why he took such a rooted dislike to me. Hate at first sight. Molly and Floey Dillon linked under the lilactree, laughing. Fellow always like that, mortified if women are by.\n\nGot a dinge in the side of his hat. Carriage probably.\n\n\u2014Excuse me, sir, Mr Bloom said beside them.\n\nThey stopped.\n\n\u2014Your hat is a little crushed, Mr Bloom said pointing.\n\nJohn Henry Menton stared at him for an instant without moving.\n\n\u2014There, Martin Cunningham helped, pointing also. John Henry Menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed the nap with care on his coatsleeve. He clapped the hat on his head again.\n\n\u2014It's all right now, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nJohn Henry Menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.\n\n\u2014Thank you, he said shortly.\n\nThey walked on towards the gates. Mr Bloom, chapfallen, drew behind a few paces so as not to overhear. Martin laying down the law. Martin could wind a sappyhead like that round his little finger, without his seeing it.\n\nOyster eyes. Never mind. Be sorry after perhaps when it dawns on him. Get the pull over him that way.\n\nThank you.

guys\n\nIf you'll wear this ring for me\nThen we'll go steadily\nAs the year draws to an end\nI'll be wearing your fraternity pin\nThen one day when we're out of school\nAnd our campus days are through\nWe'll be making all our future plans\nTo be wearing matching wedding bands\nI'm glad that I saw you our first day back at school\n\nIf you'll wear this ring for me\nThen we'll go steadily\nAs the year draws to an end\nI'll be wearing your fraternity pin\nThen one day when we're out of school\nAnd our campus days are through\nWe'll be making all our future plans\nTo be wearing matching

Ritter von Leopold Sacher-Masoch\n\nTranslator: Fernanda Savage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVENUS IN FURS\n\n\nOf this book, intended for\nprivate circulation, only\n1225 copies have been\nprinted, and type afterward\ndistributed.\n\n\n\n\nVENUS IN FURS\n\nBy\n\nLEOPOLD VON SACHER-MASOCH\n\n\nTranslated from the German\n\nBy\n\nFERNANDA SAVAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n_\"But the Almighty Lord hath struck him,\nand hath delivered him into the hands of\na woman.\"_\n\n--The Vulgate, Judith, xvi. 7.\n\n\nMy company was charming.\n\nOpposite me by the massive Renaissance fireplace sat Venus; she was not a casual woman of the half-world, who under this pseudonym wages war against the enemy sex, like Mademoiselle Cleopatra, but the real, true goddess of love.\n\nShe sat in an armchair and had kindled a crackling fire, whose\nreflection ran in red flames over her pale face with its white eyes, and from time to time over her feet when she sought to warm them.\n\nHer head was wonderful in spite of the dead stony eyes; it was all I could see of her. She had wrapped her marble-like body in a huge fur, and rolled herself up trembling like a cat.\n\n\"I don't understand it,\" I exclaimed, \"It isn't really cold any\nlonger. For two weeks past we have had perfect spring weather. You must be nervous.\"\n\"Much obliged for your spring,\" she replied with a low stony voice, and immediately afterwards sneezed divinely, twice in succession. \"I really can't stand it here much longer, and I am beginning to understand--\"\n\n\"What, dear lady?\"\n\n\"I am beginning to believe the unbelievable and to understand the un-understandable. All of a sudden I understand the Germanic virtue of woman, and German philosophy, and I am no longer surprised that you of the North do not know how to love, haven't even an idea of what love is.\"\n\n\"But, madame,\" I replied flaring up, \"I surely haven't given you any reason.\"\n\n\"Oh, you--\" The divinity sneezed for the third time, and shrugged her shoulders with inimitable grace. \"That's why I have always been nice to you, and even come to see you now and then, although I catch a cold every time, in spite of all my furs. Do you remember the first time we met?\"\n\n\"How could I forget it,\" I said. \"You wore your abundant hair in\nbrown curls, and you had brown eyes and a red mouth, but I recognized you immediately by the outline of your face and its marble-like pallor--you always wore a violet-blue velvet jacket edged with squirrel-skin.\"\n\n\"You were really in love with the costume, and awfully docile.\"\n\n\"You have taught me what love is. Your serene form of worship let me forget two thousand years.\"\n\n\"And my faithfulness to you was without equal!\"\n\n\"Well, as far as faithfulness goes--\"\n\n\"Ungrateful!\"\n\n\"I will not reproach you with anything. You are a divine woman, but nevertheless a woman, and like every woman cruel in love.\"\n\n\"What you call cruel,\" the goddess of love replied eagerly, \"is\nsimply the element of passion and of natural love, which is woman's nature and makes her give herself where she loves, and makes her love everything, that pleases her.\"\n\n\"Can there be any greater cruelty for a lover than the\nunfaithfulness of the woman he loves?\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" she replied. \"We are faithful as long as we love, but you demand faithfulness of a woman without love, and the giving of herself without enjoyment. Who is cruel there--woman or man? You of\nthe North in general take love too soberly and seriously. You talk\nof duties where there should be only a question of pleasure.\"\n\n\"That is why our emotions are honorable and virtuous, and our\nrelations permanent.\"\n\n\"And yet a restless, always unsatisfied craving for the nudity of\npaganism,\" she interrupted, \"but that love, which is the highest joy,\nwhich is divine simplicity itself, is not for you moderns, you\nchildren of reflection. It works only evil in you. _As soon as you\nwish to be natural, you become common._ To you nature seems something\nhostile; you have made devils out of the smiling gods of Greece, and\nout of me a demon. You can only exorcise and curse me, or slay\nyourselves in bacchantic madness before my altar. And if ever one of\nyou has had the courage to kiss my red mouth, he makes a barefoot\npilgrimage to Rome in penitential robes and expects flowers to grow\nfrom his withered staff, while under my feet roses, violets, and\nmyrtles spring up every hour, but their fragrance does not agree with\nyou. Stay among your northern fogs and Christian incense; let us\npagans remain under the debris, beneath the lava; do not disinter us.\nPompeii was not built for you, nor our villas, our baths, our temples.\nYou do not require gods. We are chilled in your world.\"\n\nThe beautiful marble woman coughed, and drew the dark sables still\ncloser about her shoulders.\n\n\"Much obliged for the classical lesson,\" I replied, \"but you cannot\ndeny, that man and woman are mortal enemies, in your serene sunlit\nworld as well as in our foggy one. In love there is union into a\nsingle being for a short time only, capable of only one thought, one\nsensation, one will, in order to be then further disunited. And you\nknow this better than I; whichever of the two fails to subjugate will\nsoon feel the feet of the other on his neck--\"\n\n\"And as a rule the man that of the woman,\" cried Madame Venus with\nproud mockery, \"which you know better than I.\"\n\n\"Of course, and that is why I don't have any illusions.\"\n\n\"You mean you are now my slave without illusions, and for that\nreason you shall feel the weight of my foot without mercy.\"\n\n\"Madame!\"\n\n\"Don't you know me yet? Yes, I am _cruel_--since you take so much\ndelight in that word-and am I not entitled to be so? Man is the one\nwho desires, woman the one who is desired. This is woman's entire but\ndecisive advantage. Through his passion nature has given man into\nwoman's hands, and the woman who does not know how to make him her\nsubject, her slave, her toy, and how to betray him with a smile in the\nend is not wise.\"\n\n\"Exactly your principles,\" I interrupted angrily.\n\n\"They are based on the experience of thousands of years,\" she\nreplied ironically, while her white fingers played over the dark fur.\n\"The more devoted a woman shows herself, the sooner the man sobers\ndown and becomes domineering. The more cruelly she treats him and the\nmore faithless she is, the worse she uses him, the more wantonly she\nplays with him, the less pity she shows him, by so much the more will\nshe increase his desire, be loved, worshipped by him. So it has\nalways been, since the time of Helen and Delilah, down to Catherine\nthe Second and Lola Montez.\"\n\n\"I cannot deny,\" I said, \"that nothing will attract a man more than\nthe picture of a beautiful, passionate, cruel, and despotic woman who\nwantonly changes her favorites without scruple in accordance with her\nwhim--\"\n\n\"And in addition wears furs,\" exclaimed the divinity.\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"I know your predilection.\"\n\n\"Do you know,\" I interrupted, \"that, since we last saw each other,\nyou have grown very coquettish.\"\n\n\"In what way, may I ask?\"\n\n\"In that there is no way of accentuating your white body to greater\nadvantage than by these dark furs, and that--\"\n\nThe divinity laughed.\n\n\"You are dreaming,\" she cried, \"wake up!\" and she clasped my arm\nwith her marble-white hand. \"Do wake up,\" she repeated raucously with\nthe low register of her voice. I opened my eyes with difficulty.\n\nI saw the hand which shook me, and suddenly it was brown as bronze;\nthe voice was the thick alcoholic voice of my cossack servant who\nstood before me at his full height of nearly six feet.\n\n\"Do get up,\" continued the good fellow, \"it is really disgraceful.\"\n\n\"What is disgraceful?\"\n\n\"To fall asleep in your clothes and with a book besides.\" He snuffed\nthe candles which had burned down, and picked up the volume which had\nfallen from my hand, \"with a book by\"--he looked at the title page--\n\"by Hegel. Besides it is high time you were starting for Mr.\nSeverin's who is expecting us for tea.\"\n\n\"A curious dream,\" said Severin when I had finished. He supported\nhis arms on his knees, resting his face in his delicate, finely\nveined hands, and fell to pondering.\n\nI knew that he wouldn't move for a long time, hardly even breathe. This\nactually happened, but I didn't consider his behavior as in any way\nremarkable. I had been on terms of close friendship with him for nearly\nthree years, and gotten used to his peculiarities. For it cannot be\ndenied that he was peculiar, although he wasn't quite the dangerous\nmadman that the neighborhood, or indeed the entire district of Kolomea,\nconsidered him to be. I found his personality not only interesting--and\nthat is why many also regarded me a bit mad--but to a degree\nsympathetic. For a Galician nobleman and land-owner, and considering his\nage--he was hardly over thirty--he displayed surprising sobriety, a\ncertain seriousness, even pedantry. He lived according to a minutely\nelaborated, half-philosophical, half-practical system, like clock-work;\nnot this alone, but also by the thermometer, barometer, aerometer,\nhydrometer, Hippocrates, Hufeland, Plato, Kant, Knigge, and Lord\nChesterfield. But at times he had violent attacks of sudden passion, and\ngave the impression of being about to run with his head right through a\nwall. At such times every one preferred to get out of his way.\n\nWhile he remained silent, the fire sang in the chimney and the large\nvenerable samovar sang; and the ancient chair in which I sat rocking\nto and fro smoking my cigar, and the cricket in the old walls sang\ntoo. I let my eyes glide over the curious apparatus, skeletons of\nanimals, stuffed birds, globes, plaster-casts, with which his room\nwas heaped full, until by chance my glance remained fixed on a\npicture which I had seen often enough before. But to-day, under the\nreflected red glow of the fire, it made an indescribable impression\non me.\n\nIt was a large oil painting, done in the robust full-bodied manner\nof the Belgian school. Its subject was strange enough.\n\nA beautiful woman with a radiant smile upon her face, with abundant\nhair tied into a classical knot, on which white powder lay like a\nsoft hoarfrost, was resting on an ottoman, supported on her left arm.\nShe was nude in her dark furs. Her right hand played with a lash,\nwhile her bare foot rested carelessly on a man, lying before her like\na slave, like a dog. In the sharply outlined, but well-formed\nlinaments of this man lay brooding melancholy and passionate\ndevotion; he looked up to her with the ecstatic burning eye of a\nmartyr. This man, the footstool for her feet, was Severin, but\nbeardless, and, it seemed, some ten years younger.\n\n\"_Venus in Furs_,\" I cried, pointing to the picture. \"That is the way\nI saw her in my dream.\"\n\n\"I, too,\" said Severin, \"only I dreamed my dream with open eyes.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\"\n\n\"It is a tiresome story.\"\n\n\"Your picture apparently suggested my dream,\" I continued. \"But do\ntell me what it means. I can imagine that it played a role in your\nlife, and perhaps a very decisive one. But the details I can only get\nfrom you.\"\n\n\"Look at its counterpart,\" replied my strange friend, without\nheeding my question.\n\nThe counterpart was an excellent copy of Titian's well-known \"Venus\nwith the Mirror\" in the Dresden Gallery.\n\n\"And what is the significance?\"\n\nSeverin rose and pointed with his finger at the fur with which\nTitian garbed his goddess of love.\n\n\"It, too, is a 'Venus in Furs,'\" he said with a slight smile. \"I\ndon't believe that the old Venetian had any secondary intention. He\nsimply painted the portrait of some aristocratic Mesalina, and was\ntactful enough to let Cupid hold the mirror in which she tests her\nmajestic allure with cold satisfaction. He looks as though his task\nwere becoming burdensome enough. The picture is painted flattery.\nLater an 'expert' in the Rococo period baptized the lady with the\nname of Venus. The furs of the despot in which Titian's fair model\nwrapped herself, probably more for fear of a cold than out of\nmodesty, have become a symbol of the tyranny and cruelty that\nconstitute woman's essence and her beauty.\n\n\"But enough of that. The picture, as it now exists, is a bitter\nsatire on our love. Venus in this abstract North, in this icy\nChristian world, has to creep into huge black furs so as not to catch\ncold--\"\n\nSeverin laughed, and lighted a fresh cigarette.\n\nJust then the door opened and an attractive, stoutish, blonde girl\nentered. She had wise, kindly eyes, was dressed in black silk, and\nbrought us cold meat and eggs with our tea. Severin took one of the\nlatter, and decapitated it with his knife.\n\n\"Didn't I tell you that I want them soft-boiled?\" he cried with a\nviolence that made the young woman tremble.\n\n\"But my dear Sevtchu--\" she said timidly.\n\n\"Sevtchu, nothing,\" he yelled, \"you are to obey, obey, do you\nunderstand?\" and he tore the _kantchuk_ [Footnote: A long whip with a\nshort handle.] which was hanging beside the weapons from its hook.\n\nThe woman fled from the chamber quickly and timidly like a doe.\n\n\"Just wait, I'll get you yet,\" he called after her.\n\n\"But Severin,\" I said placing my hand on his arm, \"how can you treat\na pretty young woman thus?\"\n\n\"Look at the woman,\" he replied, blinking humorously with his eyes.\n\"Had I flattered her, she would have cast the noose around my neck,\nbut now, when I bring her up with the _kantchuk_, she adores me.\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\"\n\n\"Nonsense, nothing, that is the way you have to break in women.\"\n\n\"Well, if you like it, live like a pasha in your harem, but don't\nlay down theories for me--\"\n\n\"Why not,\" he said animatedly. \"Goethe's 'you must be hammer or anvil'\nis absolutely appropriate to the relation between man and woman.\nDidn't Lady Venus in your dream prove that to you? Woman's power lies\nin man's passion, and she knows how to use it, if man doesn't\nunderstand himself. He has only one choice: to be the _tyrant_ over or\nthe _slave_ of woman. As soon as he gives in, his neck is under the\nyoke, and the lash will soon fall upon him.\"\n\n\"Strange maxims!\"\n\n\"Not maxims, but experiences,\" he replied, nodding his head, \"_I have\nactually felt the lash_. I am cured. Do you care to know how?\"\n\nHe rose, and got a small manuscript from his massive desk, and put\nit in front of me.\n\n\"You have already asked about the picture. I have long owed you an\nexplanation. Here--read!\"\n\nSeverin sat down by the chimney with his back toward me, and seemed\nto dream with open eyes. Silence had fallen again, and again the fire\nsang in the chimney, and the samovar and the cricket in the old\nwalls. I opened the manuscript and read:\n\nCONFESSIONS OF A SUPERSENSUAL MAN.\n\nThe margin of the manuscript bore as motto a variation of the well-known\nlines from _Faust_:\n\n\"Thou supersensual sensual wooer\nA woman leads you by the nose.\"\n--MEPHISTOPHELES.\n\nI turned the title-page and read: \"What follows has been compiled\nfrom my diary of that period, because it is impossible ever frankly\nto write of one's past, but in this way everything retains its fresh\ncolors, the colors of the present.\"\n\nGogol, the Russian Moliere, says--where? well, somewhere--\"the real\ncomic muse is the one under whose laughing mask tears roll down.\"\n\nA wonderful saying.\n\nSo I have a very curious feeling as I am writing all this down. The\natmosphere seems filled with a stimulating fragrance of flowers,\nwhich overcomes me and gives me a headache. The smoke of the\nfireplace curls and condenses into figures, small gray-bearded\nkokolds that mockingly point their finger at me. Chubby-cheeked\ncupids ride on the arms of my chair and on my knees. I have to smile\ninvoluntarily, even laugh aloud, as I am writing down my adventures.\nYet I am not writing with ordinary ink, but with red blood that drips\nfrom my heart. All its wounds long scarred over have opened and it\nthrobs and hurts, and now and then a tear falls on the paper.\n\nThe days creep along sluggishly in the little Carpathian health-resort.\nYou see no one, and no one sees you. It is boring enough to write idyls.\nI would have leisure here to supply a whole gallery of paintings,\nfurnish a theater with new pieces for an entire season, a dozen\nvirtuosos with concertos, trios, and duos, but--what am I saying--the\nupshot of it all is that I don't do much more than to stretch the\ncanvas, smooth the bow, line the scores. For I am--no false modesty,\nFriend Severin; you can lie to others, but you don't quite succeed any\nlonger in lying to yourself--I am nothing but a dilettante, a dilettante\nin painting, in poetry, in music, and several other of the so-called\nunprofitable arts, which, however, at present secure for their masters\nthe income of a cabinet minister, or even that of a minor potentate.\nAbove all else I am a dilettante in life.\n\nUp to the present I have lived as I have painted and written poetry.\nI never got far beyond the preparation, the plan, the first act, the\nfirst stanza. There are people like that who begin everything, and\nnever finish anything. I am such a one.\n\nBut what am I saying?\n\nTo the business in hand.\n\nI lie in my window, and the miserable little town, which fills me\nwith despondency, really seems infinitely full of poetry. How\nwonderful the outlook upon the blue wall of high mountains interwoven\nwith golden sunlight; mountain-torrents weave through them like\nribbons of silver! How clear and blue the heavens into which\nsnowcapped crags project; how green and fresh the forested slopes;\nthe meadows on which small herds graze, down to the yellow billows\nof grain where reapers stand and bend over and rise up again.\n\nThe house in which I live stands in a sort of park, or forest, or\nwilderness, whatever one wants to call it, and is very solitary.\n\nIts sole inhabitants are myself, a widow from Lemberg, and Madame\nTartakovska, who runs the house, a little old woman, who grows older\nand smaller each day. There are also an old dog that limps on one\nleg, and a young cat that continually plays with a ball of yarn. This\nball of yarn, I believe, belongs to the widow.\n\nShe is said to be really beautiful, this widow, still very young,\ntwenty-four at the most, and very rich. She dwells in the first story,\nand I on the ground floor. She always keeps the green blinds drawn, and\nhas a balcony entirely overgrown with green climbing-plants. I for my\npart down below have a comfortable, intimate arbor of honeysuckle, in\nwhich I read and write and paint and sing like a bird among the twigs. I\ncan look up on the balcony. Sometimes I actually do so, and then from\ntime to time a white gown gleams between the dense green network.\n\nReally the beautiful woman up there doesn't interest me very much, for I\nam in love with someone else, and terribly unhappy at that; far more\nunhappy than the Knight of Toggenburg or the Chevalier in Manon\nl'Escault, because the object of my adoration is of stone.\n\nIn the garden, in the tiny wilderness, there is a graceful little\nmeadow on which a couple of deer graze peacefully. On this meadow is\na stone statue of Venus, the original of which, I believe, is in\nFlorence. This Venus is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in\nall my life.\n\nThat, however, does not signify much, for I have seen few beautiful\nwomen, or rather few women at all. In love too, I am a dilettante who\nnever got beyond the preparation, the first act.\n\nBut why talk in superlatives, as if something that is beautiful\ncould be surpassed?\n\nIt is sufficient to say that this Venus is beautiful. I love her\npassionately with a morbid intensity; madly as one can only love a\nwoman who never responds to our love with anything but an eternally\nuniform, eternally calm, stony smile. I literally adore her.\n\nI often lie reading under the leafy covering of a young birch when\nthe sun broods over the forest. Often I visit that cold, cruel\nmistress of mine by night and lie on my knees before her, with the\nface pressed against the cold pedestal on which her feet rest, and\nmy prayers go up to her.\n\nThe rising moon, which just now is waning, produces an indescribable\neffect. It seems to hover among the trees and submerges the meadow\nin its gleam of silver. The goddess stands as if transfigured, and\nseems to bathe in the soft moonlight.\n\nOnce when I was returning from my devotions by one of the walks\nleading to the house, I suddenly saw a woman's figure, white as\nstone, under the illumination of the moon and separated from me\nmerely by a screen of trees. It seemed as if the beautiful woman of\nmarble had taken pity on me, become alive, and followed me. I was\nseized by a nameless fear, my heart threatened to burst, and instead--\n\nWell, I am a dilettante. As always, I broke down at the second\nstanza; rather, on the contrary, I did not break down, but ran away\nas fast as my legs would carry me.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhat an accident! Through a Jew, dealing in photographs I secured a\npicture of my ideal. It is a small reproduction of Titian's \"Venus\nwith the Mirror.\" What a woman! I want to write a poem, but instead,\nI take the reproduction, and write on it: _Venus in Furs_.\n\nYou are cold, while you yourself fan flames. By all means wrap\nyourself in your despotic furs, there is no one to whom they are more\nappropriate, cruel goddess of love and of beauty!--After a while I add\na few verses from Goethe, which I recently found in his paralipomena\nto _Faust_.\n\nTO AMOR\n\n\"The pair of wings a fiction are,\nThe arrows, they are naught but claws,\nThe wreath conceals the little horns,\nFor without any doubt he is\nLike all the gods of ancient Greece\nOnly a devil in disguise.\"\n\nThen I put the picture before me on my table, supporting it with a\nbook, and looked at it.\n\nI was enraptured and at the same time filled with a strange fear by\nthe cold coquetry with which this magnificent woman draped her charms\nin her furs of dark sable; by the severity and hardness which lay in\nthis cold marble-like face. Again I took my pen in hand, and wrote\nthe following words:\n\n\"To love, to be loved, what happiness! And yet how the glamour of\nthis pales in comparison with the tormenting bliss of worshipping a\nwoman who makes a plaything out of us, of being the slave of a\nbeautiful tyrant who treads us pitilessly underfoot. Even Samson, the\nhero, the giant, again put himself into the hands of Delilah, even\nafter she had betrayed him, and again she betrayed him, and the\nPhilistines bound him and put out his eyes which until the very end\nhe kept fixed, drunken with rage and love, upon the beautiful\nbetrayer.\"\n\nI was breakfasting in my honey-suckle arbor, and reading in the Book\nof Judith. I envied the hero Holofernes because of the regal woman\nwho cut off his head with a sword, and because of his beautiful\nsanguinary end.\n\n\"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\nhands of a woman.\"\n\nThis sentence strangely impressed me.\n\nHow ungallant these Jews are, I thought. And their God might choose\nmore becoming expressions when he speaks of the fair sex.\n\n\"The almighty Lord hath struck him, and hath delivered him into the\nhands of a woman,\" I repeated to myself. What shall I do, so that He\nmay punish me?\n\nHeaven preserve us! Here comes the housekeeper, who has again\ndiminished somewhat in size overnight. And up there among the green\ntwinings and garlandings the white gown gleams again. Is it Venus,\nor the widow?\n\nThis time it happens to be the widow, for Madame Tartakovska makes\na courtesy, and asks me in her name for something to read. I run to\nmy room, and gather together a couple of volumes.\n\nLater I remember that my picture of Venus is in one of them, and now\nit and my effusions are in the hands of the white woman up there\ntogether. What will she say?\n\nI hear her laugh.\n\nIs she laughing at me?\n\nIt is full moon. It is already peering over the tops of the low\nhemlocks that fringe the park. A silvery exhalation fills the\nterrace, the groups of trees, all the landscape, as far as the eye\ncan reach; in the distance it gradually fades away, like trembling\nwaters.\n\nI cannot resist. I feel a strange urge and call within me. I put on\nmy clothes again and go out into the garden.\n\nSome power draws me toward the meadow, toward her, who is my\ndivinity and my beloved.\n\nThe night is cool. I feel a slight chill. The atmosphere is heavy\nwith the odor of flowers and of the forest. It intoxicates.\n\nWhat solemnity! What music round about! A nightingale sobs. The\nstars quiver very faintly in the pale-blue glamour. The meadow seems\nsmooth, like a mirror, like a covering of ice on a pond.\n\nThe statue of Venus stands out august and luminous.\n\nBut--what has happened? From the marble shoulders of the goddess a\nlarge dark fur flows down to her heels. I stand dumbfounded and stare\nat her in amazement; again an indescribable fear seizes hold of me\nand I take flight.\n\nI hasten my steps, and notice that I have missed the main path. As\nI am about to turn aside into one of the green walks I see Venus\nsitting before me on a stone bench, not the beautiful woman of\nmarble, but the goddess of love herself with warm blood and throbbing\npulses. She has actually come to life for me, like the statue that\nbegan to breathe for her creator. Indeed, the miracle is only half\ncompleted. Her white hair seems still to be of stone, and her white\ngown shimmers like moonlight, or is it satin? From her shoulders the\ndark fur flows. But her lips are already reddening and her cheeks\nbegin to take color. Two diabolical green rays out of her eyes fall\nupon me, and now she laughs.\n\nHer laughter is very mysterious, very--I don't know. It cannot be\ndescribed, it takes my breath away. I flee further, and after every\nfew steps I have to pause to take breath. The mocking laughter\npursues me through the dark leafy paths, across light open spaces,\nthrough the thicket where only single moonbeams can pierce. I can no\nlonger find my way, I wander about utterly confused, with cold drops\nof perspiration on the forehead.\n\nFinally I stand still, and engage in a short monologue.\n\nIt runs--well--one is either very polite to one's self or very rude.\n\nI say to myself:\n\n\"Donkey!\"\n\nThis word exercises a remarkable effect, like a magic formula, which\nsets me free and makes me master of myself.\n\nI am perfectly quiet in a moment.\n\nWith considerable pleasure I repeat: \"Donkey!\"\n\nNow everything is perfectly clear and distinct before my eyes again.\nThere is the fountain, there the alley of box-wood, there the house\nwhich I am slowly approaching.\n\nYet--suddenly the appearance is here again. Behind the green screen\nthrough which the moonlight gleams so that it seems embroidered with\nsilver, I again see the white figure, the woman of stone whom I\nadore, whom I fear and flee.\n\nWith a couple of leaps I am within the house and catch my breath and\nreflect.\n\nWhat am I really, a little dilettante or a great big donkey?\n\nA sultry morning, the atmosphere is dead, heavily laden with odors,\nyet stimulating. Again I am sitting in my honey-suckle arbor, reading\nin the Odyssey about the beautiful witch who transformed her admirers\ninto beasts. A wonderful picture of antique love.\n\nThere is a soft rustling in the twigs and blades and the pages of my\nbook rustle and on the terrace likewise there is a rustling.\n\nA woman's dress--\n\nShe is there--Venus--but without furs--No, this time it is merely\nthe widow--and yet--Venus-oh, what a woman!\n\nAs she stands there in her light white morning gown, looking at me, her\nslight figure seems full of poetry and grace. She is neither large, nor\nsmall; her head is alluring, piquant--in the sense of the period of the\nFrench marquises--rather than formally beautiful. What enchantment and\nsoftness, what roguish charm play about her none too small mouth! Her\nskin is so infinitely delicate, that the blue veins show through\neverywhere; even through the muslin covering her arms and bosom. How\nabundant her red hair-it is red, not blonde or golden-yellow--how\ndiabolically and yet tenderly it plays around her neck! Now her eyes\nmeet mine like green lightnings--they are green, these eyes of hers,\nwhose power is so indescribable--green, but as are precious stones, or\ndeep unfathomable mountain lakes.\n\nShe observes my confusion, which has even made me discourteous, for I\nhave remained seated and still have my cap on my head.\n\nShe smiles roguishly.\n\nFinally I rise and bow to her. She comes closer, and bursts out into\na loud, almost childlike laughter. I stammer, as only a little\ndilettante or great big donkey can do on such an occasion.\n\nThus our acquaintance began.\n\nThe divinity asks for my name, and mentions her own.\n\nHer name is Wanda von Dunajew.\n\nAnd she is actually my Venus.\n\n\"But madame, what put the idea into your head?\"\n\n\"The little picture in one of your books--\"\n\n\"I had forgotten about it.\"\n\n\"The curious notes on its back--\"\n\n\"Why curious?\"\n\nShe looked at me.\n\n\"I have always wanted to know a real dreamer some time--for the sake\nof the change--and you seem one of the maddest of the tribe.\"\n\n\"Dear lady--in fact--\" Again I fell victim to an odious, asinine\nstammering, and in addition blushed in a way that might have been\nappropriate for a youngster of sixteen, but not for me, who was\nalmost a full ten years older--\n\n\"You were afraid of me last night.\"\n\n\"Really--of course--but won't you sit down?\"\n\nShe sat down, and enjoyed my embarrassment--for actually I was even\nmore afraid of her now in the full light of day. A delightful\nexpression of contempt hovered about her upper lip.\n\n\"You look at love, and especially woman,\" she began, \"as something\nhostile, something against which you put up a defense, even if\nunsuccessfully. You feel that their power over you gives you a\nsensation of pleasurable torture, of pungent cruelty. This is a\ngenuinely modern point of view.\"\n\n\"You don't share it?\"\n\n\"I do not share it,\" she said quickly and decisively, shaking her\nhead, so that her curls flew up like red flames.\n\n\"The ideal which I strive to realize in my life is the serene\nsensuousness of the Greeks--pleasure without pain. I do not believe\nin the kind of love which is preached by Christianity, by the\nmoderns, by the knights of the spirit. Yes, look at me, I am worse\nthan a heretic, I am a pagan.\n\n'Doest thou imagine long the goddess of love took counsel\nWhen in Ida's grove she was pleased with the hero Achilles?'\n\n\"These lines from Goethe's _Roman Elegy_ have always delighted me.\n\n\"In nature there is only the love of the heroic age, 'when gods and\ngoddesses loved.' At that time 'desire followed the glance, enjoyment\ndesire.' All else is factitious, affected, a lie. Christianity, whose\ncruel emblem, the cross, has always had for me an element of the\nmonstrous, brought something alien and hostile into nature and its\ninnocent instincts.\n\n\"The battle of the spirit with the senses is the gospel of modern\nman. I do not care to have a share in it.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mount Olympus would be the place for you, madame,\" I replied,\n\"but we moderns can no longer support the antique serenity, least of\nall in love. The idea of sharing a woman, even if it were an Aspasia,\nwith another revolts us. We are jealous as is our God. For example,\nwe have made a term abuse out of the name of the glorious Phryne.\n\n\"We prefer one of Holbein's meagre, pallid virgins, which is wholly\nours to an antique Venus, no matter how divinely beautiful she is,\nbut who loves Anchises to-day, Paris to-morrow, Adonis the day after.\nAnd if nature triumphs in us so that we give our whole glowing,\npassionate devotion to such a woman, her serene joy of life appears\nto us as something demonic and cruel, and we read into our happiness\na sin which we must expiate.\"\n\n\"So you too are one of those who rave about modern women, those\nmiserable hysterical feminine creatures who don't appreciate a real\nman in their somnambulistic search for some dream-man and masculine\nideal. Amid tears and convulsions they daily outrage their Christian\nduties; they cheat and are cheated; they always seek again and choose\nand reject; they are never happy, and never give happiness. They\naccuse fate instead of calmly confessing that they want to love and\nlive as Helen and Aspasia lived. Nature admits of no permanence in\nthe relation between man and woman.\"\n\n\"But, my dear lady--\"\n\n\"Let me finish. It is only man's egoism which wants to keep woman\nlike some buried treasure. All endeavors to introduce permanence in\nlove, the most changeable thing in this changeable human existence,\nhave gone shipwreck in spite of religious ceremonies, vows, and\nlegalities. Can you deny that our Christian world has given itself\nover to corruption?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"But you are about to say, the individual who rebels against the\narrangements of society is ostracized, branded, stoned. So be it. I\nam willing to take the risk; my principles are very pagan. I will\nlive my own life as it pleases me. I am willing to do without your\nhypocritical respect; I prefer to be happy. The inventors of the\nChristian marriage have done well, simultaneously to invent\nimmortality. I, however, have no wish to live eternally. When with\nmy last breath everything as far as Wanda von Dunajew is concerned\ncomes to an end here below, what does it profit me whether my pure\nspirit joins the choirs of angels, or whether my dust goes into the\nformation of new beings? Shall I belong to one man whom I don't love,\nmerely because I have once loved him? No, I do not renounce; I love\neveryone who pleases me, and give happiness to everyone who loves me.\nIs that ugly? No, it is more beautiful by far, than if cruelly I\nenjoy the tortures, which my beauty excites, and virtuously reject\nthe poor fellow who is pining away for me. I am young, rich, and\nbeautiful, and I live serenely for the sake of pleasure and\nenjoyment.\"\n\nWhile she was speaking her eyes sparkled roguishly, and I had taken\nhold of her hands without exactly knowing what to do with them, but\nbeing a genuine dilettante I hastily let go of them again.\n\n\"Your frankness,\" I said, \"delights me, and not it alone--\"\n\nMy confounded dilettantism again throttled me as though there were\na rope around my neck.\n\n\"You were about to say--\"\n\n\"I was about to say--I was--I am sorry--I interrupted you.\"\n\n\"How, so?\"\n\nA long pause. She is doubtless engaging in a monologue, which\ntranslated into my language would be comprised in the single word,\n\"donkey.\"\n\n\"If I may ask,\" I finally began, \"how did you arrive at these--these\nconclusions?\"\n\n\"Quite simply, my father was an intelligent man. From my cradle onward\nI was surrounded by replicas of ancient art; at ten years of age I\nread _Gil Blas_, at twelve _La Pucelle_. Where others had\nHop-o'-my-thumb, Bluebeard, Cinderella, as childhood friends, mine\nwere Venus and Apollo, Hercules and Lackoon. My husband's personality\nwas filled with serenity and sunlight. Not even the incurable illness\nwhich fell upon him soon after our marriage could long cloud his brow.\nOn the very night of his death he took me in his arms, and during the\nmany months when he lay dying in his wheel chair, he often said\njokingly to me: 'Well, have you already picked out a lover?' I blushed\nwith shame. 'Don't deceive me,' he added on one occasion, 'that would\nseem ugly to me, but pick out an attractive lover, or preferably\nseveral. You are a splendid woman, but still half a child, and you\nneed toys.'\n\n\"I suppose, I hardly need tell you that during his life time I had\nno lover; but it was through him that I have become what I am, a\nwoman of Greece.\"\n\n\"A goddess,\" I interrupted.\n\n\"Which one,\" she smiled.\n\n\"Venus.\"\n\nShe threatened me with her finger and knitted her brows. \"Perhaps,\neven a 'Venus in Furs.' Watch out, I have a large, very large fur,\nwith which I could cover you up entirely, and I have a mind to catch\nyou in it as in a net.\"\n\n\"Do you believe,\" I said quickly, for an idea which seemed good, in\nspite of its conventionality and triteness, flashed into my head, \"do\nyou believe that your theories could be carried into execution at the\npresent time, that Venus would be permitted to stray with impunity\namong our railroads and telegraphs in all her undraped beauty and\nserenity?\"\n\n\"_Undraped_, of course not, but in furs,\" she replied smiling, \"would\nyou care to see mine?\"\n\n\"And then--\"\n\n\"What then?\"\n\n\"Beautiful, free, serene, and happy human beings, such as the Greeks\nwere, are only possible when it is permitted to have _slaves_ who will\nperform the prosaic tasks of every day for them and above all else\nlabor for them.\"\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied playfully, \"an Olympian divinity, such as\nI am, requires a whole army of slaves. Beware of me!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nI myself was frightened at the hardiness with which I uttered this\n\"why\"; it did not startle her in the least.\n\nShe drew back her lips a little so that her small white teeth became\nvisible, and then said lightly, as if she were discussing some\ntrifling matter, \"Do you want to be my slave?\"\n\n\"There is no equality in love,\" I replied solemnly. \"Whenever it is\na matter of choice for me of ruling or being ruled, it seems much\nmore satisfactory to me to be the slave of a beautiful woman. But\nwhere shall I find the woman who knows how to rule, calmly, full of\nself-confidence, even harshly, and not seek to gain her power by\nmeans of petty nagging?\"\n\n\"Oh, that might not be so difficult.\"\n\n\"You think--\"\n\n\"I--for instance--\" she laughed and leaned far back--\"I have a real\ntalent for despotism--I also have the necessary furs--but last night\nyou were really seriously afraid of me!\"\n\n\"Quite seriously.\"\n\n\"And now?\"\n\n\"Now, I am more afraid of you than ever!\"\n\nWe are together every day, I and--Venus; we are together a great\ndeal. We breakfast in my honey-suckle arbor, and have tea in her\nlittle sitting-room. I have an opportunity to unfold all my small,\nvery small talents. Of what use would have been my study of all the\nvarious sciences, my playing at all the arts, if I were unable in the\ncase of a pretty, little woman--\n\nBut this woman is by no means little; in fact she impresses me\ntremendously. I made a drawing of her to-day, and felt particularly\nclearly, how inappropriate the modern way of dressing is for a\ncameo-head like hers. The configuration of her face has little of the\nRoman, but much of the Greek.\n\nSometimes I should like to paint her as Psyche, and then again as\nAstarte. It depends upon the expression in her eyes, whether it is\nvaguely dreamy, or half-consuming, filled with tired desire.\nShe, however, insists that it be a portrait-likeness.\n\nI shall make her a present of furs.\n\nHow could I have any doubts? If not for her, for whom would princely\nfurs be suitable?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI was with her yesterday evening, reading the _Roman Elegies_ to her.\nThen I laid the book aside, and improvised something for her. She\nseemed pleased; rather more than that, she actually hung upon my\nwords, and her bosom heaved.\n\nOr was I mistaken?\n\nThe rain beat in melancholy fashion on the window-panes, the fire\ncrackled in the fireplace in wintery comfort. I felt quite at home\nwith her, and for a moment lost all my fear of this beautiful woman;\nI kissed her hand, and she permitted it.\n\nThen I sat down at her feet and read a short poem I had written for\nher.\n\nVENUS IN FURS.\n\n\"Place thy foot upon thy slave,\nOh thou, half of hell, half of dreams;\nAmong the shadows, dark and grave,\nThy extended body softly gleams.\"\n\nAnd--so on. This time I really got beyond the first stanza. At her\nrequest I gave her the poem in the evening, keeping no copy. And now\nas I am writing this down in my diary I can only remember the first\nstanza.\n\nI am filled with a very curious sensation. I don't believe that I am\nin love with Wanda; I am sure that at our first meeting, I felt\nnothing of the lightning-like flashes of passion. But I feel how her\nextraordinary, really divine beauty is gradually winding magic snares\nabout me. It isn't any spiritual sympathy which is growing in me; it\nis a physical subjection, coming on slowly, but for that reason more\nabsolutely.\n\nI suffer under it more and more each day, and she--she merely smiles.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWithout any provocation she suddenly said to me to-day: \"You\ninterest me. Most men are very commonplace, without verve or poetry.\nIn you there is a certain depth and capacity for enthusiasm and a\ndeep seriousness, which delight me. I might learn to love you.\"\n\nAfter a short but severe shower we went out together to the meadow\nand the statue of Venus. All about us the earth steamed; mists rose\nup toward heaven like clouds of incense; a shattered rainbow still\nhovered in the air. The trees were still shedding drops, but sparrows\nand finches were already hopping from twig to twig. They are\ntwittering gaily, as if very much pleased at something. Everything\nis filled with a fresh fragrance. We cannot cross the meadow for it\nis still wet. In the sunlight it looks like a small pool, and the\ngoddess of love seems to rise from the undulations of its mirror-like\nsurface. About her head a swarm of gnats is dancing, which,\nilluminated by the sun, seem to hover above her like an aureole.\n\nWanda is enjoying the lovely scene. As all the benches along the\nwalk are still wet, she supports herself on my arm to rest a while.\nA soft weariness permeates her whole being, her eyes are half closed;\nI feel the touch of her breath on my cheek.\n\nHow I managed to get up courage enough I really don't know, but I\ntook hold of her hand, asking,\n\n\"Could you love me?\"\n\n\"Why not,\" she replied, letting her calm, clear look rest upon me,\nbut not for long.\n\nA moment later I am kneeling before her, pressing my burning face\nagainst the fragrant muslin of her gown.\n\n\"But Severin--this isn't right,\" she cried.\n\nBut I take hold of her little foot, and press my lips upon it.\n\n\"You are getting worse and worse!\" she cried. She tore herself free,\nand fled rapidly toward the house, the while her adorable slipper\nremained in my hand.\n\nIs it an omen?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll day long I didn't dare to go near her. Toward evening as I was\nsitting in my arbor her gay red head peered suddenly through the\ngreenery of her balcony. \"Why don't you come up?\" he called down\nimpatiently.\n\nI ran upstairs, and at the top lost courage again. I knocked very\nlightly. She didn't say come-in, but opened the door herself, and\nstood on the threshold.\n\n\"Where is my slipper?\"\n\n\"It is--I have--I want,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Get it, and then we will have tea together, and chat.\"\n\nWhen I returned, she was engaged in making tea. I ceremoniously\nplaced the slipper on the table, and stood in the corner like a child\nawaiting punishment.\n\nI noticed that her brows were slightly contracted, and there was an\nexpression of hardness and dominance about her lips which delighted\nme.\n\nAll of a sudden she broke out laughing.\n\n\"So--you are really in love--with me?\"\n\n\"Yes, and I suffer more from it than you can imagine?\"\n\n\"You suffer?\" she laughed again.\n\nI was revolted, mortified, annihilated, but all this was quite\nuseless.\n\n\"Why?\" she continued, \"I like you, with all my heart.\"\n\nShe gave me her hand, and looked at me in the friendliest fashion.\n\n\"And will you be my wife?\"\n\nWanda looked at me--how did she look at me? I think first of all\nwith surprise, and then with a tinge of irony.\n\n\"What has given you so much courage, all at once?\"\n\n\"Courage?\"\n\n\"Yes courage, to ask anyone to be your wife, and me in particular?\"\nShe lifted up the slipper. \"Was it through a sudden friendship with\nthis? But joking aside. Do you really wish to marry me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Well, Severin, that is a serious matter. I believe, you love me,\nand I care for you too, and what is more important each of us finds\nthe other interesting. There is no danger that we would soon get\nbored, but, you know, I am a fickle person, and just for that reason\nI take marriage seriously. If I assume obligations, I want to be able\nto meet them. But I am afraid--no--it would hurt you.\"\n\n\"Please be perfectly frank with me,\" I replied.\n\n\"Well then honestly, I don't believe I could love a man longer than--\"\nShe inclined her head gracefully to one side and mused.\n\n\"A year.\"\n\n\"What do you imagine--a month perhaps.\"\n\n\"Not even me?\"\n\n\"Oh you--perhaps two.\"\n\n\"Two months!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Two months is very long.\"\n\n\"You go beyond antiquity, madame.\"\n\n\"You see, you cannot stand the truth.\"\n\nWanda walked across the room and leaned back against the fireplace,\nwatching me and resting one of her arms on the mantelpiece.\n\n\"What shall I do with you?\" she began anew.\n\n\"Whatever you wish,\" I replied with resignation, \"whatever will give\nyou pleasure.\"\n\n\"How illogical!\" she cried, \"first you want to make me your wife,\nand then you offer yourself to me as something to toy with.\"\n\n\"Wanda--I love you.\"\n\n\"Now we are back to the place where we started. You love me, and\nwant to make me your wife, but I don't want to enter into a new\nmarriage, because I doubt the permanence of both my and your\nfeelings.\"\n\n\"But if I am willing to take the risk with you?\" I replied.\n\n\"But it also depends on whether I am willing to risk it with you,\"\nshe said quietly. \"I can easily imagine belonging to one man for my\nentire life, but he would have to be a whole man, a man who would\ndominate me, who would subjugate me by his inate strength, do you\nunderstand? And every man--I know this very well--as soon as he falls\nin love becomes weak, pliable, ridiculous. He puts himself into the\nwoman's hands, kneels down before her. The only man whom I could love\npermanently would be he before whom I should have to kneel. I've gotten\nto like you so much, however, that I'll try it with you.\"\n\nI fell down at her feet.\n\n\"For heaven's sake, here you are kneeling already,\" she said\nmockingly. \"You are making a good beginning.\" When I had risen again\nshe continued, \"I will give you a year's time to win me, to convince\nme that we are suited to each other, that we might live together. If\nyou succeed, I will become your wife, and a wife, Severin, who will\nconscientiously and strictly perform all her duties. During this year\nwe will live as though we were married--\"\n\nMy blood rose to my head.\n\nIn her eyes too there was a sudden flame--\n\n\"We will live together,\" she continued, \"share our daily life, so that\nwe may find out whether we are really fitted for each other. _I grant\nyou all the rights of a husband, of a lover, of a friend._ Are you\nsatisfied?\"\n\n\"I suppose, I'll have to be?\"\n\n\"You don't have to.\"\n\n\"Well then, I want to--\"\n\n\"Splendid. That is how a man speaks. Here is my hand.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor ten days I have been with her every hour, except at night. All\nthe time I was allowed to look into her eyes, hold her hands, listen\nto what she said, accompany her wherever she went.\n\nMy love seems to me like a deep, bottomless abyss, into which I\nsubside deeper and deeper. There is nothing now which could save me\nfrom it.\n\nThis afternoon we were resting on the meadow at the foot of the\nVenus-statue. I plucked flowers and tossed them into her lap; she\nwound them into wreaths with which we adorned our goddess.\n\nSuddenly Wanda looked at me so strangely that my senses became\nconfused and passion swept over my head like a conflagration. Losing\ncommand over myself, I threw my arms about her and clung to her lips,\nand she--she drew me close to her heaving breast.\n\n\"Are you angry?\" I then asked her.\n\n\"I am never angry at anything that is natural--\" she replied, \"but\n_I_ am afraid you suffer.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am suffering frightfully.\"\n\n\"Poor friend!\" she brushed my disordered hair back from my fore-head. \"I\nhope it isn't through any fault of mine.\"\n\n\"No--\" I replied,--\"and yet my love for you has become a sort of\nmadness. The thought that I might lose you, perhaps actually lose\nyou, torments me day and night.\"\n\n\"But you don't yet possess me,\" said Wanda, and again she looked at\nme with that vibrant, consuming expression, which had already once\nbefore carried me away. Then she rose, and with her small transparent\nhands placed a wreath of blue anemones upon the ringletted white head\nof Venus. Half against my will I threw my arm around her body.\n\n\"I can no longer live without you, oh wonderful woman,\" I said.\n\"Believe me, believe only this once, that this time it is not a\nphrase, not a thing of dreams. I feel deep down in my innermost soul,\nthat my life belongs inseparably with yours. If you leave me, I shall\nperish, go to pieces.\"\n\n\"That will hardly be necessary, for I love you,\" she took hold of my\nchin, \"you foolish man!\"\n\n\"But you will be mine only under conditions, while I belong to you\nunconditionally--\"\n\n\"That isn't wise, Severin,\" she replied almost with a start. \"Don't\nyou know me yet, do you absolutely refuse to know me? I am good when\nI am treated seriously and reasonably, but when you abandon yourself\ntoo absolutely to me, I grow arrogant--\"\n\n\"So be it, be arrogant, be despotic,\" I cried in the fulness of\nexaltation, \"only be mine, mine forever.\" I lay at her feet,\nembracing her knees.\n\n\"Things will end badly, my friend,\" she said soberly, without moving.\n\n\"It shall never end,\" I cried excitedly, almost violently. \"Only death\nshall part us. If you cannot be mine, all mine and for always, then _I\nwant to be your slave_, serve you, suffer everything from you, if only\nyou won't drive me away.\"\n\n\"Calm yourself,\" she said, bending down and kissing my forehead, \"I\nam really very fond of you, but your way is not the way to win and\nhold me.\"\n\n\"I want to do everything, absolutely everything, that you want, only\nnot to lose you,\" I cried, \"only not that, I cannot bear the thought.\"\n\n\"Do get up.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"You are a strange person,\" continued Wanda. \"You wish to possess me\nat any price?\"\n\n\"Yes, at any price.\"\n\n\"But of what value, for instance, would that be?\"--She pondered; a\nlurking uncanny expression entered her eyes--\"If I no longer loved\nyou, if I belonged to another.\"\n\nA shudder ran through me. I looked at her She stood firmly and\nconfident before me, and her eyes disclosed a cold gleam.\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"the very thought frightens you.\" A\nbeautiful smile suddenly illuminated her face.\n\n\"I feel a perfect horror, when I imagine, that the woman I love and\nwho has responded to my love could give herself to another regardless\nof me. But have I still a choice? If I love such a woman, even unto\nmadness, shall I turn my back to her and lose everything for the sake\nof a bit of boastful strength; shall I send a bullet through my\nbrains? I have two ideals of woman. If I cannot obtain the one that\nis noble and simple, the woman who will faithfully and truly share\nmy life, well then I don't want anything half-way or lukewarm. Then\nI would rather be subject to a woman without virtue, fidelity, or pity.\nSuch a woman in her magnificent selfishness is likewise an ideal. If\nI am not permitted to enjoy the happiness of love, fully and wholly,\nI want to taste its pains and torments to the very dregs; I want to\nbe maltreated and betrayed by the woman I love, and the more cruelly\nthe better. This too is a luxury.\"\n\n\"Have you lost your senses,\" cried Wanda.\n\n\"I love you with all my soul,\" I continued, \"with all my senses, and\nyour presence and personality are absolutely essential to me, if I\nam to go on living. Choose between my ideals. Do with me what you will,\nmake of me your husband or your slave.\"\n\n\"Very well,\" said Wanda, contracting her small but strongly arched\nbrows, \"it seems to me it would be rather entertaining to have a man,\nwho interests me and loves me, completely in my power; at least I\nshall not lack pastime. You were imprudent enough to leave the choice\nto me. Therefore I choose; I want you to be my slave, I shall make\na plaything for myself out of you!\"\n\n\"Oh, please do,\" I cried half-shuddering, half-enraptured. \"If the\nfoundation of marriage depends on equality and agreement, it is\nlikewise true that the greatest passions rise out of opposites. We\nare such opposites, almost enemies. That is why my love is part hate,\npart fear. In such a relation only one can be hammer and the other\nanvil. I wish to be the anvil. I cannot be happy when I look down\nupon the woman I love. I want to adore a woman, and this I can only\ndo when she is cruel towards me.\"\n\n\"But, Severin,\" replied Wanda, almost angrily, \"do you believe me\ncapable of maltreating a man who loves me as you do, and whom I love?\"\n\n\"Why not, if I adore you the more on this account? _It is possible to\nlove really only that which stands above us,_ a woman, who through her\nbeauty, temperament, intelligence, and strength of will subjugates us\nand becomes a despot over us.\"\n\n\"Then that which repels others, attracts you.\"\n\n\"Yes. That is the strange part of me.\"\n\n\"Perhaps, after all, there isn't anything so very unique or strange\nin all your passions, for who doesn't love beautiful furs? And\neveryone knows and feels how closely sexual love and cruelty are\nrelated.\"\n\n\"But in my case all these elements are raised to their highest\ndegree,\" I replied.\n\n\"In other words, reason has little power over you, and you are by\nnature, soft, sensual, yielding.\"\n\n\"Were the martyrs also soft and sensual by nature?\"\n\n\"The martyrs?\"\n\n\"On the contrary, they were _supersensual men,_ who found enjoyment in\nsuffering. They sought out the most frightful tortures, even death\nitself, as others seek joy, and as they were, so am I--_supersensual.\"_\n\n\"Have a care that in being such, you do not become a martyr to love,\nthe _martyr of a woman_.\"\n\nWe are sitting on Wanda's little balcony in the mellow fragrant\nsummer night. A twofold roof is above us, first the green ceiling of\nclimbing-plants, and then the vault of heaven sown with innumerable\nstars. The low wailing love-call of a cat rises from the park. I am\nsitting on footstool at the feet of my divinity, and am telling her\nof my childhood.\n\n\"And even then all these strange tendencies were distinctly marked\nin you?\" asked Wanda.\n\n\"Of course, I can't remember a time when I didn't have them. Even in\nmy cradle, so mother has told me, I was _supersensual._ I scorned the\nhealthy breast of my nurse, and had to be brought up on goats' milk.\nAs a little boy I was mysteriously shy before women, which really was\nonly an expression of an inordinate interest in them. I was oppressed\nby the gray arches and half-darknesses of the church, and actually\nafraid of the glittering altars and images of the saints. Secretly,\nhowever, I sneaked as to a secret joy to a plaster-Venus which stood\nin my father's little library. I kneeled down before her, and to her I\nsaid the prayers I had been taught--the Paternoster, the Ave Maria,\nand the Credo.\n\n\"Once at night I left my bed to visit her. The sickle of the moon\nwas my light and showed me the goddess in a pale-blue cold light. I\nprostrated myself before her and kissed her cold feet, as I had seen\nour peasants do when they kissed the feet of the dead Savior.\n\n\"An irresistible yearning seized me.\n\n\"I got up and embraced the beautiful cold body and kissed the cold\nlips. A deep shudder fell upon me and I fled, and later in a dream,\nit seemed to me, as if the goddess stood beside my bed, threatening\nme with up-raised arm.\n\n\"I was sent to school early and soon reached the gymnasium. I\npassionately grasped at everything which promised to make the world\nof antiquity accessible to me. Soon I was more familiar with the gods\nof Greece than with the religion of Jesus. I was with Paris when he\ngave the fateful apple to Venus, I saw Troy burn, and followed\nUlysses on his wanderings. The prototypes of all that is beautiful\nsank deep into my soul, and consequently at the time when other boys\nare coarse and obscene, I displayed an insurmountable aversion to\neverything base, vulgar, unbeautiful.\n\n\"To me, the maturing youth, love for women seemed something\nespecially base and unbeautiful, for it showed itself to me first in\nall its commonness. I avoided all contact with the fair sex; in\nshort, I was supersensual to madness.\n\n\"When I was about fourteen my mother had a charming chamber-maid,\nyoung, attractive, with a figure just budding into womanhood. I was\nsitting one day studying my Tacitus and growing enthusiastic over the\nvirtues of the ancient Teutons, while she was sweeping my room.\nSuddenly she stopped, bent down over me, in the meantime holding fast\nto the broom, and a pair of fresh, full, adorable lips touched mine.\nThe kiss of the enamoured little cat ran through me like a shudder,\nbut I raised up my _Germania_, like a shield against the temptress,\nand indignantly left the room.\"\n\nWanda broke out in loud laughter. \"It would, indeed, be hard to find\nanother man like you, but continue.\"\n\n\"There is another unforgetable incident belonging to that period,\"\nI continued my story. \"Countess Sobol, a distant aunt of mine, was\nvisiting my parents. She was a beautiful majestic woman with an\nattractive smile. I, however, hated her, for she was regarded by the\nfamily as a sort of Messalina. My behavior toward her was as rude,\nmalicious, and awkward as possible.\n\n\"One day my parents drove to the capital of the district. My aunt\ndetermined to take advantage of their absence, and to exercise\njudgment over me. She entered unexpectedly in her fur-lined\n_kazabaika,_ [Footnote: A woman's jacket.] followed by the cook,\nkitchen-maid, and the cat of a chamber-maid whom I had scorned.\nWithout asking any questions, they seized me and bound me hand and\nfoot, in spite of my violent resistance. Then my aunt, with an evil\nsmile, rolled up her sleeve and began to whip me with a stout switch.\nShe whipped so hard that the blood flowed, and that, at last,\nnotwithstanding my heroic spirit, I cried and wept and begged for\nmercy. She then had me untied, but I had to get down on my knees and\nthank her for the punishment and kiss her hand.\n\n\"Now you understand the supersensual fool! Under the lash of a\nbeautiful woman my senses first realized the meaning of woman. In her\nfur-jacket she seemed to me like a wrathful queen, and from then on\nmy aunt became the most desirable woman on God's earth.\n\n\"My Cato-like austerity, my shyness before woman, was nothing but an\nexcessive feeling for beauty. In my imagination sensuality became a\nsort of cult. I took an oath to myself that I would not squander its\nholy wealth upon any ordinary person, but I would reserve it for an\nideal woman, if possible for the goddess of love herself.\n\n\"I went to the university at a very early age. It was in the capital\nwhere my aunt lived. My room looked at that time like Doctor\nFaustus's. Everything in it was in a wild confusion. There were huge\nclosets stuffed full of books, which I bought for a song from a\nJewish dealer on the Servanica; [Footnote: The street of the Jews in\nLemberg.] there were globes, atlases, flasks, charts of the heavens,\nskeletons of animals, skulls, the busts of eminent men. It looked as\nthough Mephistopheles might have stepped out from behind the huge\ngreen store as a wandering scholiast at any moment.\n\n\"I studied everything in a jumble without system, without selection:\nchemistry, alchemy, history, astronomy, philosophy, law, anatomy, and\nliterature; I read Homer, Virgil, Ossian, Schiller, Goethe,\nShakespeare, Cervantes, Voltaire, Moliere, the Koran, the Kosmos,\nCasanova's Memoirs. I grew more confused each day, more fantastical,\nmore supersensual. All the time a beautiful ideal woman hovered in my\nimagination. Every so and so often she appeared before me like a\nvision among my leather-bound books and dead bones, lying on a bed of\nroses, surrounded by cupids. Sometimes she appeared gowned like the\nOlympians with the stern white face of the plaster Venus; sometimes in\nbraids of a rich brown, blue-eyes, in my aunt's red velvet\n_kazabaika,_ trimmed with ermine.\n\n\"One morning when she had again risen out of the golden mist of my\nimagination in all her smiling beauty, I went to see Countess Sobol,\nwho received me in a friendly, even cordial manner. She gave me a\nkiss of welcome, which put all my senses in a turmoil. She was\nprobably about forty years old, but like most well-preserved women\nof the world, still very attractive. She wore as always her fur-edged\njacket. This time it was one of green velvet with brown marten. But\nnothing of the sternness which had so delighted me the other time was\nnow discernable.\n\n\"On the contrary, there was so little of cruelty in her that without\nany more ado she let me adore her.\n\n\"Only too soon did she discover my supersensual folly and innocence,\nand it pleased her to make me happy. As for myself--I was as happy\nas a young god. What rapture for me to be allowed to lie before her\non my knees, and to kiss her hands, those with which she had scourged\nme! What marvellous hands they were, of beautiful form, delicate,\nrounded, and white, with adorable dimples! I really was in love with\nher hands only. I played with them, let them submerge and emerge in\nthe dark fur, held them against the light, and was unable to satiate\nmy eyes with them.\"\n\nWanda involuntarily looked at her hand; I noticed it, and had to\nsmile.\n\n\"From the way in which the supersensual predominated in me in those\ndays you can see that I was in love only with the cruel lashes I\nreceived from my aunt; and about two years later when I paid court\nto a young actress only in the roles she played. Still later I became\nthe admirer of a respectable woman. She acted the part of\nirreproachable virtue, only in the end to betray me with a rich Jew.\nYou see, it is because I was betrayed, sold, by a woman who feigned\nthe strictest principles and the highest ideals, that I hate that\nsort of poetical, sentimental virtue so intensely. Give me rather a\nwoman who is honest enough to say to me: I am a Pompadour, a Lucretia\nBorgia, and I am ready to adore her.\"\n\nWanda rose and opened the window.\n\n\"You have a curious way of arousing one's imagination, stimulating\nall one's nerves, and making one's pulses beat faster. You put an\naureole on vice, provided only if it is honest. Your ideal is a\ndaring courtesan of genius. Oh, you are the kind of man who will\ncorrupt a woman to her very last fiber.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIn the middle of the night there was a knock at my window; I got up,\nopened it, and was startled. Without stood \"Venus in Furs,\" just as\nshe had appeared to me the first time.\n\n\"You have disturbed me with your stories; I have been tossing about\nin bed, and can't go to sleep,\" she said. \"Now come and stay with me.\"\n\n\"In a moment.\"\n\nAs I entered Wanda was crouching by the fireplace where she had\nkindled a small fire.\n\n\"Autumn is coming,\" she began, \"the nights are really quite cold\nalready. I am afraid you may not like it, but I can't put off my furs\nuntil the room is sufficiently warm.\"\n\n\"Not like it--you are joking--you know--\" I threw my arm around her,\nand kissed her.\n\n\"Of course, I know, but why this great fondness for furs?\"\n\n\"I was born with it,\" I replied. \"I already had it as a child.\nFurthermore furs have a stimulating effect on all highly organized\nnatures. This is due both to general and natural laws. It is a\nphysical stimulus which sets you tingling, and no one can wholly\nescape it. Science has recently shown a certain relationship between\nelectricity and warmth; at any rate, their effects upon the human\norganism are related. The torrid zone produces more passionate\ncharacters, a heated atmosphere stimulation. Likewise with\nelectricity. This is the reason why the presence of cats exercises\nsuch a magic influence upon highly-organized men of intellect. This\nis why these long-tailed Graces of the animal kingdom, these\nadorable, scintillating electric batteries have been the favorite\nanimal of a Mahommed, Cardinal Richelieu, Crebillon, Rousseau,\nWieland.\"\n\n\"A woman wearing furs, then,\" cried Wanda, \"is nothing else than a\nlarge cat, an augmented electric battery?\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I replied. \"That is my explanation of the symbolic\nmeaning which fur has acquired as the attribute of power and beauty.\nMonarchs and the dominant higher nobility in former times used it in\nthis sense for their costume, exclusively; great painters used it\nonly for queenly beauty. The most beautiful frame, which Raphael\ncould find for the divine forms of Fornarina and Titian for the\nroseate body of his beloved, was dark furs.\"\n\n\"Thanks for the learned discourse on love,\" said Wanda, \"but you\nhaven't told me everything. You associate something entirely\nindividual with furs.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" I cried. \"I have repeatedly told you that suffering has\na peculiar attraction for me. Nothing can intensify my passion more\nthan tyranny, cruelty, and especially the faithlessness of a\nbeautiful woman. And I cannot imagine this woman, this strange ideal\nderived from an aesthetics of ugliness, this soul of Nero in the body\nof a Phryne, except in furs.\"\n\n\"I understand,\" Wanda interrupted. \"It gives a dominant and imposing\nquality to a woman.\"\n\n\"Not only that,\" I continued. \"You know I am _supersensual._ With me\neverything has its roots in the imagination, and thence it receives\nits nourishment. I was already pre-maturely developed and highly\nsensitive, when at about the age of ten the legends of the martyrs\nfell into my hands. I remember reading with a kind of horror, which\nreally was rapture, of how they pined in prisons, were laid on the\ngridiron, pierced with arrows, boiled in pitch, thrown to wild\nanimals, nailed to the cross, and suffered the most horrible torment\nwith a kind of joy. To suffer and endure cruel torture from then on\nseemed to me exquisite delight, especially when it was inflicted by a\nbeautiful woman, for ever since I can remember all poetry and\neverything demonic was for me concentrated in woman. I literally\ncarried the idea into a sort of cult.\n\n\"I felt there was something sacred in sex; in fact, it was the only\nsacred thing. In woman and her beauty I saw something divine, because\nthe most important function of existence--the continuation of the\nspecies--is her vocation. To me woman represented a personification of\nnature, _Isis_, and man was her priest, her slave. In contrast to him\nshe was cruel like nature herself who tosses aside whatever has served\nher purposes as soon as she no longer has need for it. To him her\ncruelties, even death itself, still were sensual raptures.\n\n\"I envied King Gunther whom the mighty Brunhilde fettered on the\nbridal night, and the poor troubadour whom his capricious mistress\nhad sewed in the skins of wolves to have him hunted like game. I\nenvied the Knight Ctirad whom the daring Amazon Scharka craftily\nensnared in a forest near Prague, and carried to her castle Divin,\nwhere, after having amused herself a while with him, she had him\nbroken on the wheel--\"\n\n\"Disgusting,\" cried Wanda. \"I almost wish you might fall into the\nhands of a woman of their savage race. In the wolf's skin, under the\nteeth of the dogs, or upon the wheel, you would lose the taste for\nyour kind of poetry.\"\n\n\"Do you think so? I hardly do.\"\n\n\"Have you actually lost your senses.\"\n\n\"Possibly. But let me go on. I developed a perfect passion for\nreading stories in which the extremest cruelties were described. I\nloved especially to look at pictures and prints which represented\nthem. All the sanguinary tyrants that ever occupied a throne; the\ninquisitors who had the heretics tortured, roasted, and butchered;\nall the woman whom the pages of history have recorded as lustful,\nbeautiful, and violent women like Libussa, Lucretia Borgia, Agnes of\nHungary, Queen Margot, Isabeau, the Sultana Roxolane, the Russian\nCzarinas of last century--all these I saw in furs or in robes\nbordered with ermine.\"\n\n\"And so furs now rouse strange imaginings in you,\" said Wanda, and\nsimultaneously she began to drape her magnificent fur-cloak\ncoquettishly about her, so that the dark shining sable played\nbeautifully around her bust and arms. \"Well, how do you feel now,\nhalf broken on the wheel?\"\n\nHer piercing green eyes rested on me with a peculiar mocking\nsatisfaction. Overcome by desire, I flung myself down before her, and\nthrew my arms about her.\n\n\"Yes--you have awakened my dearest dream,\" I cried. \"It has slept\nlong enough.\"\n\n\"And this is?\" She put her hand on my neck.\n\nI was seized with a sweet intoxication under the influence of this\nwarm little hand and of her regard, which, tenderly searching, fell\nupon me through her half-closed lids.\n\n_\"To be the slave of a woman, a beautiful woman, whom I love, whom\nI worship.\"_\n\n\"And who on that account maltreats you,\" interrupted Wanda, laughing.\n\n\"Yes, who fetters me and whips me, treads me underfoot, the while\nshe gives herself to another.\"\n\n\"And who in her wantonness will go so far as to make a present of\nyou to your successful rival when driven insane by jealousy you must\nmeet him face to face, who will turn you over to his absolute mercy.\nWhy not? This final tableau doesn't please you so well?\"\n\nI looked at Wanda frightened.\n\n\"You surpass my dreams.\"\n\n\"Yes, we women are inventive,\" she said, \"take heed, when you find\nyour ideal, it might easily happen, that she will treat you more\ncruelly than you anticipate.\"\n\n\"I am afraid that I have already found my ideal!\" I exclaimed,\nburying my burning face in her lap.\n\n\"Not I?\" exclaimed Wanda, throwing off her furs and moving about the\nroom laughing. She was still laughing as I went downstairs, and when\nI stood musing in the yard, I still heard her peals of laughter above.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Do you really then expect me to embody your ideal?\" Wanda asked\narchly, when we met in the park to-day.\n\nAt first I could find no answer. The most antagonistic emotions were\nbattling within me. In the meantime she sat down on one of the\nstone-benches, and played with a flower.\n\n\"Well--am I?\"\n\nI kneeled down and seized her hands.\n\n\"Once more I beg you to become my wife, my true and loyal wife; if\nyou can't do that then become the embodiment of my ideal, absolutely,\nwithout reservation, without softness.\"\n\n\"You know I am ready at the end of a year to give you my hand, if\nyou prove to be the man I am seeking,\" Wanda replied very seriously,\n\"but I think you would be more grateful to me if through me you\nrealized your imaginings. Well, which do you prefer?\"\n\n\"I believe that everything my imagination has dreamed lies latent in\nyour personality.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken.\"\n\n\"I believe,\" I continued, \"that you enjoy having a man wholly in\nyour power, torturing him--\"\n\n\"No, no,\" she exclaimed quickly, \"or perhaps--.\" She pondered.\n\n\"I don't understand myself any longer,\" she continued, \"but I have\na confession to make to you. You have corrupted my imagination and\ninflamed my blood. I am beginning to like the things you speak of.\nThe enthusiasm with which you speak of a Pompadour, a Catherine the\nSecond, and all the other selfish, frivolous, cruel women, carries\nme away and takes hold of my soul. It urges me on to become like those\nwomen, who in spite of their vileness were slavishly adored during\ntheir lifetime and still exert a miraculous power from their graves.\n\n\"You will end by making of me a despot in miniature, a domestic\nPompadour.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" I said in agitation, \"if all this is inherent in you,\ngive way to this trend of your nature. Nothing half-way. If you can't\nbe a true and loyal wife to me, be a demon.\"\n\nI was nervous from loss of sleep, and the proximity of the beautiful\nwoman affected me like a fever. I no longer recall what I said, but\nI remember that I kissed her feet, and finally raised her foot and\nput my neck under it. She withdrew it quickly, and rose almost angrily.\n\n\"If you love me, Severin,\" she said quickly, and her voice sounded\nsharp and commanding, \"never speak to me of those things again.\nUnderstand, never! Otherwise I might really--\" She smiled and sat\ndown again.\n\n\"I am entirely serious,\" I exclaimed, half-raving. \"I adore you so\ninfinitely that I am willing to suffer anything from you, for the\nsake of spending my whole life near you.\"\n\n\"Severin, once more I warn you.\"\n\n\"Your warning is vain. Do with me what you will, as long as you\ndon't drive me away.\"\n\n\"Severin,\" replied Wanda, \"I am a frivolous young woman; it is\ndangerous for you to put yourself so completely in my power. You will\nend by actually becoming a plaything to me. Who will give warrant\nthat I shall not abuse your insane desire?\"\n\n\"Your own nobility of character.\"\n\n\"Power makes people over-bearing.\"\n\n\"Be it,\" I cried, \"tread me underfoot.\"\n\nWanda threw her arms around my neck, looked into my eyes, and shook\nher head.\n\n\"I am afraid I can't, but I will try, for your sake, for I love you\nSeverin, as I have loved no other man.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day she suddenly took her hat and shawl, and I had to go shopping\nwith her. She looked at whips, long whips with a short handle, the\nkind that are used on dogs.\n\n\"Are these satisfactory?\" said the shopkeeper.\n\n\"No, they are much too small,\" replied Wanda, with a side-glance at\nme. \"I need a large--\"\n\n\"For a bull-dog, I suppose?\" opined the merchant.\n\n\"Yes,\" she exclaimed, \"of the kind that are used in Russia for\nintractable slaves.\"\n\nShe looked further and finally selected a whip, at whose sight I\nfelt a strange creeping sensation.\n\n\"Now good-by, Severin,\" she said. \"I have some other purchases to\nmake, but you can't go along.\"\n\nI left her and took a walk. On the way back I saw Wanda coming out\nat a furrier's. She beckoned me.\n\n\"Consider it well,\" she began in good spirits, \"I have never made a\nsecret of how deeply your serious, dreamy character has fascinated\nme. The idea of seeing this serious man wholly in my power, actually\nlying enraptured at my feet, of course, stimulates me--but will this\nattraction last? Woman loves a man; she maltreats a slave, and ends\nby kicking him aside.\"\n\n\"Very well then, kick me aside,\" I replied, \"when you are tired of\nme. I want to be your slave.\"\n\n\"Dangerous forces lie within me,\" said Wanda, after we had gone a\nfew steps further. \"You awaken them, and not to your advantage. You\nknow how to paint pleasure, cruelty, arrogance in glowing colors.\nWhat would you say should I try my hand at them, and make you the\nfirst object of my experiments. I would be like Dionysius who had the\ninventor of the iron ox roasted within it in order to see whether his\nwails and groans really resembled the bellowing of an ox.\n\n\"Perhaps I am a female Dionysius?\"\n\n\"Be it,\" I exclaimed, \"and my dreams will be fulfilled. I am yours\nfor good or evil, choose. The destiny that lies concealed within my\nbreast drives me on--demoniacally--relentlessly.\"\n\n\"My Beloved,\n\nI do not care to see you to-day or to-morrow, and not until evening\nthe day after tomorrow, and then _as my slave_.\n\nYour mistress\n\nWanda.\"\n\n\"As my slave\" was underlined. I read the note which I received early\nin the morning a second time. Then I had a donkey saddled, an animal\nsymbolic of learned professors, and rode into the mountains. I wanted\nto numb my desire, my yearning, with the magnificent scenery of the\nCarpathians. I am back, tired, hungry, thirsty, and more in love than\never. I quickly change my clothes, and a few moments later knock at\nher door.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nI enter. She is standing in the center of the room, dressed in a gown\nof white satin which floods down her body like light. Over it she\nwears a scarlet _kazabaika_, richly edged with ermine. Upon her\npowdered, snowy hair is a little diadem of diamonds. She stands with\nher arms folded across her breast, and with her brows contracted.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I run toward her, and am about to throw my arm about her to\nkiss her. She retreats a step, measuring me from top to bottom.\n\n\"Slave!\"\n\n\"Mistress!\" I kneel down, and kiss the hem of her garment.\n\n\"That is as it should be.\"\n\n\"Oh, how beautiful you are.\"\n\n\"Do I please you?\" She stepped before the mirror, and looked at\nherself with proud satisfaction.\n\n\"I shall become mad!\"\n\nHer lower lip twitched derisively, and she looked at me mockingly\nfrom behind half-closed lids.\n\n\"Give me the whip.\"\n\nI looked about the room.\n\n\"No,\" she exclaimed, \"stay as you are, kneeling.\" She went over to\nthe fire-place, took the whip from the mantle-piece, and, watching\nme with a smile, let it hiss through the air; then she slowly rolled\nup the sleeve of her fur-jacket.\n\n\"Marvellous woman!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Silence, slave!\" She suddenly scowled, looked savage, and struck me\nwith the whip. A moment later she threw her arm tenderly about me, and\npityingly bent down to me. \"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, half-shyly,\nhalf-timidly.\n\n\"No,\" I replied, \"and even if you had, pains that come through you\nare a joy. Strike again, if it gives you pleasure.\"\n\n\"But it doesn't give me pleasure.\"\n\nAgain I was seized with that strange intoxication.\n\n\"Whip me,\" I begged, \"whip me without mercy.\"\n\nWanda swung the whip, and hit me twice. \"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Seriously, no?\"\n\n\"Whip me, I beg you, it is a joy to me.\"\n\n\"Yes, because you know very well that it isn't serious,\" she\nreplied, \"because I haven't the heart to hurt you. This brutal game\ngoes against my grain. Were I really the woman who beats her slaves\nyou would be horrified.\"\n\n\"No, Wanda,\" I replied, \"I love you more than myself; I am devoted\nto you for death and life. In all seriousness, you can do with me\nwhatever you will, whatever your caprice suggests.\"\n\n\"Severin!\"\n\n\"Tread me underfoot!\" I exclaimed, and flung myself face to the\nfloor before her.\n\n\"I hate all this play-acting,\" said Wanda impatiently.\n\n\"Well, then maltreat me seriously.\"\n\nAn uncanny pause.\n\n\"Severin, I warn you for the last time,\" began Wanda.\n\n\"If you love me, be cruel towards me,\" I pleaded with upraised eyes.\n\n\"If I love you,\" repeated Wanda. \"Very well!\" She stepped back and\nlooked at me with a sombre smile. _\"Be then my slave, and know what\nit means to be delivered into the hands of a woman.\"_ And at the\nsame moment she gave me a kick.\n\n\"How do you like that, slave?\"\n\nThen she flourished the whip.\n\n\"Get up!\"\n\nI was about to rise.\n\n\"Not that way,\" she commanded, \"on your knees.\"\n\nI obeyed, and she began to apply the lash.\n\nThe blows fell rapidly and powerfully on my back and arms. Each one\ncut into my flesh and burned there, but the pains enraptured me. They\ncame from her whom I adored, and for whom I was ready at any hour to\nlay down my life.\n\nShe stopped. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\" she said, \"but enough for\nto-day. I am beginning to feel a demonic curiosity to see how far\nyour strength goes. I take a cruel joy in seeing you tremble and\nwrithe beneath my whip, and in hearing your groans and wails; I want\nto go on whipping without pity until you beg for mercy, until you\nlose your senses. You have awakened dangerous elements in my being.\nBut now get up.\"\n\nI seized her hand to press it to my lips.\n\n\"What impudence.\"\n\nShe shoved me away with her foot.\n\n\"Out of my sight, slave!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter having spent a feverish night filled with confused dreams, I\nawoke. Dawn was just beginning to break.\n\nHow much of what was hovering in my memory was true; what had I\nactually experienced and what had I dreamed? That I had been whipped\nwas certain. I can still feel each blow, and count the burning red\nstripes on my body. And _she_ whipped me. Now I know everything.\n\nMy dream has become truth. How does it make me feel? Am I\ndisappointed in the realization of my dream?\n\nNo, I am merely somewhat tired, but her cruelty has enraptured me.\nOh, how I love her, adore her! All this cannot express in the\nremotest way my feeling for her, my complete devotion to her. What\nhappiness to be her slave!\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe calls to me from her balcony. I hurry upstairs. She is standing\non the threshold, holding out her hand in friendly fashion. \"I am\nashamed of myself,\" she says, while I embrace her, and she hides her\nhead against my breast.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Please try to forget the ugly scene of yesterday,\" she said with\nquivering voice, \"I have fulfilled your mad wish, now let us be\nreasonable and happy and love each other, and in a year I will be\nyour wife.\"\n\n\"My mistress,\" I exclaimed, \"and I your slave!\"\n\n\"Not another word of slavery, cruelty, or the whip,\" interrupted\nWanda. \"I shall not grant you any of those favors, none except\nwearing my fur-jacket; come and help me into it.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe little bronze clock on which stood a cupid who had just shot his\nbolt struck midnight.\n\nI rose, and wanted to leave.\n\nWanda said nothing, but embraced me and drew me back on the ottoman.\nShe began to kiss me anew, and this silent language was so\ncomprehensible, so convincing--\n\nAnd it told me more than I dared to understand.\n\nA languid abandonment pervaded Wanda's entire being. What a\nvoluptuous softness there was in the gloaming of her half-closed\neyes, in the red flood of her hair which shimmered faintly under the\nwhite powder, in the red and white satin which crackled about her\nwith every movement, in the swelling ermine of the _kazabaika_\nin which she carelessly nestled.\n\n\"Please,\" I stammered, \"but you will be angry with me.\"\n\n\"Do with me what you will,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Well, then whip me, or I shall go mad.\"\n\n\"Haven't I forbidden you,\" said Wanda sternly, \"but you are\nincorrigible.\"\n\n\"Oh, I am so terribly in love.\" I had sunken on my knees, and was\nburying my glowing face in her lap.\n\n\"I really believe,\" said Wanda thoughtfully, \"that your madness is\nnothing but a demonic, unsatisfied sensuality. _Our unnatural way\nof life must generate such illnesses._ Were you less virtuous, you\nwould be completely sane.\"\n\n\"Well then, make me sane,\" I murmured. My hands were running through\nher hair and playing tremblingly with the gleaming fur, which rose\nand fell like a moonlit wave upon her heaving bosom, and drove all\nmy senses into confusion.\n\nAnd I kissed her. No, she kissed me savagely, pitilessly, as if she\nwanted to slay me with her kisses. I was as in a delirium, and had\nlong since lost my reason, but now I, too, was breathless. I sought\nto free myself.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.\n\n\"I am suffering agonies.\"\n\n\"You are suffering--\" she broke out into a loud amused laughter.\n\n\"You laugh!\" I moaned, \"have you no idea--\"\n\nShe was serious all of a sudden. She raised my head in her hands,\nand with a violent gesture drew me to her breast.\n\n\"Wanda,\" I stammered.\n\n\"Of course, you enjoy suffering,\" she said, and laughed again, \"but\nwait, I'll bring you to your senses.\"\n\n\"No, I will no longer ask,\" I exclaimed, \"whether you want to belong\nto me for always or for only a brief moment of intoxication. I want\nto drain my happiness to the full. You are mine now, and I would\nrather lose you than never to have had you.\"\n\n\"Now you are sensible,\" she said. She kissed me again with her\nmurderous lips. I tore the ermine apart and the covering of lace and\nher naked breast surged against mine.\n\nThen my senses left me--\n\nThe first thing I remember is the moment when I saw blood dripping\nfrom my hand, and she asked apathetically: \"Did you scratch me?\"\n\n\"No, I believe, I have bitten you.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is strange how every relation in life assumes a different face as\nsoon as a new person enters.\n\nWe spent marvellous days together; we visited the mountains and\nlakes, we read together, and I completed Wanda's portrait. And how\nwe loved one another, how beautiful her smiling face was!\n\nThen a friend of hers arrived, a divorced woman somewhat older, more\nexperienced, and less scrupulous than Wanda. Her influence is already\nmaking itself felt in every direction.\n\nWanda wrinkles her brows, and displays a certain impatience with me.\n\nHas she ceased loving me?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor almost a fortnight this unbearable restraint has lain upon us.\nHer friend lives with her, and we are never alone. A circle of men\nsurrounds the young women. With my seriousness and melancholy I am\nplaying an absurd role as lover. Wanda treats me like a stranger.\n\nTo-day, while out walking, she staid behind with me. I saw that this\nwas done intentionally, and I rejoiced. But what did she tell me?\n\n\"My friend doesn't understand how I can love you. She doesn't think\nyou either handsome or particularly attractive otherwise. She is\ntelling me from morning till night about the glamour of the frivolous\nlife in the capital, hinting at the advantages to which I could lay\nclaim, the large parties which I would find there, and the\ndistinguished and handsome admirers which I would attract. But of\nwhat use is all this, since it happens that I love you.\"\n\nFor a moment I lost my breath, then I said: \"I have no wish to stand\nin the way of your happiness, Wanda. Do not consider me.\" Then I\nraised my hat, and let her go ahead. She looked at me surprised, but\ndid not answer a syllable.\n\nWhen by chance I happened to be close to her on the way back, she\nsecretly pressed my hand. Her glance was so radiant, so full of\npromised happiness, that in a moment all the torments of these days\nwere forgotten and all their wounds healed.\n\nI now am aware again of how much I love her.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"My friend has complained about you,\" said Wanda to-day.\n\n\"Perhaps she feels that I despise her.\"\n\n\"But why do you despise her, you foolish young man?\" exclaimed\nWanda, pulling my ears with both hands.\n\n\"Because she is a hypocrite,\" I said. \"I respect only a woman who is\nactually virtuous, or who openly lives for pleasure's sake.\"\n\n\"Like me, for instance,\" replied Wanda jestingly, \"but you see,\nchild, a woman can only do that in the rarest cases. She can neither\nbe as gaily sensual, nor as spiritually free as man; her state is\nalways a mixture of the sensual and spiritual. Her heart desires to\nenchain man permanently, while she herself is ever subject to the\ndesire for change. The result is a conflict, and thus usually against\nher wishes lies and deception enter into her actions and personality\nand corrupt her character.\"\n\n\"Certainly that is true,\" I said. \"The transcendental character with\nwhich woman wants to stamp love leads her to deception.\"\n\n\"But the world likewise demands it,\" Wanda interrupted. \"Look at\nthis woman. She has a husband and a lover in Lemberg and has found\na new admirer here. She deceives all three and yet is honored by all\nand respected by the world.\"\n\n\"I don't care,\" I exclaimed, \"but she is to leave you alone; she\ntreats you like an article of commerce.\"\n\n\"Why not?\" the beautiful woman interrupted vivaciously. \"Every woman\nhas the instinct or desire to draw advantage out of her attractions,\nand much is to be said for giving one's self without love or pleasure\nbecause if you do it in cold blood, you can reap profit to best\nadvantage.\"\n\n\"Wanda, what are you saying?\"\n\n\"Why not?\" she said, \"and take note of what I am about to say to you.\n_Never feel secure with the woman you love,_ for there are more\ndangers in woman's nature than you imagine. Women are neither as\n_good_ as their admirers and defenders maintain, nor as _bad_ as their\nenemies make them out to be. _Woman's character is characterlessness._\nThe best woman will momentarily go down into the mire, and the worst\nunexpectedly rises to deeds of greatness and goodness and puts to\nshame those that despise her. No woman is so good or so bad, but that\nat any moment she is capable of the most diabolical as well as of the\nmost divine, of the filthiest as well as of the purest, thoughts,\nemotions, and actions. In spite of all the advances of civilization,\nwoman has remained as she came out of the hand of nature. She has the\nnature of a savage, who is faithful or faithless, magnanimous or\ncruel, according to the impulse that dominates at the moment.\nThroughout history it has always been a serious deep culture which has\nproduced moral character. Man even when he is selfish or evil always\nfollows _principles,_ woman never follows anything but _impulses._\nDon't ever forget that, and never feel secure with the woman you\nlove.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nHer friend has left. At last an evening alone with her again. It\nseems as if Wanda had saved up all the love, which had been kept from\nher, for this superlative evening; never had she been so kind, so\nnear, so full of tenderness.\n\nWhat happiness to cling to her lips, and to die away in her arms! In\na state of relaxation and wholly mine, her head rests against my\nbreast, and with drunken rapture our eyes seek each other.\n\nI cannot yet believe, comprehend, that this woman is mine, wholly\nmine.\n\n\"She is right on one point,\" Wanda began, without moving, without\nopening her eyes, as if she were asleep.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\nShe remained silent.\n\n\"Your friend?\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, she is right, you are not a man, you are a\ndreamer, a charming cavalier, and you certainly would be a priceless\nslave, but I cannot imagine you as husband.\"\n\nI was frightened.\n\n\"What is the matter? You are trembling?\"\n\n\"I tremble at the thought of how easily I might lose you,\" I replied.\n\n\"Are you made less happy now, because of this?\" she replied. \"Does\nit rob you of any of your joys, that I have belonged to another\nbefore I did to you, that others after you will possess me, and would\nyou enjoy less if another were made happy simultaneously with you?\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"You see,\" she continued, \"that would be a way out. You won't ever\nlose me then. I care deeply for you and intellectually we are\nharmonious, and I should like to live with you always, if in addition\nto you I might have--\"\n\n\"What an idea,\" I cried. \"You fill me with a sort of horror.\"\n\n\"Do you love me any the less?\"\n\n\"On the contrary.\"\n\nWanda had raised herself on her left arm. \"I believe,\" she said,\n\"that to hold a man permanently, it is vitally important not to be\nfaithful to him. What honest woman has ever been as devotedly loved\nas a hetaira?\"\n\n\"There is a painful stimulus in the unfaithfulness of a beloved\nwoman. It is the highest kind of ecstacy.\"\n\n\"For you, too?\" Wanda asked quickly.\n\n\"For me, too.\"\n\n\"And if I should give you that pleasure,\" Wanda exclaimed mockingly.\n\n\"I shall suffer terrible agonies, but I shall adore you the more,\"\nI replied. \"But you would never deceive me, you would have the daemonic\ngreatness of saying to me: I shall love no one but you, but I shall\nmake happy whoever pleases me.\"\n\nWanda shook her head. \"I don't like deception, I am honest, but what\nman exists who can support the burden of truth. Were I say to you:\nthis serene, sensual life, this paganism is my ideal, would you be\nstrong enough to bear it?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I could endure anything so as not to lose you. I feel\nhow little I really mean to you.\"\n\n\"But Severin--\"\n\n\"But it is so,\" said I, \"and just for that reason--\"\n\n\"For that reason you would--\" she smiled roguishly--\"have I guessed\nit?\"\n\n\"Be your slave!\" I exclaimed. \"Be your unrestricted property,\nwithout a will of my own, of which you could dispose as you wished,\nand which would therefore never be a burden to you. While you drink\nlife at its fullness, while surrounded by luxury, you enjoy the\nserene happiness and Olympian love, I want to be your servant, put\non and take off your shoes.\"\n\n\"You really aren't so far from wrong,\" replied Wanda, \"for only as\nmy slave could you endure my loving others. Furthermore the freedom\nof enjoyment of the ancient world is unthinkable without slavery. It\nmust give one a feeling of like unto a god to see a man kneel before\none and tremble. I want a slave, do you hear, Severin?\"\n\n\"Am I not your slave?\"\n\n\"Then listen to me,\" said Wanda excitedly, seizing my hand. \"I want\nto be yours, as long as I love you.\"\n\n\"A month?\"\n\n\"Perhaps, even two.\"\n\n\"And then?\"\n\n\"Then you become my slave.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"I? Why do you ask? I am a goddess and sometimes I descend from my\nOlympian heights to you, softly, very softly, and secretly.\n\n\"But what does all this mean,\" said Wanda, resting her head in both\nhands with her gaze lost in the distance, \"a golden fancy which never\ncan become true.\" An uncanny brooding melancholy seemed shed over her\nentire being; I have never seen her like that.\n\n\"Why unachievable?\" I began.\n\n\"Because slavery doesn't exist any longer.\"\n\n\"Then we will go to a country where it still exists, to the Orient,\nto Turkey,\" I said eagerly.\n\n\"You would--Severin--in all seriousness,\" Wanda replied. Her eyes\nburned.\n\n\"Yes, in all seriousness, I want to be your slave,\" I continued. \"I\nwant your power over me to be sanctified by law; I want my life to\nbe in your hands, I want nothing that could protect or save me from\nyou. Oh, what a voluptuous joy when once I feel myself entirely dependent\nupon your absolute will, your whim, at your beck and call. And then\nwhat happiness, when at some time you deign to be gracious, and the\nslave may kiss the lips which mean life and death to him.\" I knelt\ndown, and leaned my burning forehead against her knee.\n\n\"You are talking as in a fever,\" said Wanda agitatedly, \"and you\nreally love me so endlessly.\" She held me to her breast, and covered\nme with kisses.\n\n\"You really want it?\"\n\n\"I swear to you now by God and my honor, that I shall be your slave,\nwherever and whenever you wish it, as soon as you command,\" I\nexclaimed, hardly master of myself.\n\n\"And if I take you at your word?\" said Wanda.\n\n\"Please do!\"\n\n\"All this appeals to me,\" she said then. \"It is different from\nanything else--to know that a man who worships me, and whom I love\nwith all my heart, is so wholly mine, dependent on my will and\ncaprice, my possession and slave, while I--\"\n\nShe looked strangely at me.\n\n\"If I should become frightfully frivolous you are to blame,\" she\ncontinued. \"It almost seems as if you were afraid of me already, but\nyou have sworn.\"\n\n\"And I shall keep my oath.\"\n\n\"I shall see to that,\" she replied. \"I am beginning to enjoy it,\nand, heaven help me, we won't stick to fancies now. You shall become\nmy slave, and I--I shall try to be _Venus in Furs_.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI thought that at last I knew this woman, understood her, and now I\nsee I have to begin at the very beginning again. Only a little while\nago her reaction to my dreams was violently hostile, and now she\ntries to carry them into execution with the soberest seriousness.\n\nShe has drawn up a contract according to which I give my word of\nhonor and agree under oath to be her slave, as long as she wishes.\n\nWith her arm around my neck she reads this, unprecedented,\nincredible document to me. The end of each sentence she punctuates\nwith a kiss.\n\n\"But all the obligations in the contract are on my side,\" I said,\nteasing her.\n\n\"Of course,\" she replied with great seriousness, \"you cease to be my\nlover, and consequently I am released from all duties and obligations\ntowards you. You will have to look upon my favors as pure\nbenevolence. You no longer have any rights, and no longer can lay\nclaim to any. There can be no limit to my power over you. Remember,\nthat you won't be much better than a dog, or some inanimate object.\nYou will be mine, my plaything, which I can break to pieces, whenever\nI want an hour's amusement. You are nothing, I am everything. Do you\nunderstand?\" She laughed and kissed me again, and yet a sort of cold\nshiver ran through me.\n\n\"Won't you allow me a few conditions--\" I began.\n\n\"Conditions?\" She contracted her forehead. \"Ah! You are afraid\nalready, or perhaps you regret, but it is too late now. You have\nsworn, I have your word of honor. But let me hear them.\"\n\n\"First of all I should like to have it included in our contract,\nthat you will never completely leave me, and then that you will never\ngive me over to the mercies of any of your admirers--\"\n\n\"But Severin,\" exclaimed Wanda with her voice full of emotion and\nwith tears in her eyes, \"how can you imagine that I--and you, a man\nwho loves me so absolutely, who puts himself so entirely in my power--\"\nShe halted.\n\n\"No, no!\" I said, covering her hands with kisses. \"I don't fear\nanything from you that might dishonor me. Forgive me the ugly\nthought.\"\n\nWanda smiled happily, leaned her cheek against mine, and seemed to\nreflect.\n\n\"You have forgotten something,\" she whispered coquettishly, \"the\nmost important thing!\"\n\n\"A condition?\"\n\n\"Yes, that I must always wear my furs,\" exclaimed Wanda. \"But I\npromise you I'll do that anyhow because they give me a despotic\nfeeling. And I shall be very cruel to you, do you understand?\"\n\n\"Shall I sign the contract?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not yet,\" said Wanda. \"I shall first add your conditions, and the\nactual signing won't occur until the proper time and place.\"\n\n\"In Constantinople?\"\n\n\"No. I have thought things over. What special value would there be\nin owning a slave where everyone owns slaves. What I want is to\n_have a slave, I alone,_ here in our civilized sober, Philistine\nworld, and a slave who submits helplessly to my power solely on\naccount of my beauty and personality, not because of law, of property\nrights, or compulsions. This attracts me. But at any rate we will go\nto a country where we are not known and where you can appear before\nthe world as my servant without embarrassment. Perhaps to Italy, to\nRome or Naples.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWe were sitting on Wanda's ottoman. She wore her ermine jacket, her\nhair was loose and fell like a lion's mane down her back. She clung\nto my lips, drawing my soul from my body. My head whirled, my blood\nbegan to seethe, my heart beat violently against hers.\n\n\"I want to be absolutely in your power, Wanda,\" I exclaimed\nsuddenly, seized by that frenzy of passion when I can scarcely think\nclearly or decide freely. \"I want to put myself absolutely at your\nmercy for good or evil without any condition, without any limit to\nyour power.\"\n\nWhile saying this I had slipped from the ottoman, and lay at her\nfeet looking up at her with drunken eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful you now are,\" she exclaimed, \"your eyes half-broken\nin ecstacy fill me with joy, carry me away. How wonderful your look\nwould be if you were being beaten to death, in the extreme agony. You\nhave the eye of a martyr.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nSometimes, nevertheless, I have an uneasy feeling about placing\nmyself so absolutely, so unconditionally into a woman's hands.\nSuppose she did abuse my passion, her power?\n\nWell, then I would experience what has occupied my imagination since\nmy childhood, what has always given me the feeling of seductive\nterror. A foolish apprehension! It will be a wanton game she will play\nwith me, nothing more. She loves me, and she is good, a noble\npersonality, incapable of a breach of faith. But it lies in her hands\n--_if she wants to she can._ What a temptation in this doubt, this\nfear!\n\nNow I understand Manon l'Escault and the poor chevalier, who, even\nin the pillory, while she was another man's mistress, still adored\nher.\n\nLove knows no virtue, no profit; it loves and forgives and suffers\neverything, because it must. It is not our judgment that leads us;\nit is neither the advantages nor the faults which we discover, that\nmake us abandon ourselves, or that repel us.\n\nIt is a sweet, soft, enigmatic power that drives us on. We cease to\nthink, to feel, to will; we let ourselves be carried away by it, and\nask not whither?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA Russian prince made his first appearance today on the promenade.\nHe aroused general interest on account of his athletic figure,\nmagnificent face, and splendid bearing. The women particularly gaped\nat him as though he were a wild animal, but he went his way gloomily\nwithout paying attention to any one. He was accompanied by two\nservants, one a negro, completely dressed in red satin, and the other\na Circassian in his full gleaming uniform. Suddenly he saw Wanda, and\nfixed his cold piercing look upon her; he even turned his head after\nher, and when she had passed, he stood still and followed her with\nhis eyes.\n\nAnd she--she veritably devoured him with her radiant green eyes--and\ndid everything possible to meet him again.\n\nThe cunning coquetry with which she walked, moved, and looked at\nhim, almost stifled me. On the way home I remarked about it. She knit\nher brows.\n\n\"What do you want,\" she said, \"the prince is a man whom I might\nlike, who even dazzles me, and I am free. I can do what I please--\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any longer--\" I stammered, frightened.\n\n\"I love only you,\" she replied, \"but I shall have the prince pay\ncourt to me.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Aren't you my slave?\" she said calmly. \"Am I not Venus, the cruel\nnorthern Venus in Furs?\"\n\nI was silent. I felt literally crushed by her words; her cold look\nentered my heart like a dagger.\n\n\"You will find out immediately the prince's name, residence, and\ncircumstances,\" she continued. \"Do you understand?\"\n\n\"But--\"\n\n\"No argument, obey!\" exclaimed Wanda, more sternly than I would have\nthought possible for her, \"and don't dare to enter my sight until you\ncan answer my questions.\"\n\nIt was not till afternoon that I could obtain the desired\ninformation for Wanda. She let me stand before her like a servant,\nwhile she leaned back in her arm-chair and listened to me, smiling.\nThen she nodded; she seemed to be satisfied.\n\n\"Bring me my footstool,\" she commanded shortly.\n\nI obeyed, and after having put it before her and having put her feet\non it, I remained kneeling.\n\n\"How will this end?\" I asked sadly after a short pause.\n\nShe broke into playful laughter. \"Why things haven't even begun yet.\"\n\n\"You are more heartless than I imagined,\" I replied, hurt.\n\n\"Severin,\" Wanda began earnestly. \"I haven't done anything yet, not\nthe slightest thing, and you are already calling me heartless. What\nwill happen when I begin to carry your dreams to their realization,\nwhen I shall lead a gay, free life and have a circle of admirers\nabout me, when I shall actually fulfil your ideal, tread you\nunderfoot and apply the lash?\"\n\n\"You take my dreams too seriously.\"\n\n\"Too seriously? I can't stop at make-believe, when once I begin,\"\nshe replied. \"You know I hate all play-acting and comedy. You have\nwished it. Was it my idea or yours? Did I persuade you or did you\ninflame my imagination? I am taking things seriously now.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I replied, caressingly, \"listen quietly to me. We love each\nother infinitely, we are very happy, will you sacrifice our entire\nfuture to a whim?\"\n\n\"It is no longer a whim,\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked frightened.\n\n\"Something that was probably latent in me,\" she said quietly and\nthoughtfully. \"Perhaps it would never have come to light, if you had\nnot called it to life, and made it grow. Now that it has become a\npowerful impulse, fills my whole being, now that I enjoy it, now that\nI cannot and do not want to do otherwise, now you want to back out--\nyou--are you a man?\"\n\n\"Dear, sweet Wanda!\" I began to caress her, kiss her.\n\n\"Don't--you are not a man--\"\n\n\"And you,\" I flared up.\n\n\"I am stubborn,\" she said, \"you know that. I haven't a strong\nimagination, and like you I am weak in execution. But when I make up\nmy mind to do something, I carry it through, and the more certainly,\nthe more opposition I meet. Leave me alone!\"\n\nShe pushed me away, and got up.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I likewise rose, and stood facing her.\n\n\"Now you know what I am,\" she continued. \"Once more I warn you. You\nstill have the choice. I am not compelling you to be my slave.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I replied with emotion and tears filling my eyes, \"don't\nyou know how I love you?\"\n\nHer lips quivered contemptuously.\n\n\"You are mistaken, you make yourself out worse than you are; you are\ngood and noble by nature--\"\n\n\"What do you know about my nature,\" she interrupted vehemently, \"you\nwill get to know me as I am.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Decide, will you submit, unconditionally?\"\n\n\"And if I say no.\"\n\n\"Then--\"\n\nShe stepped close up to me, cold and contemptuous. As she stood\nbefore me now, the arms folded across her breast, with an evil smile\nabout her lips, she was in fact the despotic woman of my dreams. Her\nexpression seemed hard, and nothing lay in her eyes that promised\nkindness or mercy.\n\n\"Well--\" she said at last.\n\n\"You are angry,\" I cried, \"you will punish me.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" she replied, \"I shall let you go. You are free. I am not\nholding you.\"\n\n\"Wanda--I, who love you so--\"\n\n\"Yes, you, my dear sir, you who adore me,\" she exclaimed\ncontemptuously, \"but who are a coward, a liar, and a breaker of\npromises. Leave me instantly--\"\n\n\"Wanda I--\"\n\n\"Wretch!\"\n\nMy blood rose in my heart. I threw myself down at her feet and began\nto cry.\n\n\"Tears, too!\" She began to laugh. Oh, this laughter was frightful.\n\"Leave me--I don't want to see you again.\"\n\n\"Oh my God!\" I cried, beside myself. \"I will do whatever you\ncommand, be your slave, a mere object with which you can do what you\nwill--only don't send me away--I can't bear it--I cannot live without\nyou.\" I embraced her knees, and covered her hand with kisses.\n\n\"Yes, you must be a slave, and feel the lash, for you are not a\nman,\" she said calmly. She said this to me with perfect composure,\nnot angrily, not even excitedly, and it was what hurt most. \"Now I\nknow you, your dog-like nature, that adores where it is kicked, and\nthe more, the more it is maltreated. Now I know you, and now you\nshall come to know me.\"\n\nShe walked up and down with long strides, while I remained crushed\non my knees; my head was hanging supine, tears flowed from my eyes.\n\n\"Come here,\" Wanda commanded harshly, sitting down on the ottoman.\nI obeyed her command, and sat down beside her. She looked at me\nsombrely, and then a light suddenly seemed to illuminate the interior\nof her eye. Smiling, she drew me toward her breast, and began to kiss\nthe tears out of my eyes.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe odd part of my situation is that I am like the bear in Lily's\npark. I can escape and don't want to; I am ready to endure everything\nas soon as she threatens to set me free.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIf only she would use the whip again. There is something uncanny in\nthe kindness with which she treats me. I seem like a little captive\nmouse with which a beautiful cat prettily plays. She is ready at any\nmoment to tear it to pieces, and my heart of a mouse threatens to\nburst.\n\nWhat are her intentions? What does she purpose to do with me?\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt seems she has completely forgotten the contract, my slavehood. Or\nwas it actually only stubbornness? And she gave up her whole plan as\nsoon as I no longer opposed her and submitted to her imperial whim?\n\nHow kind she is to me, how tender, how loving! We are spending\nmarvellously happy days.\n\nTo-day she had me read to her the scene between Faust and\nMephistopheles, in which the latter appears as a wandering scholar.\nHer glance hung on me with strange pleasure.\n\n\"I don't understand,\" she said when I had finished, \"how a man who\ncan read such great and beautiful thoughts with such expression, and\ninterpret them so clearly, concisely, and intelligently, can at the\nsame time be such a visionary and supersensual ninny as you are.\"\n\n\"Were you pleased,\" said I, and kissed her forehead.\n\nShe gently stroked my brow. \"I love you, Severin,\" she whispered. \"I\ndon't believe I could ever love any one more than you. Let us be\nsensible, what do you say?\"\n\nInstead of replying I folded her in my arms; a deep inward, yet\nvaguely sad happiness filled my breast, my eyes grew moist, and a\ntear fell upon her hand.\n\n\"How can you cry!\" she exclaimed, \"you are a child!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn a pleasure drive we met the Russian prince in his carriage. He\nseemed to be unpleasantly surprised to see me by Wanda's side, and\nlooked as if he wanted to pierce her through and through with his\nelectric gray eyes. She, however, did not seem to notice him. I felt\nat that moment like kneeling down before her and kissing her feet.\nShe let her glance glide over him indifferently as though he were an\ninanimate object, a tree, for instance, and turned to me with her\ngracious smile.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I said good-night to her to-day she seemed suddenly\nunaccountably distracted and moody. What was occupying her?\n\n\"I am sorry you are going,\" she said when I was already standing on\nthe threshold.\n\n\"It is entirely in your hands to shorten the hard period of my\ntrial, to cease tormenting me--\" I pleaded.\n\n\"Do you imagine that this compulsion isn't a torment for me, too,\"\nWanda interjected.\n\n\"Then end it,\" I exclaimed, embracing her, \"be my wife.\"\n\n\"_Never, Severin_,\" she said gently, but with great firmness.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\nI was frightened in my innermost soul.\n\n\"_You are not the man for me._\"\n\nI looked at her, and slowly withdrew my arm which was still about\nher waist; then I left the room, and she--she did not call me back.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA sleepless night; I made countless decisions, only to toss them\naside again. In the morning I wrote her a letter in which I declared\nour relationship dissolved. My hand trembled when I put on the seal,\nand I burned my fingers.\n\nAs I went upstairs to hand it to the maid, my knees threatened to\ngive way.\n\nThe door opened, and Wanda thrust forth her head full of curling-papers.\n\n\"I haven't had my hair dressed yet,\" she said, smiling. \"What have\nyou there?\"\n\n\"A letter--\"\n\n\"For me?\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"Ah, you want to break with me,\" she exclaimed, mockingly.\n\n\"Didn't you tell me yesterday that I wasn't the man for you?\"\n\n_\"I repeat it now!\"_\n\n\"Very well, then.\" My whole body was trembling, my voice failed me,\nand I handed her the letter.\n\n\"Keep it,\" she said, measuring me coldly. \"You forget that is no\nlonger a question as to whether you satisfy me as a man; as a _slave_\nyou will doubtless do well enough.\"\n\n\"Madame!\" I exclaimed, aghast.\n\n\"That is what you will call me in the future,\" replied Wanda,\nthrowing back her head with a movement of unutterable contempt. \"Put\nyour affairs in order within the next twenty-four hours. The day\nafter to-morrow I shall start for Italy, and you will accompany me\nas my servant.\"\n\n\"Wanda--\"\n\n\"I forbid any sort of familiarity,\" she said, cutting my words short,\n\"likewise you are not to come in unless I call or ring for you, and\nyou are not to speak to me until you are spoken to. From now on your\nname is no longer Severin, but _Gregor_.\"\n\nI trembled with rage, and yet, unfortunately, I cannot deny it, I\nalso felt a strange pleasure and stimulation.\n\n\"But, madame, you know my circumstances,\" I began in my confusion.\n\"I am dependent on my father, and I doubt whether he will give me the\nlarge sum of money needed for this journey--\"\n\n\"That means you have no money, Gregor,\" said Wanda, delightedly, \"so\nmuch the better, you are then entirely dependent on me, and in fact\nmy slave.\"\n\n\"You don't consider,\" I tried to object, \"that as man of honor it is\nimpossible for me--\"\n\n\"I have indeed considered it,\" she replied almost with a tone of\ncommand. \"As a man of honor you must keep your oath and redeem your\npromise to follow me as slave whithersoever I demand and to obey\nwhatever I command. Now leave me, Gregor!\"\n\nI turned toward the door.\n\n\"Not yet--you may first kiss my hand.\" She held it out to me with a\ncertain proud indifference, and I the dilettante, the donkey, the\nmiserable slave pressed it with intense tenderness against my lips\nwhich were dry and hot with excitement.\n\nThere was another gracious nod of the head.\n\nThen I was dismissed.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThough it was late in the evening my light was still lit, and a fire\nwas burning in the large green stove. There were still many things\namong my letters and documents to be put in order. Autumn, as is\nusually the case with us, had fallen with all its power.\n\nSuddenly she knocked at my window with the handle of her whip.\n\nI opened and saw her standing outside in her ermine-lined jacket and\nin a high round Cossack cap of ermine of the kind which the great\nCatherine favored.\n\n\"Are you ready, Gregor?\" she asked darkly.\n\n\"Not yet, mistress,\" I replied.\n\n\"I like that word,\" she said then, \"you are always to call me\nmistress, do you understand? We leave here to-morrow morning at nine\no'clock. As far as the district capital you will be my companion and\nfriend, but from the moment that we enter the railway-coach you are\nmy slave, my servant. Now close the window, and open the door.\"\n\nAfter I had done as she had demanded, and after she had entered, she\nasked, contracting her brows ironically, \"well, how do you like me.\"\n\n\"Wanda, you--\"\n\n\"Who gave you permission?\" She gave me a blow with the whip.\n\n\"You are very beautiful, mistress.\"\n\nWanda smiled and sat down in the arm-chair. \"Kneel down--here beside\nmy chair.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"Kiss my hand.\"\n\nI seized her small cold hand and kissed it.\n\n\"And the mouth--\"\n\nIn a surge of passion I threw my arms around the beautiful cruel\nwoman, and covered her face, arms, and breast with glowing kisses.\nShe returned them with equal fervor--the eyelids closed as in a\ndream. It was after midnight when she left.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAt nine o'clock sharp in the morning everything was ready for departure,\nas she had ordered. We left the little Carpathian health-resort in a\ncomfortable light carriage. The most interesting drama of my life had\nreached a point of development whose denouement it was then impossible\nto foretell.\n\nSo far everything went well. I sat beside Wanda, and she chatted\nvery graciously and intelligently with me, as with a good friend,\nconcerning Italy, Pisemski's new novel, and Wagner's music. She wore\na sort of Amazonesque travelling-dress of black cloth with a short\njacket of the same material, set with dark fur. It fitted closely and\nshowed her figure to best advantage. Over it she wore dark furs. Her\nhair wound into an antique knot, lay beneath a small dark fur-hat\nfrom which a black veil hung. Wanda was in very good humor; she fed\nme candies, played with my hair, loosened my neck cloth and made a\npretty cockade of it; she covered my knees with her furs and\nstealthily pressed the fingers of my hand. When our Jewish driver\npersistently went on nodding to himself, she even gave me a kiss, and\nher cold lips had the fresh frosty fragrance of a young autumnal\nrose, which blossoms alone amid bare stalks and yellow leaves and\nupon whose calyx the first frost has hung tiny diamonds of ice.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWe are at the district capital. We get out at the railway station.\nWanda throws off her furs and places them over my arm, and goes\nto secure the tickets.\n\nWhen she returns she has completely changed.\n\n\"Here is your ticket, Gregor,\" she says in a tone which supercilious\nladies use to their servants.\n\n\"A third-class ticket,\" I reply with comic horror.\n\n\"Of course,\" she continues, \"but now be careful. You won't get on\nuntil I am settled in my compartment and don't need you any longer.\nAt each station you will hurry to my car and ask for my orders. Don't\nforget. And now give me my furs.\"\n\nAfter I had helped her into them, humbly like a slave, she went to\nfind an empty first-class coupe. I followed. Supporting herself on\nmy shoulder, she got on and I wrapped her feet in bear-skins and placed\nthem on the warming bottle.\n\nThen she nodded to me, and dismissed me. I slowly ascended a third-class\ncarriage, which was filled with abominable tobacco-smoke that seemed\nlike the fogs of Acheron at the entrance to Hades. I now had the leisure\nto muse about the riddle of human existence, and about its greatest\nriddle of all--_woman_.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhenever the train stops, I jump off, run to her carriage, and with\ndrawn cap await her orders. She wants coffee and then a glass of\nwater, at another time a bowl of warm water to wash her hands, and\nthus it goes on. She lets several men who have entered her\ncompartment pay court to her. I am dying of jealousy and have to leap\nabout like an antelope so as to secure what she wants quickly and\nnot miss the train.\n\nIn this way the night passes. I haven't had time to eat a mouthful\nand I can't sleep, I have to breathe the same oniony air with Polish\npeasants, Jewish peddlers, and common soldiers.\n\nWhen I mount the steps of her coupe, she is lying stretched out\non cushions in her comfortable furs, covered up with the skins of\nanimals. She is like an oriental despot, and the men sit like Indian\ndeities, straight upright against the walls and scarcely dare to\nbreathe.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe stops over in Vienna for a day to go shopping, and particularly\nto buy series of luxurious gowns. She continues to treat me as her\nservant. I follow her at the respectful distance of ten paces. She\nhands me her packages without so much as even deigning a kind look,\nand laden down like a donkey I pant along behind.\n\nBefore leaving she takes all my clothes and gives them to the hotel\nwaiters. I am ordered to put on her livery. It is a Cracovian costume\nin her colors, light-blue with red facings, and red quadrangular cap,\nornamented with peacock-feathers. The costume is rather becoming to\nme.\n\nThe silver buttons bear her coat of arms. I have the feeling of having\nbeen sold or of having bonded myself to the devil. My fair demon leads\nme from Vienna to Florence. Instead of linen-garbed Mazovians and\ngreasy-haired Jews, my companions now are curly-haired Contadini, a\nmagnificent sergeant of the first Italian Grenadiers, and a poor German\npainter. The tobacco smoke no longer smells of onions, but of salami and\ncheese.\n\nNight has fallen again. I lie on my wooden bed as on a rack; my arms and\nlegs seem broken. But there nevertheless is an element of poetry in the\naffair. The stars sparkle round about, the Italian sergeant has a face\nlike Apollo Belvedere, and the German painter sings a lovely German\nsong.\n\n\"Now that all the shadows gather\nAnd endless stars grow light,\nDeep yearning on me falls\nAnd softly fills the night.\"\n\n\"Through the sea of dreams\nSailing without cease,\nSailing goes my soul\nIn thine to find release.\"\n\nAnd I am thinking of the beautiful woman who is sleeping in regal\ncomfort among her soft furs.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFlorence! Crowds, cries, importunate porters and cab-drivers. Wanda\nchooses a carriage, and dismisses the porters.\n\n\"What have I a servant for,\" she says, \"Gregor--here is the ticket--\nget the luggage.\"\n\nShe wraps herself in her furs and sits quietly in the carriage while I\ndrag the heavy trunks hither, one after another. I break down for a\nmoment under the last one; a good-natured _carabiniere_ with an\nintelligent face comes to my assistance. She laughs.\n\n\"It must be heavy,\" said she, \"all my furs are in it.\"\n\nI get up on the driver's seat, wiping drops of perspiration from my\nbrow. She gives the name of the hotel, and the driver urges on his\nhorse. In a few minutes we halt at the brilliantly illuminated\nentrance.\n\n\"Have you any rooms?\" she asks the portier.\n\n\"Yes, madame.\"\n\n\"Two for me, one for my servant, all with stoves.\"\n\n\"Two first-class rooms for you, madame, both with stoves,\" replied\nthe waiter who had hastily come up, \"and one without heat for your\nservant.\"\n\nShe looked at them, and then abruptly said: \"they are satisfactory,\nhave fires built at once; my servant can sleep in the unheated room.\"\n\nI merely looked at her.\n\n\"Bring up the trunks, Gregor,\" she commands, paying no attention to\nmy looks. \"In the meantime I'll be dressing, and then will go down\nto the dining-room, and you can eat something for supper.\"\n\nAs she goes into the adjoining room, I drag the trunks upstairs and\nhelp the waiter build a fire in her bed-room. He tries to question\nme in bad French about my employer. With a brief glance I see the\nblazing fire, the fragrant white poster-bed, and the rugs which cover\nthe floor. Tired and hungry I then descend the stairs, and ask for\nsomething to eat. A good-natured waiter, who used to be in the\nAustrian army and takes all sorts of pains to entertain me in German,\nshows me the dining-room and waits on me. I have just had the first\nfresh drink in thirty-six hours and the first bite of warm food on\nmy fork, when she enters.\n\nI rise.\n\n\"What do you mean by taking me into a dining-room in which my\nservant is eating,\" she snaps at the waiter, flaring with anger. She\nturns around and leaves.\n\nMeanwhile I thank heaven that I am permitted to go on eating. Later\nI climb the four flights upstairs to my room. My small trunk is\nalready there, and a miserable little oil-lamp is burning. It is a\nnarrow room without fire-place, without a window, but with a small\nair-hole. If it weren't so beastly cold, it would remind me of one\nof the Venetian _piombi_. [Footnote: These were notorious prisons\nunder the leaden roof of the Palace of the Doges.] Involuntarily I\nhave to laugh out aloud, so that it re-echoes, and I am startled by\nmy own laughter.\n\nSuddenly the door is pulled open and the waiter with a theatrical\nItalian gesture calls \"You are to come down to madame, at once.\" I\npick up my cap, stumble down the first few steps, but finally arrive\nin front of her door on the first floor and knock.\n\n\"Come in!\"\n\nI enter, shut the door, and stand attention.\n\nWanda has made herself comfortable. She is sitting in a neglige of\nwhite muslin and laces on a small red divan with her feet on a\nfootstool that matches. She has thrown her fur-cloak about her. It\nis the identical cloak in which she appeared to me for the first time,\nas goddess of love.\n\nThe yellow lights of the candelabra which stand on projections,\ntheir reflections in the large mirrors, and the red flames from the\nopen fireplace play beautifully on the green velvet, the dark-brown\nsable of the cloak, the smooth white skin, and the red, flaming hair\nof the beautiful woman. Her clear, but cold face is turned toward me,\nand her cold green eyes rest upon me.\n\n\"I am satisfied with you, Gregor,\" she began.\n\nI bowed.\n\n\"Come closer.\"\n\nI obeyed.\n\n\"Still closer,\" she looked down, and stroked the sable with her\nhand. \"Venus in Furs receives her slave. I can see that you are more\nthan an ordinary dreamer, you don't remain far in arrears of your\ndreams; you are the sort of man who is ready to carry his dreams into\neffect, no matter how mad they are. I confess, I like this; it\nimpresses me. There is strength in this, and strength is the only\nthing one respects. I actually believe that under unusual\ncircumstances, in a period of great deeds, what seems to be your\nweakness would reveal itself as extraordinary power. Under the early\nemperors you would have been a martyr, at the time of the Reformation\nan anabaptist, during the French Revolution one of those inspired\nGirondists who mounted the guillotine with the marseillaise on their\nlips. But you are my slave, my--\"\n\nShe suddenly leaped up; the furs slipped down, and she threw her\narms with soft pressure about my neck.\n\n\"My beloved slave, Severin, oh, how I love you, how I adore you, how\nhandsome you are in your Cracovian costume! You will be cold to-night\nup in your wretched room without a fire. Shall I give you one of my\nfurs, dear heart, the large one there--\"\n\nShe quickly picked it up, throwing it over my shoulders, and before\nI knew what had happened I was completely wrapped up in it.\n\n\"How wonderfully becoming furs are to your face, they bring out your\nnoble lines. As soon as you cease being my slave, you must wear a\nvelvet coat with sable, do you understand? Otherwise I shall never\nput on my fur-jacket again.\"\n\nAnd again she began to caress me and kiss me; finally she drew me\ndown on the little divan.\n\n\"You seem to be pleased with yourself in furs,\" she said. \"Quick,\nquick, give them to me, or I will lose all sense of dignity.\"\n\nI placed the furs about her, and Wanda slipped her right arm into\nthe sleeve.\n\n\"This is the pose in Titian's picture. But now enough of joking.\nDon't always look so solemn, it makes me feel sad. As far as the\nworld is concerned you are still merely my servant; you are not yet\nmy slave, for you have not yet signed the contract. You are still\nfree, and can leave me any moment. You have played your part\nmagnificently. I have been delighted, but aren't you tired of it\nalready, and don't you think I am abominable? Well, say something--I\ncommand it.\"\n\n\"Must I confess to you, Wanda?\" I began.\n\n\"Yes, you must.\"\n\n\"Even it you take advantage of it,\" I continued, \"I shall love you\nthe more deeply, adore you the more fanatically, the worse you treat\nme. What you have just done inflames my blood and intoxicates all my\nsenses.\" I held her close to me and clung for several moments to her\nmoist lips.\n\n\"Oh, you beautiful woman,\" I then exclaimed, looking at her. In my\nenthusiasm I tore the sable from her shoulders and pressed my mouth\nagainst her neck.\n\n\"You love me even when I am cruel,\" said Wanda, \"now go!--you bore\nme--don't you hear?\"\n\nShe boxed my ears so that I saw stars and bells rang in my ears.\n\n\"Help me into my furs, slave.\"\n\nI helped her, as well as I could.\n\n\"How awkward,\" she exclaimed, and was scarcely in it before she\nstruck me in the face again. I felt myself growing pale.\n\n\"Did I hurt you?\" she asked, softly touching me with her hand.\n\n\"No, no,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"At any rate you have no reason to complain, you want it thus; now\nkiss me again.\"\n\nI threw my arms about her, and her lips clung closely to mine. As\nshe lay against my breast in her large heavy furs, I had a curiously\noppressive sensation. It was as if a wild beast, a she-bear, were\nembracing me. It seemed as if I were about to feel her claws in my\nflesh. But this time the she-bear let me off easily.\n\nWith my heart filled with smiling hopes, I went up to my miserable\nservant's room, and threw myself down on my hard couch.\n\n\"Life is really amazingly droll,\" I thought. \"A short time ago the\nmost beautiful woman, Venus herself, rested against your breast, and\nnow you have an opportunity for studying the Chinese hell. Unlike us,\nthey don't hurl the damned into flames, but they have devils chasing\nthem out into fields of ice.\n\n\"Very likely the founders of their religion also slept in unheated\nrooms.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the night I startled out of my sleep with a scream. I had\nbeen dreaming of an icefield in which I had lost my way; I had been\nlooking in vain for a way out. Suddenly an eskimo drove up in a\nsleigh harnessed with reindeer; he had the face of the waiter who had\nshown me to the unheated room.\n\n\"What are you looking for here, my dear sir?\" he exclaimed. \"This is\nthe North Pole.\"\n\nA moment later he had disappeared, and Wanda flew over the smooth\nice on tiny skates. Her white satin skirt fluttered and crackled; the\nermine of her jacket and cap, but especially her face, gleamed whiter\nthan the snow. She shot toward me, inclosed me in her arms, and began\nto kiss me. Suddenly I felt my blood running warm down my side.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked horror-stricken.\n\nShe laughed, and as I looked at her now, it was no longer Wanda, but\na huge, white she-bear, who was digging her paws into my body.\n\nI cried out in despair, and still heard her diabolical laughter when\nI awoke, and looked about the room in surprise.\n\nEarly in the morning I stood at Wanda's door, and the waiter brought\nthe coffee. I took it from him, and served it to my beautiful\nmistress. She had already dressed, and looked magnificent, all fresh\nand roseate. She smiled graciously at me and called me back, when I\nwas about to withdraw respectfully.\n\n\"Come, Gregor, have your breakfast quickly too,\" she said, \"then we\nwill go house-hunting. I don't want to stay in the hotel any longer\nthan I have to. It is very embarassing here. If I chat with you for\nmore than a minute, people will immediately say: 'The fair Russian\nis having an affair with her servant, you see, the race of Catherines\nisn't extinct yet.'\"\n\nHalf an hour later we went out; Wanda was in her cloth-gown with the\nRussian cap, and I in my Cracovian costume. We created quite a stir. I\nwalked about ten paces behind, looking very solemn, but expected\nmomentarily to have to break out into loud laughter. There was scarcely\na street in which one or the other of the attractive houses did not bear\nthe sign _camere ammobiliate_. Wanda always sent me upstairs, and only\nwhen the apartment seemed to answer her requirements did she herself\nascend. By noon I was as tired as a stag-hound after the hunt.\n\nWe entered a new house and left it again without having found a suitable\nhabitation. Wanda was already somewhat out of humor. Suddenly she said\nto me: \"Severin, the seriousness with which you play your part is\ncharming, and the restrictions, which we have placed upon each other are\nreally annoying me. I can't stand it any longer, I do love you, I must\nkiss you. Let's go into one of the houses.\"\n\n\"But, my lady--\" I interposed.\n\n\"Gregor?\" She entered the next open corridor and ascended a few\nsteps of the dark stair-way; then she threw her arms about me with\npassionate tenderness and kissed me.\n\n\"Oh, Severin, you were very wise. You are much more dangerous as\nslave than I would have imagined; you are positively irrestible, and\nI am afraid I shall have to fall in love with you again.\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any longer then,\" I asked seized by a sudden\nfright.\n\nShe solemnly shook her head, but kissed me again with her swelling,\nadorable lips.\n\nWe returned to the hotel. Wanda had luncheon, and ordered me also\nquickly to get something to eat.\n\nOf course, I wasn't served as quickly as she, and so it happened\nthat just as I was carrying the second bite of my steak to my mouth,\nthe waiter entered and called out with his theatrical gesture:\n\"Madame wants you, at once.\"\n\nI took a rapid and painful leave of my food, and, tired and hungry,\nhurried toward Wanda, who was already on the street.\n\n\"I wouldn't have imagined you could be so cruel,\" I said\nreproachfully. \"With all these, fatiguing duties you don't even leave\nme time to eat in peace.\"\n\nWanda laughed gaily. \"I thought you had finished,\" she said, \"but\nnever mind. Man was born to suffer, and you in particular. The\nmartyrs didn't have any beefsteaks either.\"\n\nI followed her resentfully, gnawing at my hunger.\n\n\"I have given up the idea of finding a place in the city,\" Wanda\ncontinued. \"It will be difficult to find an entire floor which is\nshut off and where you can do as you please. In such a strange, mad\nrelationship as ours there must be no jarring note. I shall rent an\nentire villa--and you will be surprised. You have my permission now\nto satisfy your hunger, and look about a bit in Florence. I won't be\nhome till evening. If I need you then, I will have you called.\"\n\nI looked at the Duomo, the Palazzo Vecchio, the Logia di Lanzi, and\nthen I stood for a long time on the banks of the Arno. Again and\nagain I let my eyes rest on the magnificent ancient Florence, whose\nround cupolas and towers were drawn in soft lines against the blue,\ncloudless sky. I watched its splendid bridges beneath whose wide\narches the lively waves of the beautiful, yellow river ran, and the\ngreen hills which surrounded the city, bearing slender cypresses and\nextensive buildings, palaces and monasteries.\n\nIt is a different world, this one in which we are--a gay, sensuous,\nsmiling world. The landscape too has nothing of the seriousness and\nsomberness of ours. It is a long ways off to the last white villas\nscattered among the pale green of the mountains, and yet there isn't\na spot that isn't bright with sunlight. The people are less serious\nthan we; perhaps, they think less, but they all look as though they\nwere happy.\n\nIt is also maintained that death is easier in the South.\n\nI have a vague feeling now that such a thing as beauty without thorn\nand love of the senses without torment does exist.\n\nWanda has discovered a delightful little villa and rented it for the\nwinter. It is situated on a charming hill on the left bank of the\nArno, opposite the Cascine. It is surrounded by an attractive garden\nwith lovely paths, grass plots, and magnificent meadow of camelias.\nIt is only two stories high, quadrangular in the Italian fashion. An\nopen gallery runs along one side, a sort of loggia with plaster-casts\nof antique statues; stone steps lead from it down into the garden.\nFrom the gallery you enter a bath with a magnificent marble basin,\nfrom which winding stairs lead to my mistress' bed-chamber.\n\nWanda occupies the second story by herself.\n\nA room on the ground floor has been assigned to me; it is very\nattractive, and even has a fireplace.\n\nI have roamed through the garden. On a round hillock I discovered a\nlittle temple, but I found its door locked. However, there is a chink\nin the door and when I glue my eye to it, I see the goddess of love\non a white pedestal.\n\nA slight shudder passes over me. It seems to me as if she were\nsmiling at me saying: \"Are you there? I have been expecting you.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is evening. An attractive maid brings me orders to appear before\nmy mistress. I ascend the wide marble stairs, pass through the\nanteroom, a large salon furnished with extravagant magnificence, and\nknock at the door of the bedroom. I knock very softly for the luxury\ndisplayed everywhere intimidates me. Consequently no one hears me,\nand I stand for some time in front of the door. I have a feeling as\nif I were standing before the bed-room of the great Catherine, and\nit seems as if at any moment she might come out in her green sleeping\nfurs, with the red ribbon and decoration on her bare breast, and with\nher little white powdered curls.\n\nI knocked again. Wanda impatiently pulls the door open.\n\n\"Why so late?\" she asks.\n\n\"I was standing in front of the door, but you didn't hear me knock,\"\nI reply timidly. She closes the door, and clinging to me, she leads\nme to the red damask ottoman on which she had been resting. The\nentire arrangement of the room is in red damask--wall-paper,\ncurtains, portieres, hangings of the bed. A magnificent painting of\nSamson and Delilah forms the ceiling.\n\nWanda receives me in an intoxicating dishabille. Her white satin\ndress flows gracefully and picturesquely down her slender body,\nleaving her arms and breast bare, and carelessly they nestle amid the\ndark hair of the great fur of sable, lined with green velvet. Her red\nhair falls down her back as far as the hips, only half held by\nstrings of black pearls.\n\n\"Venus in Furs,\" I whisper, while she draws me to her breast and\nthreatens to stifle me with her kisses. Then I no longer speak and\nneither do I think; everything is drowned out in an ocean of\nunimagined bliss.\n\n\"Do you still love me?\" she asks, her eye softening in passionate\ntenderness.\n\n\"You ask!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"You still remember your oath,\" she continued with an alluring\nsmile, \"now that everything is prepared, everything in readiness, I\nask you once more, is it still your serious wish to become my slave?\"\n\n\"Am I not ready?\" I asked in surprise.\n\n\"You have not yet signed the papers.\"\n\n\"Papers--what papers?\"\n\n\"Oh, I see, you want to give it up,\" she said, \"well then, we will\nlet it go.\"\n\n\"But Wanda,\" I said, \"you know that nothing gives me greater\nhappiness than to serve you, to be your slave. I would give\neverything for the sake of feeling myself wholly in your power, even\nunto death--\"\n\n\"How beautiful you are,\" she whispered, \"when you speak so\nenthusiastically, so passionately. I am more in love with you than\never and you want me to be dominant, stern, and cruel. I am afraid,\nit will be impossible for me to be so.\"\n\n\"I am not afraid,\" I replied smiling, \"where are the papers?'\"\n\n\"So that you may know what it means to be absolutely in my power, I\nhave drafted a second agreement in which you declare that you have\ndecided to kill yourself. In that way I can even kill you, if I so\ndesire.\"\n\n\"Give them to me.\"\n\nWhile I was unfolding the documents and reading them, Wanda got pen\nand ink. She then sat down beside me with her arm about my neck, and\nlooked over my shoulder at the paper.\n\nThe first one read:\n\nAGREEMENT BETWEEN MME. VON DUNAJEW AND SEVERIN VON KUSIEMSKI\n\n\"Severin von Kusiemski ceases with the present day being the affianced\nof Mme. Wanda von Dunajew, and renounces all the rights appertaining\nthereunto; he on the contrary binds himself on his word of honor as a\nman and nobleman, that hereafter he will be her _slave_ until such\ntime that she herself sets him at liberty again.\n\n\"As the slave of Mme. von Dunajew he is to bear the name Gregor, and\nhe is unconditionally to comply with every one of her wishes, and to\nobey every one of her commands; he is always to be submissive to his\nmistress, and is to consider her every sign of favor as an\nextraordinary mercy.\n\n\"Mme. von Dunajew is entitled not only to punish her slave as she\ndeems best, even for the slightest inadvertence or fault, but also\nis herewith given the right to torture him as the mood may seize her\nor merely for the sake of whiling away the time. Should she so desire,\nshe may kill him whenever she wishes; in short, he is her\nunrestricted property.\n\n\"Should Mme. von Dunajew ever set her slave at liberty, Severin von\nKusiemski agrees to forget everything that he has experienced or\nsuffered as her slave, and promises _never under any circumstances and\nin no wise to think of vengeance or retaliation_.\n\n\"Mme. von Dunajew on her behalf agrees as his mistress to appear as\noften as possible in her furs, especially when she purposes some\ncruelty toward her slave.\"\n\nAppended at the bottom of the agreement was the date of the present\nday.\n\nThe second document contained only a few words.\n\n\"Having since many years become weary of existence and its\nillusions, I have of my own free will put an end to my worthless\nlife.\"\n\nI was seized with a deep horror when I had finished. There was still\ntime, I could still withdraw, but the madness of passion and the\nsight of the beautiful woman that lay all relaxed against my shoulder\ncarried me away.\n\n\"This one you will have to copy, Severin,\" said Wanda, indicating\nthe second document. \"It has to be entirely in your own handwriting;\nthis, of course, isn't necessary in the case of the agreement.\"\n\nI quickly copied the few lines in which I designated myself a\nsuicide, and handed them to Wanda. She read them, and put them on the\ntable with a smile.\n\n\"Now have you the courage to sign it?\" she asked with a crafty\nsmile, inclining her head.\n\nI took the pen.\n\n\"Let me sign first,\" said Wanda, \"your hand is trembling, are you\nafraid of the happiness that is to be yours?\"\n\nShe took the agreement and pen. While engaging in my internal struggle,\nI looked upward for a moment. It occurred to me that the painting on the\nceiling, like many of those of the Italian and Dutch schools, was\nutterly unhistorical, but this very fact gave it a strange mood which\nhad an almost uncanny effect on me. Delilah, an opulent woman with\nflaming red hair, lay extended, half-disrobed, in a dark fur-cloak, upon\na red ottoman, and bent smiling over Samson who had been overthrown and\nbound by the Philistines. Her smile in its mocking coquetry was full of\na diabolical cruelty; her eyes, half-closed, met Samson's, and his with\na last look of insane passion cling to hers, for already one of his\nenemies is kneeling on his breast with the red-hot iron to blind him.\n\n\"Now--\" said Wanda. \"Why you are all lost in thought. What is the\nmatter with you, everything will remain just as it was, even after\nyou have signed, don't you know me yet, dear heart?\"\n\nI looked at the agreement. Her name was written there in bold\nletters. I peered once more into her eyes with their potent magic,\nthen I took the pen and quickly signed the agreement.\n\n\"You are trembling,\" said Wanda calmly, \"shall I help you?\"\n\nShe gently took hold of my hand, and my name appeared at the bottom\nof the second paper. Wanda looked once more at the two documents, and\nthen locked them in the desk which stood at the head of the ottoman.\n\n\"Now then, give me your passport and money.\"\n\nI took out my wallet and handed it to her. She inspected it, nodded,\nand put it with other things while in a sweet drunkenness I kneeled\nbefore her leaning my head against her breast.\n\nSuddenly she thrusts me away with her foot, leaps up, and pulls the\nbell-rope. In answer to its sound three young, slender negresses\nenter; they are as if carved of ebony, and are dressed from head to\nfoot in red satin; each one has a rope in her hand.\n\nSuddenly I realize my position, and am about to rise. Wanda stands\nproudly erect, her cold beautiful face with its sombre brows and\ncontemptous eyes is turned toward me. She stands before me as\nmistress, commanding, gives a sign with her hand, and before I really\nknow what has happened to me the negresses have dragged me to the\nground, and have tied me hand and foot. As in the case of one about\nto be executed my arms are bound behind my back, so that I can\nscarcely move.\n\n\"Give me the whip, Haydee,\" commands Wanda, with unearthly calm.\n\nThe negress hands it to her mistress, kneeling.\n\n\"And now take off my heavy furs,\" she continues, \"they impede me.\"\n\nThe negress obeyed.\n\n\"The jacket there!\" Wanda commanded.\n\nHaydee quickly brought her the _kazabaika_, set with ermine, which lay\non the bed, and Wanda slipped into it with two inimitably graceful\nmovements.\n\n\"Now tie him to the pillar here!\"\n\nThe negresses lifted me up, and twisting a heavy rope around my\nbody, tied me standing against one of the massive pillars which\nsupported the top of the wide Italian bed.\n\nThen they suddenly disappeared, as if the earth had swallowed them.\n\nWanda swiftly approached me. Her white satin dress flowed behind her\nin a long train, like silver, like moonlight; her hair flared like\nflames against the white fur of her jacket. Now she stood in front\nof me with her left hand firmly planted on her hips, in her right hand\nshe held the whip. She uttered an abrupt laugh.\n\n\"Now play has come to an end between us,\" she said with heartless\ncoldness. \"Now we will begin in dead earnest. You fool, I laugh at you\nand despise you; you who in your insane infatuation have given\nyourself as a plaything to _me_, the frivolous and capricious woman.\nYou are no longer the man I love, but _my slave_, at my mercy even\nunto life and death.\n\n\"You shall know me!\n\n\"First of all you shall have a taste of the whip in all seriousness,\nwithout having done anything to deserve it, so that you may\nunderstand what to expect, if you are awkward, disobedient, or\nrefractory.\"\n\nWith a wild grace she rolled back her fur-lined sleeve, and struck\nme across the back.\n\nI winced, for the whip cut like a knife into my flesh.\n\n\"Well, how do you like that?\" she exclaimed.\n\nI was silent.\n\n\"Just wait, you will yet whine like a dog beneath my whip,\" she\nthreatened, and simultaneously began to strike me again.\n\nThe blows fell quickly, in rapid succession, with terrific force\nupon my back, arms, and neck; I had to grit my teeth not to scream\naloud. Now she struck me in the face, warm blood ran down, but she\nlaughed, and continued her blows.\n\n\"It is only now I understand you,\" she exclaimed. \"It really is a\njoy to have some one so completely in one's power, and a man at that,\nwho loves you--you do love me?--No--Oh! I'll tear you to shreds yet,\nand with each blow my pleasure will grow. Now, twist like a worm,\nscream, whine! You will find no mercy in me!\"\n\nFinally she seemed tired.\n\nShe tossed the whip aside, stretched out on the ottoman, and rang.\n\nThe negresses entered.\n\n\"Untie him!\"\n\nAs they loosened the rope, I fell to the floor like a lump of wood.\nThe black women grinned, showing their white teeth.\n\n\"Untie the rope around his feet.\"\n\nThey did it, but I was unable to rise.\n\n\"Come over here, Gregor.\"\n\nI approached the beautiful woman. Never did she seem more seductive\nto me than to-day in spite of all her cruelty and contempt.\n\n\"One step further,\" Wanda commanded. \"Now kneel down, and kiss my\nfoot.\"\n\nShe extended her foot beyond the hem of white satin, and I, the\nsupersensual fool, pressed my lips upon it.\n\n\"Now, you won't lay eyes on me for an entire month, Gregor,\" she\nsaid seriously. \"I want to become a stranger to you, so you will more\neasily adjust yourself to our new relationship. In the meantime you\nwill work in the garden, and await my orders. Now, off with you,\nslave!\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA month has passed with monotonous regularity, heavy work, and a\nmelancholy hunger, hunger for her, who is inflicting all these\ntorments on me.\n\nI am under the gardener's orders; I help him lop the trees and prune\nthe hedges, transplant flowers, turn over the flower beds, sweep the\ngravel paths; I share his coarse food and his hard cot; I rise and\ngo to bed with the chickens. Now and then I hear that our mistress\nis amusing herself, surrounded by admirers. Once I heard her gay\nlaughter even down here in the garden.\n\nI seem awfully stupid to myself. Was it the result of my present\nlife, or was I so before? The month is drawing to a close--the day\nafter to-morrow. What will she do with me now, or has she forgotten\nme, and left me to trim hedges and bind bouquets till my dying day?\n\nA written order.\n\n\"The slave Gregor is herewith ordered to my personal service.\n\nWanda Dunajew.\"\n\nWith a beating heart I draw aside the damask curtain on the\nfollowing morning, and enter the bed-room of my divinity. It is still\nfilled with a pleasant half darkness.\n\n\"Is it you, Gregor?\" she asks, while I kneel before the fire-place,\nbuilding a fire. I tremble at the sound of the beloved voice. I\ncannot see her herself; she is invisible behind the curtains of the\nfour-poster bed.\n\n\"Yes, my mistress,\" I reply.\n\n\"How late is it?\"\n\n\"Past nine o'clock.\"\n\n\"Breakfast.\"\n\nI hasten to get it, and then kneel down with the tray beside her bed.\n\n\"Here is breakfast, my mistress.\"\n\nWanda draws back the curtains, and curiously enough at the first\nglance when I see her among the pillows with loosened flowing hair,\nshe seems an absolute stranger, a beautiful woman, but the beloved\nsoft lines are gone. This face is hard and has an expression of\nweariness and satiety.\n\nOr is it simply that formerly my eye did not see this?\n\nShe fixes her green eyes upon me, more with curiosity than with\nmenace, perhaps even somewhat pityingly, and lazily pulls the dark\nsleeping fur on which she lies over the bared shoulder.\n\nAt this moment she is very charming, very maddening, and I feel my\nblood rising to my head and heart. The tray in my hands begins to\nsway. She notices it and reached out for the whip which is lying on\nthe toilet-table.\n\n\"You are awkward, slave,\" she says furrowing her brow.\n\nI lower my looks to the ground, and hold the tray as steadily as\npossible. She eats her breakfast, yawns, and stretches her opulent\nlimbs in the magnificent furs.\n\nShe has rung. I enter.\n\n\"Take this letter to Prince Corsini.\"\n\nI hurry into the city, and hand the letter to the Prince. He is a\nhandsome young man with glowing black eyes. Consumed with jealousy,\nI take his answer to her.\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" she asks with lurking spitefulness.\n\"You are very pale.\"\n\n\"Nothing, mistress, I merely walked rather fast.\"\n\nAt luncheon the prince is at her side, and I am condemned to serve\nboth her and him. They joke, and I am, as if non-existent, for both.\nFor a brief moment I see black; I was just pouring some Bordeaux into\nhis glass, and spilled it over the table-cloth and her gown.\n\n\"How awkward,\" Wanda exclaimed and slapped my face. The prince\nlaughed, and she also, but I felt the blood rising to my face.\n\nAfter luncheon she drove in the Cascine. She has a little carriage\nwith a handsome, brown English horse, and holds the reins herself.\nI sit behind and notice how coquettishly she acts, and nods with a\nsmile when one of the distinguished gentlemen bows to her.\n\nAs I help her out of the carriage, she leans lightly on my arm; the\ncontact runs through me like an electric shock. She _is_ a wonderful\nwoman, and I love her more than ever.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor dinner at six she has invited a small group of men and women. I\nserve, but this time I do not spill any wine over the table-cloth.\n\nA slap in the face is more effective than ten lectures. It makes you\nunderstand very quickly, especially when the instruction is by the\nway of a small woman's hand.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAfter dinner she drives to the Pergola Theater. As she descends the\nstairs in her black velvet dress with its large collar of ermine and\nwith a diadem of white roses on her hair, she is literally stunning.\nI open the carriage-door, and help her in. In front of the theater\nI leap from the driver's seat, and in alighting she leaned on my arm,\nwhich trembled under the sweet burden. I open the door of her box,\nand then wait in the vestibule. The performance lasts four hours; she\nreceives visits from her cavaliers, the while I grit my teeth with\nrage.\n\nIt is way beyond midnight when my mistress's bell sounds for the\nlast time.\n\n\"Fire!\" she orders abruptly, and when the fire-place crackles, \"Tea!\"\n\nWhen I return with the samovar, she has already undressed, and with\nthe aid of the negress slipped into a white negligee.\n\nHaydee thereupon leaves.\n\n\"Hand me the sleeping-furs,\" says Wanda, sleepily stretching her\nlovely limbs. I take them from the arm-chair, and hold them while she\nslowly and lazily slides into the sleeves. She then throws herself\ndown on the cushions of the ottoman.\n\n\"Take off my shoes, and put on my velvet slippers.\"\n\nI kneel down and tug at the little shoe which resists my efforts.\n\"Hurry, hurry!\" Wanda exclaims, \"you are hurting me! just you wait--I\nwill teach you.\" She strikes me with the whip, but now the shoe is\noff.\n\n\"Now get out!\" Still a kick--and then I can go to bed.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-night I accompanied her to a soiree. In the entrance-hall she\nordered me to help her out of her furs; then with a proud smile,\nconfident of victory, she entered the brilliantly illuminated room.\nI again waited with gloomy and monotonous thoughts, watching hour after\nhour run by. From time to time the sounds of music reached me, when\nthe door remained open for a moment. Several servants tried to start\na conversation with me, but soon desisted, since I knew only a few\nwords of Italian.\n\nFinally I fell asleep, and dreamed that I murdered Wanda in a\nviolent attack of jealousy. I was condemned to death, and saw myself\nstrapped on the board; the knife fell, I felt it on my neck, but I\nwas still alive--\n\nThen the executioner slapped my face.\n\nNo, it wasn't the executioner; it was Wanda who stood wrathfully\nbefore me demanding her furs. I am at her side in a moment, and help\nher on with it.\n\nThere is a deep joy in wrapping a beautiful woman into her furs, and\nin seeing and feeling how her neck and magnificent limbs nestle in\nthe precious soft furs, and to lift the flowing hair over the collar.\nWhen she throws it off a soft warmth and a faint fragrance of her\nbody still clings to the ends of the hairs of sable. It is enough to\ndrive one mad.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFinally a day came when there were neither guests, nor theater, nor\nother company. I breathed a sigh of relief. Wanda sat in the gallery,\nreading, and apparently had no orders for me. At dusk when the\nsilvery evening mists fell she withdrew. I served her at dinner, she\nate by herself, but had not a look, not a syllable for me, not even\na slap in the face.\n\nI actually desire a slap from her hand. Tears fill my eyes, and I\nfeel that she has humiliated me so deeply, that she doesn't even find\nit worth while to torture or maltreat me any further.\n\nBefore she goes to bed, her bell calls me.\n\n\"You will sleep here to-night, I had horrible dreams last night, and\nam afraid of being alone. Take one of the cushions from the ottoman,\nand lie down on the bearskin at my feet.\"\n\nThen Wanda put out the lights. The only illumination in the room was\nfrom a small lamp suspended from the ceiling. She herself got into\nbed. \"Don't stir, so as not to wake me.\"\n\nI did as she had commanded, but could not fall asleep for a long\ntime. I saw the beautiful woman, beautiful as a goddess, lying on her\nback on the dark sleeping-furs; her arms beneath her neck, with a\nflood of red hair over them. I heard her magnificent breast rise in\ndeep regular breathing, and whenever she moved ever so slightly. I\nwoke up and listened to see whether she needed me.\n\nBut she did not require me.\n\nNo task was required of me; I meant no more to her than a night-lamp, or\na revolver which one places under one's pillow.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAm I mad or is she? Does all this arise out of an inventive, wanton\nwoman's brain with the intention of surpassing my supersensual\nfantasies, or is this woman really one of those Neronian characters\nwho take a diabolical pleasure in treading underfoot, like a worm,\nhuman beings, who have thoughts and feelings and a will like theirs?\n\nWhat have I experienced?\n\nWhen I knelt with the coffee-tray beside her bed, Wanda suddenly\nplaced her hand on my shoulder and her eyes plunged deep into mine.\n\n\"What beautiful eyes you have,\" she said softly, \"and especially now\nsince you suffer. Are you very unhappy?\"\n\nI bowed my head, and kept silent.\n\n\"Severin, do you still love me,\" she suddenly exclaimed\npassionately, \"can you still love me?\"\n\nShe drew me close with such vehemence that the coffee-tray upset,\nthe can and cups fell to the floor, and the coffee ran over the\ncarpet.\n\n\"Wanda--my Wanda,\" I cried out and held her passionately against me;\nI covered her mouth, face, and breast with kisses.\n\n\"It is my unhappiness that I love you more and more madly the worse\nyou treat me, the more frequently you betray me. Oh, I shall die of\npain and love and jealousy.\"\n\n\"But I haven't betrayed you, as yet, Severin,\" replied Wanda smiling.\n\n\"Not? Wanda! Don't jest so mercilessly with me,\" I cried. \"Haven't\nI myself taken the letter to the Prince--\"\n\n\"Of course, it was an invitation for luncheon.\"\n\n\"You have, since we have been in Florence--\"\n\n\"I have been absolutely faithful to you,\" replied Wanda, \"I swear it\nby all that is holy to me. All that I have done was merely to fulfill\nyour dream and it was done for your sake.\n\n\"However, I shall take a lover, otherwise things will be only half\naccomplished, and in the end you will yet reproach me with not having\ntreated you cruelly enough, my dear beautiful slave! But to-day you\nshall be Severin again, the only one I love. I haven't given away\nyour clothes. They are here in the chest. Go and dress as you used\nto in the little Carpathian health-resort when our love was so intimate.\nForget everything that has happened since; oh, you will forget it\neasily in my arms; I shall kiss away all your sorrows.\"\n\nShe began to treat me tenderly like a child, to kiss me and caress\nme. Finally she said with a gracious smile, \"Go now and dress, I too\nwill dress. Shall I put on my fur-jacket? Oh yes, I know, now run\nalong!\"\n\nWhen I returned she was standing in the center of the room in her\nwhite satin dress, and the red _kazabaika_ edged with ermine; her hair\nwas white with powder and over her forehead she wore a small diamond\ndiadem. For a moment she reminded me in an uncanny way of Catherine\nthe Second, but she did not give me much time for reminiscences. She\ndrew me down on the ottoman beside her and we enjoyed two blissful\nhours. She was no longer the stern capricious mistress, she was\nentirely a fine lady, a tender sweetheart. She showed me photographs\nand books which had just appeared, and talked about them with so much\nintelligence, clarity, and good taste, that I more than once carried\nher hand to my lips, enraptured. She then had me recite several of\nLermontov's poems, and when I was all afire with enthusiasm, she\nplaced her small hand gently on mine. Her expression was soft, and her\neyes were filled with tender pleasure.\n\n\"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\nShe then leaned back on the cushions, and slowly opened her\n_kazabaika_.\n\nBut I quickly covered the half-bared breast again with the ermine.\n\"You are driving me mad.\" I stammered.\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nI was already lying in her arms, and like a serpent she was kissing\nme with her tongue, when again she whispered, \"Are you happy?\"\n\n\"Infinitely!\" I exclaimed.\n\nShe laughed aloud. It was an evil, shrill laugh which made cold\nshivers run down by back.\n\n\"You used to dream of being the slave, the plaything of a beautiful\nwoman, and now you imagine you are a free human being, a man, my\nlover-you fool! A sign from me, and you are a slave again. Down on\nyour knees!\"\n\nI sank down from the ottoman to her feet, but my eye still clung\ndoubtingly on hers.\n\n\"You can't believe it,\" she said, looking at me with her arms folded\nacross her breast. \"I am bored, and you will just do to while away\na couple of hours of time. Don't look at me that way--\"\n\nShe kicked me with her foot.\n\n\"You are just what I want, a human being, a thing, an animal--\"\n\nShe rang. The three negresses entered.\n\n\"Tie his hands behind his back.\"\n\nI remained kneeling and unresistingly let them do this. They led me\ninto the garden, down to the little vineyard, which forms the\nsouthern boundary. Corn had been planted between the espaliers, and\nhere and there a few dead stalks still stood. To one side was a\nplough.\n\nThe negresses tied me to a post, and amused themselves sticking me\nwith their golden hair-needles. But this did not last long, before\nWanda appeared with her ermine cap on her head, and with her hands\nin the pockets of her jacket. She had me untied, and then my hands\nwere fastened together on my back. She finally had a yoke put around\nmy neck, and harnessed me to the plough.\n\nThen her black demons drove me out into the field. One of them held\nthe plough, the other one led me by a line, the third applied the\nwhip, and Venus in Furs stood to one side and looked on.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWhen I was serving dinner on the following day Wanda said: \"Bring\nanother cover, I want you to dine with me to-day,\" and when I was\nabout to sit down opposite her, she added, \"No, over here, close by\nmy side.\"\n\nShe is in the best of humors, gives me soup with her spoon, feeds me\nwith her fork, and places her head on the table like a playful kitten\nand flirts with me. I have the misfortune of looking at Haydee, who\nserves in my place, perhaps a little longer than is necessary. It is\nonly now that I noticed her noble, almost European cast of\ncountenance and her magnificent statuesque bust, which is as if hewn\nout of black marble. The black devil observes that she pleases me,\nand, grinning, shows her teeth. She has hardly left the room, before\nWanda leaps up in a rage.\n\n\"What, you dare to look at another woman besides me! Perhaps you\nlike her even better than you do me, she is even more demonic!\"\n\nI am frightened; I have never seen her like this before; she is\nsuddenly pale even to the lips and her whole body trembles. Venus in\nFurs is jealous of her slave. She snatches the whip from its hook and\nstrikes me in the face; then she calls her black servants, who bind\nme, and carry me down into the cellar, where they throw me into a\ndark, dank, subterranean compartment, a veritable prison-cell.\n\nThen the lock of the door clicks, the bolts are drawn, a key sings\nin the lock. I am a prisoner, buried.\n\nI have been lying here for I don't know how long, bound like a calf\nabout to be hauled to the slaughter, on a bundle of damp straw,\nwithout any light, without food, without drink, without sleep. It\nwould be like her to let me starve to death, if I don't freeze to\ndeath before then. I am shaking with cold. Or is it fever? I believe\nI am beginning to hate this woman.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nA red streak, like blood, floods across the floor; it is a light\nfalling through the door which is now thrust open.\n\nWanda appears on the threshold, wrapped in her sables, holding a\nlighted torch.\n\n\"Are you still alive?\" she asks.\n\n\"Are you coming to kill me?\" I reply with a low, hoarse voice.\n\nWith two rapid strides Wanda reaches my side, she kneels down beside\nme, and places my head in her lap. \"Are you ill? Your eyes glow so,\ndo you love me? I want you to love me.\"\n\nShe draws forth a short dagger. I start with fright when its blade\ngleams in front of my eyes. I actually believe that she is about to\nkill me. She laughs, and cuts the ropes that bind me.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nEvery evening after dinner she now has me called. I have to read to\nher, and she discusses with me all sorts of interesting problems and\nsubjects. She seems entirely transformed; it is as if she were\nashamed of the savagery which she betrayed to me and of the cruelty\nwith which she treated me. A touching gentleness transfigures her\nentire being, and when at the good-night she gives me her hand, a\nsuperhuman power of goodness and love lies in her eyes, of the kind\nwhich calls forth tears in us and causes us to forget all the\nmiseries of existence and all the terrors of death.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI am reading _Manon l'Escault_ to her. She feels the association, she\ndoesn't say a word, but she smiles from time to time, and finally she\nshuts up the little book.\n\n\"Don't you want to go on reading?\"\n\n\"Not to-day. We will ourselves act _Manon l'Escault_ to-day. I have a\nrendezvous in the Cascine, and you, my dear Chevalier, will accompany\nme; I know, you will do it, won't you?\"\n\n\"You command it.\"\n\n\"I do not command it, I beg it of you,\" she says with irresistible\ncharm. She then rises, puts her hands on my shoulders, and looks at\nme.\n\n\"Your eyes!\" she exclaims. \"I love you, Severin, you have no idea\nhow I love you!\"\n\n\"Yes, I have!\" I replied bitterly, \"so much so that you have\narranged for a rendezvous with some one else.\"\n\n\"I do this only to allure you the more,\" she replied vivaciously. \"I\nmust have admirers, so as not to lose you. I don't ever want to lose\nyou, never, do you hear, for I love only you, you alone.\"\n\nShe clung passionately to my lips.\n\n\"Oh, if I only could, as I would, give you all of my soul in a kiss--\nthus--but now come.\"\n\nShe slipped into a simple black velvet coat, and put a dark _bashlyk_\n[Footnote: A kind of Russian cap.] on her head. Then she rapidly went\nthrough the gallery, and entered the carriage.\n\n\"Gregor will drive,\" she called out to the coachman who withdrew in\nsurprise.\n\nI ascended the driver's seat, and angrily whipped up the horses.\n\nIn the Cascine where the main roadway turns into a leafy path, Wanda\ngot out. It was night, only occasional stars shone through the gray\nclouds that fled across the sky. By the bank of the Arno stood a man\nin a dark cloak, with a brigand's hat, and looked at the yellow\nwaves. Wanda rapidly walked through the shrubbery, and tapped him on\nthe shoulder. I saw him turn and seize her hand, and then they\ndisappeared behind the green wall.\n\nAn hour full of torments. Finally there was a rustling in the bushes\nto one side, and they returned.\n\nThe man accompanied her to the carriage. The light of the lamp fell\nfull and glaringly upon an infinitely young, soft and dreamy face\nwhich I had never before seen, and played in his long, blond curls.\n\nShe held out her hand which he kissed with deep respect, then she\nsignaled to me, and immediately the carriage flew along the leafy\nwall which follows the river like a long green screen.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe bell at the garden-gate rings. It is a familiar face. The man\nfrom the Cascine.\n\n\"Whom shall I announce?\" I ask him in French. He timidly shakes his\nhead.\n\n\"Do you, perhaps, understand some German?\" he asks shyly.\n\n\"Yes. Your name, please.\"\n\n\"Oh! I haven't any yet,\" he replies, embarrassed--\"Tell your\nmistress the German painter from the Cascine is here and would like--\nbut there she is herself.\"\n\nWanda had stepped out on the balcony, and nodded toward the stranger.\n\n\"Gregor, show the gentleman in!\" she called to me.\n\nI showed the painter the stairs.\n\n\"Thanks, I'll find her now, thanks, thanks very much.\" He ran up the\nsteps. I remained standing below, and looked with deep pity on the\npoor German.\n\nVenus in Furs has caught his soul in the red snares of hair. He will\npaint her, and go mad.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nIt is a sunny winter's day. Something that looks like gold trembles\non the leaves of the clusters of trees down below in the green level\nof the meadow. The camelias at the foot of the gallery are glorious\nin their abundant buds. Wanda is sitting in the loggia; she is\ndrawing. The German painter stands opposite her with his hands folded\nas in adoration, and looks at her. No, he rather looks at her face,\nand is entirely absorbed in it, enraptured.\n\nBut she does not see him, neither does she see me, who with the\nspade in my hand am turning over the flower-bed, solely that I may\nsee her and feel her nearness, which produces an effect on me like\npoetry, like music.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe painter has gone. It is a hazardous thing to do, but I risk it.\nI go up to the gallery, quite close, and ask Wanda \"Do you love the\npainter, mistress?\"\n\nShe looks at me without getting angry, shakes her head, and finally\neven smiles.\n\n\"I feel sorry for him,\" she replies, \"but I do not love him. I love no\none. _I used to love you, as ardently, as passionately, as deeply as\nit was possible for me to love,_ but now I don't love even you any\nmore; my heart is a void, dead, and this makes me sad.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I exclaimed, deeply moved.\n\n\"Soon, you too will no longer love me,\" she continued, \"tell me when\nyou have reached that point, and I will give back to you your\nfreedom.\"\n\n\"Then I shall remain your slave, all my life long, for I adore you\nand shall always adore you,\" I cried, seized by that fanaticism of\nlove which has repeatedly been so fatal to me.\n\nWanda looked at me with a curious pleasure. \"Consider well what you\ndo,\" she said. \"I have loved you infinitely and have been despotic\ntowards you so that I might fulfil your dream. Something of my old\nfeeling, a sort of real sympathy for you, still trembles in my\nbreast. When that too has gone who knows whether then I shall give\nyou your liberty; whether I shall not then become really cruel,\nmerciless, even brutal toward; whether I shall not take a diabolical\npleasure in tormenting and putting on the rack the man who worships\nme idolatrously, the while I remain indifferent or love someone else;\nperhaps, I shall enjoy seeing him die of his love for me. Consider\nthis well.\"\n\n\"I have long since considered all that,\" I replied as in a glow of\nfever. \"I cannot exist, cannot live without you; I shall die if you\nset me at liberty; let me remain your slave, kill me, but do not\ndrive me away.\"\n\n\"Very well then, be my slave,\" she replied, \"but don't forget that\nI no longer love you, and your love doesn't mean any more to me than\na dog's, and dogs are kicked.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day I visited the Venus of Medici.\n\nIt was still early, and the little octagonal room in the Tribuna was\nfilled with half-lights like a sanctuary; I stood with folded hands\nin deep adoration before the silent image of the divinity.\n\nBut I did not stand for long.\n\nNot a human soul was in the gallery, not even an Englishman, and I\nfell down on my knees. I looked up at the lovely slender body, the\nbudding breasts, the virginal and yet voluptuous face, the fragrant\ncurls which seemed to conceal tiny horns on each side of the forehead.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMy mistress's bell.\n\nIt is noonday. She, however, is still abed with her arms intertwined\nbehind her neck.\n\n\"I want to bathe,\" she says, \"and you will attend me. Lock the door!\"\n\nI obey.\n\n\"Now go downstairs and make sure the door below is also locked.\"\n\nI descended the winding stairs that lead from her bedroom to the\nbath; my feet gave way beneath me, and I had to support myself\nagainst the iron banister. After having ascertained that the door\nleading to the Loggia and the garden was locked, I returned. Wanda\nwas now sitting on the bed with loosened hair, wrapped in her green\nvelvet furs. When she made a rapid movement, I noticed that the furs\nwere her only covering. It made me start terribly, I don't know why?\nI was like one condemned to death, who knows he is on the way to the\nscaffold, and yet begins to tremble when he sees it.\n\n\"Come, Gregor, take me on your arms.\"\n\n\"You mean, mistress?\"\n\n\"You are to carry me, don't you understand?\"\n\nI lifted her up, so that she rested in my arms, while she twined\nhers around my neck. Slowly, step by step, I went down the stairs\nwith her and her hair beat from time to time against my cheek and her\nfoot sought support against my knee. I trembled under the beautiful\nburden I was carrying, and every moment it seemed as if I had to\nbreak down beneath it.\n\nThe bath consisted of a wide, high rotunda, which received a soft\nquiet light from a red glass cupola above. Two palms extended their\nbroad leaves like a roof over a couch of velvet cushions. From here\nsteps covered with Turkish rugs led to the white marble basin which\noccupied the center.\n\n\"There is a green ribbon on my toilet-table upstairs,\" said Wanda,\nas I let her down on the couch, \"go get it, and also bring the whip.\"\n\nI flew upstairs and back again, and kneeling put both in my mistress's\nhands. She then had me twist her heavy electric hair into a large knot\nwhich I fastened with the green ribbon. Then I prepared the bath. I did\nthis very awkwardly because my hands and feet refused to obey me. Again\nand again I had to look at the beautiful woman lying on the red velvet\ncushions, and from time to time her wonderful body gleamed here and\nthere beneath the furs. Some magnetic power stronger than my will\ncompelled me to look. I felt that all sensuality and lustfulness lies in\nthat which is half-concealed or intentionally disclosed; and the truth\nof this I recognized even more acutely, when the basin at last was full,\nand Wanda threw off the fur-cloak with a single gesture, and stood\nbefore me like the goddess in the Tribuna.\n\nAt that moment she seemed as sacred and chaste to me in her unveiled\nbeauty, as did the divinity of long ago. I sank down on my knees\nbefore her, and devoutly pressed my lips on her foot.\n\nMy soul which had been storm-tossed only a little while earlier,\nsuddenly was perfectly calm, and I now felt no element of cruelty in\nWanda.\n\nShe slowly descended the stairs, and I could watch her with a\ncalmness in which not a single atom of torment or desire was\nintermingled. I could see her plunge into and rise out of the\ncrystalline water, and the wavelets which she herself raised played\nabout her like tender lovers.\n\nOur nihilistic aesthetician is right when he says: a real apple is\nmore beautiful than a painted one, and a living woman is more\nbeautiful than a Venus of stone.\n\nAnd when she left the bath, and the silvery drops and the roseate\nlight rippled down her body, I was seized with silent rapture. I\nwrapped the linen sheets about her, drying her glorious body. The\ncalm bliss remained with me, even now when one foot upon me as upon\na footstool, she rested on the cushions in her large velvet cloak.\nThe lithe sables nestled desirously against her cold marble-like body.\nHer left arm on which she supported herself lay like a sleeping swan\nin the dark fur of the sleeve, while her left hand played carelessly\nwith the whip.\n\nBy chance my look fell on the massive mirror on the wall opposite,\nand I cried out, for I saw the two of us in its golden frame as in\na picture. The picture was so marvellously beautiful, so strange, so\nimaginative, that I was filled with deep sorrow at the thought that\nits lines and colors would have to dissolve like mist.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Wanda.\n\nI pointed to the mirror.\n\n\"Ah, that is really beautiful,\" she exclaimed, \"too bad one can't\ncapture the moment and make it permanent.\"\n\n\"And why not?\" I asked. \"Would not any artist, even the most famous,\nbe proud if you gave him leave to paint you and make you immortal by\nmeans of his brush.\n\n\"The very thought that this extra-ordinary beauty is to be lost to\nthe world,\" I continued still watching her enthusiastically, \"is\nhorrible--all this glorious facial expression, this mysterious eye\nwith its green fires, this demonic hair, this magnificence of body.\nThe idea fills me with a horror of death, of annihilation. But the\nhand of an artist shall snatch you from this. You shall not like the\nrest of us disappear absolutely and forever, without leaving a trace\nof your having been. Your picture must live, even when you yourself\nhave long fallen to dust; your beauty must triumph beyond death!\"\n\nWanda smiled.\n\n\"Too bad, that present-day Italy hasn't a Titian or Raphael,\" she\nsaid, \"but, perhaps, love will make amends for genius, who knows; our\nlittle German might do?\" She pondered.\n\n\"Yes, he shall paint you, and I will see to it that the god of love\nmixes his colors.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe young painter has established his studio in her villa; he is\ncompletely in her net. He has just begun a Madonna, a Madonna with\nred hair and green eyes! Only the idealism of a German would attempt\nto use this thorough-bred woman as a model for a picture of\nvirginity. The poor fellow really is an almost bigger donkey than I\nam. Our misfortune is that our Titania has discovered our ass's ears\ntoo soon.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nNow she laughs derisively at us, and how she laughs! I hear her\ninsolent melodious laughter in his studio, under the open window of\nwhich I stand, jealously listening.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"Are you mad, me--ah, it is unbelievable, me as the Mother of God!\"\nshe exclaimed and laughed again. \"Wait a moment, I will show you\nanother picture of myself, one that I myself have painted, and you\nshall copy it.\"\n\nHer head appeared in the window, luminous like a flame under the\nsunlight.\n\n\"Gregor!\"\n\nI hurried up the stairs, through the gallery, into the studio.\n\n\"Lead him to the bath,\" Wanda commanded, while she herself hurried\naway.\n\nA few moments passed and Wanda arrived; dressed in nothing but the\nsable fur, with the whip in her hand; she descended the stairs and\nstretched out on the velvet cushions as on the former occasion. I lay\nat her feet and she placed one of her feet upon me; her right hand\nplayed with the whip. \"Look at me,\" she said, \"with your deep,\nfanatical look, that's it.\"\n\nThe painter had turned terribly pale. He devoured the scene with his\nbeautiful dreamy blue eyes; his lips opened, but he remained dumb.\n\n\"Well, how do you like the picture?\"\n\n\"Yes, that is how I want to paint you,\" said the German, but it was\nreally not a spoken language; it was the eloquent moaning, the\nweeping of a sick soul, a soul sick unto death.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe charcoal outline of the painting is done; the heads and flesh\nparts are painted in. Her diabolical face is already becoming visible\nunder a few bold strokes, life flashes in her green eyes.\n\nWanda stands in front of the canvas with her arms crossed over her\nbreast.\n\n\"This picture, like many of those of the Venetian school, is\nsimultaneously to represent a portrait and to tell a story,\"\nexplained the painter, who again had become pale as death.\n\n\"And what will you call it?\" she asked, \"but what is the matter with\nyou, are you ill?\"\n\n\"I am afraid--\" he answered with a consuming look fixed on the\nbeautiful woman in furs, \"but let us talk of the picture.\"\n\n\"Yes, let us talk about the picture.\"\n\n\"I imagine the goddess of love as having descended from Mount Olympus\nfor the sake of some mortal man. And always cold in this modern world\nof ours, she seeks to keep her sublime body warm in a large heavy fur\nand her feet in the lap of her lover. I imagine the favorite of a\nbeautiful despot, who whips her slave, when she is tired of kissing\nhim, and the more she treads him underfoot, the more insanely he loves\nher. And so I shall call the picture: _Venus in Furs_.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe painter paints slowly, but his passion grows more and more\nrapidly. I am afraid he will end up by committing suicide. She plays\nwith him and propounds riddles to him which he cannot solve, and he\nfeels his blood congealing in the process, but it amuses her.\n\nDuring the sitting she nibbles at candies, and rolls the paper-wrappers\ninto little pellets with which she bombards him.\n\n\"I am glad you are in such good humor,\" said the painter, \"but your face\nhas lost the expression which I need for my picture.\"\n\n\"The expression which you need for your picture,\" she replied,\nsmiling. \"Wait a moment.\"\n\nShe rose, and dealt me a blow with the whip. The painter looked at\nher with stupefaction, and a child-like surprise showed on his face,\nmingled with disgust and admiration.\n\nWhile whipping me, Wanda's face acquired more and more of the cruel,\ncontemptuous character, which so haunts and intoxicates me.\n\n\"Is this the expression you need for your picture?\" she exclaimed.\nThe painter lowered his look in confusion before the cold ray of her\neye.\n\n\"It is the expression--\" he stammered, \"but I can't paint now--\"\n\n\"What?\" said Wanda, scornfully, \"perhaps I can help you?\"\n\n\"Yes--\" cried the German, as if taken with madness, \"whip me too.\"\n\n\"Oh! With pleasure,\" she replied, shrugging her shoulders, \"but if\nI am to whip you I want to do it in sober earnest.\"\n\n\"Whip me to death,\" cried the painter.\n\n\"Will you let me tie you?\" she asked, smiling.\n\n\"Yes--\" he moaned--\n\nWanda left the room for a moment, and returned with ropes.\n\n\"Well--are you still brave enough to put yourself into the power of\nVenus in Furs, the beautiful despot, for better or worse?\" she began\nironically.\n\n\"Yes, tie me,\" the painter replied dully. Wanda tied his hands on\nhis back and drew a rope through his arms and a second one around his\nbody, and fettered him to the cross-bars of the window. Then she\nrolled back the fur, seized the whip, and stepped in front of him.\n\nThe scene had a grim attraction for me, which I cannot describe. I\nfelt my heart beat, when, with a smile, she drew back her arm for the\nfirst blow, and the whip hissed through the air. He winced slightly\nunder the blow. Then she let blow after blow rain upon him, with her\nmouth half-opened and her teeth flashing between her red lips, until\nhe finally seemed to ask for mercy with his piteous, blue eyes. It\nwas indescribable.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe is sitting for him now, alone. He is working on her head.\n\nShe has posted me in the adjoining room behind a heavy curtain,\nwhere I can't be seen, but can see everything.\n\nWhat does she intend now?\n\nIs she afraid of him? She has driven him insane enough to be sure,\nor is she hatching a new torment for me? My knees tremble.\n\nThey are talking. He has lowered his voice so that I cannot\nunderstand a word, and she replies in the same way. What is the\nmeaning of this? Is there an understanding between them?\n\nI suffer frightful torments; my heart seems about to burst.\n\nHe kneels down before her, embraces her, and presses his head\nagainst her breast, and she--in her heartlessness--laughs--and now\nI hear her saying aloud:\n\n\"Ah! You need another application of the whip.\"\n\n\"Woman! Goddess! Are you without a heart--can't you love,\" exclaimed\nthe German, \"don't you even know, what it means to love, to be\nconsumed with desire and passion, can't you even imagine what I\nsuffer? Have you no pity for me?\"\n\n\"No!\" she replied proudly and mockingly, \"but I have the whip.\"\n\nShe drew it quickly from the pocket of her fur-coat, and struck him\nin the face with the handle. He rose, and drew back a couple of paces.\n\n\"Now, are you ready to paint again?\" she asked indifferently. He did\nnot reply, but again went to the easel and took up his brush and\npalette.\n\nThe painting is marvellously successful. It is a portrait which as\nfar as the likeness goes couldn't be better, and at the same time it\nseems to have an ideal quality. The colors glow, are supernatural;\nalmost diabolical, I would call them.\n\nThe painter has put all his sufferings, his adoration, and all his\nexecration into the picture.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nNow he is painting me; we are alone together for several hours every\nday. To-day he suddenly turned to me with his vibrant voice and said:\n\n\"You love this woman?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I also love her.\" His eyes were bathed in tears. He remained silent\nfor a while, and continued painting.\n\n\"We have a mountain at home in Germany within which she dwells,\" he\nmurmured to himself. \"She is a demon.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe picture is finished. She insisted on paying him for it,\nmunificently, in the manner of queens.\n\n\"Oh, you have already paid me,\" he said, with a tormented smile,\nrefusing her offer.\n\nBefore he left, he secretly opened his portfolio, and let me look\ninside. I was startled. Her head looked at me as if out of a mirror\nand seemed actually to be alive.\n\n\"I shall take it along,\" he said, \"it is mine; she can't take it\naway from me. I have earned it with my heart's blood.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I am really rather sorry for the poor painter,\" she said to me to-day,\n\"it is absurd to be as virtuous as I am. Don't you think so too?\"\n\nI did not dare to reply to her.\n\n\"Oh, I forgot that I am talking with a slave; I need some fresh air,\nI want to be diverted, I want to forget.\n\n\"The carriage, quick!\"\n\nHer new dress is extravagant: Russian half-boots of violet-blue\nvelvet trimmed with ermine, and a skirt of the same material,\ndecorated with narrow stripes and rosettes of furs. Above it is an\nappropriate, close-fitting jacket, also richly trimmed and lined with\nermine. The headdress is a tall cap of ermine of the style of\nCatherine the Second, with a small aigrette, held in place by a\ndiamond-agraffe; her red hair falls loose down her back. She ascends\non the driver's seat, and holds the reins herself; I take my seat\nbehind. How she lashes on the horses! The carriage flies along like\nmad.\n\nApparently it is her intention to attract attention to-day, to make\nconquests, and she succeeds completely. She is the lioness of the\nCascine. People nod to her from carriages; on the footpath people\ngather in groups to discuss her. She pays no attention to anyone,\nexcept now and then acknowledging the greetings of elderly gentlemen\nwith a slight nod.\n\nSuddenly a young man on a lithe black horse dashes up at full speed.\nAs soon as he sees Wanda, he stops his horse and makes it walk. When\nhe is quite close, he stops entirely and lets her pass. And she too\nsees him--the lioness, the lion. Their eyes meet. She madly drives\npast him, but she cannot tear herself free from the magic power of\nhis look, and she turns her head after him.\n\nMy heart stops when I see the half-surprised, half-enraptured look\nwith which she devours him, but he is worthy of it.\n\nFor he is, indeed, a magnificent specimen of man, No, rather, he is\na man whose like I have never yet seen among the living. He is in the\nBelvedere, graven in marble, with the same slender, yet steely\nmusculature, with the same face and the same waving curls. What makes\nhim particularly beautiful is that he is beardless. If his hips were\nless narrow, one might take him for a woman in disguise. The curious\nexpression about the mouth, the lion's lip which slightly discloses\nthe teeth beneath, lends a flashing tinge of cruelty to the beautiful\nface--\n\nApollo flaying Marsyas.\n\nHe wears high black boots, closely fitting breeches of white\nleather, short fur coat of black cloth, of the kind worn by Italian\ncavalry officers, trimmed with astrakhan and many rich loops; on his\nblack locks is a red fez.\n\nI now understand the masculine Eros, and I marvel at Socrates for\nhaving remained virtuous in view of an Alcibiades like this.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have never seen my lioness so excited. Her cheeks flamed when she\nleft from the carriage at her villa. She hurried upstairs, and with\nan imperious gesture ordered me to follow.\n\nWalking up and down her room with long strides, she began to talk so\nrapidly, that I was frightened.\n\n\"You are to find out who the man in the Cascine was, immediately--\n\n\"Oh, what a man! Did you see him? What do you think of him? Tell me.\"\n\n\"The man is beautiful,\" I replied dully.\n\n\"He is so beautiful,\" she paused, supporting herself on the arm of\na chair, \"that he has taken my breath away.\"\n\n\"I can understand the impression he has made on you,\" I replied, my\nimagination carrying me away in a mad whirl. \"I am quite lost in\nadmiration myself, and I can imagine--\"\n\n\"You may imagine,\" she laughed aloud, \"that this man is my lover,\nand that he will apply the lash to you, and that you will enjoy being\npunished by him.\n\n\"But now go, go.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nBefore evening fell, I had the desired information.\n\nWanda was still fully dressed when I returned. She reclined on the\nottoman, her face buried in her hands, her hair in a wild tangle,\nlike the red mane of a lioness.\n\n\"What is his name?\" she asked, uncanny calm.\n\n\"Alexis Papadopolis.\"\n\n\"A Greek, then,\"\n\nI nodded.\n\n\"He is very young?\"\n\n\"Scarcely older than you. They say he was educated in Paris, and\nthat he is an atheist. He fought against the Turks in Candia, and is\nsaid to have distinguished himself there no less by his race-hatred\nand cruelty, than by his bravery.\"\n\n\"All in all, then, a man,\" she cried with sparkling eyes.\n\n\"At present he is living in Florence,\" I continued, \"he is said to\nbe tremendously rich--\"\n\n\"I didn't ask you about that,\" she interrupted quickly and sharply.\n\"The man is dangerous. Aren't you afraid of him? I am afraid of him.\nHas he a wife?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"A mistress?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"What theaters does he attend?\"\n\n\"To-night he will be at the Nicolini Theater, where Virginia Marini\nand Salvini are acting; they are the greatest living artists in\nItaly, perhaps in Europe.\n\n\"See that you get a box--and be quick about it!\" she commanded.\n\n\"But, mistress--\"\n\n\"Do you want a taste of the whip?\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"You can wait down in the lobby,\" she said when I had placed the\nopera-glasses and the programme on the edge of her box and adjusted\nthe footstool.\n\nI am standing there and had to lean against the wall for support so\nas not to fall down with envy and rage--no, rage isn't the right\nword; it was a mortal fear.\n\nI saw her in her box dressed in blue moire, with a huge ermine cloak\nabout her bare shoulders; he sat opposite. I saw them devour each\nother with their eyes. For both of them the stage, Goldoni's _Pamela,_\nSalvini, Marini, the public, even the entire world, were non-existant\nto-night. And I--what was I at that moment?--\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nTo-day she is attending the ball at the Greek ambassador's. Does she\nknow, that she will meet him there?\n\nAt any rate she dressed, as if she did. A heavy sea-green silk dress\nplastically encloses her divine form, leaving the bust and arms bare. In\nher hair, which is done into a single flaming knot, a white water-lily\nblossoms; from it the leaves of reeds interwoven with a few loose\nstrands fall down toward her neck. There no longer is any trace of\nagitation or trembling feverishness in her being. She is calm, so calm,\nthat I feel my blood congealing and my heart growing cold under her\nglance. Slowly, with a weary, indolent majesty, she ascends the marble\nstaircase, lets her precious wrap slide off, and listlessly enters the\nhall, where the smoke of a hundred candles has formed a silvery mist.\n\nFor a few moments my eyes follow her in a daze, then I pick up her\nfurs, which without my being aware, had slipped from my hands. They\nare still warm from her shoulders.\n\nI kiss the spot, and my eyes fill with tears.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nHe has arrived.\n\nIn his black velvet coat extravagantly trimmed with sable, he is a\nbeautiful, haughty despot who plays with the lives and souls of men.\nHe stands in the ante-room, looking around proudly, and his eyes rest\non me for an uncomfortably long time.\n\nUnder his icy glance I am again seized by a mortal fear. I have a\npresentiment that this man can enchain her, captivate her, subjugate\nher, and I feel inferior in contrast with his savage masculinity; I\nam filled with envy, with jealousy.\n\nI feel that I am a queer weakly creature of brains, merely! And what\nis most humiliating, I want to hate him, but I can't. Why is that\namong all the host of servants he has chosen me.\n\nWith an inimitably aristocratic nod of the head he calls me over to\nhim, and I--I obey his call--against my own will.\n\n\"Take my furs,\" he quickly commands.\n\nMy entire body trembles with resentment, but I obey, abjectly like\na slave.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nAll night long I waited in the ante-room, raving as in a fever.\nStrange images hovered past my inner eye. I saw their meeting--their\nlong exchange of looks. I saw her float through the hall in his arms,\ndrunken, lying with half-closed lids against his breast. I saw him\nin the holy of holies of love, lying on the ottoman, not as slave,\nbut as master, and she at his feet. On my knees I served them, the\ntea-tray faltering in my hands, and I saw him reach for the whip.\nBut now the servants are talking about him.\n\nHe is a man who is like a woman; he knows that he is beautiful, and\nhe acts accordingly. He changes his clothes four or five times a day,\nlike a vain courtesan.\n\nIn Paris he appeared first in woman's dress, and the men assailed\nhim with love-letters. An Italian singer, famous equally for his art\nand his passionate intensity, even invaded his home, and lying on his\nknees before him threatened to commit suicide if he wouldn't be his.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he replied, smiling, \"I should like to do you the\nfavor, but you will have to carry out your threat, for I am a man.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nThe drawing-room has already thinned out to a marked degree, but she\napparently has no thought of leaving.\n\nMorning is already peering through the blinds.\n\nAt last I hear the rustling of her heavy gown which flows along\nbehind her like green waves. She advances step by step, engaged in\nconversation with him.\n\nI hardly exist for her any longer; she doesn't even trouble to give\nme an order.\n\n\"The cloak for madame,\" he commands. He, of course, doesn't think of\nlooking after her himself.\n\nWhile I put her furs about her, he stands to one side with his arms\ncrossed. While I am on my knees putting on her fur over-shoes, she\nlightly supports herself with her hand on his shoulder. She asks:\n\n\"And what about the lioness?\"\n\n\"When the lion whom she has chosen and with whom she lives is\nattacked by another,\" the Greek went on with his narrative, \"the\nlioness quietly lies down and watches the battle. Even if her mate\nis worsted she does not go to his aid. She looks on indifferently as\nhe bleeds to death under his opponent's claws, and follows the victor,\nthe stronger--that is the female's nature.\"\n\nAt this moment my lioness looked quickly and curiously at me.\n\nIt made me shudder, though I didn't know why--and the red dawn\nimmerses me and her and him in blood.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe did not go to bed, but merely threw off her ball-dress and undid\nher hair; then she ordered me to build a fire, and she sat by the\nfire-place, and stared into the flames.\n\n\"Do you need me any longer, mistress?\" I asked, my voice failed me\nat the last word.\n\nWanda shook her head.\n\nI left the room, passed through the gallery, and sat down on one of\nthe steps, leading from there down into the garden. A gentle north\nwind brought a fresh, damp coolness from the Arno, the green hills\nextended into the distance in a rosy mist, a golden haze hovered over\nthe city, over the round cupola of the Duomo.\n\nA few stars still tremble in the pale-blue sky.\n\nI tore open my coat, and pressed my burning forehead against the\nmarble. Everything that had happened so far seemed to me a mere\nchild's play; but now things were beginning to be serious, terribly\nserious.\n\nI anticipated a catastrophe, I visualized it, I could lay hold of it\nwith my hands, but I lacked the courage to meet it. My strength was\nbroken. And if I am honest with myself, neither the pains and\nsufferings that threatened me, not the humiliations that impended,\nwere the thing that frightened me.\n\nI merely felt a fear, the fear of losing her whom I loved with a\nsort of fanatical devotion; but it was so overwhelming, so crushing\nthat I suddenly began to sob like a child.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nDuring the day she remained locked in her room, and had the negress\nattend her. When the evening star rose glowing in the blue sky, I saw\nher pass through the garden, and, carefully following her at a\ndistance, watched her enter the shrine of Venus. I stealthily\nfollowed and peered through the chink in the door.\n\nShe stood before the divine image of the goddess, her hands folded\nas in prayer, and the sacred light of the star of love casts its blue\nrays over her.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nOn my couch at night the fear of losing her and despair took such\npowerful hold of me that they made a hero and a libertine of me. I\nlighted the little red oil-lamp which hung in the corridor beneath\na saint's image, and entered her bedroom, covering the light with one\nhand.\n\nThe lioness had been hunted and driven until she was exhausted. She\nhad fallen asleep among her pillows, lying on her back, her hands\nclenched, breathing heavily. A dream seemed to oppress her. I slowly\nwithdrew my hand, and let the red light fall full on her wonderful\nface.\n\nBut she did not awaken.\n\nI gently set the lamp on the floor, sank down beside Wanda's bed,\nand rested my head on her soft, glowing arm.\n\nShe moved slightly, but even now did not awaken. I do not know how\nlong I lay thus in the middle of the night, turned as into a stone\nby horrible torments.\n\nFinally a severe trembling seized me, and I was able to cry. My\ntears flowed over her arm. She quivered several times and finally sat\nup; she brushed her hand across her eyes, and looked at me.\n\n\"Severin,\" she exclaimed, more frightened than angry.\n\nI was unable to reply.\n\n\"Severin,\" she continued softly, \"what is the matter? Are you ill?\"\n\nHer voice sounded so sympathetic, so kind, so full of love, that it\nclutched my breast like red-hot tongs and I began to sob aloud.\n\n\"Severin,\" she began anew. \"My poor unhappy friend.\" Her hand gently\nstroked my hair. \"I am sorry, very sorry for you; but I can't help\nyou; with the best intention in the world I know of nothing that\nwould cure you.\"\n\n\"Oh, Wanda, must it be?\" I moaned in my agony.\n\n\"What, Severin? What are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any more?\" I continued. \"Haven't you even a\nlittle bit of pity for me? Has the beautiful stranger taken complete\npossession of you?\"\n\n\"I cannot lie,\" she replied softly after a short pause. \"He has made\nan impression on me which I haven't yet been able to analyse, further\nthan that I suffer and tremble beneath it. It is an impression of the\nsort I have met with in the works of poets or on the stage, but I\nalways thought it was a figment of the imagination. Oh, he is a man\nlike a lion, strong and beautiful and yet gentle, not brutal like the\nmen of our northern world. I am sorry for you, Severin, I am; but I\nmust possess him. What am I saying? I must give myself to him, if he\nwill have me.\"\n\n\"Consider your reputation, Wanda, which so far has remained\nspotless,\" I exclaimed, \"even if I no longer mean anything to you.\"\n\n\"I am considering it,\" she replied, \"I intend to be strong, as long\nas it is possible, I want--\" she buried her head shyly in the pillows\n--\"I want to become his wife--if he will have me.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I cried, seized again by that mortal fear, which always\nrobs me of my breath, makes me lose possession of myself, \"you want\nto be his wife, belong to him for always. Oh! Do not drive me away!\nHe does not love you--\"\n\n\"Who says that?\" she exclaimed, flaring up.\n\n\"He does not love you,\" I went on passionately, \"but I love you, I\nadore you, I am your slave, I let you tread me underfoot, I want to\ncarry you on my arms through life.\"\n\n\"Who says that he doesn't love me?\" she interrupted vehemently.\n\n\"Oh! be mine,\" I replied, \"be mine! I cannot exist, cannot live\nwithout you. Have mercy on me, Wanda, have mercy!\"\n\nShe looked at me again, and her face had her cold heartless\nexpression, her evil smile.\n\n\"You say he doesn't love me,\" she said, scornfully. \"Very well then,\nget what consolation you can out of it.\"\n\nWith this she turned over on the other side, and contemptuously\nshowed me her back.\n\n\"Good God, are you a woman without flesh or blood, haven't you a\nheart as well as I!\" I cried, while my breast heaved convulsively.\n\n\"You know what I am,\" she replied, coldly. \"I am a woman of stone,\n_Venus in Furs_, your ideal, kneel down, and pray to me.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I implored, \"mercy!\"\n\nShe began to laugh. I buried my face in her pillows. Pain had\nloosened the floodgates of my tears and I let them flow.\n\nFor a long time silence reigned, then Wanda slowly raised herself.\n\n\"You bore me,\" she began.\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"I am tired, let me go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Mercy,\" I implored. \"Do not drive me away. No man, no one, will\nlove you as I do.\"\n\n\"Let me go to sleep,\"--she turned her back to me again.\n\nI leaped up, and snatched the poinard, which hung beside her bed,\nfrom its sheath, and placed its point against my breast.\n\n\"I shall kill myself here before your eyes,\" I murmured dully.\n\n\"Do what you please,\" Wanda replied with complete indifference. \"But\nlet me go to sleep.\" She yawned aloud. \"I am very sleepy.\"\n\nFor a moment I stood as if petrified. Then I began to laugh and cry\nat the same time. Finally I placed the poinard in my belt, and again\nfell on my knees before her.\n\n\"Wanda, listen to me, only for a few moments,\" I begged.\n\n\"I want to go to sleep! Don't you hear!\" she cried, leaping angrily\nout of bed and pushing me away with her foot. \"You forget that I am\nyour mistress?\" When I didn't budge, she seized the whip and struck\nme. I rose; she struck me again--this time right in the face.\n\n\"Wretch, slave!\"\n\nWith clenched fist held heavenward, I left her bedroom with a sudden\nresolve. She tossed the whip aside, and broke out into clear\nlaughter. I can imagine that my theatrical attitude must have been\nvery droll.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have determined to set myself free from this heartless woman, who\nhas treated me so cruelly, and is now about to break faith and betray\nme, as a reward for all my slavish devotion, for everything I have\nsuffered from her. I packed my few belongings into a bundle, and then\nwrote her as follows:\n\n\"Dear Madam,--\n\nI have loved you even to madness, I have given myself to you as no man\never has given himself to a woman. You have abused my most sacred\nemotions, and played an impudent, frivolous game with me. However, as\nlong as you were merely cruel and merciless, it was still possible for\nme to love you. Now you are about to become _cheap_. I am no longer\nthe slave whom you can kick about and whip. You yourself have set me\nfree, and I am leaving a woman I can only hate and despise.\n\nSeverin Kusiemski.\"\n\nI handed these lines to the negress, and hastened away as fast as I\ncould go. I arrived at the railway-station all out of breath.\nSuddenly I felt a sharp pain in my heart and stopped. I began to\nweep. It is humiliating that I want to flee and I can't. I turn back--\nwhither?--to her, whom I abhor, and yet, at the same time, adore.\n\nAgain I pause. I cannot go back. I dare not.\n\nBut how am I to leave Florence. I remember that I haven't any money,\nnot a penny. Very well then, on foot; it is better to be an honest\nbeggar than to eat the bread of a courtesan.\n\nBut still I can't leave.\n\nShe has my pledge, my word of honor. I have to return. Perhaps she\nwill release me.\n\nAfter a few rapid strides, I stop again.\n\nShe has my word of honor and my bond, that I shall remain her slave\nas long as she desires, until she herself gives me my freedom. But\nI might kill myself.\n\nI go through the Cascine down to the Arno, where its yellow waters\nplash monotonously about a couple of stray willows. There I sit, and\ncast up my final accounts with existence. I let my entire life pass\nbefore me in review. On the whole, it is rather a wretched affair--a\nfew joys, an endless number of indifferent and worthless things, and\nbetween these an abundant harvest of pains, miseries, fears,\ndisappointments, shipwrecked hopes, afflictions, sorrow and grief.\n\nI thought of my mother, whom I loved so deeply and whom I had to\nwatch waste away beneath a horrible disease; of my brother, who full\nof the promise of joy and happiness died in the flower of youth,\nwithout even having put his lips to the cup of life. I thought of my\ndead nurse, my childhood playmates, the friends that had striven and\nstudied with me; of all those, covered by the cold, dead, indifferent\nearth. I thought of my turtle-dove, who not infrequently made his\ncooing bows to me, instead of to his mate.--All have returned, dust\nunto dust.\n\nI laughed aloud, and slid down into the water, but at the same\nmoment I caught hold of one of the willow-branches, hanging above the\nyellow waves. As in a vision, I see the woman who has caused all my\nmisery. She hovers above the level of the water, luminous in the\nsunlight as though she were transparent, with red flames about her\nhead and neck. She turns her face toward me and smiles.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI am back again, dripping, wet through, glowing with shame and\nfever. The negress has delivered my letter; I am judged, lost, in the\npower of a heartless, affronted woman.\n\nWell, let her kill me. I am unable to do it myself, and yet I have\nno wish to go on living.\n\nAs I walk around the house, she is standing in the gallery, leaning\nover the railing. Her face is full in the light of the sun, and her\ngreen eyes sparkle.\n\n\"Still alive?\" she asked, without moving. I stood silent, with bowed\nhead.\n\n\"Give me back my poinard,\" she continued. \"It is of no use to you.\nYou haven't even the courage to take your own life.\"\n\n\"I have lost it,\" I replied, trembling, shaken by chills.\n\nShe looked me over with a proud, scornful glance.\n\n\"I suppose you lost it in the Arno?\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"No\nmatter. Well, and why didn't you leave?\"\n\nI mumbled something which neither she nor I myself could understand.\n\n\"Oh! you haven't any money,\" she cried. \"Here!\" With an\nindescribably disdainful gesture she tossed me her purse.\n\nI did not pick it up.\n\nBoth of us were silent for some time.\n\n\"You don't want to leave then?\"\n\n\"I can't.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nWanda drives in the Cascine without me, and goes to the theater\nwithout me; she receives company, and the negress serves her. No one\nasks after me. I stray about the garden, irresolutely, like an animal\nthat has lost its master.\n\nLying among the bushes, I watch a couple of sparrows, fighting over\na seed.\n\nSuddenly I hear the swish of a woman's dress.\n\nWanda approaches in a gown of dark silk, modestly closed up to the\nneck; the Greek is with her. They are in an eager discussion, but I\ncannot as yet understand a word of what they are saying. He stamps\nhis foot so that the gravel scatters about in all directions, and he\nlashes the air with his riding whip. Wanda startles.\n\nIs she afraid that he will strike her?\n\nHave they gone that far?\n\nHe has left her, she calls him; he does not hear her, does not want\nto hear her.\n\nWanda sadly lowers her head, and then sits down on the nearest\nstone-bench. She sits for a long time, lost in thought. I watch her with\na sort of malevolent pleasure, finally I pull myself together by sheer\nforce of will, and ironically step before her. She startles, and\ntrembles all over.\n\n\"I come to wish you happiness,\" I said, bowing, \"I see, my dear\nlady, too, has found a master.\"\n\n\"Yes, thank God!\" she exclaimed, \"not a new slave, I have had enough\nof them. A master! Woman needs a master, and she adores him.\"\n\n\"You adore him, Wanda?\" I cried, \"this brutal person--\"\n\n\"Yes, I love him, as I have never loved any one else.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\" I clenched my fists, but tears already filled my eyes, and\nI was seized by the delirium of passion, as by a sweet madness. \"Very\nwell, take him as your husband, let him be your master, but I want\nto remain your slave, as long as I live.\"\n\n\"You want to remain my slave, even then?\" she said, \"that would be\ninteresting, but I am afraid he wouldn't permit it.\"\n\n\"He?\"\n\n\"Yes, he is already jealous of you,\" she exclaimed, \"he, of you! He\ndemanded that I dismiss you immediately, and when I told him who you\nwere--\"\n\n\"You told him--\" I repeated, thunderstruck.\n\n\"I told him everything,\" she replied, \"our whole story, all your\nqueerness, everything--and he, instead of being amused, grew angry,\nand stamped his foot.\"\n\n\"And threatened to strike you?\"\n\nWanda looked to the ground, and remained silent.\n\n\"Yes, indeed,\" I said with mocking bitterness, \"you are afraid of\nhim, Wanda!\" I threw myself down at her feet, and in my agitation\nembraced her knees. \"I don't want anything of you, except to be your\nslave, to be always near you! I will be your dog-\"\n\n\"Do you know, you bore me?\" said Wanda, indifferently.\n\nI leaped up. Everything within me was seething.\n\n\"You are now no longer cruel, but cheap,\" I said, clearly and\ndistinctly, accentuating every word.\n\n\"You have already written that in your letter,\" Wanda replied, with\na proud shrug of the shoulders. \"A man of brains should never repeat\nhimself.\"\n\n\"The way you are treating me,\" I broke out, \"what would you call it?\"\n\n\"I might punish you,\" she replied ironically, \"but I prefer this\ntime to reply with reasons instead of lashes. You have no right to\naccuse me. Haven't I always been honest with you? Haven't I warned\nyou more than once? Didn't I love you with all my heart, even\npassionately, and did I conceal the fact from you, that it was\ndangerous to give yourself into my power, to abase yourself before\nme, and that I want to be dominated? But you wished to be my\nplaything, my slave! You found the highest pleasure in feeling the\nfoot, the whip of an arrogant, cruel woman. What do you want now?\n\n\"Dangerous potentialities were slumbering in me, but you were the\nfirst to awaken them. If I now take pleasure in torturing you,\nabusing you, it is your fault; you have made of me what I now am, and\nnow you are even unmanly, weak, and miserable enough to accuse me.\"\n\n\"Yes, I am guilty,\" I said, \"but haven't I suffered because of it?\nLet us put an end now to the cruel game.\"\n\n\"That is my wish, too,\" she replied with a curious deceitful look.\n\n\"Wanda!\" I exclaimed violently, \"don't drive me to extremes; you see\nthat I am a man again.\"\n\n\"A fire of straw,\" she replied, \"which makes a lot of stir for a\nmoment, and goes out as quickly as it flared up. You imagine you can\nintimidate me, and you only make yourself ridiculous. Had you been\nthe man I first thought you were, serious, reserved, stern, I would\nhave loved you faithfully, and become your wife. Woman demands that\nshe can look up to a man, but one like you who voluntarily places his\nneck under her foot, she uses as a welcome plaything, only to toss\nit aside when she is tired of it.\"\n\n\"Try to toss me aside,\" I said, jeeringly. \"Some toys are dangerous.\"\n\n\"Don't challenge me,\" exclaimed Wanda. Her eyes began to flash, and\na flush entered her cheeks.\n\n\"If you won't be mine now,\" I continued, with a voice stifled with\nrage, \"no one else shall possess you either.\"\n\n\"What play is this from?\" she mocked, seizing me by the breast. She\nwas pale with anger at this moment. \"Don't challenge me,\" she\ncontinued, \"I am not cruel, but I don't know whether I may not become\nso and whether then there will be any bounds.\"\n\n\"What worse can you do, than to make your lover, your husband?\" I\nexclaimed, more and more enraged.\n\n\"I might make you _his_ slave,\" she replied quickly, \"are you not in\nmy power? Haven't I the agreement? But, of course, you will merely\ntake pleasure in it, if I have you bound, and say to him.\n\n\"Do with him what you please.\"\n\n\"Woman, are you mad!\" I cried.\n\n\"I am entirely rational,\" she said, calmly. \"I warn you for the last\ntime. Don't offer any resistance, one who has gone as far as I have\ngone might easily go still further. I feel a sort of hatred for you,\nand would find a real joy in seeing him beat you to death; I am still\nrestraining myself, but--\"\n\nScarcely master of myself any longer, I seized her by the wrist and\nforced her to the ground, so that she lay on her knees before me.\n\n\"Severin!\" she cried. Rage and terror were painted on her face.\n\n\"I shall kill you if you marry him,\" I threatened; the words came\nhoarsely and dully from my breast. \"You are mine, I won't let you go,\nI love you too much.\" Then I clutched her and pressed her close to\nme; my right hand involuntarily seized the dagger which I still had\nin my belt.\n\nWanda fixed a large, calm, incomprehensible look on me.\n\n\"I like you that way,\" she said, carelessly. \"Now you are a man, and\nat this moment I know I still love you.\"\n\n\"Wanda,\" I wept with rapture, and bent down over her, covering her\ndear face with kisses, and she, suddenly breaking into a loud gay\nlaugh, said, \"Have you finished with your ideal now, are you\nsatisfied with me?\"\n\n\"You mean?\" I stammered, \"that you weren't serious?\"\n\n\"I am very serious,\" she gaily continued. \"I love you, only you, and\nyou--you foolish, little man, didn't know that everything was only\nmake-believe and play-acting. How hard it often was for me to strike\nyou with the whip, when I would have rather taken your head and\ncovered it with kisses. But now we are through with that, aren't we?\nI have played my cruel role better than you expected, and now you\nwill be satisfied with my being a good, little wife who isn't\naltogether unattractive. Isn't that so? We will live like rational\npeople--\"\n\n\"You will marry me!\" I cried, overflowing with happiness.\n\n\"Yes--marry you--you dear, darling man,\" whispered Wanda, kissing my\nhands.\n\nI drew her up to my breast.\n\n\"Now, you are no longer Gregor, my slave,\" said she, \"but Severin,\nthe dear man I love--\"\n\n\"And he--you don't love him?\" I asked in agitation.\n\n\"How could you imagine my loving a man of his brutal type? You were\nblind to everything, I was really afraid for you.\"\n\n\"I almost killed myself for your sake.\"\n\n\"Really?\" she cried, \"ah, I still tremble at the thought, that you\nwere already in the Arno.\"\n\n\"But you saved me,\" I replied, tenderly. \"You hovered over the\nwaters and smiled, and your smile called me back to life.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nI have a curious feeling when I now hold her in my arms and she lies\nsilently against my breast and lets me kiss her and smiles. I feel\nlike one who has suddenly awakened out of a feverish delirium, or\nlike a shipwrecked man who has for many days battled with waves that\nmomentarily threatened to devour him and finally has found a safe\nshore.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"I hate this Florence, where you have been so unhappy,\" she\ndeclared, as I was saying good-night to her. \"I want to leave\nimmediately, tomorrow, you will be good enough to write a couple of\nletters for me, and, while you are doing that, I will drive to the\ncity to pay my farewell visits. Is that satisfactory to you?\"\n\n\"Of course, you dear, sweet, beautiful woman.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nEarly in the morning she knocked at my door to ask how I had slept.\nHer tenderness is positively wonderful. I should never have believed\nthat she could be so tender.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe has now been gone for over four hours. I have long since\nfinished the letters, and am now sitting in the gallery, looking down\nthe street to see whether I cannot discover her carriage in the\ndistance. I am a little worried about her, and yet I know there is\nno reason under heaven why I should doubt or fear. However, a feeling\nof oppression weighs me down, and I cannot rid myself of it. It is\nprobably the sufferings of the past days, which still cast their\nshadows into my soul.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nShe is back, radiant with happiness and contentment.\n\n\"Well, has everything gone as you wished?\" I asked tenderly, kissing\nher hand.\n\n\"Yes, dear heart,\" she replied, \"and we shall leave to-night. Help\nme pack my trunks.\"\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nToward evening she asked me to go to the post-office and mail her\nletters myself. I took her carriage, and was back within an hour.\n\n\"Mistress has asked for you,\" said the negress, with a grin, as I\nascended the wide marble stairs.\n\n\"Has anyone been here?\"\n\n\"No one,\" she replied, crouching down on the steps like a black cat.\n\nI slowly passed through the drawing-room, and then stood before her\nbedroom door.\n\nWhy does my heart beat so? Am I not perfectly happy?\n\nOpening the door softly, I draw back the portiere. Wanda is lying on\nthe ottoman, and does not seem to notice me. How beautiful she looks,\nin her silver-gray dress, which fits closely, and while displaying\nin tell-tale fashion her splendid figure, leaves her wonderful bust\nand arms bare.\n\nHer hair is interwoven with, and held up by a black velvet ribbon.\nA mighty fire is burning in the fire-place, the hanging lamp casts\na reddish glow, and the whole room is as if drowned in blood.\n\n\"Wanda,\" I said at last.\n\n\"Oh Severin,\" she cried out joyously. \"I have been impatiently\nwaiting for you.\" She leaped up, and folded me in her arms. She sat\ndown again on the rich cushions and tried to draw me down to her\nside, but I softly slid down to her feet and placed my head in her\nlap.\n\n\"Do you know I am very much in love with you to-day?\" she whispered,\nbrushing a few stray hairs from my forehead and kissing my eyes.\n\n\"How beautiful your eyes are, I have always loved them as the best\nof you, but to-day they fairly intoxicate me. I am all--\" She\nextended her magnificent limbs and tenderly looked at me from beneath\nher red lashes.\n\n\"And you--you are cold--you hold me like a block of wood; wait, I'll\nstir you with the fire of love,\" she said, and again clung fawningly\nand caressingly to my lips.\n\n\"I no longer please you; I suppose I'll have to be cruel to you\nagain, evidently I have been too kind to you to-day. Do you know, you\nlittle fool, what I shall do, I shall whip you for a while--\"\n\n\"But child--\"\n\n\"I want to.\"\n\n\"Wanda!\"\n\n\"Come, let me bind you,\" she continued, and ran gaily through the\nroom. \"I want to see you very much in love, do you understand? Here\nare the ropes. I wonder if I can still do it?\"\n\nShe began with fettering my feet and then she tied my hands behind\nmy back, pinioning my arms like those of a prisoner.\n\n\"So,\" she said, with gay eagerness. \"Can you still move?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Fine--\"\n\nShe then tied a noose in a stout rope, threw it over my head, and\nlet it slip down as far as the hips. She drew it tight, and bound me\nto a pillar.\n\nA curious tremor seized me at that moment.\n\n\"I have a feeling as if I were about to be executed,\" I said with a\nlow voice.\n\n\"Well, you shall have a thorough punishment to-day,\" exclaimed Wanda.\n\n\"But put on your fur-jacket, please,\" I said.\n\n\"I shall gladly give you that pleasure,\" she replied. She got her\n_kazabaika_, and put it on. Then she stood in front of me with\nher arms folded across her chest, and looked at me out of half-closed\neyes.\n\n\"Do you remember the story of the ox of Dionysius?\" she asked.\n\n\"I remember it only vaguely, what about it?\"\n\n\"A courtier invented a new implement of torture for the Tyrant of\nSyracuse. It was an iron ox in which those condemned to death were\nto be shut, and then pushed into a mighty furnace.\n\n\"As soon as the iron ox began to get hot, and the condemned person\nbegan to cry out in his torment, his wails sounded like the bellowing\nof an ox.\n\n\"Dionysius nodded graciously to the inventor, and to put his\ninvention to an immediate test had him shut up in the iron ox.\n\n\"It is a very instructive story.\n\n\"It was you who innoculated me with selfishness, pride, and cruelty,\nand _you shall be their first victim._ I now literally enjoy having a\nhuman being that thinks and feels and desires like myself in my power;\nI love to abuse a man who is stronger in intelligence and body than I,\nespecially a man who loves me.\n\n\"Do you still love me?\"\n\n\"Even to madness,\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"So much the better,\" she replied, \"and so much the more will you\nenjoy what I am about to do with you now.\"\n\n\"What is the matter with you?\" I asked. \"I don't understand you,\nthere is a gleam of real cruelty in your eyes to-day, and you are\nstrangely beautiful--completely _Venus in Furs.\"_\n\nWithout replying Wanda placed her arms around my neck and kissed me.\nI was again seized by my fanatical passion.\n\n\"Where is the whip?\" I asked.\n\nWanda laughed, and withdrew a couple of steps.\n\n\"You really insist upon being punished?\" she exclaimed, proudly\ntossing back her head.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nSuddenly Wanda's face was completely transformed. It was as if\ndisfigured by rage; for a moment she seemed even ugly to me.\n\n\"Very well, then _you_ whip him!\" she called loudly.\n\nAt the same instant the beautiful Greek stuck his head of black\ncurls through the curtains of her four-poster bed. At first I was\nspeechless, petrified. There was a horribly comic element in the\nsituation. I would have laughed aloud, had not my position been at\nthe same time so terribly cruel and humiliating.\n\nIt went beyond anything I had imagined. A cold shudder ran down my\nback, when my rival stepped from the bed in his riding boots, his\ntight-fitting white breeches, and his short velvet jacket, and I saw\nhis athletic limbs.\n\n\"You are indeed cruel,\" he said, turning to Wanda.\n\n\"Only inordinately fond of pleasure,\" she replied with a wild sort\nof humor. \"Pleasure alone lends value to existence; whoever enjoys\ndoes not easily part from life, whoever suffers or is needy meets\ndeath like a friend.\n\n\"But whoever wants to enjoy must take life gaily in the sense of the\nancient world; he dare not hesitate to enjoy at the expense of others;\nhe must never feel pity; he must be ready to harness others to his\ncarriage or his plough as though they were animals. He must know how to\nmake slaves of men who feel and would enjoy as he does, and use them for\nhis service and pleasure without remorse. It is not his affair whether\nthey like it, or whether they go to rack and ruin. He must always\nremember this, that if they had him in their power, as he has them they\nwould act in exactly the same way, and he would have to pay for their\npleasure with his sweat and blood and soul. That was the world of the\nancients: pleasure and cruelty, liberty and slavery went hand in hand.\nPeople who want to live like the gods of Olympus must of necessity have\nslaves whom they can toss into their fish-ponds, and gladiators who will\ndo battle, the while they banquet, and they must not mind if by chance a\nbit of blood bespatters them.\"\n\nHer words brought back my complete self-possession.\n\n\"Unloosen me!\" I exclaimed angrily.\n\n\"Aren't you my slave, my property?\" replied Wanda. \"Do you want me\nto show you the agreement?\"\n\n\"Untie me!\" I threatened, \"otherwise--\" I tugged at the ropes.\n\n\"Can he tear himself free?\" she asked. \"He has threatened to kill me.\"\n\n\"Be entirely at ease,\" said the Greek, testing my fetters.\n\n\"I shall call for help,\" I began again.\n\n\"No one will hear you,\" replied Wanda, \"and no one will hinder me\nfrom abusing your most sacred emotions or playing a frivolous game\nwith you.\" she continued, repeating with satanic mockery phrases from\nmy letter to her.\n\n\"Do you think I am at this moment merely cruel and merciless, or am\nI also about to become cheap? What? Do you still love me, or do you\nalready hate and despise me? Here is the whip--\" She handed it to the\nGreek who quickly stepped closer.\n\n\"Don't you dare!\" I exclaimed, trembling with indignation, \"I won't\npermit it--\"\n\n\"Oh, because I don't wear furs,\" the Greek replied with an ironical\nsmile, and he took his short sable from the bed.\n\n\"You are adorable,\" exclaimed Wanda, kissing him, and helping him\ninto his furs.\n\n\"May I really whip him?\" he asked.\n\n\"Do with him what you please,\" replied Wanda.\n\n\"Beast!\" I exclaimed, utterly revolted.\n\nThe Greek fixed his cold tigerish look upon me and tried out the\nwhip. His muscles swelled when he drew back his arms, and made the\nwhip hiss through the air. I was bound like Marsyas while Apollo was\ngetting ready to flay me.\n\nMy look wandered about the room and remained fixed on the ceiling,\nwhere Samson, lying at Delilah's feet, was about to have his eyes put\nout by the Philistines. The picture at that moment seemed to me like\na symbol, an eternal parable of passion and lust, of the love of man\nfor woman. \"Each one of us in the end is a Samson,\" I thought, \"and\nultimately for better or worse is betrayed by the woman he loves,\nwhether he wears an ordinary coat or sables.\"\n\n\"Now watch me break him in,\" said the Greek. He showed his teeth,\nand his face acquired the blood-thirsty expression, which startled\nme the first time I saw him.\n\nAnd he began to apply the lash--so mercilessly, with such frightful\nforce that I quivered under each blow, and began to tremble all over\nwith pain. Tears rolled down over my cheeks. In the meantime Wanda\nlay on the ottoman in her fur-jacket, supporting herself on her arm;\nshe looked on with cruel curiosity, and was convulsed with laughter.\n\nThe sensation of being whipped by a successful rival before the eyes\nof an adored woman cannot be described. I almost went mad with shame\nand despair.\n\nWhat was most humiliating was that at first I felt a certain wild,\nsupersensual stimulation under Apollo's whip and the cruel laughter\nof my Venus, no matter how horrible my position was. But Apollo\nwhipped on and on, blow after blow, until I forgot all about poetry,\nand finally gritted my teeth in impotent rage, and cursed my wild\ndreams, woman, and love.\n\nAll of a sudden I saw with horrible clarity whither blind passion\nand lust have led man, ever since Holofernes and Agamemnon--into a\nblind alley, into the net of woman's treachery, into misery, slavery,\nand death.\n\nIt was as though I were awakening from a dream.\n\nBlood was already flowing under the whip. I wound like a worm that\nis trodden on, but he whipped on without mercy, and she continued to\nlaugh without mercy. In the meantime she locked her packed trunk and\nslipped into her travelling furs, and was still laughing, when she\nwent downstairs on his arm and entered the carriage.\n\nThen everything was silent for a moment.\n\nI listened breathlessly.\n\nThe carriage door slammed, the horse began to pull--the rolling of\nthe carriage for a short time--then all was over.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nFor a moment I thought of taking vengeance, of killing him, but I\nwas bound by the abominable agreement. So nothing was left for me to\ndo except to keep my pledged word and grit my teeth.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\nMy first impulse after this, the most cruel catastrophe of my life,\nwas to seek laborious tasks, dangers, and privations. I wanted to\nbecome a soldier and go to Asia or Algiers, but my father was old and\nill and wanted me.\n\nSo I quietly returned home and for two years helped him bear his\nburdens, and learned how to look after the estate which I had never\ndone before. To _labor_ and to _do my duty_ was comforting like a\ndrink of fresh water. Then my father died, and I inherited the estate,\nbut it meant no change.\n\nI had put on my own Spanish boots and went on living just as\nrationally as if the old man were standing behind me, looking over\nmy shoulder with his large wise eyes.\n\nOne day a box arrived, accompanied by a letter. I recognized Wanda's\nwriting.\n\nCuriously moved, I opened it, and read.\n\n\"Sir.--\n\nNow that over three years have passed since that night in Florence,\nI suppose, I may confess to you that I loved you deeply. You\nyourself, however, stifled my love by your fantastic devotion and\nyour insane passion. From the moment that you became my slave, I knew\nit would be impossible for you ever to become my husband. However,\nI found it interesting to have you realize your ideal in my own person,\nand, while I gloriously amused myself, perhaps, to cure you.\n\nI found the strong man for whom I felt a need, and I was as happy\nwith him as, I suppose, it is possible for any one to be on this\nfunny ball of clay.\n\nBut my happiness, like all things mortal, was of short duration.\nAbout a year ago he fell in a duel, and since then I have been living\nin Paris, like an Aspasia--\n\nAnd you?--Your life surely is not without its sunshine, if you have\ngained control of your imagination, and those qualities in you have\nmaterialized, which at first so attracted me to you--your clarity of\nintellect, kindness of heart, and, above all else, your--_moral\nseriousness_.\n\nI hope you have been cured under my whip; the cure was cruel, but\nradical. In memory of that time and of a woman who loved you\npassionately, I am sending you the portrait by the poor German.\n\n_Venus in Furs_.\"\n\nI had to smile, and as I fell to musing the beautiful woman suddenly\nstood before me in her velvet jacket trimmed with ermine, with the\nwhip in her hand. And I continued to smile at the woman I had once\nloved so insanely, at the fur-jacket that had once so entranced me,\nat the whip, and ended by smiling at myself and saying: The cure was\ncruel, but radical; but the main point is, I have been cured.\n\n*       *       *       *       *\n\n\"And the moral of the story?\" I said to Severin when I put the\nmanuscript down on the table.\n\n\"That I was a donkey,\" he exclaimed without turning around, for he\nseemed to be embarrassed. \"If only I had beaten her!\"\n\n\"A curious remedy,\" I exclaimed, \"which might answer with your\npeasant-women--\"\n\n\"Oh, they are used to it,\" he replied eagerly, \"but imagine the\neffect upon one of our delicate, nervous, hysterical ladies--\"\n\n\"But the moral?\"\n\n\"That woman, as nature has created her and as man is at present\neducating her, is his enemy. She can only be his slave or his despot,\nbut _never his companion._ This she can become only when she has\nthe same rights as he, and is his equal in education and work.\n\n\"At present we have only the choice of being hammer or anvil, and I\nwas the kind of donkey who let a woman make a slave of him, do you\nunderstand?\n\n\"The moral of the tale is this: whoever allows himself to be\nwhipped, deserves to be whipped.\n\n\"The blows, as you see, have agreed with me; the roseate supersensual\nmist has dissolved, and no one can ever make me believe again that\nthese 'sacred apes of Benares' [Footnote: One of Schopenhauer's\ndesignations for women.] or Plato's rooster [Footnote: Diogenes\nthrew a plucked rooster into Plato's school and exclaimed: \"Here\nyou have Plato's human being.\"] are the image of God.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Venus in Furs, by Ritter von Leopold Sacher-Masoch\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK VENUS IN FURS ***\n\n***** This file should be named 6852-8.txt or 6852-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/6/8/5/6852/\n\nProduced by Avinash Kothare, Tom Allen, Tiffany Vergon,\nCharles Aldarondo, Charles Franks and the Online Distributed\nProofreading Team.\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

He obeyed, and having much leisure,\nconnected another subject with it; and, pursuing the train of thought\nto which his situation and turn of mind led him, brought forth, at\nlength, instead of the trifle which he at first intended, a serious\naffair--a volume.]\n\nI sing the Sofa.  I, who lately sang\nTruth, Hope, and Charity, and touched with awe\nThe solemn chords, and with a trembling hand,\nEscaped with pain from that advent'rous flight,\nNow seek repose upon a humbler theme:\nThe theme though humble, yet august and proud\nThe occasion--for the Fair commands the song.\n\nTime was, when clothing sumptuous or for use,\nSave their own painted skins, our sires had none.\nAs yet black breeches were not; satin smooth,\nOr velvet soft, or plush with shaggy pile:\nThe hardy chief upon the rugged rock\nWashed by the sea, or on the gravelly bank\nThrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud,\nFearless of wrong, reposed his weary strength.\nThose barbarous ages past, succeeded next\nThe birthday of invention; weak at first,\nDull in design, and clumsy to perform.\nJoint-stools were then created; on three legs\nUpborne they stood. Three legs upholding firm\nA massy slab, in fashion square or round.\nOn such a stool immortal Alfred sat,\nAnd swayed the sceptre of his infant realms;\nAnd such in ancient halls and mansions drear\nMay still be seen, but perforated sore\nAnd drilled in holes the solid oak is found,\nBy worms voracious eating through and through.\nAt length a generation more refined\nImproved the simple plan, made three legs four,\nGave them a twisted form vermicular,\nAnd o'er the seat, with plenteous wadding stuffed,\nInduced a splendid cover green and blue,\nYellow and red, of tapestry richly wrought\nAnd woven close, or needlework sublime.\nThere might ye see the peony spread wide,\nThe full-blown rose, the shepherd and his lass,\nLapdog and lambkin with black staring eyes,\nAnd parrots with twin cherries in their beak.\n\nNow came the cane from India, smooth and bright\nWith Nature's varnish; severed into stripes\nThat interlaced each other, these supplied,\nOf texture firm, a lattice-work that braced\nThe new machine, and it became a chair.\nBut restless was the chair; the back erect\nDistressed the weary loins that felt no ease;\nThe slippery seat betrayed the sliding part\nThat pressed it, and the feet hung dangling down,\nAnxious in vain to find the distant floor.\nThese for the rich:  the rest, whom fate had placed\nIn modest mediocrity, content\nWith base materials, sat on well-tanned hides\nObdurate and unyielding, glassy smooth,\nWith here and there a tuft of crimson yarn,\nOr scarlet crewel in the cushion fixed:\nIf cushion might be called, what harder seemed\nThan the firm oak of which the frame was formed.\nNo want of timber then was felt or feared\nIn Albion's happy isle.  The lumber stood\nPonderous, and fixed by its own massy weight.\nBut elbows still were wanting; these, some say,\nAn alderman of Cripplegate contrived,\nAnd some ascribe the invention to a priest\nBurly and big, and studious of his ease.\nBut rude at first, and not with easy slope\nReceding wide, they pressed against the ribs,\nAnd bruised the side, and elevated high\nTaught the raised shoulders to invade the ears.\nLong time elapsed or e'er our rugged sires\nComplained, though incommodiously pent in,\nAnd ill at ease behind.  The ladies first\nGan murmur, as became the softer sex.\nIngenious fancy, never better pleased\nThan when employed to accommodate the fair,\nHeard the sweet moan with pity, and devised\nThe soft settee; one elbow at each end,\nAnd in the midst an elbow, it received,\nUnited yet divided, twain at once.\nSo sit two kings of Brentford on one throne;\nAnd so two citizens who take the air,\nClose packed and smiling in a chaise and one.\nBut relaxation of the languid frame\nBy soft recumbency of outstretched limbs,\nWas bliss reserved for happier days; so slow\nThe growth of what is excellent, so hard\nTo attain perfection in this nether world.\nThus first necessity invented stools,\nConvenience next suggested elbow-chairs,\nAnd luxury the accomplished Sofa last.\nThe nurse sleeps sweetly, hired to watch the sick,\nWhom snoring she disturbs.  As sweetly he\nWho quits the coach-box at the midnight hour\nTo sleep within the carriage more secure,\nHis legs depending at the open door.\nSweet sleep enjoys the curate in his desk,\nThe tedious rector drawling o'er his head,\nAnd sweet the clerk below; but neither sleep\nOf lazy nurse, who snores the sick man dead,\nNor his who quits the box at midnight hour\nTo slumber in the carriage more secure,\nNor sleep enjoyed by curate in his desk,\nNor yet the dozings of the clerk are sweet,\nCompared with the repose the Sofa yields.\n\nOh, may I live exempted (while I live\nGuiltless of pampered appetite obscene)\nFrom pangs arthritic that infest the toe\nOf libertine excess.  The Sofa suits\nThe gouty limb, 'tis true; but gouty limb,\nThough on a Sofa, may I never feel:\nFor I have loved the rural walk through lanes\nOf grassy swarth, close cropped by nibbling sheep,\nAnd skirted thick with intertexture firm\nOf thorny boughs:  have loved the rural walk\nO'er hills, through valleys, and by river's brink,\nE'er since a truant boy I passed my bounds\nTo enjoy a ramble on the banks of Thames.\nAnd still remember, nor without regret\nOf hours that sorrow since has much endeared,\nHow oft, my slice of pocket store consumed,\nStill hungering penniless and far from home,\nI fed on scarlet hips and stony haws,\nOr blushing crabs, or berries that emboss\nThe bramble, black as jet, or sloes austere.\nHard fare! but such as boyish appetite\nDisdains not, nor the palate undepraved\nBy culinary arts unsavoury deems.\nNo Sofa then awaited my return,\nNo Sofa then I needed.  Youth repairs\nHis wasted spirits quickly, by long toil\nIncurring short fatigue; and though our years,\nAs life declines, speed rapidly away,\nAnd not a year but pilfers as he goes\nSome youthful grace that age would gladly keep,\nA tooth or auburn lock, and by degrees\nTheir length and colour from the locks they spare;\nThe elastic spring of an unwearied foot\nThat mounts the stile with ease, or leaps the fence,\nThat play of lungs inhaling and again\nRespiring freely the fresh air, that makes\nSwift pace or steep ascent no toil to me,\nMine have not pilfered yet; nor yet impaired\nMy relish of fair prospect; scenes that soothed\nOr charmed me young, no longer young, I find\nStill soothing and of power to charm me still.\nAnd witness, dear companion of my walks,\nWhose arm this twentieth winter I perceive\nFast locked in mine, with pleasure such as love,\nConfirmed by long experience of thy worth\nAnd well-tried virtues, could alone inspire--\nWitness a joy that thou hast doubled long.\nThou know'st my praise of Nature most sincere,\nAnd that my raptures are not conjured up\nTo serve occasions of poetic pomp,\nBut genuine, and art partner of them all.\nHow oft upon yon eminence, our pace\nHas slackened to a pause, and we have borne\nThe ruffling wind scarce conscious that it blew,\nWhile admiration feeding at the eye,\nAnd still unsated, dwelt upon the scene!\nThence with what pleasure have we just discerned\nThe distant plough slow-moving, and beside\nHis labouring team, that swerved not from the track,\nThe sturdy swain diminished to a boy!\nHere Ouse, slow winding through a level plain\nOf spacious meads with cattle sprinkled o'er,\nConducts the eye along his sinuous course\nDelighted.  There, fast rooted in his bank\nStand, never overlooked, our favourite elms\nThat screen the herdsman's solitary hut;\nWhile far beyond and overthwart the stream\nThat, as with molten glass, inlays the vale,\nThe sloping land recedes into the clouds;\nDisplaying on its varied side the grace\nOf hedgerow beauties numberless, square tower,\nTall spire, from which the sound of cheerful bells\nJust undulates upon the listening ear;\nGroves, heaths, and smoking villages remote.\nScenes must be beautiful which daily viewed\nPlease daily, and whose novelty survives\nLong knowledge and the scrutiny of years:\nPraise justly due to those that I describe.\n\nNor rural sights alone, but rural sounds\nExhilarate the spirit, and restore\nThe tone of languid Nature.  Mighty winds,\nThat sweep the skirt of some far-spreading wood\nOf ancient growth, make music not unlike\nThe dash of ocean on his winding shore,\nAnd lull the spirit while they fill the mind,\nUnnumbered branches waving in the blast,\nAnd all their leaves fast fluttering, all at once.\nNor less composure waits upon the roar\nOf distant floods, or on the softer voice\nOf neighbouring fountain, or of rills that slip\nThrough the cleft rock, and, chiming as they fall\nUpon loose pebbles, lose themselves at length\nIn matted grass, that with a livelier green\nBetrays the secret of their silent course.\nNature inanimate employs sweet sounds,\nBut animated Nature sweeter still\nTo soothe and satisfy the human ear.\nTen thousand warblers cheer the day, and one\nThe livelong night:  nor these alone whose notes\nNice-fingered art must emulate in vain,\nBut cawing rooks, and kites that swim sublime\nIn still repeated circles, screaming loud,\nThe jay, the pie, and even the boding owl\nThat hails the rising moon, have charms for me.\nSounds inharmonious in themselves and harsh,\nYet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns,\nAnd only there, please highly for their sake.\n\nPeace to the artist, whose ingenious thought\nDevised the weather-house, that useful toy!\nFearless of humid air and gathering rains\nForth steps the man--an emblem of myself!\nMore delicate his timorous mate retires.\nWhen Winter soaks the fields, and female feet,\nToo weak to struggle with tenacious clay,\nOr ford the rivulets, are best at home,\nThe task of new discoveries falls on me.\nAt such a season and with such a charge\nOnce went I forth, and found, till then unknown,\nA cottage, whither oft we since repair:\n'Tis perched upon the green hill-top, but close\nEnvironed with a ring of branching elms\nThat overhang the thatch, itself unseen\nPeeps at the vale below; so thick beset\nWith foliage of such dark redundant growth,\nI called the low-roofed lodge the PEASANT'S NEST.\nAnd hidden as it is, and far remote\nFrom such unpleasing sounds as haunt the ear\nIn village or in town, the bay of curs\nIncessant, clinking hammers, grinding wheels,\nAnd infants clamorous whether pleased or pained,\nOft have I wished the peaceful covert mine.\nHere, I have said, at least I should possess\nThe poet's treasure, silence, and indulge\nThe dreams of fancy, tranquil and secure.\nVain thought! the dweller in that still retreat\nDearly obtains the refuge it affords.\nIts elevated site forbids the wretch\nTo drink sweet waters of the crystal well;\nHe dips his bowl into the weedy ditch,\nAnd heavy-laden brings his beverage home,\nFar-fetched and little worth:  nor seldom waits\nDependent on the baker's punctual call,\nTo hear his creaking panniers at the door,\nAngry and sad and his last crust consumed.\nSo farewell envy of the PEASANT'S NEST.\nIf solitude make scant the means of life,\nSociety for me!  Thou seeming sweet,\nBe still a pleasing object in my view,\nMy visit still, but never mine abode.\n\nNot distant far, a length of colonnade\nInvites us; monument of ancient taste,\nNow scorned, but worthy of a better fate.\nOur fathers knew the value of a screen\nFrom sultry suns, and, in their shaded walks\nAnd long-protracted bowers, enjoyed at noon\nThe gloom and coolness of declining day.\nWe bear our shades about us; self-deprived\nOf other screen, the thin umbrella spread,\nAnd range an Indian waste without a tree.\nThanks to Benevolus--he spares me yet\nThese chestnuts ranged in corresponding lines,\nAnd, though himself so polished, still reprieves\nThe obsolete prolixity of shade.\n\nDescending now (but cautious, lest too fast)\nA sudden steep, upon a rustic bridge\nWe pass a gulf, in which the willows dip\nTheir pendent boughs, stooping as if to drink.\nHence ankle-deep in moss and flowery thyme\nWe mount again, and feel at every step\nOur foot half sunk in hillocks green and soft,\nRaised by the mole, the miner of the soil.\nHe, not unlike the great ones of mankind,\nDisfigures earth, and plotting in the dark\nToils much to earn a monumental pile,\nThat may record the mischiefs he has done.\n\nThe summit gained, behold the proud alcove\nThat crowns it! yet not all its pride secures\nThe grand retreat from injuries impressed\nBy rural carvers, who with knives deface\nThe panels, leaving an obscure rude name\nIn characters uncouth, and spelt amiss.\nSo strong the zeal to immortalise himself\nBeats in the breast of man, that even a few\nFew transient years, won from the abyss abhorred\nOf blank oblivion, seem a glorious prize,\nAnd even to a clown.  Now roves the eye,\nAnd posted on this speculative height\nExults in its command.  The sheepfold here\nPours out its fleecy tenants o'er the glebe.\nAt first, progressive as a stream, they seek\nThe middle field; but scattered by degrees,\nEach to his choice, soon whiten all the land.\nThere, from the sunburnt hay-field homeward creeps\nThe loaded wain; while, lightened of its charge,\nThe wain that meets it passes swiftly by,\nThe boorish driver leaning o'er his team,\nVociferous, and impatient of delay.\nNor less attractive is the woodland scene\nDiversified with trees of every growth,\nAlike yet various.  Here the gray smooth trunks\nOf ash, or lime, or beech, distinctly shine,\nWithin the twilight of their distant shades;\nThere, lost behind a rising ground, the wood\nSeems sunk, and shortened to its topmost boughs.\nNo tree in all the grove but has its charms,\nThough each its hue peculiar; paler some,\nAnd of a wannish gray; the willow such,\nAnd poplar that with silver lines his leaf,\nAnd ash far-stretching his umbrageous arm;\nOf deeper green the elm; and deeper still,\nLord of the woods, the long-surviving oak.\nSome glossy-leaved and shining in the sun,\nThe maple, and the beech of oily nuts\nProlific, and the lime at dewy eve\nDiffusing odours; nor unnoted pass\nThe sycamore, capricious in attire,\nNow green, now tawny, and ere autumn yet\nHave changed the woods, in scarlet honours bright.\nO'er these, but far beyond (a spacious map\nOf hill and valley interposed between),\nThe Ouse, dividing the well-watered land,\nNow glitters in the sun, and now retires,\nAs bashful, yet impatient to be seen.\n\nHence the declivity is sharp and short,\nAnd such the re-ascent; between them weeps\nA little Naiad her impoverished urn,\nAll summer long, which winter fills again.\nThe folded gates would bar my progress now,\nBut that the lord of this enclosed demesne,\nCommunicative of the good he owns,\nAdmits me to a share:  the guiltless eye\nCommits no wrong, nor wastes what it enjoys.\nRefreshing change! where now the blazing sun?\nBy short transition we have lost his glare,\nAnd stepped at once into a cooler clime.\nYe fallen avenues! once more I mourn\nYour fate unmerited, once more rejoice\nThat yet a remnant of your race survives.\nHow airy and how light the graceful arch,\nYet awful as the consecrated roof\nRe-echoing pious anthems! while beneath,\nThe chequered earth seems restless as a flood\nBrushed by the wind.  So sportive is the light\nShot through the boughs, it dances as they dance,\nShadow and sunshine intermingling quick,\nAnd darkening and enlightening, as the leaves\nPlay wanton, every moment, every spot.\n\nAnd now, with nerves new-braced and spirits cheered,\nWe tread the wilderness, whose well-rolled walks,\nWith curvature of slow and easy sweep--\nDeception innocent--give ample space\nTo narrow bounds.  The grove receives us next;\nBetween the upright shafts of whose tall elms\nWe may discern the thresher at his task.\nThump after thump resounds the constant flail,\nThat seems to swing uncertain and yet falls\nFull on the destined ear.  Wide flies the chaff,\nThe rustling straw sends up a frequent mist\nOf atoms, sparkling in the noonday beam.\nCome hither, ye that press your beds of down\nAnd sleep not:  see him sweating o'er his bread\nBefore he eats it.--'Tis the primal curse,\nBut softened into mercy; made the pledge\nOf cheerful days, and nights without a groan.\n\nBy ceaseless action, all that is subsists.\nConstant rotation of the unwearied wheel\nThat Nature rides upon, maintains her health,\nHer beauty, her fertility.  She dreads\nAn instant's pause, and lives but while she moves.\nIts own revolvency upholds the world.\nWinds from all quarters agitate the air,\nAnd fit the limpid element for use,\nElse noxious:  oceans, rivers, lakes, and streams\nAll feel the freshening impulse, and are cleansed\nBy restless undulation:  even the oak\nThrives by the rude concussion of the storm:\nHe seems indeed indignant, and to feel\nThe impression of the blast with proud disdain,\nFrowning as if in his unconscious arm\nHe held the thunder.  But the monarch owes\nHis firm stability to what he scorns,\nMore fixed below, the more disturbed above.\nThe law, by which all creatures else are bound,\nBinds man the lord of all.  Himself derives\nNo mean advantage from a kindred cause,\nFrom strenuous toil his hours of sweetest ease.\nThe sedentary stretch their lazy length\nWhen custom bids, but no refreshment find,\nFor none they need:  the languid eye, the cheek\nDeserted of its bloom, the flaccid, shrunk,\nAnd withered muscle, and the vapid soul,\nReproach their owner with that love of rest\nTo which he forfeits even the rest he loves.\nNot such the alert and active.  Measure life\nBy its true worth, the comforts it affords,\nAnd theirs alone seems worthy of the name\nGood health, and, its associate in the most,\nGood temper; spirits prompt to undertake,\nAnd not soon spent, though in an arduous task;\nThe powers of fancy and strong thought are theirs;\nEven age itself seems privileged in them\nWith clear exemption from its own defects.\nA sparkling eye beneath a wrinkled front\nThe veteran shows, and gracing a gray beard\nWith youthful smiles, descends towards the grave\nSprightly, and old almost without decay.\n\nLike a coy maiden, Ease, when courted most,\nFarthest retires--an idol, at whose shrine\nWho oftenest sacrifice are favoured least.\nThe love of Nature and the scene she draws\nIs Nature's dictate.  Strange, there should be found\nWho, self-imprisoned in their proud saloons,\nRenounce the odours of the open field\nFor the unscented fictions of the loom;\nWho, satisfied with only pencilled scenes,\nPrefer to the performance of a God\nThe inferior wonders of an artist's hand.\nLovely indeed the mimic works of Art,\nBut Nature's works far lovelier.  I admire,\nNone more admires, the painter's magic skill,\nWho shows me that which I shall never see,\nConveys a distant country into mine,\nAnd throws Italian light on English walls.\nBut imitative strokes can do no more\nThan please the eye, sweet Nature every sense.\nThe air salubrious of her lofty hills,\nThe cheering fragrance of her dewy vales,\nAnd music of her woods--no works of man\nMay rival these; these all bespeak a power\nPeculiar, and exclusively her own.\nBeneath the open sky she spreads the feast;\n'Tis free to all--'tis ev'ry day renewed,\nWho scorns it, starves deservedly at home.\nHe does not scorn it, who, imprisoned long\nIn some unwholesome dungeon, and a prey\nTo sallow sickness, which the vapours dank\nAnd clammy of his dark abode have bred\nEscapes at last to liberty and light;\nHis cheek recovers soon its healthful hue,\nHis eye relumines its extinguished fires,\nHe walks, he leaps, he runs--is winged with joy,\nAnd riots in the sweets of every breeze.\nHe does not scorn it, who has long endured\nA fever's agonies, and fed on drugs.\nNor yet the mariner, his blood inflamed\nWith acrid salts; his very heart athirst\nTo gaze at Nature in her green array.\nUpon the ship's tall side he stands, possessed\nWith visions prompted by intense desire;\nFair fields appear below, such as he left\nFar distant, such as he would die to find--\nHe seeks them headlong, and is seen no more.\n\nThe spleen is seldom felt where Flora reigns;\nThe lowering eye, the petulance, the frown,\nAnd sullen sadness that o'ershade, distort,\nAnd mar the face of beauty, when no cause\nFor such immeasurable woe appears,\nThese Flora banishes, and gives the fair\nSweet smiles, and bloom less transient than her own.\nIt is the constant revolution, stale\nAnd tasteless, of the same repeated joys\nThat palls and satiates, and makes languid life\nA pedlar's pack that bows the bearer down.\nHealth suffers, and the spirits ebb; the heart\nRecoils from its own choice--at the full feast\nIs famished--finds no music in the song,\nNo smartness in the jest, and wonders why.\nYet thousands still desire to journey on,\nThough halt and weary of the path they tread.\nThe paralytic, who can hold her cards\nBut cannot play them, borrows a friend's hand\nTo deal and shuffle, to divide and sort\nHer mingled suits and sequences, and sits\nSpectatress both and spectacle, a sad\nAnd silent cipher, while her proxy plays.\nOthers are dragged into the crowded room\nBetween supporters; and once seated, sit\nThrough downright inability to rise,\nTill the stout bearers lift the corpse again.\nThese speak a loud memento.  Yet even these\nThemselves love life, and cling to it as he,\nThat overhangs a torrent, to a twig.\nThey love it, and yet loathe it; fear to die,\nYet scorn the purposes for which they live.\nThen wherefore not renounce them?  No--the dread,\nThe slavish dread of solitude, that breeds\nReflection and remorse, the fear of shame,\nAnd their inveterate habits, all forbid.\n\nWhom call we gay?  That honour has been long\nThe boast of mere pretenders to the name.\nThe innocent are gay--the lark is gay,\nThat dries his feathers saturate with dew\nBeneath the rosy cloud, while yet the beams\nOf day-spring overshoot his humble nest.\nThe peasant too, a witness of his song,\nHimself a songster, is as gay as he.\nBut save me from the gaiety of those\nWhose headaches nail them to a noonday bed;\nAnd save me, too, from theirs whose haggard eyes\nFlash desperation, and betray their pangs\nFor property stripped off by cruel chance;\nFrom gaiety that fills the bones with pain,\nThe mouth with blasphemy, the heart with woe.\n\nThe earth was made so various, that the mind\nOf desultory man, studious of change,\nAnd pleased with novelty, might be indulged.\nProspects however lovely may be seen\nTill half their beauties fade; the weary sight,\nToo well acquainted with their smiles, slides off\nFastidious, seeking less familiar scenes.\nThen snug enclosures in the sheltered vale,\nWhere frequent hedges intercept the eye,\nDelight us, happy to renounce a while,\nNot senseless of its charms, what still we love,\nThat such short absence may endear it more.\nThen forests, or the savage rock may please,\nThat hides the sea-mew in his hollow clefts\nAbove the reach of man:  his hoary head\nConspicuous many a league, the mariner,\nBound homeward, and in hope already there,\nGreets with three cheers exulting.  At his waist\nA girdle of half-withered shrubs he shows,\nAnd at his feet the baffled billows die.\nThe common overgrown with fern, and rough\nWith prickly gorse, that, shapeless and deformed\nAnd dangerous to the touch, has yet its bloom,\nAnd decks itself with ornaments of gold,\nYields no unpleasing ramble; there the turf\nSmells fresh, and, rich in odoriferous herbs\nAnd fungous fruits of earth, regales the sense\nWith luxury of unexpected sweets.\n\nThere often wanders one, whom better days\nSaw better clad, in cloak of satin trimmed\nWith lace, and hat with splendid ribbon bound.\nA serving-maid was she, and fell in love\nWith one who left her, went to sea and died.\nHer fancy followed him through foaming waves\nTo distant shores, and she would sit and weep\nAt what a sailor suffers; fancy too,\nDelusive most where warmest wishes are,\nWould oft anticipate his glad return,\nAnd dream of transports she was not to know.\nShe heard the doleful tidings of his death,\nAnd never smiled again.  And now she roams\nThe dreary waste; there spends the livelong day,\nAnd there, unless when charity forbids,\nThe livelong night.  A tattered apron hides,\nWorn as a cloak, and hardly hides, a gown\nMore tattered still; and both but ill conceal\nA bosom heaved with never-ceasing sighs.\nShe begs an idle pin of all she meets,\nAnd hoards them in her sleeve; but needful food,\nThough pressed with hunger oft, or comelier clothes,\nThough pinched with cold, asks never.--Kate is crazed!\n\nI see a column of slow-rising smoke\nO'ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild.\nA vagabond and useless tribe there eat\nTheir miserable meal.  A kettle slung\nBetween two poles upon a stick transverse,\nReceives the morsel; flesh obscene of dog,\nOr vermin, or, at best, of cock purloined\nFrom his accustomed perch.  Hard-faring race!\nThey pick their fuel out of every hedge,\nWhich, kindled with dry leaves, just saves unquenched\nThe spark of life.  The sportive wind blows wide\nTheir fluttering rags, and shows a tawny skin,\nThe vellum of the pedigree they claim.\nGreat skill have they in palmistry, and more\nTo conjure clean away the gold they touch,\nConveying worthless dross into its place;\nLoud when they beg, dumb only when they steal.\nStrange! that a creature rational, and cast\nIn human mould, should brutalise by choice\nHis nature, and, though capable of arts\nBy which the world might profit and himself,\nSelf-banished from society, prefer\nSuch squalid sloth to honourable toil.\nYet even these, though feigning sickness oft\nThey swathe the forehead, drag the limping limb,\nAnd vex their flesh with artificial sores,\nCan change their whine into a mirthful note\nWhen safe occasion offers, and with dance,\nAnd music of the bladder and the bag,\nBeguile their woes, and make the woods resound.\nSuch health and gaiety of heart enjoy\nThe houseless rovers of the sylvan world;\nAnd breathing wholesome air, and wandering much,\nNeed other physic none to heal the effects\nOf loathsome diet, penury, and cold.\n\nBlest he, though undistinguished from the crowd\nBy wealth or dignity, who dwells secure\nWhere man, by nature fierce, has laid aside\nHis fierceness, having learnt, though slow to learn\nThe manners and the arts of civil life.\nHis wants, indeed, are many; but supply\nIs obvious; placed within the easy reach\nOf temperate wishes and industrious hands.\nHere virtue thrives as in her proper soil;\nNot rude and surly, and beset with thorns,\nAnd terrible to sight, as when she springs\n(If e'er she spring spontaneous) in remote\nAnd barbarous climes, where violence prevails,\nAnd strength is lord of all; but gentle, kind,\nBy culture tamed, by liberty refreshed,\nAnd all her fruits by radiant truth matured.\nWar and the chase engross the savage whole;\nWar followed for revenge, or to supplant\nThe envied tenants of some happier spot;\nThe chase for sustenance, precarious trust!\nHis hard condition with severe constraint\nBinds all his faculties, forbids all growth\nOf wisdom, proves a school in which he learns\nSly circumvention, unrelenting hate,\nMean self-attachment, and scarce aught beside.\nThus fare the shivering natives of the north,\nAnd thus the rangers of the western world,\nWhere it advances far into the deep,\nTowards the Antarctic.  Even the favoured isles\nSo lately found, although the constant sun\nCheer all their seasons with a grateful smile,\nCan boast but little virtue; and inert\nThrough plenty, lose in morals what they gain\nIn manners, victims of luxurious ease.\nThese therefore I can pity, placed remote\nFrom all that science traces, art invents,\nOr inspiration teaches; and enclosed\nIn boundless oceans, never to be passed\nBy navigators uninformed as they,\nOr ploughed perhaps by British bark again.\nBut far beyond the rest, and with most cause,\nThee, gentle savage! whom no love of thee\nOr thine, but curiosity perhaps,\nOr else vain-glory, prompted us to draw\nForth from thy native bowers, to show thee here\nWith what superior skill we can abuse\nThe gifts of Providence, and squander life.\nThe dream is past.  And thou hast found again\nThy cocoas and bananas, palms, and yams,\nAnd homestall thatched with leaves.  But hast thou found\nTheir former charms?  And, having seen our state,\nOur palaces, our ladies, and our pomp\nOf equipage, our gardens, and our sports,\nAnd heard our music; are thy simple friends,\nThy simple fare, and all thy plain delights\nAs dear to thee as once?  And have thy joys\nLost nothing by comparison with ours?\nRude as thou art (for we returned thee rude\nAnd ignorant, except of outward show),\nI cannot think thee yet so dull of heart\nAnd spiritless, as never to regret\nSweets tasted here, and left as soon as known.\nMethinks I see thee straying on the beach,\nAnd asking of the surge that bathes the foot\nIf ever it has washed our distant shore.\nI see thee weep, and thine are honest tears,\nA patriot's for his country.  Thou art sad\nAt thought of her forlorn and abject state,\nFrom which no power of thine can raise her up.\nThus fancy paints thee, and, though apt to err,\nPerhaps errs little when she paints thee thus.\nShe tells me too that duly every morn\nThou climb'st the mountain-top, with eager eye\nExploring far and wide the watery waste,\nFor sight of ship from England.  Every speck\nSeen in the dim horizon turns thee pale\nWith conflict of contending hopes and fears.\nBut comes at last the dull and dusky eve,\nAnd sends thee to thy cabin, well prepared\nTo dream all night of what the day denied.\nAlas, expect it not.  We found no bait\nTo tempt us in thy country.  Doing good,\nDisinterested good, is not our trade.\nWe travel far, 'tis true, but not for naught;\nAnd must be bribed to compass earth again\nBy other hopes, and richer fruits than yours.\n\nBut though true worth and virtue, in the mild\nAnd genial soil of cultivated life\nThrive most, and may perhaps thrive only there,\nYet not in cities oft.  In proud and gay\nAnd gain-devoted cities, thither flow,\nAs to a common and most noisome sewer,\nThe dregs and feculence of every land.\nIn cities, foul example on most minds\nBegets its likeness.  Rank abundance breeds\nIn gross and pampered cities sloth and lust,\nAnd wantonness and gluttonous excess.\nIn cities, vice is hidden with most ease,\nOr seen with least reproach; and virtue, taught\nBy frequent lapse, can hope no triumph there,\nBeyond the achievement of successful flight.\nI do confess them nurseries of the arts,\nIn which they flourish most; where, in the beams\nOf warm encouragement, and in the eye\nOf public note, they reach their perfect size.\nSuch London is, by taste and wealth proclaimed\nThe fairest capital in all the world,\nBy riot and incontinence the worst.\nThere, touched by Reynolds, a dull blank becomes\nA lucid mirror, in which nature sees\nAll her reflected features.  Bacon there\nGives more than female beauty to a stone,\nAnd Chatham's eloquence to marble lips.\nNor does the chisel occupy alone\nThe powers of sculpture, but the style as much;\nEach province of her art her equal care.\nWith nice incision of her guided steel\nShe ploughs a brazen field, and clothes a soil\nSo sterile with what charms soe'er she will,\nThe richest scenery and the loveliest forms.\nWhere finds philosophy her eagle eye,\nWith which she gazes at yon burning disk\nUndazzled, and detects and counts his spots?\nIn London.  Where her implements exact,\nWith which she calculates, computes, and scans\nAll distance, motion, magnitude, and now\nMeasures an atom, and now girds a world?\nIn London.  Where has commerce such a mart,\nSo rich, so thronged, so drained, and so supplied,\nAs London, opulent, enlarged, and still\nIncreasing London?  Babylon of old\nNot more the glory of the earth, than she\nA more accomplished world's chief glory now.\n\nShe has her praise.  Now mark a spot or two\nThat so much beauty would do well to purge;\nAnd show this queen of cities, that so fair\nMay yet be foul; so witty, yet not wise.\nIt is not seemly, nor of good report,\nThat she is slack in discipline; more prompt\nTo avenge than to prevent the breach of law:\nThat she is rigid in denouncing death\nOn petty robbers, and indulges life\nAnd liberty, and ofttimes honour too,\nTo peculators of the public gold:\nThat thieves at home must hang; but he, that puts\nInto his overgorged and bloated purse\nThe wealth of Indian provinces, escapes.\nNor is it well, nor can it come to good,\nThat through profane and infidel contempt\nOf holy writ, she has presumed to annul\nAnd abrogate, as roundly as she may,\nThe total ordinance and will of God;\nAdvancing fashion to the post of truth,\nAnd centring all authority in modes\nAnd customs of her own, till Sabbath rites\nHave dwindled into unrespected forms,\nAnd knees and hassocks are wellnigh divorced.\n\nGod made the country, and man made the town.\nWhat wonder, then, that health and virtue, gifts\nThat can alone make sweet the bitter draught\nThat life holds out to all, should most abound\nAnd least be threatened in the fields and groves?\nPossess ye therefore, ye who, borne about\nIn chariots and sedans, know no fatigue\nBut that of idleness, and taste no scenes\nBut such as art contrives, possess ye still\nYour element; there only ye can shine,\nThere only minds like yours can do no harm.\nOur groves were planted to console at noon\nThe pensive wanderer in their shades.  At eve\nThe moonbeam, sliding softly in between\nThe sleeping leaves, is all the light they wish,\nBirds warbling all the music.  We can spare\nThe splendour of your lamps, they but eclipse\nOur softer satellite.  Your songs confound\nOur more harmonious notes.  The thrush departs\nScared, and the offended nightingale is mute.\nThere is a public mischief in your mirth;\nIt plagues your country.  Folly such as yours,\nGraced with a sword, and worthier of a fan,\nHas made, which enemies could ne'er have done,\nOur arch of empire, steadfast but for you,\nA mutilated structure, soon to fall.\n\n\n\nBOOK II.\n\nTHE TIMEPIECE.\n\nOh for a lodge in some vast wilderness,\nSome boundless contiguity of shade,\nWhere rumour of oppression and deceit,\nOf unsuccessful or successful war,\nMight never reach me more!  My ear is pained,\nMy soul is sick with every day's report\nOf wrong and outrage with which earth is filled.\nThere is no flesh in man's obdurate heart,\nIt does not feel for man.  The natural bond\nOf brotherhood is severed as the flax\nThat falls asunder at the touch of fire.\nHe finds his fellow guilty of a skin\nNot coloured like his own, and having power\nTo enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause\nDooms and devotes him as his lawful prey.\nLands intersected by a narrow frith\nAbhor each other.  Mountains interposed\nMake enemies of nations, who had else\nLike kindred drops been mingled into one.\nThus man devotes his brother, and destroys;\nAnd worse than all, and most to be deplored,\nAs human nature's broadest, foulest blot,\nChains him, and tasks him, and exacts his sweat\nWith stripes, that mercy, with a bleeding heart,\nWeeps when she sees inflicted on a beast.\nThen what is man?  And what man, seeing this,\nAnd having human feelings, does not blush\nAnd hang his head, to think himself a man?\nI would not have a slave to till my ground,\nTo carry me, to fan me while I sleep,\nAnd tremble when I wake, for all the wealth\nThat sinews bought and sold have ever earned.\nNo:  dear as freedom is, and in my heart's\nJust estimation prized above all price,\nI had much rather be myself the slave\nAnd wear the bonds, than fasten them on him.\nWe have no slaves at home--then why abroad?\nAnd they themselves, once ferried o'er the wave\nThat parts us, are emancipate and loosed.\nSlaves cannot breathe in England; if their lungs\nReceive our air, that moment they are free,\nThey touch our country and their shackles fall.\nThat's noble, and bespeaks a nation proud\nAnd jealous of the blessing.  Spread it then,\nAnd let it circulate through every vein\nOf all your empire; that where Britain's power\nIs felt, mankind may feel her mercy too.\n\nSure there is need of social intercourse,\nBenevolence and peace and mutual aid,\nBetween the nations, in a world that seems\nTo toll the death-bell to its own decease;\nAnd by the voice of all its elements\nTo preach the general doom.  When were the winds\nLet slip with such a warrant to destroy?\nWhen did the waves so haughtily o'erleap\nTheir ancient barriers, deluging the dry?\nFires from beneath and meteors from above,\nPortentous, unexampled, unexplained,\nHave kindled beacons in the skies, and the old\nAnd crazy earth has had her shaking fits\nMore frequent, and foregone her usual rest.\nIs it a time to wrangle, when the props\nAnd pillars of our planet seem to fail,\nAnd nature with a dim and sickly eye\nTo wait the close of all?  But grant her end\nMore distant, and that prophecy demands\nA longer respite, unaccomplished yet;\nStill they are frowning signals, and bespeak\nDispleasure in His breast who smites the earth\nOr heals it, makes it languish or rejoice.\nAnd 'tis but seemly, that, where all deserve\nAnd stand exposed by common peccancy\nTo what no few have felt, there should be peace,\nAnd brethren in calamity should love.\n\nAlas for Sicily, rude fragments now\nLie scattered where the shapely column stood.\nHer palaces are dust.  In all her streets\nThe voice of singing and the sprightly chord\nAre silent.  Revelry and dance and show\nSuffer a syncope and solemn pause,\nWhile God performs, upon the trembling stage\nOf His own works, His dreadful part alone.\nHow does the earth receive Him?--With what signs\nOf gratulation and delight, her King?\nPours she not all her choicest fruits abroad,\nHer sweetest flowers, her aromatic gums,\nDisclosing paradise where'er He treads?\nShe quakes at His approach.  Her hollow womb,\nConceiving thunders, through a thousand deeps\nAnd fiery caverns roars beneath His foot.\nThe hills move lightly and the mountains smoke,\nFor He has touched them.  From the extremest point\nOf elevation down into the abyss,\nHis wrath is busy and His frown is felt.\nThe rocks fall headlong and the valleys rise,\nThe rivers die into offensive pools,\nAnd, charged with putrid verdure, breathe a gross\nAnd mortal nuisance into all the air.\nWhat solid was, by transformation strange\nGrows fluid, and the fixed and rooted earth\nTormented into billows, heaves and swells,\nOr with vortiginous and hideous whirl\nSucks down its prey insatiable.  Immense\nThe tumult and the overthrow, the pangs\nAnd agonies of human and of brute\nMultitudes, fugitive on every side,\nAnd fugitive in vain.  The sylvan scene\nMigrates uplifted, and, with all its soil\nAlighting in far-distant fields, finds out\nA new possessor, and survives the change.\nOcean has caught the frenzy, and upwrought\nTo an enormous and o'erbearing height,\nNot by a mighty wind, but by that voice\nWhich winds and waves obey, invades the shore\nResistless.  Never such a sudden flood,\nUpridged so high, and sent on such a charge,\nPossessed an inland scene.  Where now the throng\nThat pressed the beach and hasty to depart\nLooked to the sea for safety?  They are gone,\nGone with the refluent wave into the deep,\nA prince with half his people.  Ancient towers,\nAnd roofs embattled high, the gloomy scenes\nWhere beauty oft and lettered worth consume\nLife in the unproductive shades of death,\nFall prone:  the pale inhabitants come forth,\nAnd, happy in their unforeseen release\nFrom all the rigours of restraint, enjoy\nThe terrors of the day that sets them free.\nWho then, that has thee, would not hold thee fast,\nFreedom! whom they that lose thee so regret,\nThat even a judgment, making way for thee,\nSeems in their eyes a mercy, for thy sake.\n\nSuch evil sin hath wrought; and such a flame\nKindled in heaven, that it burns down to earth,\nAnd, in the furious inquest that it makes\nOn God's behalf, lays waste His fairest works.\nThe very elements, though each be meant\nThe minister of man to serve his wants,\nConspire against him.  With his breath he draws\nA plague into his blood; and cannot use\nLife's necessary means, but he must die.\nStorms rise to o'erwhelm him:  or, if stormy winds\nRise not, the waters of the deep shall rise,\nAnd, needing none assistance of the storm,\nShall roll themselves ashore, and reach him there.\nThe earth shall shake him out of all his holds,\nOr make his house his grave; nor so content,\nShall counterfeit the motions of the flood,\nAnd drown him in her dry and dusty gulfs.\nWhat then--were they the wicked above all,\nAnd we the righteous, whose fast-anchored isle\nMoved not, while theirs was rocked like a light skiff,\nThe sport of every wave?  No:  none are clear,\nAnd none than we more guilty.  But where all\nStand chargeable with guilt, and to the shafts\nOf wrath obnoxious, God may choose His mark,\nMay punish, if He please, the less, to warn\nThe more malignant.  If He spared not them,\nTremble and be amazed at thine escape,\nFar guiltier England, lest He spare not thee!\n\nHappy the man who sees a God employed\nIn all the good and ill that chequer life!\nResolving all events, with their effects\nAnd manifold results, into the will\nAnd arbitration wise of the Supreme.\nDid not His eye rule all things, and intend\nThe least of our concerns (since from the least\nThe greatest oft originate), could chance\nFind place in His dominion, or dispose\nOne lawless particle to thwart His plan,\nThen God might be surprised, and unforeseen\nContingence might alarm Him, and disturb\nThe smooth and equal course of His affairs.\nThis truth, philosophy, though eagle-eyed\nIn nature's tendencies, oft overlooks;\nAnd, having found His instrument, forgets\nOr disregards, or, more presumptuous still,\nDenies the power that wields it.  God proclaims\nHis hot displeasure against foolish men\nThat live an Atheist life:  involves the heaven\nIn tempests, quits His grasp upon the winds\nAnd gives them all their fury; bids a plague\nKindle a fiery boil upon the skin,\nAnd putrefy the breath of blooming health.\nHe calls for Famine, and the meagre fiend\nBlows mildew from between his shrivelled lips,\nAnd taints the golden ear.  He springs His mines,\nAnd desolates a nation at a blast.\nForth steps the spruce philosopher, and tells\nOf homogeneal and discordant springs\nAnd principles; of causes how they work\nBy necessary laws their sure effects;\nOf action and reaction.  He has found\nThe source of the disease that nature feels,\nAnd bids the world take heart and banish fear.\nThou fool! will thy discovery of the cause\nSuspend the effect, or heal it?  Has not God\nStill wrought by means since first He made the world,\nAnd did He not of old employ His means\nTo drown it?  What is His creation less\nThan a capacious reservoir of means\nFormed for His use, and ready at His will?\nGo, dress thine eyes with eye-salve, ask of Him,\nOr ask of whomsoever He has taught,\nAnd learn, though late, the genuine cause of all.\n\nEngland, with all thy faults, I love thee still--\nMy country! and while yet a nook is left,\nWhere English minds and manners may be found,\nShall be constrained to love thee.  Though thy clime\nBe fickle, and thy year most part deformed\nWith dripping rains, or withered by a frost,\nI would not yet exchange thy sullen skies\nAnd fields without a flower, for warmer France\nWith all her vines; nor for Ausonia's groves\nOf golden fruitage, and her myrtle bowers.\nTo shake thy senate, and from heights sublime\nOf patriot eloquence to flash down fire\nUpon thy foes, was never meant my task;\nBut I can feel thy fortune, and partake\nThy joys and sorrows with as true a heart\nAs any thunderer there.  And I can feel\nThy follies too, and with a just disdain\nFrown at effeminates, whose very looks\nReflect dishonour on the land I love.\nHow, in the name of soldiership and sense,\nShould England prosper, when such things, as smooth\nAnd tender as a girl, all essenced o'er\nWith odours, and as profligate as sweet,\nWho sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath,\nAnd love when they should fight; when such as these\nPresume to lay their hand upon the ark\nOf her magnificent and awful cause?\nTime was when it was praise and boast enough\nIn every clime, and travel where we might,\nThat we were born her children.  Praise enough\nTo fill the ambition of a private man,\nThat Chatham's language was his mother tongue,\nAnd Wolfe's great name compatriot with his own.\nFarewell those honours, and farewell with them\nThe hope of such hereafter.  They have fallen\nEach in his field of glory; one in arms,\nAnd one in council;--Wolfe upon the lap\nOf smiling victory that moment won,\nAnd Chatham, heart-sick of his country's shame.\nThey made us many soldiers.  Chatham, still\nConsulting England's happiness at home,\nSecured it by an unforgiving frown\nIf any wronged her.  Wolfe, where'er he fought,\nPut so much of his heart into his act,\nThat his example had a magnet's force,\nAnd all were swift to follow whom all loved.\nThose suns are set.  Oh, rise some other such!\nOr all that we have left is empty talk\nOf old achievements, and despair of new.\n\nNow hoist the sail, and let the streamers float\nUpon the wanton breezes.  Strew the deck\nWith lavender, and sprinkle liquid sweets,\nThat no rude savour maritime invade\nThe nose of nice nobility.  Breathe soft,\nYe clarionets, and softer still, ye flutes,\nThat winds and waters lulled by magic sounds\nMay bear us smoothly to the Gallic shore.\nTrue, we have lost an empire--let it pass.\nTrue, we may thank the perfidy of France\nThat picked the jewel out of England's crown,\nWith all the cunning of an envious shrew.\nAnd let that pass--'twas but a trick of state.\nA brave man knows no malice, but at once\nForgets in peace the injuries of war,\nAnd gives his direst foe a friend's embrace.\nAnd shamed as we have been, to the very beard\nBraved and defied, and in our own sea proved\nToo weak for those decisive blows that once\nInsured us mastery there, we yet retain\nSome small pre-eminence, we justly boast\nAt least superior jockeyship, and claim\nThe honours of the turf as all our own.\nGo then, well worthy of the praise ye seek,\nAnd show the shame ye might conceal at home,\nIn foreign eyes!--be grooms, and win the plate,\nWhere once your nobler fathers won a crown!--\n'Tis generous to communicate your skill\nTo those that need it.  Folly is soon learned,\nAnd, under such preceptors, who can fail?\n\nThere is a pleasure in poetic pains\nWhich only poets know.  The shifts and turns,\nThe expedients and inventions multiform\nTo which the mind resorts, in chase of terms\nThough apt, yet coy, and difficult to win--\nTo arrest the fleeting images that fill\nThe mirror of the mind, and hold them fast,\nAnd force them sit, till he has pencilled off\nA faithful likeness of the forms he views;\nThen to dispose his copies with such art\nThat each may find its most propitious light,\nAnd shine by situation, hardly less\nThan by the labour and the skill it cost,\nAre occupations of the poet's mind\nSo pleasing, and that steal away the thought\nWith such address from themes of sad import,\nThat, lost in his own musings, happy man!\nHe feels the anxieties of life, denied\nTheir wonted entertainment, all retire.\nSuch joys has he that sings.  But ah! not such,\nOr seldom such, the hearers of his song.\nFastidious, or else listless, or perhaps\nAware of nothing arduous in a task\nThey never undertook, they little note\nHis dangers or escapes, and haply find\nThere least amusement where he found the most.\nBut is amusement all? studious of song\nAnd yet ambitious not to sing in vain,\nI would not trifle merely, though the world\nBe loudest in their praise who do no more.\nYet what can satire, whether grave or gay?\nIt may correct a foible, may chastise\nThe freaks of fashion, regulate the dress,\nRetrench a sword-blade, or displace a patch;\nBut where are its sublimer trophies found?\nWhat vice has it subdued? whose heart reclaimed\nBy rigour, or whom laughed into reform?\nAlas, Leviathan is not so tamed.\nLaughed at, he laughs again; and, stricken hard,\nTurns to the stroke his adamantine scales,\nThat fear no discipline of human hands.\n\nThe pulpit therefore--and I name it, filled\nWith solemn awe, that bids me well beware\nWith what intent I touch that holy thing--\nThe pulpit, when the satirist has at last,\nStrutting and vapouring in an empty school,\nSpent all his force, and made no proselyte--\nI say the pulpit, in the sober use\nOf its legitimate peculiar powers,\nMust stand acknowledged, while the world shall stand,\nThe most important and effectual guard,\nSupport, and ornament of virtue's cause.\nThere stands the messenger of truth; there stands\nThe legate of the skies; his theme divine,\nHis office sacred, his credentials clear.\nBy him, the violated Law speaks out\nIts thunders, and by him, in strains as sweet\nAs angels use, the Gospel whispers peace.\nHe stablishes the strong, restores the weak,\nReclaims the wanderer, binds the broken heart,\nAnd, armed himself in panoply complete\nOf heavenly temper, furnishes with arms\nBright as his own, and trains, by every rule\nOf holy discipline, to glorious war,\nThe sacramental host of God's elect.\nAre all such teachers? would to heaven all were!\nBut hark--the Doctor's voice--fast wedged between\nTwo empirics he stands, and with swollen cheeks\nInspires the news, his trumpet.  Keener far\nThan all invective is his bold harangue,\nWhile through that public organ of report\nHe hails the clergy, and, defying shame,\nAnnounces to the world his own and theirs,\nHe teaches those to read whom schools dismissed,\nAnd colleges, untaught; sells accents, tone,\nAnd emphasis in score, and gives to prayer\nThe adagio and andante it demands.\nHe grinds divinity of other days\nDown into modern use; transforms old print\nTo zigzag manuscript, and cheats the eyes\nOf gallery critics by a thousand arts.--\nAre there who purchase of the Doctor's ware?\nOh name it not in Gath!--it cannot be,\nThat grave and learned Clerks should need such aid.\nHe doubtless is in sport, and does but droll,\nAssuming thus a rank unknown before,\nGrand caterer and dry-nurse of the Church.\n\nI venerate the man whose heart is warm,\nWhose hands are pure, whose doctrine and whose life,\nCoincident, exhibit lucid proof\nThat he is honest in the sacred cause.\nTo such I render more than mere respect,\nWhose actions say that they respect themselves.\nBut, loose in morals, and in manners vain,\nIn conversation frivolous, in dress\nExtreme, at once rapacious and profuse,\nFrequent in park with lady at his side,\nAmbling and prattling scandal as he goes,\nBut rare at home, and never at his books\nOr with his pen, save when he scrawls a card;\nConstant at routs, familiar with a round\nOf ladyships, a stranger to the poor;\nAmbitions of preferment for its gold,\nAnd well prepared by ignorance and sloth,\nBy infidelity and love o' the world,\nTo make God's work a sinecure; a slave\nTo his own pleasures and his patron's pride.--\nFrom such apostles, O ye mitred heads,\nPreserve the Church! and lay not careless hands\nOn skulls that cannot teach, and will not learn.\n\nWould I describe a preacher, such as Paul,\nWere he on earth, would hear, approve, and own,\nPaul should himself direct me.  I would trace\nHis master-strokes, and draw from his design.\nI would express him simple, grave, sincere;\nIn doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain,\nAnd plain in manner; decent, solemn, chaste,\nAnd natural in gesture; much impressed\nHimself, as conscious of his awful charge,\nAnd anxious mainly that the flock he feeds\nMay feel it too; affectionate in look\nAnd tender in address, as well becomes\nA messenger of grace to guilty men.\nBehold the picture!--Is it like?--Like whom?\nThe things that mount the rostrum with a skip,\nAnd then skip down again; pronounce a text,\nCry--Hem; and reading what they never wrote,\nJust fifteen minutes, huddle up their work,\nAnd with a well-bred whisper close the scene.\n\nIn man or woman, but far most in man,\nAnd most of all in man that ministers\nAnd serves the altar, in my soul I loathe\nAll affectation.  'Tis my perfect scorn;\nObject of my implacable disgust.\nWhat!--will a man play tricks, will he indulge\nA silly fond conceit of his fair form\nAnd just proportion, fashionable mien,\nAnd pretty face, in presence of his God?\nOr will he seek to dazzle me with tropes,\nAs with the diamond on his lily hand,\nAnd play his brilliant parts before my eyes,\nWhen I am hungry for the Bread of Life?\nHe mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shames\nHis noble office, and, instead of truth,\nDisplaying his own beauty, starves his flock!\nTherefore, avaunt, all attitude and stare\nAnd start theatric, practised at the glass.\nI seek divine simplicity in him\nWho handles things divine; and all beside,\nThough learned with labour, and though much admired\nBy curious eyes and judgments ill-informed,\nTo me is odious as the nasal twang\nHeard at conventicle, where worthy men,\nMisled by custom, strain celestial themes\nThrough the prest nostril, spectacle-bestrid.\nSome, decent in demeanour while they preach,\nThat task performed, relapse into themselves,\nAnd having spoken wisely, at the close\nGrow wanton, and give proof to every eye--\nWhoe'er was edified themselves were not.\nForth comes the pocket mirror.  First we stroke\nAn eyebrow; next compose a straggling lock;\nThen with an air, most gracefully performed,\nFall back into our seat; extend an arm,\nAnd lay it at its ease with gentle care,\nWith handkerchief in hand, depending low:\nThe better hand, more busy, gives the nose\nIts bergamot, or aids the indebted eye\nWith opera glass to watch the moving scene,\nAnd recognise the slow-retiring fair.\nNow this is fulsome, and offends me more\nThan in a Churchman slovenly neglect\nAnd rustic coarseness would.  A heavenly mind\nMay be indifferent to her house of clay,\nAnd slight the hovel as beneath her care.\nBut how a body so fantastic, trim,\nAnd quaint in its deportment and attire,\nCan lodge a heavenly mind--demands a doubt.\n\nHe that negotiates between God and man,\nAs God's ambassador, the grand concerns\nOf judgment and of mercy, should beware\nOf lightness in his speech.  'Tis pitiful\nTo court a grin, when you should woo a soul;\nTo break a jest, when pity would inspire\nPathetic exhortation; and to address\nThe skittish fancy with facetious tales,\nWhen sent with God's commission to the heart.\nSo did not Paul.  Direct me to a quip\nOr merry turn in all he ever wrote,\nAnd I consent you take it for your text,\nYour only one, till sides and benches fail.\nNo:  he was serious in a serious cause,\nAnd understood too well the weighty terms\nThat he had ta'en in charge.  He would not stoop\nTo conquer those by jocular exploits,\nWhom truth and soberness assailed in vain.\n\nOh, popular applause! what heart of man\nIs proof against thy sweet seducing charms?\nThe wisest and the best feel urgent need\nOf all their caution in thy gentlest gales;\nBut swelled into a gust--who then, alas!\nWith all his canvas set, and inexpert,\nAnd therefore heedless, can withstand thy power?\nPraise from the riveled lips of toothless, bald\nDecrepitude, and in the looks of lean\nAnd craving poverty, and in the bow\nRespectful of the smutched artificer,\nIs oft too welcome, and may much disturb\nThe bias of the purpose.  How much more,\nPoured forth by beauty splendid and polite,\nIn language soft as adoration breathes?\nAh, spare your idol! think him human still;\nCharms he may have, but he has frailties too;\nDote not too much, nor spoil what ye admire.\n\nAll truth is from the sempiternal source\nOf light divine.  But Egypt, Greece, and Rome\nDrew from the stream below.  More favoured, we\nDrink, when we choose it, at the fountain head.\nTo them it flowed much mingled and defiled\nWith hurtful error, prejudice, and dreams\nIllusive of philosophy, so called,\nBut falsely.  Sages after sages strove,\nIn vain, to filter off a crystal draught\nPure from the lees, which often more enhanced\nThe thirst than slaked it, and not seldom bred\nIntoxication and delirium wild.\nIn vain they pushed inquiry to the birth\nAnd spring-time of the world; asked, Whence is man?\nWhy formed at all? and wherefore as he is?\nWhere must he find his Maker?  With what rites\nAdore Him?  Will He hear, accept, and bless?\nOr does He sit regardless of His works?\nHas man within him an immortal seed?\nOr does the tomb take all?  If he survive\nHis ashes, where? and in what weal or woe?\nKnots worthy of solution, which alone\nA Deity could solve.  Their answers vague,\nAnd all at random, fabulous and dark,\nLeft them as dark themselves.  Their rules of life,\nDefective and unsanctioned, proved too weak\nTo bind the roving appetite, and lead\nBlind nature to a God not yet revealed.\n'Tis Revelation satisfies all doubts,\nExplains all mysteries, except her own,\nAnd so illuminates the path of life,\nThat fools discover it, and stray no more.\nNow tell me, dignified and sapient sir,\nMy man of morals, nurtured in the shades\nOf Academus, is this false or true?\nIs Christ the abler teacher, or the schools?\nIf Christ, then why resort at every turn\nTo Athens or to Rome for wisdom short\nOf man's occasions, when in Him reside\nGrace, knowledge, comfort, an unfathomed store?\nHow oft when Paul has served us with a text,\nHas Epictetus, Plato, Tully, preached!\nMen that, if now alive, would sit content\nAnd humble learners of a Saviour's worth,\nPreach it who might.  Such was their love of truth,\nTheir thirst of knowledge, and their candour too.\n\nAnd thus it is.  The pastor, either vain\nBy nature, or by flattery made so, taught\nTo gaze at his own splendour, and to exalt\nAbsurdly, not his office, but himself;\nOr unenlightened, and too proud to learn,\nOr vicious, and not therefore apt to teach,\nPerverting often, by the stress of lewd\nAnd loose example, whom he should instruct,\nExposes and holds up to broad disgrace\nThe noblest function, and discredits much\nThe brightest truths that man has ever seen.\nFor ghostly counsel, if it either fall\nBelow the exigence, or be not backed\nWith show of love, at least with hopeful proof\nOf some sincerity on the giver's part;\nOr be dishonoured in the exterior form\nAnd mode of its conveyance, by such tricks\nAs move derision, or by foppish airs\nAnd histrionic mummery, that let down\nThe pulpit to the level of the stage;\nDrops from the lips a disregarded thing.\nThe weak perhaps are moved, but are not taught,\nWhile prejudice in men of stronger minds\nTakes deeper root, confirmed by what they see.\nA relaxation of religion's hold\nUpon the roving and untutored heart\nSoon follows, and the curb of conscience snapt,\nThe laity run wild.--But do they now?\nNote their extravagance, and be convinced.\n\nAs nations, ignorant of God, contrive\nA wooden one, so we, no longer taught\nBy monitors that Mother Church supplies,\nNow make our own.  Posterity will ask\n(If e'er posterity sees verse of mine),\nSome fifty or a hundred lustrums hence,\nWhat was a monitor in George's days?\nMy very gentle reader, yet unborn,\nOf whom I needs must augur better things,\nSince Heaven would sure grow weary of a world\nProductive only of a race like us,\nA monitor is wood--plank shaven thin.\nWe wear it at our backs.  There, closely braced\nAnd neatly fitted, it compresses hard\nThe prominent and most unsightly bones,\nAnd binds the shoulders flat.  We prove its use\nSovereign and most effectual to secure\nA form, not now gymnastic as of yore,\nFrom rickets and distortion, else, our lot.\nBut thus admonished we can walk erect,\nOne proof at least of manhood; while the friend\nSticks close, a Mentor worthy of his charge.\nOur habits costlier than Lucullus wore,\nAnd, by caprice as multiplied as his,\nJust please us while the fashion is at full,\nBut change with every moon.  The sycophant,\nThat waits to dress us, arbitrates their date,\nSurveys his fair reversion with keen eye;\nFinds one ill made, another obsolete,\nThis fits not nicely, that is ill conceived;\nAnd, making prize of all that he condemns,\nWith our expenditure defrays his own.\nVariety's the very spice of life,\nThat gives it all its flavour.  We have run\nThrough every change that fancy, at the loom\nExhausted, has had genius to supply,\nAnd, studious of mutation still, discard\nA real elegance, a little used,\nFor monstrous novelty and strange disguise.\nWe sacrifice to dress, till household joys\nAnd comforts cease.  Dress drains our cellar dry,\nAnd keeps our larder lean; puts out our fires,\nAnd introduces hunger, frost, and woe,\nWhere peace and hospitality might reign.\nWhat man that lives, and that knows how to live,\nWould fail to exhibit at the public shows\nA form as splendid as the proudest there,\nThough appetite raise outcries at the cost?\nA man o' the town dines late, but soon enough,\nWith reasonable forecast and despatch,\nTo ensure a side-box station at half-price.\nYou think, perhaps, so delicate his dress,\nHis daily fare as delicate.  Alas!\nHe picks clean teeth, and, busy as he seems\nWith an old tavern quill, is hungry yet.\nThe rout is folly's circle which she draws\nWith magic wand.  So potent is the spell,\nThat none decoyed into that fatal ring,\nUnless by Heaven's peculiar grace, escape.\nThere we grow early gray, but never wise;\nThere form connections, and acquire no friend;\nSolicit pleasure hopeless of success;\nWaste youth in occupations only fit\nFor second childhood, and devote old age\nTo sports which only childhood could excuse.\nThere they are happiest who dissemble best\nTheir weariness; and they the most polite,\nWho squander time and treasure with a smile,\nThough at their own destruction.  She that asks\nHer dear five hundred friends, contemns them all,\nAnd hates their coming.  They (what can they less?)\nMake just reprisals, and, with cringe and shrug\nAnd bow obsequious, hide their hate of her.\nAll catch the frenzy, downward from her Grace,\nWhose flambeaux flash against the morning skies,\nAnd gild our chamber ceilings as they pass,\nTo her who, frugal only that her thrift\nMay feed excesses she can ill afford,\nIs hackneyed home unlackeyed; who, in haste\nAlighting, turns the key in her own door,\nAnd, at the watchman's lantern borrowing light,\nFinds a cold bed her only comfort left.\nWives beggar husbands, husbands starve their wives,\nOn Fortune's velvet altar offering up\nTheir last poor pittance--Fortune, most severe\nOf goddesses yet known, and costlier far\nThan all that held their routs in Juno's heaven.--\nSo fare we in this prison-house the world.\nAnd 'tis a fearful spectacle to see\nSo many maniacs dancing in their chains.\nThey gaze upon the links that hold them fast\nWith eyes of anguish, execrate their lot,\nThen shake them in despair, and dance again.\n\nNow basket up the family of plagues\nThat waste our vitals.  Peculation, sale\nOf honour, perjury, corruption, frauds\nBy forgery, by subterfuge of law,\nBy tricks and lies, as numerous and as keen\nAs the necessities their authors feel;\nThen cast them, closely bundled, every brat\nAt the right door.  Profusion is its sire.\nProfusion unrestrained, with all that's base\nIn character, has littered all the land,\nAnd bred within the memory of no few\nA priesthood such as Baal's was of old,\nA people such as never was till now.\nIt is a hungry vice:--it eats up all\nThat gives society its beauty, strength,\nConvenience, and security, and use;\nMakes men mere vermin, worthy to be trapped\nAnd gibbeted, as fast as catchpole claws\nCan seize the slippery prey; unties the knot\nOf union, and converts the sacred band\nThat holds mankind together to a scourge.\nProfusion, deluging a state with lusts\nOf grossest nature and of worst effects,\nPrepares it for its ruin; hardens, blinds,\nAnd warps the consciences of public men\nTill they can laugh at virtue; mock the fools\nThat trust them; and, in the end, disclose a face\nThat would have shocked credulity herself,\nUnmasked, vouchsafing this their sole excuse;--\nSince all alike are selfish, why not they?\nThis does Profusion, and the accursed cause\nOf such deep mischief has itself a cause.\n\nIn colleges and halls, in ancient days,\nWhen learning, virtue, piety, and truth\nWere precious, and inculcated with care,\nThere dwelt a sage called Discipline.  His head,\nNot yet by time completely silvered o'er,\nBespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth,\nBut strong for service still, and unimpaired.\nHis eye was meek and gentle, and a smile\nPlayed on his lips, and in his speech was heard\nPaternal sweetness, dignity, and love.\nThe occupation dearest to his heart\nWas to encourage goodness.  He would stroke\nThe head of modest and ingenuous worth,\nThat blushed at its own praise, and press the youth\nClose to his side that pleased him.  Learning grew\nBeneath his care, a thriving, vigorous plant;\nThe mind was well informed, the passions held\nSubordinate, and diligence was choice.\nIf e'er it chanced, as sometimes chance it must,\nThat one among so many overleaped\nThe limits of control, his gentle eye\nGrew stern, and darted a severe rebuke;\nHis frown was full of terror, and his voice\nShook the delinquent with such fits of awe\nAs left him not, till penitence had won\nLost favour back again, and closed the breach.\nBut Discipline, a faithful servant long,\nDeclined at length into the vale of years;\nA palsy struck his arm, his sparkling eye\nWas quenched in rheums of age, his voice unstrung\nGrew tremulous, and moved derision more\nThan reverence in perverse, rebellious youth.\nSo colleges and halls neglected much\nTheir good old friend, and Discipline at length,\nO'erlooked and unemployed, fell sick and died.\nThen study languished, emulation slept,\nAnd virtue fled.  The schools became a scene\nOf solemn farce, where ignorance in stilts,\nHis cap well lined with logic not his own,\nWith parrot tongue performed the scholar's part,\nProceeding soon a graduated dunce.\nThen compromise had place, and scrutiny\nBecame stone-blind, precedence went in truck,\nAnd he was competent whose purse was so.\nA dissolution of all bonds ensued,\nThe curbs invented for the mulish mouth\nOf headstrong youth were broken; bars and bolts\nGrew rusty by disuse, and massy gates\nForgot their office, opening with a touch;\nTill gowns at length are found mere masquerade;\nThe tasselled cap and the spruce band a jest,\nA mockery of the world.  What need of these\nFor gamesters, jockeys, brothellers impure,\nSpendthrifts and booted sportsmen, oftener seen\nWith belted waist, and pointers at their heels,\nThan in the bounds of duty?  What was learned,\nIf aught was learned in childhood, is forgot,\nAnd such expense as pinches parents blue\nAnd mortifies the liberal hand of love,\nIs squandered in pursuit of idle sports\nAnd vicious pleasures; buys the boy a name,\nThat sits a stigma on his father's house,\nAnd cleaves through life inseparably close\nTo him that wears it.  What can after-games\nOf riper joys, and commerce with the world,\nThe lewd vain world that must receive him soon,\nAdd to such erudition thus acquired,\nWhere science and where virtue are professed?\nThey may confirm his habits, rivet fast\nHis folly, but to spoil him is a task\nThat bids defiance to the united powers\nOf fashion, dissipation, taverns, stews.\nNow, blame we most the nurselings, or the nurse?\nThe children crooked and twisted and deformed\nThrough want of care, or her whose winking eye\nAnd slumbering oscitancy mars the brood?\nThe nurse no doubt.  Regardless of her charge,\nShe needs herself correction; needs to learn\nThat it is dangerous sporting with the world,\nWith things so sacred as a nation's trust;\nThe nurture of her youth, her dearest pledge.\n\nAll are not such.  I had a brother once--\nPeace to the memory of a man of worth,\nA man of letters and of manners too--\nOf manners sweet as virtue always wears,\nWhen gay good-nature dresses her in smiles.\nHe graced a college in which order yet\nWas sacred, and was honoured, loved, and wept,\nBy more than one, themselves conspicuous there.\nSome minds are tempered happily, and mixt\nWith such ingredients of good sense and taste\nOf what is excellent in man, they thirst\nWith such a zeal to be what they approve,\nThat no restraints can circumscribe them more\nThan they themselves by choice, for wisdom's sake.\nNor can example hurt them.  What they see\nOf vice in others but enhancing more\nThe charms of virtue in their just esteem.\nIf such escape contagion, and emerge\nPure, from so foul a pool, to shine abroad,\nAnd give the world their talents and themselves,\nSmall thanks to those whose negligence or sloth\nExposed their inexperience to the snare,\nAnd left them to an undirected choice.\n\nSee, then, the quiver broken and decayed,\nIn which are kept our arrows.  Rusting there\nIn wild disorder and unfit for use,\nWhat wonder if discharged into the world\nThey shame their shooters with a random flight,\nTheir points obtuse and feathers drunk with wine.\nWell may the Church wage unsuccessful war\nWith such artillery armed.  Vice parries wide\nThe undreaded volley with a sword of straw,\nAnd stands an impudent and fearless mark.\n\nHave we not tracked the felon home, and found\nHis birthplace and his dam?  The country mourns--\nMourns, because every plague that can infest\nSociety, that saps and worms the base\nOf the edifice that Policy has raised,\nSwarms in all quarters; meets the eye, the ear,\nAnd suffocates the breath at every turn.\nProfusion breeds them.  And the cause itself\nOf that calamitous mischief has been found,\nFound, too, where most offensive, in the skirts\nOf the robed pedagogue.  Else, let the arraigned\nStand up unconscious and refute the charge.\nSo, when the Jewish leader stretched his arm\nAnd waved his rod divine, a race obscene,\nSpawned in the muddy beds of Nile, came forth\nPolluting Egypt.  Gardens, fields, and plains\nWere covered with the pest.  The streets were filled;\nThe croaking nuisance lurked in every nook,\nNor palaces nor even chambers 'scaped,\nAnd the land stank, so numerous was the fry.\n\n\n\nBOOK III.\n\nTHE GARDEN.\n\nAs one who, long in thickets and in brakes\nEntangled, winds now this way and now that\nHis devious course uncertain, seeking home;\nOr, having long in miry ways been foiled\nAnd sore discomfited, from slough to slough\nPlunging, and half despairing of escape,\nIf chance at length he find a greensward smooth\nAnd faithful to the foot, his spirits rise,\nHe chirrups brisk his ear-erecting steed,\nAnd winds his way with pleasure and with ease;\nSo I, designing other themes, and called\nTo adorn the Sofa with eulogium due,\nTo tell its slumbers and to paint its dreams,\nHave rambled wide.  In country, city, seat\nOf academic fame, howe'er deserved,\nLong held, and scarcely disengaged at last.\nBut now with pleasant pace, a cleanlier road\nI mean to tread.  I feel myself at large,\nCourageous, and refreshed for future toil,\nIf toil await me, or if dangers new.\n\nSince pulpits fail, and sounding-boards reflect\nMost part an empty ineffectual sound,\nWhat chance that I, to fame so little known,\nNor conversant with men or manners much,\nShould speak to purpose, or with better hope\nCrack the satiric thong?  'Twere wiser far\nFor me, enamoured of sequestered scenes,\nAnd charmed with rural beauty, to repose,\nWhere chance may throw me, beneath elm or vine\nMy languid limbs, when summer sears the plains;\nOr when rough winter rages, on the soft\nAnd sheltered Sofa, while the nitrous air\nFeeds a blue flame and makes a cheerful hearth;\nThere, undisturbed by folly, and apprised\nHow great the danger of disturbing her,\nTo muse in silence, or at least confine\nRemarks that gall so many to the few,\nMy partners in retreat.  Disgust concealed\nIs ofttimes proof of wisdom, when the fault\nIs obstinate, and cure beyond our reach.\n\nDomestic happiness, thou only bliss\nOf Paradise that has survived the fall!\nThough few now taste thee unimpaired and pure,\nOr, tasting, long enjoy thee, too infirm\nOr too incautious to preserve thy sweets\nUnmixed with drops of bitter, which neglect\nOr temper sheds into thy crystal cup.\nThou art the nurse of virtue.  In thine arms\nShe smiles, appearing, as in truth she is,\nHeaven-born, and destined to the skies again.\nThou art not known where Pleasure is adored,\nThat reeling goddess with the zoneless waist\nAnd wandering eyes, still leaning on the arm\nOf Novelty, her fickle frail support;\nFor thou art meek and constant, hating change,\nAnd finding in the calm of truth-tried love\nJoys that her stormy raptures never yield.\nForsaking thee, what shipwreck have we made\nOf honour, dignity, and fair renown,\nTill prostitution elbows us aside\nIn all our crowded streets, and senates seem\nConvened for purposes of empire less,\nThan to release the adult'ress from her bond.\nThe adult'ress! what a theme for angry verse,\nWhat provocation to the indignant heart\nThat feels for injured love! but I disdain\nThe nauseous task to paint her as she is,\nCruel, abandoned, glorying in her shame.\nNo; let her pass, and charioted along\nIn guilty splendour shake the public ways;\nThe frequency of crimes has washed them white,\nAnd verse of mine shall never brand the wretch\nWhom matrons now of character unsmirched\nAnd chaste themselves, are not ashamed to own.\nVirtue and vice had boundaries in old time\nNot to be passed; and she that had renounced\nHer sex's honour, was renounced herself\nBy all that prized it; not for prudery's sake,\nBut dignity's, resentful of the wrong.\n'Twas hard, perhaps, on here and there a waif\nDesirous to return, and not received;\nBut was a wholesome rigour in the main,\nAnd taught the unblemished to preserve with care\nThat purity, whose loss was loss of all.\nMen, too, were nice in honour in those days,\nAnd judged offenders well.  Then he that sharped,\nAnd pocketed a prize by fraud obtained,\nWas marked and shunned as odious.  He that sold\nHis country, or was slack when she required\nHis every nerve in action and at stretch,\nPaid with the blood that he had basely spared\nThe price of his default.  But now,--yes, now,\nWe are become so candid and so fair,\nSo liberal in construction, and so rich\nIn Christian charity (good-natured age!)\nThat they are safe, sinners of either sex,\nTransgress what laws they may.  Well dressed, well bred,\nWell equipaged, is ticket good enough\nTo pass us readily through every door.\nHypocrisy, detest her as we may\n(And no man's hatred ever wronged her yet),\nMay claim this merit still--that she admits\nThe worth of what she mimics with such care,\nAnd thus gives virtue indirect applause;\nBut she has burnt her mask, not needed here,\nWhere vice has such allowance, that her shifts\nAnd specious semblances have lost their use.\n\nI was a stricken deer that left the herd\nLong since; with many an arrow deep infixt\nMy panting side was charged, when I withdrew\nTo seek a tranquil death in distant shades.\nThere was I found by one who had himself\nBeen hurt by the archers.  In his side he bore,\nAnd in his hands and feet, the cruel scars.\nWith gentle force soliciting the darts\nHe drew them forth, and healed and bade me live.\nSince then, with few associates, in remote\nAnd silent woods I wander, far from those\nMy former partners of the peopled scene,\nWith few associates, and not wishing more.\nHere much I ruminate, as much I may,\nWith other views of men and manners now\nThan once, and others of a life to come.\nI see that all are wanderers, gone astray\nEach in his own delusions; they are lost\nIn chase of fancied happiness, still woo'd\nAnd never won.  Dream after dream ensues,\nAnd still they dream that they shall still succeed,\nAnd still are disappointed:  rings the world\nWith the vain stir.  I sum up half mankind,\nAnd add two-thirds of the remaining half,\nAnd find the total of their hopes and fears\nDreams, empty dreams.  The million flit as gay\nAs if created only, like the fly\nThat spreads his motley wings in the eye of noon,\nTo sport their season and be seen no more.\nThe rest are sober dreamers, grave and wise,\nAnd pregnant with discoveries new and rare.\nSome write a narrative of wars, and feats\nOf heroes little known, and call the rant\nA history; describe the man, of whom\nHis own coevals took but little note,\nAnd paint his person, character, and views,\nAs they had known him from his mother's womb;\nThey disentangle from the puzzled skein,\nIn which obscurity has wrapped them up,\nThe threads of politic and shrewd design\nThat ran through all his purposes, and charge\nHis mind with meanings that he never had,\nOr, having, kept concealed.  Some drill and bore\nThe solid earth, and from the strata there\nExtract a register, by which we learn\nThat He who made it and revealed its date\nTo Moses, was mistaken in its age.\nSome, more acute and more industrious still,\nContrive creation; travel nature up\nTo the sharp peak of her sublimest height,\nAnd tell us whence the stars; why some are fixt,\nAnd planetary some; what gave them first\nRotation, from what fountain flowed their light.\nGreat contest follows, and much learned dust\nInvolves the combatants, each claiming truth,\nAnd truth disclaiming both.  And thus they spend\nThe little wick of life's poor shallow lamp\nIn playing tricks with nature, giving laws\nTo distant worlds, and trifling in their own.\nIs't not a pity now, that tickling rheums\nShould ever tease the lungs and blear the sight\nOf oracles like these?  Great pity, too,\nThat having wielded the elements, and built\nA thousand systems, each in his own way,\nThey should go out in fume and be forgot?\nAh, what is life thus spent? and what are they\nBut frantic who thus spend it? all for smoke--\nEternity for bubbles proves at last\nA senseless bargain.  When I see such games\nPlayed by the creatures of a Power who swears\nThat He will judge the earth, and call the fool\nTo a sharp reckoning that has lived in vain,\nAnd when I weigh this seeming wisdom well,\nAnd prove it in the infallible result\nSo hollow and so false--I feel my heart\nDissolve in pity, and account the learned,\nIf this be learning, most of all deceived.\nGreat crimes alarm the conscience, but it sleeps\nWhile thoughtful man is plausibly amused.\nDefend me, therefore, common sense, say I,\nFrom reveries so airy, from the toil\nOf dropping buckets into empty wells,\nAnd growing old in drawing nothing up!\n\n'Twere well, says one sage erudite, profound,\nTerribly arched and aquiline his nose,\nAnd overbuilt with most impending brows,\n'Twere well could you permit the world to live\nAs the world pleases.  What's the world to you?--\nMuch.  I was born of woman, and drew milk\nAs sweet as charity from human breasts.\nI think, articulate, I laugh and weep,\nAnd exercise all functions of a man.\nHow then should I and any man that lives\nBe strangers to each other?  Pierce my vein,\nTake of the crimson stream meandering there,\nAnd catechise it well.  Apply your glass,\nSearch it, and prove now if it be not blood\nCongenial with thine own; and if it be,\nWhat edge of subtlety canst thou suppose\nKeen enough, wise and skilful as thou art,\nTo cut the link of brotherhood, by which\nOne common Maker bound me to the kind?\nTrue; I am no proficient, I confess,\nIn arts like yours.  I cannot call the swift\nAnd perilous lightnings from the angry clouds,\nAnd bid them hide themselves in the earth beneath;\nI cannot analyse the air, nor catch\nThe parallax of yonder luminous point\nThat seems half quenched in the immense abyss:\nSuch powers I boast not--neither can I rest\nA silent witness of the headlong rage,\nOr heedless folly, by which thousands die,\nBone of my bone, and kindred souls to mine.\n\nGod never meant that man should scale the heavens\nBy strides of human wisdom.  In His works,\nThough wondrous, He commands us in His Word\nTo seek Him rather where His mercy shines.\nThe mind indeed, enlightened from above,\nViews Him in all; ascribes to the grand cause\nThe grand effect; acknowledges with joy\nHis manner, and with rapture tastes His style.\nBut never yet did philosophic tube,\nThat brings the planets home into the eye\nOf observation, and discovers, else\nNot visible, His family of worlds,\nDiscover Him that rules them; such a veil\nHangs over mortal eyes, blind from the birth,\nAnd dark in things divine.  Full often too\nOur wayward intellect, the more we learn\nOf nature, overlooks her Author more;\nFrom instrumental causes proud to draw\nConclusions retrograde, and mad mistake:\nBut if His Word once teach us, shoot a ray\nThrough all the heart's dark chambers, and reveal\nTruths undiscerned but by that holy light,\nThen all is plain.  Philosophy, baptised\nIn the pure fountain of eternal love,\nHas eyes indeed; and, viewing all she sees\nAs meant to indicate a God to man,\nGives HIM His praise, and forfeits not her own.\nLearning has borne such fruit in other days\nOn all her branches.  Piety has found\nFriends in the friends of science, and true prayer\nHas flowed from lips wet with Castalian dews.\nSuch was thy wisdom, Newton, childlike sage!\nSagacious reader of the works of God,\nAnd in His Word sagacious.  Such too thine,\nMilton, whose genius had angelic wings,\nAnd fed on manna.  And such thine, in whom\nOur British Themis gloried with just cause,\nImmortal Hale! for deep discernment praised,\nAnd sound integrity not more, than famed\nFor sanctity of manners undefiled.\n\nAll flesh is grass, and all its glory fades\nLike the fair flower dishevelled in the wind;\nRiches have wings, and grandeur is a dream;\nThe man we celebrate must find a tomb,\nAnd we that worship him, ignoble graves.\nNothing is proof against the general curse\nOf vanity, that seizes all below.\nThe only amaranthine flower on earth\nIs virtue; the only lasting treasure, truth.\nBut what is truth? 'twas Pilate's question put\nTo truth itself, that deigned him no reply.\nAnd wherefore? will not God impart His light\nTo them that ask it?--Freely--'tis His joy,\nHis glory, and His nature to impart.\nBut to the proud, uncandid, insincere,\nOr negligent inquirer, not a spark.\nWhat's that which brings contempt upon a book\nAnd him that writes it, though the style be neat,\nThe method clear, and argument exact?\nThat makes a minister in holy things\nThe joy of many, and the dread of more,\nHis name a theme for praise and for reproach?--\nThat, while it gives us worth in God's account,\nDepreciates and undoes us in our own?\nWhat pearl is it that rich men cannot buy,\nThat learning is too proud to gather up,\nBut which the poor and the despised of all\nSeek and obtain, and often find unsought?\nTell me, and I will tell thee what is truth.\n\nOh, friendly to the best pursuits of man,\nFriendly to thought, to virtue, and to peace,\nDomestic life in rural leisure passed!\nFew know thy value, and few taste thy sweets,\nThough many boast thy favours, and affect\nTo understand and choose thee for their own.\nBut foolish man foregoes his proper bliss,\nEven as his first progenitor, and quits,\nThough placed in paradise, for earth has still\nSome traces of her youthful beauty left,\nSubstantial happiness for transient joy.\nScenes formed for contemplation, and to nurse\nThe growing seeds of wisdom; that suggest,\nBy every pleasing image they present,\nReflections such as meliorate the heart,\nCompose the passions, and exalt the mind;\nScenes such as these, 'tis his supreme delight\nTo fill with riot and defile with blood.\nShould some contagion, kind to the poor brutes\nWe persecute, annihilate the tribes\nThat draw the sportsman over hill and dale\nFearless, and rapt away from all his cares;\nShould never game-fowl hatch her eggs again,\nNor baited hook deceive the fish's eye;\nCould pageantry, and dance, and feast, and song\nBe quelled in all our summer months' retreats;\nHow many self-deluded nymphs and swains,\nWho dream they have a taste for fields and groves,\nWould find them hideous nurseries of the spleen,\nAnd crowd the roads, impatient for the town!\nThey love the country, and none else, who seek\nFor their own sake its silence and its shade;\nDelights which who would leave, that has a heart\nSusceptible of pity, or a mind\nCultured and capable of sober thought,\nFor all the savage din of the swift pack,\nAnd clamours of the field?  Detested sport,\nThat owes its pleasures to another's pain,\nThat feeds upon the sobs and dying shrieks\nOf harmless nature, dumb, but yet endued\nWith eloquence, that agonies inspire,\nOf silent tears and heart-distending sighs!\nVain tears, alas! and sighs that never find\nA corresponding tone in jovial souls.\nWell--one at least is safe.  One sheltered hare\nHas never heard the sanguinary yell\nOf cruel man, exulting in her woes.\nInnocent partner of my peaceful home,\nWhom ten long years' experience of my care\nHas made at last familiar, she has lost\nMuch of her vigilant instinctive dread,\nNot needful here, beneath a roof like mine.\nYes--thou mayst eat thy bread, and lick the hand\nThat feeds thee; thou mayst frolic on the floor\nAt evening, and at night retire secure\nTo thy straw-couch, and slumber unalarmed;\nFor I have gained thy confidence, have pledged\nAll that is human in me to protect\nThine unsuspecting gratitude and love.\nIf I survive thee I will dig thy grave,\nAnd when I place thee in it, sighing say,\nI knew at least one hare that had a friend.\n\nHow various his employments, whom the world\nCalls idle, and who justly in return\nEsteems that busy world an idler, too!\nFriends, books, a garden, and perhaps his pen,\nDelightful industry enjoyed at home,\nAnd nature in her cultivated trim\nDressed to his taste, inviting him abroad--\nCan he want occupation who has these?\nWill he be idle who has much to enjoy?\nMe, therefore, studious of laborious ease,\nNot slothful; happy to deceive the time,\nNot waste it; and aware that human life\nIs but a loan to be repaid with use,\nWhen He shall call His debtors to account,\nFrom whom are all our blessings; business finds\nEven here:  while sedulous I seek to improve,\nAt least neglect not, or leave unemployed,\nThe mind He gave me; driving it, though slack\nToo oft, and much impeded in its work\nBy causes not to be divulged in vain,\nTo its just point--the service of mankind.\nHe that attends to his interior self,\nThat has a heart and keeps it; has a mind\nThat hungers and supplies it; and who seeks\nA social, not a dissipated life,\nHas business; feels himself engaged to achieve\nNo unimportant, though a silent task.\nA life all turbulence and noise may seem,\nTo him that leads it, wise and to be praised;\nBut wisdom is a pearl with most success\nSought in still water, and beneath clear skies.\nHe that is ever occupied in storms,\nOr dives not for it or brings up instead,\nVainly industrious, a disgraceful prize.\n\nThe morning finds the self-sequestered man\nFresh for his task, intend what task he may.\nWhether inclement seasons recommend\nHis warm but simple home, where he enjoys,\nWith her who shares his pleasures and his heart,\nSweet converse, sipping calm the fragrant lymph\nWhich neatly she prepares; then to his book\nWell chosen, and not sullenly perused\nIn selfish silence, but imparted oft\nAs aught occurs that she may smile to hear,\nOr turn to nourishment digested well.\nOr if the garden with its many cares,\nAll well repaid, demand him, he attends\nThe welcome call, conscious how much the hand\nOf lubbard labour needs his watchful eye,\nOft loitering lazily if not o'erseen,\nOr misapplying his unskilful strength.\nNor does he govern only or direct,\nBut much performs himself; no works indeed\nThat ask robust tough sinews, bred to toil,\nServile employ--but such as may amuse,\nNot tire, demanding rather skill than force.\nProud of his well-spread walls, he views his trees\nThat meet, no barren interval between,\nWith pleasure more than even their fruits afford,\nWhich, save himself who trains them, none can feel.\nThese, therefore, are his own peculiar charge,\nNo meaner hand may discipline the shoots,\nNone but his steel approach them.  What is weak,\nDistempered, or has lost prolific powers,\nImpaired by age, his unrelenting hand\nDooms to the knife.  Nor does he spare the soft\nAnd succulent that feeds its giant growth,\nBut barren, at the expense of neighbouring twigs\nLess ostentatious, and yet studded thick\nWith hopeful gems.  The rest, no portion left\nThat may disgrace his art, or disappoint\nLarge expectation, he disposes neat\nAt measured distances, that air and sun\nAdmitted freely may afford their aid,\nAnd ventilate and warm the swelling buds.\nHence Summer has her riches, Autumn hence,\nAnd hence even Winter fills his withered hand\nWith blushing fruits, and plenty not his own,\nFair recompense of labour well bestowed\nAnd wise precaution, which a clime so rude\nMakes needful still, whose Spring is but the child\nOf churlish Winter, in her froward moods\nDiscovering much the temper of her sire.\nFor oft, as if in her the stream of mild\nMaternal nature had reversed its course,\nShe brings her infants forth with many smiles,\nBut, once delivered, kills them with a frown.\nHe therefore, timely warned, himself supplies\nHer want of care, screening and keeping warm\nThe plenteous bloom, that no rough blast may sweep\nHis garlands from the boughs.  Again, as oft\nAs the sun peeps and vernal airs breathe mild,\nThe fence withdrawn, he gives them ev'ry beam,\nAnd spreads his hopes before the blaze of day.\n\nTo raise the prickly and green-coated gourd,\nSo grateful to the palate, and when rare\nSo coveted, else base and disesteemed--\nFood for the vulgar merely--is an art\nThat toiling ages have but just matured,\nAnd at this moment unessayed in song.\nYet gnats have had, and frogs and mice long since,\nTheir eulogy; those sang the Mantuan bard,\nAnd these the Grecian in ennobling strains;\nAnd in thy numbers, Philips, shines for aye\nThe solitary Shilling.  Pardon then,\nYe sage dispensers of poetic fame!\nThe ambition of one meaner far, whose powers\nPresuming an attempt not less sublime,\nPant for the praise of dressing to the taste\nOf critic appetite, no sordid fare,\nA cucumber, while costly yet and scarce.\n\nThe stable yields a stercoraceous heap\nImpregnated with quick fermenting salts,\nAnd potent to resist the freezing blast.\nFor ere the beech and elm have cast their leaf\nDeciduous, and when now November dark\nChecks vegetation in the torpid plant\nExposed to his cold breath, the task begins.\nWarily therefore, and with prudent heed\nHe seeks a favoured spot, that where he builds\nThe agglomerated pile, his frame may front\nThe sun's meridian disk, and at the back\nEnjoy close shelter, wall, or reeds, or hedge\nImpervious to the wind.  First he bids spread\nDry fern or littered hay, that may imbibe\nThe ascending damps; then leisurely impose,\nAnd lightly, shaking it with agile hand\nFrom the full fork, the saturated straw.\nWhat longest binds the closest, forms secure\nThe shapely side, that as it rises takes\nBy just degrees an overhanging breadth,\nSheltering the base with its projected eaves.\nThe uplifted frame compact at every joint,\nAnd overlaid with clear translucent glass,\nHe settles next upon the sloping mount,\nWhose sharp declivity shoots off secure\nFrom the dashed pane the deluge as it falls.\nHe shuts it close, and the first labour ends.\nThrice must the voluble and restless earth\nSpin round upon her axle, ere the warmth\nSlow gathering in the midst, through the square mass\nDiffused, attain the surface.  When, behold!\nA pestilent and most corrosive steam,\nLike a gross fog Boeotian, rising fast,\nAnd fast condensed upon the dewy sash,\nAsks egress; which obtained, the overcharged\nAnd drenched conservatory breathes abroad,\nIn volumes wheeling slow, the vapour dank,\nAnd purified, rejoices to have lost\nIts foul inhabitant.  But to assuage\nThe impatient fervour which it first conceives\nWithin its reeking bosom, threatening death\nTo his young hopes, requires discreet delay.\nExperience, slow preceptress, teaching oft\nThe way to glory by miscarriage foul,\nMust prompt him, and admonish how to catch\nThe auspicious moment, when the tempered heat,\nFriendly to vital motion, may afford\nSoft fermentation, and invite the seed.\nThe seed selected wisely, plump and smooth\nAnd glossy, he commits to pots of size\nDiminutive, well filled with well-prepared\nAnd fruitful soil, that has been treasured long,\nAnd drunk no moisture from the dripping clouds:\nThese on the warm and genial earth that hides\nThe smoking manure, and o'erspreads it all,\nHe places lightly, and, as time subdues\nThe rage of fermentation, plunges deep\nIn the soft medium, till they stand immersed.\nThen rise the tender germs upstarting quick\nAnd spreading wide their spongy lobes; at first\nPale, wan, and livid; but assuming soon,\nIf fanned by balmy and nutritious air\nStrained through the friendly mats, a vivid green.\nTwo leaves produced, two rough indented leaves,\nCautious he pinches from the second stalk\nA pimple, that portends a future sprout,\nAnd interdicts its growth.  Thence straight succeed\nThe branches, sturdy to his utmost wish,\nProlific all, and harbingers of more.\nThe crowded roots demand enlargement now\nAnd transplantation in an ampler space.\nIndulged in what they wish, they soon supply\nLarge foliage, overshadowing golden flowers,\nBlown on the summit of the apparent fruit.\nThese have their sexes, and when summer shines\nThe bee transports the fertilising meal\nFrom flower to flower, and even the breathing air\nWafts the rich prize to its appointed use.\nNot so when winter scowls.  Assistant art\nThen acts in nature's office, brings to pass\nThe glad espousals and insures the crop.\n\nGrudge not, ye rich (since luxury must have\nHis dainties, and the world's more numerous half\nLives by contriving delicates for you),\nGrudge not the cost.  Ye little know the cares,\nThe vigilance, the labour, and the skill\nThat day and night are exercised, and hang\nUpon the ticklish balance of suspense,\nThat ye may garnish your profuse regales\nWith summer fruits, brought forth by wintry suns.\nTen thousand dangers lie in wait to thwart\nThe process.  Heat and cold, and wind and steam,\nMoisture and drought, mice, worms, and swarming flies\nMinute as dust and numberless, oft work\nDire disappointment that admits no cure,\nAnd which no care can obviate.  It were long,\nToo long to tell the expedients and the shifts\nWhich he, that fights a season so severe,\nDevises, while he guards his tender trust,\nAnd oft, at last, in vain.  The learned and wise\nSarcastic would exclaim, and judge the song\nCold as its theme, and, like its theme, the fruit\nOf too much labour, worthless when produced.\n\nWho loves a garden, loves a greenhouse too.\nUnconscious of a less propitious clime\nThere blooms exotic beauty, warm and snug,\nWhile the winds whistle and the snows descend.\nThe spiry myrtle with unwithering leaf\nShines there and flourishes.  The golden boast\nOf Portugal and Western India there,\nThe ruddier orange and the paler lime,\nPeep through their polished foliage at the storm,\nAnd seem to smile at what they need not fear.\nThe amomum there with intermingling flowers\nAnd cherries hangs her twigs.  Geranium boasts\nHer crimson honours, and the spangled beau,\nFicoides, glitters bright the winter long,\nAll plants, of every leaf, that can endure\nThe winter's frown if screened from his shrewd bite,\nLive there and prosper.  Those Ausonia claims,\nLevantine regions these; the Azores send\nTheir jessamine; her jessamine remote\nCaffraria:  foreigners from many lands,\nThey form one social shade, as if convened\nBy magic summons of the Orphean lyre.\nYet such arrangement, rarely brought to pass\nBut by a master's hand, disposing well\nThe gay diversities of leaf and flower,\nMust lend its aid to illustrate all their charms,\nAnd dress the regular yet various scene.\nPlant behind plant aspiring, in the van\nThe dwarfish, in the rear retired, but still\nSublime above the rest, the statelier stand.\nSo once were ranged the sons of ancient Rome,\nA noble show, while Roscius trod the stage;\nAnd so, while Garrick, as renowned as he,\nThe sons of Albion, fearing each to lose\nSome note of Nature's music from his lips,\nAnd covetous of Shakespeare's beauty, seen\nIn every flash of his far-beaming eye.\nNor taste alone and well-contrived display\nSuffice to give the marshalled ranks the grace\nOf their complete effect.  Much yet remains\nUnsung, and many cares are yet behind\nAnd more laborious; cares on which depends\nTheir vigour, injured soon, not soon restored.\nThe soil must be renewed, which often washed\nLoses its treasure of salubrious salts,\nAnd disappoints the roots; the slender roots,\nClose interwoven where they meet the vase,\nMust smooth be shorn away; the sapless branch\nMust fly before the knife; the withered leaf\nMust be detached, and where it strews the floor\nSwept with a woman's neatness, breeding else\nContagion, and disseminating death.\nDischarge but these kind offices (and who\nWould spare, that loves them, offices like these?)\nWell they reward the toil.  The sight is pleased,\nThe scent regaled, each odoriferous leaf,\nEach opening blossom, freely breathes abroad\nIts gratitude, and thanks him with its sweets.\n\nSo manifold, all pleasing in their kind,\nAll healthful, are the employs of rural life,\nReiterated as the wheel of time\nRuns round, still ending, and beginning still.\nNor are these all.  To deck the shapely knoll\nThat, softly swelled and gaily dressed, appears\nA flowery island from the dark green lawn\nEmerging, must be deemed a labour due\nTo no mean hand, and asks the touch of taste.\nHere also grateful mixture of well-matched\nAnd sorted hues (each giving each relief,\nAnd by contrasted beauty shining more)\nIs needful.  Strength may wield the ponderous spade,\nMay turn the clod, and wheel the compost home,\nBut elegance, chief grace the garden shows\nAnd most attractive, is the fair result\nOf thought, the creature of a polished mind.\nWithout it, all is Gothic as the scene\nTo which the insipid citizen resorts,\nNear yonder heath; where industry misspent,\nBut proud of his uncouth, ill-chosen task,\nHas made a heaven on earth; with suns and moons\nOf close-rammed stones has charged the encumbered soil,\nAnd fairly laid the zodiac in the dust.\nHe, therefore, who would see his flowers disposed\nSightly and in just order, ere he gives\nThe beds the trusted treasure of their seeds,\nForecasts the future whole; that when the scene\nShall break into its preconceived display,\nEach for itself, and all as with one voice\nConspiring, may attest his bright design.\nNor even then, dismissing as performed\nHis pleasant work, may he suppose it done.\nFew self-supported flowers endure the wind\nUninjured, but expect the upholding aid\nOf the smooth-shaven prop, and neatly tied\nAre wedded thus, like beauty to old age,\nFor interest sake, the living to the dead.\nSome clothe the soil that feeds them, far diffused\nAnd lowly creeping, modest and yet fair;\nLike virtue, thriving most where little seen.\nSome, more aspiring, catch the neighbour shrub\nWith clasping tendrils, and invest his branch,\nElse unadorned, with many a gay festoon\nAnd fragrant chaplet, recompensing well\nThe strength they borrow with the grace they lend.\nAll hate the rank society of weeds,\nNoisome, and very greedy to exhaust\nThe impoverished earth; an overbearing race,\nThat, like the multitude made faction-mad,\nDisturb good order, and degrade true worth.\n\nOh blest seclusion from a jarring world,\nWhich he, thus occupied, enjoys!  Retreat\nCannot, indeed, to guilty man restore\nLost innocence, or cancel follies past;\nBut it has peace, and much secures the mind\nFrom all assaults of evil; proving still\nA faithful barrier, not o'erleaped with ease\nBy vicious custom raging uncontrolled\nAbroad and desolating public life.\nWhen fierce temptation, seconded within\nBy traitor appetite, and armed with darts\nTempered in hell, invades the throbbing breast,\nTo combat may be glorious, and success\nPerhaps may crown us, but to fly is safe.\nHad I the choice of sublunary good,\nWhat could I wish that I possess not here?\nHealth, leisure; means to improve it, friendship, peace,\nNo loose or wanton though a wandering muse,\nAnd constant occupation without care.\nThus blest, I draw a picture of that bliss;\nHopeless, indeed, that dissipated minds\nAnd profligate abusers of a world\nCreated fair so much in vain for them,\nShould seek the guiltless joys that I describe,\nAllured by my report; but sure no less\nThat self-condemned they must neglect the prize,\nAnd what they will not taste, must yet approve.\nWhat we admire we praise; and when we praise\nAdvance it into notice, that, its worth\nAcknowledged, others may admire it too.\nI therefore recommend, though at the risk\nOf popular disgust, yet boldly still,\nThe cause of piety and sacred truth\nAnd virtue, and those scenes which God ordained\nShould best secure them and promote them most;\nScenes that I love, and with regret perceive\nForsaken, or through folly not enjoyed.\nPure is the nymph, though liberal of her smiles,\nAnd chaste, though unconfined, whom I extol.\nNot as the prince in Shushan, when he called,\nVain-glorious of her charms, his Vashti forth,\nTo grace the full pavilion.  His design\nWas but to boast his own peculiar good,\nWhich all might view with envy, none partake.\nMy charmer is not mine alone; my sweets,\nAnd she that sweetens all my bitters, too,\nNature, enchanting Nature, in whose form\nAnd lineaments divine I trace a hand\nThat errs not, and find raptures still renewed,\nIs free to all men--universal prize.\nStrange that so fair a creature should yet want\nAdmirers, and be destined to divide\nWith meaner objects even the few she finds.\nStript of her ornaments, her leaves and flowers,\nShe loses all her influence.  Cities then\nAttract us, and neglected Nature pines,\nAbandoned, as unworthy of our love.\nBut are not wholesome airs, though unperfumed\nBy roses, and clear suns, though scarcely felt,\nAnd groves, if unharmonious yet secure\nFrom clamour and whose very silence charms,\nTo be preferred to smoke--to the eclipse\nThat Metropolitan volcanoes make,\nWhose Stygian throats breathe darkness all day long,\nAnd to the stir of commerce, driving slow,\nAnd thundering loud with his ten thousand wheels?\nThey would be, were not madness in the head\nAnd folly in the heart; were England now\nWhat England was, plain, hospitable, kind,\nAnd undebauched.  But we have bid farewell\nTo all the virtues of those better days,\nAnd all their honest pleasures.  Mansions once\nKnew their own masters, and laborious hands\nThat had survived the father, served the son.\nNow the legitimate and rightful lord\nIs but a transient guest, newly arrived\nAnd soon to be supplanted.  He that saw\nHis patrimonial timber cast its leaf,\nSells the last scantling, and transfers the price\nTo some shrewd sharper, ere it buds again.\nEstates are landscapes, gazed upon awhile,\nThen advertised, and auctioneered away.\nThe country starves, and they that feed the o'er-charged\nAnd surfeited lewd town with her fair dues,\nBy a just judgment strip and starve themselves.\nThe wings that waft our riches out of sight\nGrow on the gamester's elbows, and the alert\nAnd nimble motion of those restless joints,\nThat never tire, soon fans them all away.\nImprovement too, the idol of the age,\nIs fed with many a victim.  Lo! he comes--\nThe omnipotent magician, Brown, appears.\nDown falls the venerable pile, the abode\nOf our forefathers, a grave whiskered race,\nBut tasteless.  Springs a palace in its stead,\nBut in a distant spot; where more exposed\nIt may enjoy the advantage of the North\nAnd aguish East, till time shall have transformed\nThose naked acres to a sheltering grove.\nHe speaks.  The lake in front becomes a lawn,\nWoods vanish, hills subside, and valleys rise,\nAnd streams, as if created for his use,\nPursue the track of his directed wand\nSinuous or straight, now rapid and now slow,\nNow murmuring soft, now roaring in cascades,\nEven as he bids.  The enraptured owner smiles.\n'Tis finished.  And yet, finished as it seems,\nStill wants a grace, the loveliest it could show,\nA mine to satisfy the enormous cost.\nDrained to the last poor item of his wealth,\nHe sighs, departs, and leaves the accomplished plan\nThat he has touched and retouched, many a day\nLaboured, and many a night pursued in dreams,\nJust when it meets his hopes, and proves the heaven\nHe wanted, for a wealthier to enjoy.\nAnd now perhaps the glorious hour is come,\nWhen having no stake left, no pledge to endear\nHer interests, or that gives her sacred cause\nA moment's operation on his love,\nHe burns with most intense and flagrant zeal\nTo serve his country.  Ministerial grace\nDeals him out money from the public chest,\nOr, if that mine be shut, some private purse\nSupplies his need with an usurious loan,\nTo be refunded duly, when his vote,\nWell-managed, shall have earned its worthy price.\nOh, innocent compared with arts like these,\nCrape and cocked pistol and the whistling ball\nSent through the traveller's temples!  He that finds\nOne drop of heaven's sweet mercy in his cup,\nCan dig, beg, rot, and perish well-content,\nSo he may wrap himself in honest rags\nAt his last gasp; but could not for a world\nFish up his dirty and dependent bread\nFrom pools and ditches of the commonwealth,\nSordid and sickening at his own success.\n\nAmbition, avarice, penury incurred\nBy endless riot, vanity, the lust\nOf pleasure and variety, despatch,\nAs duly as the swallows disappear,\nThe world of wandering knights and squires to town;\nLondon engulfs them all.  The shark is there,\nAnd the shark's prey; the spendthrift, and the leech\nThat sucks him.  There the sycophant, and he\nThat with bare-headed and obsequious bows\nBegs a warm office, doomed to a cold jail\nAnd groat per diem if his patron frown.\nThe levee swarms, as if in golden pomp\nWere charactered on every statesman's door,\n'BATTERED AND BANKRUPT FORTUNES MENDED HERE.'\nThese are the charms that sully and eclipse\nThe charms of nature.  'Tis the cruel gripe\nThat lean hard-handed poverty inflicts,\nThe hope of better things, the chance to win,\nThe wish to shine, the thirst to be amused,\nThat, at the sound of Winter's hoary wing,\nUnpeople all our counties of such herds\nOf fluttering, loitering, cringing, begging, loose\nAnd wanton vagrants, as make London, vast\nAnd boundless as it is, a crowded coop.\n\nOh thou resort and mart of all the earth,\nChequered with all complexions of mankind,\nAnd spotted with all crimes; in whom I see\nMuch that I love, and more that I admire,\nAnd all that I abhor; thou freckled fair\nThat pleases and yet shocks me, I can laugh\nAnd I can weep, can hope, and can despond,\nFeel wrath and pity when I think on thee!\nTen righteous would have saved a city once,\nAnd thou hast many righteous.--Well for thee--\nThat salt preserves thee; more corrupted else,\nAnd therefore more obnoxious at this hour\nThan Sodom in her day had power to be,\nFor whom God heard his Abram plead in vain.\n\n\n\nBOOK IV.\n\nTHE WINTER EVENING.\n\nHark! 'tis the twanging horn o'er yonder bridge,\nThat with its wearisome but needful length\nBestrides the wintry flood, in which the moon\nSees her unwrinkled face reflected bright;--\nHe comes, the herald of a noisy world,\nWith spattered boots, strapped waist, and frozen locks,\nNews from all nations lumbering at his back.\nTrue to his charge the close-packed load behind,\nYet careless what he brings, his one concern\nIs to conduct it to the destined inn,\nAnd, having dropped the expected bag--pass on.\nHe whistles as he goes, light-hearted wretch,\nCold and yet cheerful:  messenger of grief\nPerhaps to thousands, and of joy to some;\nTo him indifferent whether grief or joy.\nHouses in ashes, and the fall of stocks,\nBirths, deaths, and marriages, epistles wet\nWith tears that trickled down the writer's cheeks,\nFast as the periods from his fluent quill,\nOr charged with amorous sighs of absent swains,\nOr nymphs responsive, equally affect\nHis horse and him, unconscious of them all.\nBut oh, the important budget! ushered in\nWith such heart-shaking music, who can say\nWhat are its tidings? have our troops awaked?\nOr do they still, as if with opium drugged,\nSnore to the murmurs of the Atlantic wave?\nIs India free? and does she wear her plumed\nAnd jewelled turban with a smile of peace,\nOr do we grind her still?  The grand debate,\nThe popular harangue, the tart reply,\nThe logic and the wisdom and the wit\nAnd the loud laugh--I long to know them all;\nI burn to set the imprisoned wranglers free,\nAnd give them voice and utterance once again.\n\nNow stir the fire, and close the shutters fast,\nLet fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,\nAnd while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn\nThrows up a steamy column, and the cups,\nThat cheer but not inebriate, wait on each,\nSo let us welcome peaceful evening in.\nNot such his evening, who with shining face\nSweats in the crowded theatre, and squeezed\nAnd bored with elbow-points through both his sides,\nOutscolds the ranting actor on the stage;\nNor his, who patient stands till his feet throb\nAnd his head thumps, to feed upon the breath\nOf patriots bursting with heroic rage,\nOr placemen all tranquillity and smiles.\nThis folio of four pages, happy work!\nWhich not even critics criticise, that holds\nInquisitive attention while I read\nFast bound in chains of silence, which the fair,\nThough eloquent themselves, yet fear to break,\nWhat is it but a map of busy life,\nIts fluctuations and its vast concerns?\nHere runs the mountainous and craggy ridge\nThat tempts ambition.  On the summit, see,\nThe seals of office glitter in his eyes;\nHe climbs, he pants, he grasps them.  At his heels,\nClose at his heels, a demagogue ascends,\nAnd with a dextrous jerk soon twists him down\nAnd wins them, but to lose them in his turn.\nHere rills of oily eloquence, in soft\nMeanders, lubricate the course they take;\nThe modest speaker is ashamed and grieved\nTo engross a moment's notice, and yet begs,\nBegs a propitious ear for his poor thoughts,\nHowever trivial all that he conceives.\nSweet bashfulness! it claims, at least, this praise,\nThe dearth of information and good sense\nThat it foretells us, always comes to pass.\nCataracts of declamation thunder here,\nThere forests of no meaning spread the page\nIn which all comprehension wanders lost;\nWhile fields of pleasantry amuse us there,\nWith merry descants on a nation's woes.\nThe rest appears a wilderness of strange\nBut gay confusion; roses for the cheeks\nAnd lilies for the brows of faded age,\nTeeth for the toothless, ringlets for the bald,\nHeaven, earth, and ocean plundered of their sweets.\nNectareous essences, Olympian dews,\nSermons and city feasts and favourite airs,\nEthereal journeys, submarine exploits,\nAnd Katterfelto with his hair on end\nAt his own wonders, wondering for his bread.\n\n'Tis pleasant through the loopholes of retreat\nTo peep at such a world; to see the stir\nOf the great Babel and not feel the crowd;\nTo hear the roar she sends through all her gates\nAt a safe distance, where the dying sound\nFalls a soft murmur on the uninjured ear.\nThus sitting and surveying thus at ease\nThe globe and its concerns, I seem advanced\nTo some secure and more than mortal height,\nThat liberates and exempts me from them all.\nIt turns submitted to my view, turns round\nWith all its generations; I behold\nThe tumult and am still.  The sound of war\nHas lost its terrors ere it reaches me;\nGrieves, but alarms me not.  I mourn the pride\nAnd avarice that makes man a wolf to man;\nHear the faint echo of those brazen throats\nBy which he speaks the language of his heart,\nAnd sigh, but never tremble at the sound.\nHe travels and expatiates, as the bee\nFrom flower to flower so he from land to land;\nThe manners, customs, policy of all\nPay contribution to the store he gleans,\nHe sucks intelligence in every clime,\nAnd spreads the honey of his deep research\nAt his return--a rich repast for me.\nHe travels and I too.  I tread his deck,\nAscend his topmast, through his peering eyes\nDiscover countries, with a kindred heart\nSuffer his woes and share in his escapes;\nWhile fancy, like the finger of a clock,\nRuns the great circuit, and is still at home.\n\nOh Winter, ruler of the inverted year,\nThy scattered hair with sleet-like ashes filled,\nThy breath congealed upon thy lips, thy cheeks\nFringed with a beard made white with other snows\nThan those of age, thy forehead wrapped in clouds,\nA leafless branch thy sceptre, and thy throne\nA sliding car indebted to no wheels,\nBut urged by storms along its slippery way,\nI love thee, all unlovely as thou seem'st,\nAnd dreaded as thou art.  Thou hold'st the sun\nA prisoner in the yet undawning East,\nShortening his journey between morn and noon,\nAnd hurrying him, impatient of his stay,\nDown to the rosy west; but kindly still\nCompensating his loss with added hours\nOf social converse and instructive ease,\nAnd gathering at short notice in one group\nThe family dispersed, and fixing thought\nNot less dispersed by daylight and its cares.\nI crown thee king of intimate delights,\nFire-side enjoyments, home-born happiness,\nAnd all the comforts that the lowly roof\nOf undisturbed retirement, and the hours\nOf long uninterrupted evening know.\nNo rattling wheels stop short before these gates;\nNo powdered pert proficients in the art\nOf sounding an alarm, assault these doors\nTill the street rings; no stationary steeds\nCough their own knell, while heedless of the sound\nThe silent circle fan themselves, and quake:\nBut here the needle plies its busy task,\nThe pattern grows, the well-depicted flower,\nWrought patiently into the snowy lawn,\nUnfolds its bosom; buds and leaves and sprigs\nAnd curly tendrils, gracefully disposed,\nFollow the nimble finger of the fair;\nA wreath that cannot fade, of flowers that blow\nWith most success when all besides decay.\nThe poet's or historian's page, by one\nMade vocal for the amusement of the rest;\nThe sprightly lyre, whose treasure of sweet sounds\nThe touch from many a trembling chord shakes out;\nAnd the clear voice symphonious, yet distinct,\nAnd in the charming strife triumphant still,\nBeguile the night, and set a keener edge\nOn female industry; the threaded steel\nFlies swiftly, and unfelt the task proceeds.\nThe volume closed, the customary rites\nOf the last meal commence:  a Roman meal,\nSuch as the mistress of the world once found\nDelicious, when her patriots of high note,\nPerhaps by moonlight, at their humble doors,\nAnd under an old oak's domestic shade,\nEnjoyed--spare feast!--a radish and an egg.\nDiscourse ensues, not trivial, yet not dull,\nNor such as with a frown forbids the play\nOf fancy, or proscribes the sound of mirth;\nNor do we madly, like an impious world,\nWho deem religion frenzy, and the God\nThat made them an intruder on their joys,\nStart at His awful name, or deem His praise\nA jarring note; themes of a graver tone\nExciting oft our gratitude and love,\nWhile we retrace with memory's pointing wand\nThat calls the past to our exact review,\nThe dangers we have scaped, the broken snare,\nThe disappointed foe, deliverance found\nUnlooked for, life preserved and peace restored,\nFruits of omnipotent eternal love:--\nOh evenings worthy of the gods! exclaimed\nThe Sabine bard.  Oh evenings, I reply,\nMore to be prized and coveted than yours,\nAs more illumined and with nobler truths,\nThat I, and mine, and those we love, enjoy.\n\nIs Winter hideous in a garb like this?\nNeeds he the tragic fur, the smoke of lamps,\nThe pent-up breath of an unsavoury throng\nTo thaw him into feeling, or the smart\nAnd snappish dialogue that flippant wits\nCall comedy, to prompt him with a smile?\nThe self-complacent actor, when he views\n(Stealing a sidelong glance at a full house)\nThe slope of faces from the floor to the roof,\nAs if one master-spring controlled them all,\nRelaxed into an universal grin,\nSees not a countenance there that speaks a joy\nHalf so refined or so sincere as ours.\nCards were superfluous here, with all the tricks\nThat idleness has ever yet contrived\nTo fill the void of an unfurnished brain,\nTo palliate dulness and give time a shove.\nTime, as he passes us, has a dove's wing,\nUnsoiled and swift and of a silken sound.\nBut the world's time is time in masquerade.\nTheirs, should I paint him, has his pinions fledged\nWith motley plumes, and, where the peacock shows\nHis azure eyes, is tinctured black and red\nWith spots quadrangular of diamond form,\nEnsanguined hearts, clubs typical of strife,\nAnd spades, the emblem of untimely graves.\nWhat should be, and what was an hour-glass once,\nBecomes a dice-box, and a billiard mast\nWell does the work of his destructive scythe.\nThus decked he charms a world whom fashion blinds\nTo his true worth, most pleased when idle most,\nWhose only happy are their wasted hours.\nEven misses, at whose age their mothers wore\nThe back-string and the bib, assume the dress\nOf womanhood, sit pupils in the school\nOf card-devoted time, and night by night,\nPlaced at some vacant corner of the board,\nLearn every trick, and soon play all the game.\nBut truce with censure.  Roving as I rove,\nWhere shall I find an end, or how proceed?\nAs he that travels far, oft turns aside\nTo view some rugged rock, or mouldering tower,\nWhich seen delights him not; then coming home,\nDescribes and prints it, that the world may know\nHow far he went for what was nothing worth;\nSo I, with brush in hand and pallet spread\nWith colours mixed for a far different use,\nPaint cards and dolls, and every idle thing\nThat fancy finds in her excursive flights.\n\nCome, Evening, once again, season of peace,\nReturn, sweet Evening, and continue long!\nMethinks I see thee in the streaky west,\nWith matron-step slow moving, while the night\nTreads on thy sweeping train; one hand employed\nIn letting fall the curtain of repose\nOn bird and beast, the other charged for man\nWith sweet oblivion of the cares of day;\nNot sumptuously adorned, nor needing aid,\nLike homely-featured night, of clustering gems,\nA star or two just twinkling on thy brow\nSuffices thee; save that the moon is thine\nNo less than hers, not worn indeed on high\nWith ostentatious pageantry, but set\nWith modest grandeur in thy purple zone,\nResplendent less, but of an ampler round.\nCome, then, and thou shalt find thy votary calm,\nOr make me so.  Composure is thy gift;\nAnd whether I devote thy gentle hours\nTo books, to music, or to poet's toil,\nTo weaving nets for bird-alluring fruit,\nOr twining silken threads round ivory reels\nWhen they command whom man was born to please,\nI slight thee not, but make thee welcome still.\n\nJust when our drawing-rooms begin to blaze\nWith lights, by clear reflection multiplied\nFrom many a mirror, in which he of Gath,\nGoliath, might have seen his giant bulk\nWhole without stooping, towering crest and all,\nMy pleasures too begin.  But me perhaps\nThe glowing hearth may satisfy a while\nWith faint illumination, that uplifts\nThe shadow to the ceiling, there by fits\nDancing uncouthly to the quivering flame.\nNot undelightful is an hour to me\nSo spent in parlour twilight; such a gloom\nSuits well the thoughtful or unthinking mind,\nThe mind contemplative, with some new theme\nPregnant, or indisposed alike to all.\nLaugh ye, who boast your more mercurial powers\nThat never feel a stupor, know no pause,\nNor need one; I am conscious, and confess.\nFearless, a soul that does not always think.\nMe oft has fancy ludicrous and wild\nSoothed with a waking dream of houses, towers,\nTrees, churches, and strange visages expressed\nIn the red cinders, while with poring eye\nI gazed, myself creating what I saw.\nNor less amused have I quiescent watched\nThe sooty films that play upon the bars\nPendulous, and foreboding in the view\nOf superstition, prophesying still,\nThough still deceived, some stranger's near approach.\n'Tis thus the understanding takes repose\nIn indolent vacuity of thought,\nAnd sleeps and is refreshed.  Meanwhile the face\nConceals the mood lethargic with a mask\nOf deep deliberation, as the man\nWere tasked to his full strength, absorbed and lost.\nThus oft reclined at ease, I lose an hour\nAt evening, till at length the freezing blast\nThat sweeps the bolted shutter, summons home\nThe recollected powers, and, snapping short\nThe glassy threads with which the fancy weaves\nHer brittle toys, restores me to myself.\nHow calm is my recess! and how the frost\nRaging abroad, and the rough wind, endear\nThe silence and the warmth enjoyed within!\nI saw the woods and fields at close of day\nA variegated show; the meadows green\nThough faded, and the lands, where lately waved\nThe golden harvest, of a mellow brown,\nUpturned so lately by the forceful share;\nI saw far off the weedy fallows smile\nWith verdure not unprofitable, grazed\nBy flocks fast feeding, and selecting each\nHis favourite herb; while all the leafless groves\nThat skirt the horizon wore a sable hue,\nScarce noticed in the kindred dusk of eve.\nTo-morrow brings a change, a total change,\nWhich even now, though silently performed\nAnd slowly, and by most unfelt, the face\nOf universal nature undergoes.\nFast falls a fleecy shower; the downy flakes,\nDescending and with never-ceasing lapse\nSoftly alighting upon all below,\nAssimilate all objects.  Earth receives\nGladly the thickening mantle, and the green\nAnd tender blade, that feared the chilling blast,\nEscapes unhurt beneath so warm a veil.\n\nIn such a world, so thorny, and where none\nFinds happiness unblighted, or if found,\nWithout some thistly sorrow at its side,\nIt seems the part of wisdom, and no sin\nAgainst the law of love, to measure lots\nWith less distinguished than ourselves, that thus\nWe may with patience bear our moderate ills,\nAnd sympathise with others, suffering more.\nIll fares the traveller now, and he that stalks\nIn ponderous boots beside his reeking team;\nThe wain goes heavily, impeded sore\nBy congregating loads adhering close\nTo the clogged wheels, and, in its sluggish pace,\nNoiseless appears a moving hill of snow.\nThe toiling steeds expand the nostril wide,\nWhile every breath, by respiration strong\nForced downward, is consolidated soon\nUpon their jutting chests.  He, formed to bear\nThe pelting brunt of the tempestuous night,\nWith half-shut eyes, and puckered cheeks, and teeth\nPresented bare against the storm, plods on;\nOne hand secures his hat, save when with both\nHe brandishes his pliant length of whip,\nResounding oft, and never heard in vain.\nOh happy, and, in my account, denied\nThat sensibility of pain with which\nRefinement is endued, thrice happy thou!\nThy frame, robust and hardy, feels indeed\nThe piercing cold, but feels it unimpaired;\nThe learned finger never need explore\nThy vigorous pulse, and the unhealthful East,\nThat breathes the spleen, and searches every bone\nOf the infirm, is wholesome air to thee.\nThy days roll on exempt from household care,\nThy waggon is thy wife; and the poor beasts,\nThat drag the dull companion to and fro,\nThine helpless charge, dependent on thy care.\nAh, treat them kindly! rude as thou appearest,\nYet show that thou hast mercy, which the great,\nWith needless hurry whirled from place to place,\nHumane as they would seem, not always show.\n\nPoor, yet industrious, modest, quiet, neat,\nSuch claim compassion in a night like this,\nAnd have a friend in every feeling heart.\nWarmed while it lasts, by labour, all day long\nThey brave the season, and yet find at eve,\nIll clad and fed but sparely, time to cool.\nThe frugal housewife trembles when she lights\nHer scanty stock of brushwood, blazing clear,\nBut dying soon, like all terrestrial joys;\nThe few small embers left she nurses well.\nAnd while her infant race with outspread hands\nAnd crowded knees sit cowering o'er the sparks,\nRetires, content to quake, so they be warmed.\nThe man feels least, as more inured than she\nTo winter, and the current in his veins\nMore briskly moved by his severer toil;\nYet he, too, finds his own distress in theirs.\nThe taper soon extinguished, which I saw\nDangled along at the cold finger's end\nJust when the day declined, and the brown loaf\nLodged on the shelf, half-eaten, without sauce\nOf sav'ry cheese, or butter costlier still,\nSleep seems their only refuge.  For alas,\nWhere penury is felt the thought is chained,\nAnd sweet colloquial pleasures are but few.\nWith all this thrift they thrive not.  All the care\nIngenious parsimony takes, but just\nSaves the small inventory, bed and stool,\nSkillet and old carved chest, from public sale.\nThey live, and live without extorted alms\nFrom grudging hands, but other boast have none\nTo soothe their honest pride that scorns to beg,\nNor comfort else, but in their mutual love.\nI praise you much, ye meek and patient pair,\nFor ye are worthy; choosing rather far\nA dry but independent crust, hard-earned\nAnd eaten with a sigh, than to endure\nThe rugged frowns and insolent rebuffs\nOf knaves in office, partial in their work\nOf distribution; liberal of their aid\nTo clamorous importunity in rags,\nBut ofttimes deaf to suppliants who would blush\nTo wear a tattered garb however coarse,\nWhom famine cannot reconcile to filth;\nThese ask with painful shyness, and, refused\nBecause deserving, silently retire.\nBut be ye of good courage!  Time itself\nShall much befriend you.  Time shall give increase,\nAnd all your numerous progeny, well trained,\nBut helpless, in few years shall find their hands,\nAnd labour too.  Meanwhile ye shall not want\nWhat, conscious of your virtues, we can spare,\nNor what a wealthier than ourselves may send.\nI mean the man, who when the distant poor\nNeed help, denies them nothing but his name.\n\nBut poverty with most, who whimper forth\nTheir long complaints, is self-inflicted woe,\nThe effect of laziness or sottish waste.\nNow goes the nightly thief prowling abroad\nFor plunder; much solicitous how best\nHe may compensate for a day of sloth,\nBy works of darkness and nocturnal wrong,\nWoe to the gardener's pale, the farmer's hedge\nPlashed neatly and secured with driven stakes\nDeep in the loamy bank.  Uptorn by strength\nResistless in so bad a cause, but lame\nTo better deeds, he bundles up the spoil--\nAn ass's burden,--and when laden most\nAnd heaviest, light of foot steals fast away.\nNor does the boarded hovel better guard\nThe well-stacked pile of riven logs and roots\nFrom his pernicious force.  Nor will he leave\nUnwrenched the door, however well secured,\nWhere chanticleer amidst his harem sleeps\nIn unsuspecting pomp; twitched from the perch\nHe gives the princely bird with all his wives\nTo his voracious bag, struggling in vain,\nAnd loudly wondering at the sudden change.\nNor this to feed his own.  'Twere some excuse\nDid pity of their sufferings warp aside\nHis principle, and tempt him into sin\nFor their support, so destitute; but they\nNeglected pine at home, themselves, as more\nExposed than others, with less scruple made\nHis victims, robbed of their defenceless all.\nCruel is all he does.  'Tis quenchless thirst\nOf ruinous ebriety that prompts\nHis every action, and imbrutes the man.\nOh for a law to noose the villain's neck\nWho starves his own; who persecutes the blood\nHe gave them in his children's veins, and hates\nAnd wrongs the woman he has sworn to love.\n\nPass where we may, through city, or through town,\nVillage or hamlet of this merry land,\nThough lean and beggared, every twentieth pace\nConducts the unguarded nose to such a whiff\nOf stale debauch, forth-issuing from the styes\nThat law has licensed, as makes temperance reel.\nThere sit involved and lost in curling clouds\nOf Indian fume, and guzzling deep, the boor,\nThe lackey, and the groom.  The craftsman there\nTakes a Lethean leave of all his toil;\nSmith, cobbler, joiner, he that plies the shears,\nAnd he that kneads the dough:  all loud alike,\nAll learned, and all drunk.  The fiddle screams\nPlaintive and piteous, as it wept and wailed\nIts wasted tones and harmony unheard;\nFierce the dispute, whate'er the theme; while she,\nFell Discord, arbitress of such debate,\nPerched on the sign-post, holds with even hand\nHer undecisive scales.  In this she lays\nA weight of ignorance, in that, of pride,\nAnd smiles delighted with the eternal poise.\nDire is the frequent curse and its twin sound\nThe cheek-distending oath, not to be praised\nAs ornamental, musical, polite,\nLike those which modern senators employ,\nWhose oath is rhetoric, and who swear for fame.\nBehold the schools in which plebeian minds,\nOnce simple, are initiated in arts\nWhich some may practise with politer grace,\nBut none with readier skill!  'Tis here they learn\nThe road that leads from competence and peace\nTo indigence and rapine; till at last\nSociety, grown weary of the load,\nShakes her encumbered lap, and casts them out.\nBut censure profits little.  Vain the attempt\nTo advertise in verse a public pest,\nThat, like the filth with which the peasant feeds\nHis hungry acres, stinks and is of use.\nThe excise is fattened with the rich result\nOf all this riot; and ten thousand casks,\nFor ever dribbling out their base contents,\nTouched by the Midas finger of the state,\nBleed gold for Ministers to sport away.\nDrink and be mad then; 'tis your country bids!\nGloriously drunk, obey the important call,\nHer cause demands the assistance of your throats;--\nYe all can swallow, and she asks no more.\n\nWould I had fallen upon those happier days\nThat poets celebrate; those golden times\nAnd those Arcadian scenes that Maro sings,\nAnd Sidney, warbler of poetic prose.\nNymphs were Dianas then, and swains had hearts\nThat felt their virtues.  Innocence, it seems,\nFrom courts dismissed, found shelter in the groves;\nThe footsteps of simplicity, impressed\nUpon the yielding herbage (so they sing),\nThen were not all effaced.  Then speech profane\nAnd manners profligate were rarely found,\nObserved as prodigies, and soon reclaimed.\nVain wish! those days were never:  airy dreams\nSat for the picture; and the poet's hand,\nImparting substance to an empty shade,\nImposed a gay delirium for a truth.\nGrant it:  I still must envy them an age\nThat favoured such a dream, in days like these\nImpossible, when virtue is so scarce\nThat to suppose a scene where she presides\nIs tramontane, and stumbles all belief.\nNo.  We are polished now.  The rural lass,\nWhom once her virgin modesty and grace,\nHer artless manners and her neat attire,\nSo dignified, that she was hardly less\nThan the fair shepherdess of old romance,\nIs seen no more.  The character is lost.\nHer head adorned with lappets pinned aloft\nAnd ribbons streaming gay, superbly raised\nAnd magnified beyond all human size,\nIndebted to some smart wig-weaver's hand\nFor more than half the tresses it sustains;\nHer elbows ruffled, and her tottering form\nIll propped upon French heels; she might be deemed\n(But that the basket dangling on her arm\nInterprets her more truly) of a rank\nToo proud for dairy-work, or sale of eggs;\nExpect her soon with foot-boy at her heels,\nNo longer blushing for her awkward load,\nHer train and her umbrella all her care.\n\nThe town has tinged the country; and the stain\nAppears a spot upon a vestal's robe,\nThe worse for what it soils.  The fashion runs\nDown into scenes still rural, but alas,\nScenes rarely graced with rural manners now.\nTime was when in the pastoral retreat\nThe unguarded door was safe; men did not watch\nTo invade another's right, or guard their own.\nThen sleep was undisturbed by fear, unscared\nBy drunken howlings; and the chilling tale\nOf midnight murder was a wonder heard\nWith doubtful credit, told to frighten babes\nBut farewell now to unsuspicious nights,\nAnd slumbers unalarmed.  Now, ere you sleep,\nSee that your polished arms be primed with care,\nAnd drop the night-bolt.  Ruffians are abroad,\nAnd the first larum of the cock's shrill throat\nMay prove a trumpet, summoning your ear\nTo horrid sounds of hostile feet within.\nEven daylight has its dangers; and the walk\nThrough pathless wastes and woods, unconscious once\nOf other tenants than melodious birds,\nOr harmless flocks, is hazardous and bold.\nLamented change! to which full many a cause\nInveterate, hopeless of a cure, conspires.\nThe course of human things from good to ill,\nFrom ill to worse, is fatal, never fails.\nIncrease of power begets increase of wealth;\nWealth luxury, and luxury excess;\nExcess, the scrofulous and itchy plague\nThat seizes first the opulent, descends\nTo the next rank contagious, and in time\nTaints downward all the graduated scale\nOf order, from the chariot to the plough.\nThe rich, and they that have an arm to check\nThe licence of the lowest in degree,\nDesert their office; and themselves, intent\nOn pleasure, haunt the capital, and thus\nTo all the violence of lawless hands\nResign the scenes their presence might protect.\nAuthority itself not seldom sleeps,\nThough resident, and witness of the wrong.\nThe plump convivial parson often bears\nThe magisterial sword in vain, and lays\nHis reverence and his worship both to rest\nOn the same cushion of habitual sloth.\nPerhaps timidity restrains his arm,\nWhen he should strike he trembles, and sets free,\nHimself enslaved by terror of the band,\nThe audacious convict whom he dares not bind.\nPerhaps, though by profession ghostly pure,\nHe, too, may have his vice, and sometimes prove\nLess dainty than becomes his grave outside\nIn lucrative concerns.  Examine well\nHis milk-white hand.  The palm is hardly clean--\nBut here and there an ugly smutch appears.\nFoh! 'twas a bribe that left it.  He has touched\nCorruption.  Whoso seeks an audit here\nPropitious, pays his tribute, game or fish,\nWildfowl or venison, and his errand speeds.\n\nBut faster far and more than all the rest\nA noble cause, which none who bears a spark\nOf public virtue ever wished removed,\nWorks the deplored and mischievous effect.\n'Tis universal soldiership has stabbed\nThe heart of merit in the meaner class.\nArms, through the vanity and brainless rage\nOf those that bear them, in whatever cause,\nSeem most at variance with all moral good,\nAnd incompatible with serious thought.\nThe clown, the child of nature, without guile,\nBlest with an infant's ignorance of all\nBut his own simple pleasures, now and then\nA wrestling match, a foot-race, or a fair,\nIs balloted, and trembles at the news.\nSheepish he doffs his hat, and mumbling swears\nA Bible-oath to be whate'er they please,\nTo do he knows not what.  The task performed,\nThat instant he becomes the serjeant's care,\nHis pupil, and his torment, and his jest;\nHis awkward gait, his introverted toes,\nBent knees, round shoulders, and dejected looks,\nProcure him many a curse.  By slow degrees,\nUnapt to learn and formed of stubborn stuff,\nHe yet by slow degrees puts off himself,\nGrows conscious of a change, and likes it well.\nHe stands erect, his slouch becomes a walk,\nHe steps right onward, martial in his air,\nHis form and movement; is as smart above\nAs meal and larded locks can make him:  wears\nHis hat or his plumed helmet with a grace,\nAnd, his three years of heroship expired,\nReturns indignant to the slighted plough.\nHe hates the field in which no fife or drum\nAttends him, drives his cattle to a march,\nAnd sighs for the smart comrades he has left.\n'Twere well if his exterior change were all--\nBut with his clumsy port the wretch has lost\nHis ignorance and harmless manners too.\nTo swear, to game, to drink, to show at home\nBy lewdness, idleness, and Sabbath-breach,\nThe great proficiency he made abroad,\nTo astonish and to grieve his gazing friends,\nTo break some maiden's and his mother's heart,\nTo be a pest where he was useful once,\nAre his sole aim, and all his glory now!\nMan in society is like a flower\nBlown in its native bed.  'Tis there alone\nHis faculties expanded in full bloom\nShine out, there only reach their proper use.\nBut man associated and leagued with man\nBy regal warrant, or self-joined by bond\nFor interest sake, or swarming into clans\nBeneath one head for purposes of war,\nLike flowers selected from the rest, and bound\nAnd bundled close to fill some crowded vase,\nFades rapidly, and by compression marred\nContracts defilement not to be endured.\nHence chartered boroughs are such public plagues,\nAnd burghers, men immaculate perhaps\nIn all their private functions, once combined,\nBecome a loathsome body, only fit\nFor dissolution, hurtful to the main.\nHence merchants, unimpeachable of sin\nAgainst the charities of domestic life,\nIncorporated, seem at once to lose\nTheir nature, and, disclaiming all regard\nFor mercy and the common rights of man,\nBuild factories with blood, conducting trade\nAt the sword's point, and dyeing the white robe\nOf innocent commercial justice red.\nHence too the field of glory, as the world\nMisdeems it, dazzled by its bright array,\nWith all the majesty of thundering pomp,\nEnchanting music and immortal wreaths,\nIs but a school where thoughtlessness is taught\nOn principle, where foppery atones\nFor folly, gallantry for every vice.\n\nBut slighted as it is, and by the great\nAbandoned, and, which still I more regret,\nInfected with the manners and the modes\nIt knew not once, the country wins me still.\nI never framed a wish or formed a plan\nThat flattered me with hopes of earthly bliss,\nBut there I laid the scene.  There early strayed\nMy fancy, ere yet liberty of choice\nHad found me, or the hope of being free.\nMy very dreams were rural, rural too\nThe first-born efforts of my youthful muse,\nSportive, and jingling her poetic bells\nEre yet her ear was mistress of their powers.\nNo bard could please me but whose lyre was tuned\nTo Nature's praises.  Heroes and their feats\nFatigued me, never weary of the pipe\nOf Tityrus, assembling as he sang\nThe rustic throng beneath his favourite beech.\nThen Milton had indeed a poet's charms:\nNew to my taste, his Paradise surpassed\nThe struggling efforts of my boyish tongue\nTo speak its excellence; I danced for joy.\nI marvelled much that, at so ripe an age\nAs twice seven years, his beauties had then first\nEngaged my wonder, and admiring still,\nAnd still admiring, with regret supposed\nThe joy half lost because not sooner found.\nThee, too, enamoured of the life I loved,\nPathetic in its praise, in its pursuit\nDetermined, and possessing it at last\nWith transports such as favoured lovers feel,\nI studied, prized, and wished that I had known,\nIngenious Cowley:  and though now, reclaimed\nBy modern lights from an erroneous taste,\nI cannot but lament thy splendid wit\nEntangled in the cobwebs of the schools.\nI still revere thee, courtly though retired,\nThough stretched at ease in Chertsey's silent bowers,\nNot unemployed, and finding rich amends\nFor a lost world in solitude and verse.\n'Tis born with all.  The love of Nature's works\nIs an ingredient in the compound, man,\nInfused at the creation of the kind.\nAnd though the Almighty Maker has throughout\nDiscriminated each from each, by strokes\nAnd touches of His hand, with so much art\nDiversified, that two were never found\nTwins at all points--yet this obtains in all,\nThat all discern a beauty in His works,\nAnd all can taste them:  minds that have been formed\nAnd tutored, with a relish more exact,\nBut none without some relish, none unmoved.\nIt is a flame that dies not even there,\nWhere nothing feeds it.  Neither business, crowds,\nNor habits of luxurious city life,\nWhatever else they smother of true worth\nIn human bosoms, quench it or abate.\nThe villas, with which London stands begirt\nLike a swarth Indian with his belt of beads,\nProve it.  A breath of unadulterate air,\nThe glimpse of a green pasture, how they cheer\nThe citizen, and brace his languid frame!\nEven in the stifling bosom of the town,\nA garden in which nothing thrives, has charms\nThat soothe the rich possessor; much consoled\nThat here and there some sprigs of mournful mint,\nOf nightshade, or valerian, grace the well\nHe cultivates.  These serve him with a hint\nThat Nature lives; that sight-refreshing green\nIs still the livery she delights to wear,\nThough sickly samples of the exuberant whole.\nWhat are the casements lined with creeping herbs,\nThe prouder sashes fronted with a range\nOf orange, myrtle, or the fragrant weed,\nThe Frenchman's darling? are they not all proofs\nThat man, immured in cities, still retains\nHis inborn inextinguishable thirst\nOf rural scenes, compensating his loss\nBy supplemental shifts, the best he may?\nThe most unfurnished with the means of life,\nAnd they that never pass their brick-wall bounds\nTo range the fields, and treat their lungs with air,\nYet feel the burning instinct:  over-head\nSuspend their crazy boxes planted thick\nAnd watered duly.  There the pitcher stands\nA fragment, and the spoutless tea-pot there;\nSad witnesses how close-pent man regrets\nThe country, with what ardour he contrives\nA peep at nature, when he can no more.\n\nHail, therefore, patroness of health and ease\nAnd contemplation, heart-consoling joys\nAnd harmless pleasures, in the thronged abode\nOf multitudes unknown, hail rural life!\nAddress himself who will to the pursuit\nOf honours, or emolument, or fame,\nI shall not add myself to such a chase,\nThwart his attempts, or envy his success.\nSome must be great.  Great offices will have\nGreat talents.  And God gives to every man\nThe virtue, temper, understanding, taste,\nThat lifts him into life, and lets him fall\nJust in the niche he was ordained to fill.\nTo the deliverer of an injured land\nHe gives a tongue to enlarge upon, a heart\nTo feel, and courage to redress her wrongs;\nTo monarchs dignity, to judges sense;\nTo artists ingenuity and skill;\nTo me an unambitious mind, content\nIn the low vale of life, that early felt\nA wish for ease and leisure, and ere long\nFound here that leisure and that ease I wished.\n\n\n\nBOOK V.\n\nTHE WINTER MORNING WALK.\n\n'Tis morning; and the sun, with ruddy orb\nAscending, fires the horizon; while the clouds,\nThat crowd away before the driving wind,\nMore ardent as the disk emerges more,\nResemble most some city in a blaze,\nSeen through the leafless wood.  His slanting ray\nSlides ineffectual down the snowy vale,\nAnd, tingeing all with his own rosy hue,\nFrom every herb and every spiry blade\nStretches a length of shadow o'er the field,\nMine, spindling into longitude immense,\nIn spite of gravity, and sage remark\nThat I myself am but a fleeting shade,\nProvokes me to a smile.  With eye askance\nI view the muscular proportioned limb\nTransformed to a lean shank; the shapeless pair,\nAs they designed to mock me, at my side\nTake step for step, and, as I near approach\nThe cottage, walk along the plastered wall,\nPreposterous sight, the legs without the man.\nThe verdure of the plain lies buried deep\nBeneath the dazzling deluge, and the bents\nAnd coarser grass upspearing o'er the rest,\nOf late unsightly and unseen, now shine\nConspicuous, and, in bright apparel clad,\nAnd fledged with icy feathers, nod superb.\nThe cattle mourn in corners, where the fence\nScreens them, and seem, half petrified, to sleep\nIn unrecumbent sadness.  There they wait\nTheir wonted fodder, not, like hungering man,\nFretful if unsupplied, but silent, meek,\nAnd patient of the slow-paced swain's delay.\nHe from the stack carves out the accustomed load,\nDeep-plunging, and again deep-plunging oft\nHis broad keen knife into the solid mass:\nSmooth as a wall the upright remnant stands,\nWith such undeviating and even force\nHe severs it away:  no needless care,\nLest storms should overset the leaning pile\nDeciduous, or its own unbalanced weight.\nForth goes the woodman, leaving unconcerned\nThe cheerful haunts of man, to wield the axe\nAnd drive the wedge in yonder forest drear,\nFrom morn to eve his solitary task.\nShaggy and lean and shrewd, with pointed ears\nAnd tail cropped short, half lurcher and half cur,\nHis dog attends him.  Close behind his heel\nNow creeps he slow, and now with many a frisk,\nWide-scampering, snatches up the drifted snow\nWith ivory teeth, or ploughs it with his snout;\nThen shakes his powdered coat and barks for joy.\nHeedless of all his pranks the sturdy churl\nMoves right toward the mark; nor stops for aught,\nBut now and then, with pressure of his thumb,\nTo adjust the fragrant charge of a short tube,\nThat fumes beneath his nose; the trailing cloud\nStreams far behind him, scenting all the air.\nNow from the roost, or from the neighbouring pale,\nWhere, diligent to catch the first faint gleam\nOf smiling day, they gossiped side by side,\nCome trooping at the housewife's well-known call\nThe feathered tribes domestic; half on wing,\nAnd half on foot, they brush the fleecy flood,\nConscious, and fearful of too deep a plunge.\nThe sparrows peep, and quit the sheltering eaves\nTo seize the fair occasion; well they eye\nThe scattered grain, and, thievishly resolved\nTo escape the impending famine, often scared\nAs oft return, a pert, voracious kind.\nClean riddance quickly made, one only care\nRemains to each, the search of sunny nook,\nOr shed impervious to the blast.  Resigned\nTo sad necessity the cock foregoes\nHis wonted strut, and, wading at their head\nWith well-considered steps, seems to resent\nHis altered gait, and stateliness retrenched.\nHow find the myriads, that in summer cheer\nThe hills and valleys with their ceaseless songs,\nDue sustenance, or where subsist they now?\nEarth yields them naught:  the imprisoned worm is safe\nBeneath the frozen clod; all seeds of herbs\nLie covered close, and berry-bearing thorns\nThat feed the thrush (whatever some suppose),\nAfford the smaller minstrel no supply.\nThe long-protracted rigour of the year\nThins all their numerous flocks.  In chinks and holes\nTen thousand seek an unmolested end,\nAs instinct prompts, self-buried ere they die.\nThe very rooks and daws forsake the fields,\nWhere neither grub nor root nor earth-nut now\nRepays their labour more; and perched aloft\nBy the way-side, or stalking in the path,\nLean pensioners upon the traveller's track,\nPick up their nauseous dole, though sweet to them,\nOf voided pulse, or half-digested grain.\nThe streams are lost amid the splendid blank,\nO'erwhelming all distinction.  On the flood\nIndurated and fixed the snowy weight\nLies undissolved, while silently beneath\nAnd unperceived the current steals away;\nNot so where, scornful of a check, it leaps\nThe mill-dam, dashes on the restless wheel,\nAnd wantons in the pebbly gulf below.\nNo frost can bind it there.  Its utmost force\nCan but arrest the light and smoky mist\nThat in its fall the liquid sheet throws wide.\nAnd see where it has hung the embroidered banks\nWith forms so various, that no powers of art,\nThe pencil, or the pen, may trace the scene!\nHere glittering turrets rise, upbearing high\n(Fantastic misarrangement) on the roof\nLarge growth of what may seem the sparkling trees\nAnd shrubs of fairy land.  The crystal drops\nThat trickle down the branches, fast congealed,\nShoot into pillars of pellucid length\nAnd prop the pile they but adorned before.\nHere grotto within grotto safe defies\nThe sunbeam.  There imbossed and fretted wild,\nThe growing wonder takes a thousand shapes\nCapricious, in which fancy seeks in vain\nThe likeness of some object seen before.\nThus nature works as if to mock at art,\nAnd in defiance of her rival powers;\nBy these fortuitous and random strokes\nPerforming such inimitable feats,\nAs she with all her rules can never reach.\nLess worthy of applause though more admired,\nBecause a novelty, the work of man,\nImperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ,\nThy most magnificent and mighty freak,\nThe wonder of the North.  No forest fell\nWhen thou wouldst build; no quarry sent its stores\nTo enrich thy walls; but thou didst hew the floods,\nAnd make thy marble of the glassy wave.\nIn such a palace Aristaeus found\nCyrene, when he bore the plaintive tale\nOf his lost bees to her maternal ear.\nIn such a palace poetry might place\nThe armoury of winter, where his troops,\nThe gloomy clouds, find weapons, arrowy sleet,\nSkin-piercing volley, blossom-bruising hail,\nAnd snow that often blinds the traveller's course,\nAnd wraps him in an unexpected tomb.\nSilently as a dream the fabric rose.\nNo sound of hammer or of saw was there.\nIce upon ice, the well-adjusted parts\nWere soon conjoined, nor other cement asked\nThan water interfused to make them one.\nLamps gracefully disposed, and of all hues,\nIllumined every side.  A watery light\nGleamed through the clear transparency, that seemed\nAnother moon new-risen, or meteor fallen\nFrom heaven to earth, of lambent flame serene.\nSo stood the brittle prodigy, though smooth\nAnd slippery the materials, yet frost-bound\nFirm as a rock.  Nor wanted aught within\nThat royal residence might well befit,\nFor grandeur or for use.  Long wavy wreaths\nOf flowers, that feared no enemy but warmth,\nBlushed on the panels.  Mirror needed none\nWhere all was vitreous, but in order due\nConvivial table and commodious seat\n(What seemed at least commodious seat) were there,\nSofa and couch and high-built throne august.\nThe same lubricity was found in all,\nAnd all was moist to the warm touch; a scene\nOf evanescent glory, once a stream,\nAnd soon to slide into a stream again.\nAlas, 'twas but a mortifying stroke\nOf undesigned severity, that glanced\n(Made by a monarch) on her own estate,\nOn human grandeur and the courts of kings\n'Twas transient in its nature, as in show\n'Twas durable; as worthless, as it seemed\nIntrinsically precious; to the foot\nTreacherous and false; it smiled, and it was cold.\n\nGreat princes have great playthings.  Some have played\nAt hewing mountains into men, and some\nAt building human wonders mountain high.\nSome have amused the dull sad years of life\n(Life spent in indolence, and therefore sad)\nWith schemes of monumental fame, and sought\nBy pyramids and mausoleum pomp,\nShort-lived themselves, to immortalise their bones.\nSome seek diversion in the tented field,\nAnd make the sorrows of mankind their sport.\nBut war's a game which, were their subjects wise,\nKings should not play at.  Nations would do well\nTo extort their truncheons from the puny hands\nOf heroes whose infirm and baby minds\nAre gratified with mischief, and who spoil,\nBecause men suffer it, their toy the world.\n\nWhen Babel was confounded, and the great\nConfederacy of projectors wild and vain\nWas split into diversity of tongues,\nThen, as a shepherd separates his flock,\nThese to the upland, to the valley those,\nGod drave asunder and assigned their lot\nTo all the nations.  Ample was the boon\nHe gave them, in its distribution fair\nAnd equal, and he bade them dwell in peace.\nPeace was a while their care.  They ploughed and sowed,\nAnd reaped their plenty without grudge or strife,\nBut violence can never longer sleep\nThan human passions please.  In every heart\nAre sown the sparks that kindle fiery war,\nOccasion needs but fan them, and they blaze.\nCain had already shed a brother's blood:\nThe Deluge washed it out; but left unquenched\nThe seeds of murder in the breast of man.\nSoon, by a righteous judgment, in the line\nOf his descending progeny was found\nThe first artificer of death; the shrewd\nContriver who first sweated at the forge,\nAnd forced the blunt and yet unblooded steel\nTo a keen edge, and made it bright for war.\nHim Tubal named, the Vulcan of old times,\nThe sword and falchion their inventor claim,\nAnd the first smith was the first murderer's son.\nHis art survived the waters; and ere long,\nWhen man was multiplied and spread abroad\nIn tribes and clans, and had begun to call\nThese meadows and that range of hills his own,\nThe tasted sweets of property begat\nDesire of more; and industry in some\nTo improve and cultivate their just demesne,\nMade others covet what they saw so fair.\nThus wars began on earth.  These fought for spoil,\nAnd those in self-defence.  Savage at first\nThe onset, and irregular.  At length\nOne eminent above the rest, for strength,\nFor stratagem, or courage, or for all,\nWas chosen leader.  Him they served in war,\nAnd him in peace for sake of warlike deeds\nReverenced no less.  Who could with him compare?\nOr who so worthy to control themselves\nAs he, whose prowess had subdued their foes?\nThus war, affording field for the display\nOf virtue, made one chief, whom times of peace,\nWhich have their exigencies too, and call\nFor skill in government, at length made king.\nKing was a name too proud for man to wear\nWith modesty and meekness, and the crown,\nSo dazzling in their eyes who set it on,\nWas sure to intoxicate the brows it bound.\nIt is the abject property of most,\nThat being parcel of the common mass,\nAnd destitute of means to raise themselves,\nThey sink and settle lower than they need.\nThey know not what it is to feel within\nA comprehensive faculty, that grasps\nGreat purposes with ease, that turns and wields,\nAlmost without an effort, plans too vast\nFor their conception, which they cannot move.\nConscious of impotence they soon grow drunk\nWith gazing, when they see an able man\nStep forth to notice; and besotted thus\nBuild him a pedestal and say--Stand there,\nAnd be our admiration and our praise.\nThey roll themselves before him in the dust,\nThen most deserving in their own account\nWhen most extravagant in his applause,\nAs if exalting him they raised themselves.\nThus by degrees, self-cheated of their sound\nAnd sober judgment that he is but man,\nThey demi-deify and fume him so\nThat in due season he forgets it too.\nInflated and astrut with self-conceit\nHe gulps the windy diet, and ere long,\nAdopting their mistake, profoundly thinks\nThe world was made in vain if not for him.\nThenceforth they are his cattle:  drudges, born\nTo bear his burdens, drawing in his gears,\nAnd sweating in his service.  His caprice\nBecomes the soul that animates them all.\nHe deems a thousand, or ten thousand lives,\nSpent in the purchase of renown for him\nAn easy reckoning, and they think the same.\nThus kings were first invented, and thus kings\nWere burnished into heroes, and became\nThe arbiters of this terraqueous swamp;\nStorks among frogs, that have but croaked and died.\nStrange that such folly, as lifts bloated man\nTo eminence fit only for a god,\nShould ever drivel out of human lips,\nEven in the cradled weakness of the world!\nStill stranger much, that when at length mankind\nHad reached the sinewy firmness of their youth,\nAnd could discriminate and argue well\nOn subjects more mysterious, they were yet\nBabes in the cause of freedom, and should fear\nAnd quake before the gods themselves had made.\nBut above measure strange, that neither proof\nOf sad experience, nor examples set\nBy some whose patriot virtue has prevailed,\nCan even now, when they are grown mature\nIn wisdom, and with philosophic deeps\nFamiliar, serve to emancipate the rest!\nSuch dupes are men to custom, and so prone\nTo reverence what is ancient, and can plead\nA course of long observance for its use,\nThat even servitude, the worst of ills,\nBecause delivered down from sire to son,\nIs kept and guarded as a sacred thing.\nBut is it fit, or can it bear the shock\nOf rational discussion, that a man,\nCompounded and made up like other men\nOf elements tumultuous, in whom lust\nAnd folly in as ample measure meet,\nAs in the bosoms of the slaves he rules,\nShould be a despot absolute, and boast\nHimself the only freeman of his land?\nShould when he pleases, and on whom he will,\nWage war, with any or with no pretence\nOf provocation given, or wrong sustained,\nAnd force the beggarly last doit, by means\nThat his own humour dictates, from the clutch\nOf poverty, that thus he may procure\nHis thousands, weary of penurious life,\nA splendid opportunity to die?\nSay ye, who (with less prudence than of old\nJotham ascribed to his assembled trees\nIn politic convention) put your trust\nI' th' shadow of a bramble, and recline\nIn fancied peace beneath his dangerous branch,\nRejoice in him and celebrate his sway,\nWhere find ye passive fortitude?  Whence springs\nYour self-denying zeal that holds it good\nTo stroke the prickly grievance, and to hang\nHis thorns with streamers of continual praise?\nWe too are friends to loyalty; we love\nThe king who loves the law, respects his bounds.\nAnd reigns content within them; him we serve\nFreely and with delight, who leaves us free;\nBut recollecting still that he is man,\nWe trust him not too far.  King though he be,\nAnd king in England, too, he may be weak\nAnd vain enough to be ambitious still,\nMay exercise amiss his proper powers,\nOr covet more than freemen choose to grant:\nBeyond that mark is treason.  He is ours,\nTo administer, to guard, to adorn the state,\nBut not to warp or change it.  We are his,\nTo serve him nobly in the common cause\nTrue to the death, but not to be his slaves.\nMark now the difference, ye that boast your love\nOf kings, between your loyalty and ours.\nWe love the man; the paltry pageant you:\nWe the chief patron of the commonwealth;\nYou the regardless author of its woes:\nWe, for the sake of liberty, a king;\nYou chains and bondage for a tyrant's sake.\n\nOur love is principle, and has its root\nIn reason, is judicious, manly, free;\nYours, a blind instinct, crouches to the rod,\nAnd licks the foot that treads it in the dust.\nWere kingship as true treasure as it seems,\nSterling, and worthy of a wise man's wish,\nI would not be a king to be beloved\nCauseless, and daubed with undiscerning praise,\nWhere love is more attachment to the throne,\nNot to the man who fills it as he ought.\n\nWhose freedom is by sufferance, and at will\nOf a superior, he is never free.\nWho lives, and is not weary of a life\nExposed to manacles, deserves them well.\nThe state that strives for liberty, though foiled\nAnd forced to abandon what she bravely sought,\nDeserves at least applause for her attempt,\nAnd pity for her loss.  But that's a cause\nNot often unsuccessful; power usurped\nIs weakness when opposed; conscious of wrong,\n'Tis pusillanimous and prone to flight.\nBut slaves that once conceive the glowing thought\nOf freedom, in that hope itself possess\nAll that the contest calls for; spirit, strength,\nThe scorn of danger, and united hearts,\nThe surest presage of the good they seek. *\n\n* The author hopes that he shall not be censured for unnecessary warmth\nupon so interesting a subject.  He is aware that it is become almost\nfashionable to stigmatise such sentiments as no better than empty\ndeclamation.  But it is an ill symptom, and peculiar to modern times.--C.\n\nThen shame to manhood, and opprobrious more\nTo France than all her losses and defeats,\nOld or of later date, by sea or land,\nHer house of bondage worse than that of old\nWhich God avenged on Pharaoh--the Bastille!\nYe horrid towers, the abode of broken hearts,\nYe dungeons and ye cages of despair,\nThat monarchs have supplied from age to age\nWith music such as suits their sovereign ears,\nThe sighs and groans of miserable men!\nThere's not an English heart that would not leap\nTo hear that ye were fallen at last, to know\nThat even our enemies, so oft employed\nIn forging chains for us, themselves were free.\nFor he that values liberty, confines\nHis zeal for her predominance within\nNo narrow bounds; her cause engages him\nWherever pleaded.  'Tis the cause of man.\nThere dwell the most forlorn of humankind,\nImmured though unaccused, condemned untried,\nCruelly spared, and hopeless of escape.\nThere, like the visionary emblem seen\nBy him of Babylon, life stands a stump,\nAnd filleted about with hoops of brass,\nStill lives, though all its pleasant boughs are gone.\nTo count the hour bell and expect no change;\nAnd ever as the sullen sound is heard,\nStill to reflect that though a joyless note\nTo him whose moments all have one dull pace,\nTen thousand rovers in the world at large\nAccount it music; that it summons some\nTo theatre, or jocund feast, or ball;\nThe wearied hireling finds it a release\nFrom labour, and the lover, that has chid\nIts long delay, feels every welcome stroke\nUpon his heart-strings trembling with delight;--\nTo fly for refuge from distracting thought\nTo such amusements as ingenious woe\nContrives, hard-shifting and without her tools;--\nTo read engraven on the mouldy walls,\nIn staggering types, his predecessor's tale,\nA sad memorial, and subjoin his own;--\nTo turn purveyor to an overgorged\nAnd bloated spider, till the pampered pest\nIs made familiar, watches his approach,\nComes at his call, and serves him for a friend;--\nTo wear out time in numbering to and fro\nThe studs that thick emboss his iron door,\nThen downward and then upward, then aslant\nAnd then alternate, with a sickly hope\nBy dint of change to give his tasteless task\nSome relish, till the sum, exactly found\nIn all directions, he begins again:--\nOh comfortless existence! hemmed around\nWith woes, which who that suffers would not kneel\nAnd beg for exile, or the pangs of death?\nThat man should thus encroach on fellow-man,\nAbridge him of his just and native rights,\nEradicate him, tear him from his hold\nUpon the endearments of domestic life\nAnd social, nip his fruitfulness and use,\nAnd doom him for perhaps a heedless word\nTo barrenness and solitude and tears,\nMoves indignation; makes the name of king\n(Of king whom such prerogative can please)\nAs dreadful as the Manichean god,\nAdored through fear, strong only to destroy.\n\n'Tis liberty alone that gives the flower\nOf fleeting life its lustre and perfume,\nAnd we are weeds without it.  All constraint,\nExcept what wisdom lays on evil men,\nIs evil; hurts the faculties, impedes\nTheir progress in the road of science; blinds\nThe eyesight of discovery, and begets,\nIn those that suffer it, a sordid mind\nBestial, a meagre intellect, unfit\nTo be the tenant of man's noble form.\nThee therefore still, blameworthy as thou art,\nWith all thy loss of empire, and though squeezed\nBy public exigence, till annual food\nFails for the craving hunger of the state,\nThee I account still happy, and the chief\nAmong the nations, seeing thou art free,\nMy native nook of earth!  Thy clime is rude,\nReplete with vapours, and disposes much\nAll hearts to sadness, and none more than mine;\nThine unadulterate manners are less soft\nAnd plausible than social life requires.\nAnd thou hast need of discipline and art\nTo give thee what politer France receives\nFrom Nature's bounty--that humane address\nAnd sweetness, without which no pleasure is\nIn converse, either starved by cold reserve,\nOr flushed with fierce dispute, a senseless brawl;\nYet, being free, I love thee; for the sake\nOf that one feature, can be well content,\nDisgraced as thou hast been, poor as thou art,\nTo seek no sublunary rest beside.\nBut once enslaved, farewell! I could endure\nChains nowhere patiently; and chains at home,\nWhere I am free by birthright, not at all.\nThen what were left of roughness in the grain\nOf British natures, wanting its excuse\nThat it belongs to freemen, would disgust\nAnd shock me.  I should then with double pain\nFeel all the rigour of thy fickle clime;\nAnd, if I must bewail the blessing lost\nFor which our Hampdens and our Sidneys bled,\nI would at least bewail it under skies\nMilder, among a people less austere,\nIn scenes which, having never known me free,\nWould not reproach me with the loss I felt.\nDo I forebode impossible events,\nAnd tremble at vain dreams?  Heaven grant I may,\nBut the age of virtuous politics is past,\nAnd we are deep in that of cold pretence.\nPatriots are grown too shrewd to be sincere,\nAnd we too wise to trust them.  He that takes\nDeep in his soft credulity the stamp\nDesigned by loud declaimers on the part\nOf liberty, themselves the slaves of lust,\nIncurs derision for his easy faith\nAnd lack of knowledge, and with cause enough.\nFor when was public virtue to be found,\nWhere private was not?  Can he love the whole\nWho loves no part? he be a nation's friend\nWho is, in truth, the friend of no man there?\nCan he be strenuous in his country's cause,\nWho slights the charities for whose dear sake\nThat country, if at all, must be beloved?\n--'Tis therefore sober and good men are sad\nFor England's glory, seeing it wax pale\nAnd sickly, while her champions wear their hearts\nSo loose to private duty, that no brain,\nHealthful and undisturbed by factious fumes,\nCan dream them trusty to the general weal.\nSuch were not they of old whose tempered blades\nDispersed the shackles of usurped control,\nAnd hewed them link from link.  Then Albion's sons\nWere sons indeed.  They felt a filial heart\nBeat high within them at a mother's wrongs,\nAnd shining each in his domestic sphere,\nShone brighter still once called to public view.\n'Tis therefore many, whose sequestered lot\nForbids their interference, looking on,\nAnticipate perforce some dire event;\nAnd seeing the old castle of the state,\nThat promised once more firmness, so assailed\nThat all its tempest-beaten turrets shake,\nStand motionless expectants of its fall.\nAll has its date below.  The fatal hour\nWas registered in heaven ere time began.\nWe turn to dust, and all our mightiest works\nDie too.  The deep foundations that we lay,\nTime ploughs them up, and not a trace remains.\nWe build with what we deem eternal rock;\nA distant age asks where the fabric stood;\nAnd in the dust, sifted and searched in vain,\nThe undiscoverable secret sleeps.\n\nBut there is yet a liberty unsung\nBy poets, and by senators unpraised,\nWhich monarchs cannot grant, nor all the power\nOf earth and hell confederate take away;\nA liberty, which persecution, fraud,\nOppression, prisons, have no power to bind,\nWhich whoso tastes can be enslaved no more:\n'Tis liberty of heart, derived from heaven,\nBought with His blood who gave it to mankind,\nAnd sealed with the same token.  It is held\nBy charter, and that charter sanctioned sure\nBy the unimpeachable and awful oath\nAnd promise of a God.  His other gifts\nAll bear the royal stamp that speaks them His,\nAnd are august, but this transcends them all.\nHis other works, this visible display\nOf all-creating energy and might,\nAre grand, no doubt, and worthy of the Word\nThat, finding an interminable space\nUnoccupied, has filled the void so well,\nAnd made so sparkling what was dark before.\nBut these are not His glory.  Man, 'tis true,\nSmit with the beauty of so fair a scene,\nMight well suppose the Artificer Divine\nMeant it eternal, had He not Himself\nPronounced it transient, glorious as it is,\nAnd still designing a more glorious far,\nDoomed it, as insufficient for His praise.\nThese, therefore, are occasional, and pass;\nFormed for the confutation of the fool\nWhose lying heart disputes against a God;\nThat office served, they must be swept away.\nNot so the labours of His love; they shine\nIn other heavens than these that we behold,\nAnd fade not.  There is Paradise that fears\nNo forfeiture, and of its fruits He sends\nLarge prelibation oft to saints below.\nOf these the first in order, and the pledge\nAnd confident assurance of the rest,\nIs liberty; a flight into His arms\nEre yet mortality's fine threads give way,\nA clear escape from tyrannising lust,\nAnd fill immunity from penal woe.\n\nChains are the portion of revolted man,\nStripes and a dungeon; and his body serves\nThe triple purpose.  In that sickly, foul,\nOpprobrious residence, he finds them all.\nPropense his heart to idols, he is held\nIn silly dotage on created things\nCareless of their Creator.  And that low\nAnd sordid gravitation of his powers\nTo a vile clod, so draws him with such force\nResistless from the centre he should seek,\nThat he at last forgets it.  All his hopes\nTend downward, his ambition is to sink,\nTo reach a depth profounder still, and still\nProfounder, in the fathomless abyss\nOf folly, plunging in pursuit of death.\nBut ere he gain the comfortless repose\nHe seeks, and acquiescence of his soul,\nIn heaven renouncing exile, he endures\nWhat does he not? from lusts opposed in vain,\nAnd self-reproaching conscience.  He foresees\nThe fatal issue to his health, fame, peace,\nFortune, and dignity; the loss of all\nThat can ennoble man, and make frail life,\nShort as it is, supportable.  Still worse,\nFar worse than all the plagues with which his sins\nInfect his happiest moments, he forebodes\nAges of hopeless misery; future death,\nAnd death still future; not a hasty stroke,\nLike that which sends him to the dusty grave,\nBut unrepealable enduring death.\nScripture is still a trumpet to his fears:\nWhat none can prove a forgery, may be true;\nWhat none but bad men wish exploded, must.\nThat scruple checks him.  Riot is not loud\nNor drunk enough to drown it.  In the midst\nOf laughter his compunctions are sincere,\nAnd he abhors the jest by which he shines.\nRemorse begets reform.  His master-lust\nFalls first before his resolute rebuke,\nAnd seems dethroned and vanquished.  Peace ensues,\nBut spurious and short-lived, the puny child\nOf self-congratulating Pride, begot\nOn fancied Innocence.  Again he falls,\nAnd fights again; but finds his best essay,\nA presage ominous, portending still\nIts own dishonour by a worse relapse,\nTill Nature, unavailing Nature, foiled\nSo oft, and wearied in the vain attempt,\nScoffs at her own performance.  Reason now\nTakes part with appetite, and pleads the cause,\nPerversely, which of late she so condemned;\nWith shallow shifts and old devices, worn\nAnd tattered in the service of debauch,\nCovering his shame from his offended sight.\n\n\"Hath God indeed given appetites to man,\nAnd stored the earth so plenteously with means\nTo gratify the hunger of His wish,\nAnd doth He reprobate and will He damn\nThe use of His own bounty? making first\nSo frail a kind, and then enacting laws\nSo strict, that less than perfect must despair?\nFalsehood! which whoso but suspects of truth,\nDishonours God, and makes a slave of man.\nDo they themselves, who undertake for hire\nThe teacher's office, and dispense at large\nTheir weekly dole of edifying strains,\nAttend to their own music? have they faith\nIn what, with such solemnity of tone\nAnd gesture, they propound to our belief?\nNay--conduct hath the loudest tongue.  The voice\nIs but an instrument on which the priest\nMay play what tune he pleases.  In the deed,\nThe unequivocal authentic deed,\nWe find sound argument, we read the heart.\"\n\nSuch reasonings (if that name must needs belong\nTo excuses in which reason has no part)\nServe to compose a spirit well inclined\nTo live on terms of amity with vice,\nAnd sin without disturbance.  Often urged\n(As often as, libidinous discourse\nExhausted, he resorts to solemn themes\nOf theological and grave import),\nThey gain at last his unreserved assent,\nTill, hardened his heart's temper in the forge\nOf lust and on the anvil of despair,\nHe slights the strokes of conscience.  Nothing moves,\nOr nothing much, his constancy in ill;\nVain tampering has but fostered his disease,\n'Tis desperate, and he sleeps the sleep of death.\nHaste now, philosopher, and set him free.\nCharm the deaf serpent wisely.  Make him hear\nOf rectitude and fitness:  moral truth\nHow lovely, and the moral sense how sure,\nConsulted and obeyed, to guide his steps\nDirectly to the FIRST AND ONLY FAIR.\nSpare not in such a cause.  Spend all the powers\nOf rant and rhapsody in virtue's praise,\nBe most sublimely good, verbosely grand,\nAnd with poetic trappings grace thy prose\nTill it outmantle all the pride of verse.--\nAh, tinkling cymbal and high-sounding brass\nSmitten in vain! such music cannot charm\nThe eclipse that intercepts truth's heavenly beam,\nAnd chills and darkens a wide-wandering soul.\nThe still small voice is wanted.  He must speak,\nWhose word leaps forth at once to its effect,\nWho calls for things that are not, and they come.\n\nGrace makes the slave a freeman.  'Tis a change\nThat turns to ridicule the turgid speech\nAnd stately tone of moralists, who boast,\nAs if, like him of fabulous renown,\nThey had indeed ability to smooth\nThe shag of savage nature, and were each\nAn Orpheus and omnipotent in song.\nBut transformation of apostate man\nFrom fool to wise, from earthly to divine,\nIs work for Him that made him.  He alone,\nAnd He, by means in philosophic eyes\nTrivial and worthy of disdain, achieves\nThe wonder; humanising what is brute\nIn the lost kind, extracting from the lips\nOf asps their venom, overpowering strength\nBy weakness, and hostility by love.\n\nPatriots have toiled, and in their country's cause\nBled nobly, and their deeds, as they deserve,\nReceive proud recompense.  We give in charge\nTheir names to the sweet lyre.  The historic muse,\nProud of the treasure, marches with it down\nTo latest times; and sculpture, in her turn,\nGives bond in stone and ever-during brass,\nTo guard them, and to immortalise her trust.\nBut fairer wreaths are due, though never paid,\nTo those who, posted at the shrine of truth,\nHave fallen in her defence.  A patriot's blood\nWell spent in such a strife may earn indeed,\nAnd for a time ensure to his loved land,\nThe sweets of liberty and equal laws;\nBut martyrs struggle for a brighter prize,\nAnd win it with more pain.  Their blood is shed\nIn confirmation of the noblest claim,\nOur claim to feed upon immortal truth,\nTo walk with God, to be divinely free,\nTo soar, and to anticipate the skies!\nYet few remember them.  They lived unknown,\nTill persecution dragged them into fame\nAnd chased them up to heaven.  Their ashes flew\n--No marble tells us whither.  With their names\nNo bard embalms and sanctifies his song,\nAnd history, so warm on meaner themes,\nIs cold on this.  She execrates indeed\nThe tyranny that doomed them to the fire,\nBut gives the glorious sufferers little praise.\n\nHe is the freeman whom the truth makes free,\nAnd all are slaves beside.  There's not a chain\nThat hellish foes confederate for his harm\nCan wind around him, but he casts it off\nWith as much ease as Samson his green withes.\nHe looks abroad into the varied field\nOf Nature, and, though poor perhaps compared\nWith those whose mansions glitter in his sight,\nCalls the delightful scenery all his own.\nHis are the mountains, and the valleys his,\nAnd the resplendent river's.  His to enjoy\nWith a propriety that none can feel,\nBut who, with filial confidence inspired,\nCan lift to heaven an unpresumptuous eye,\nAnd smiling say--My Father made them all!\nAre they not his by a peculiar right,\nAnd by an emphasis of interest his,\nWhose eye they fill with tears of holy joy,\nWhose heart with praise, and whose exalted mind\nWith worthy thoughts of that unwearied love\nThat planned, and built, and still upholds a world\nSo clothed with beauty, for rebellious man?\nYes--ye may fill your garners, ye that reap\nThe loaded soil, and ye may waste much good\nIn senseless riot; but ye will not find\nIn feast or in the chase, in song or dance,\nA liberty like his, who, unimpeached\nOf usurpation, and to no man's wrong,\nAppropriates nature as his Father's work,\nAnd has a richer use of yours, than you.\nHe is indeed a freeman.  Free by birth\nOf no mean city, planned or e'er the hills\nWere built, the fountains opened, or the sea\nWith all his roaring multitude of waves.\nHis freedom is the same in every state;\nAnd no condition of this changeful life\nSo manifold in cares, whose every day\nBrings its own evil with it, makes it less.\nFor he has wings that neither sickness, pain,\nNor penury, can cripple or confine.\nNo nook so narrow but he spreads them there\nWith ease, and is at large.  The oppressor holds\nHis body bound, but knows not what a range\nHis spirit takes, unconscious of a chain;\nAnd that to bind him is a vain attempt,\nWhom God delights in, and in whom He dwells.\n\nAcquaint thyself with God if thou wouldst taste\nHis works.  Admitted once to His embrace,\nThou shalt perceive that thou wast blind before;\nThine eye shall be instructed, and thine heart,\nMade pure, shall relish, with divine delight\nTill then unfelt, what hands divine have wrought.\nBrutes graze the mountain-top with faces prone,\nAnd eyes intent upon the scanty herb\nIt yields them; or, recumbent on its brow,\nRuminate, heedless of the scene outspread\nBeneath, beyond, and stretching far away\nFrom inland regions to the distant main.\nMan views it and admires, but rests content\nWith what he views.  The landscape has his praise,\nBut not its Author.  Unconcerned who formed\nThe paradise he sees, he finds it such,\nAnd such well pleased to find it, asks no more.\nNot so the mind that has been touched from heaven,\nAnd in the school of sacred wisdom taught\nTo read His wonders, in whose thought the world,\nFair as it is, existed ere it was.\nNor for its own sake merely, but for His\nMuch more who fashioned it, he gives it praise;\nPraise that from earth resulting as it ought\nTo earth's acknowledged Sovereign, finds at once\nIts only just proprietor in Him.\nThe soul that sees Him, or receives sublimed\nNew faculties or learns at least to employ\nMore worthily the powers she owned before;\nDiscerns in all things what, with stupid gaze\nOf ignorance, till then she overlooked,\nA ray of heavenly light gilding all forms\nTerrestrial, in the vast and the minute\nThe unambiguous footsteps of the God\nWho gives its lustre to an insect's wing\nAnd wheels His throne upon the rolling worlds.\nMuch conversant with heaven, she often holds\nWith those fair ministers of light to man\nThat fill the skies nightly with silent pomp\nSweet conference; inquires what strains were they\nWith which heaven rang, when every star, in haste\nTo gratulate the new-created earth,\nSent forth a voice, and all the sons of God\nShouted for joy.--\"Tell me, ye shining hosts\nThat navigate a sea that knows no storms,\nBeneath a vault unsullied with a cloud,\nIf from your elevation, whence ye view\nDistinctly scenes invisible to man\nAnd systems of whose birth no tidings yet\nHave reached this nether world, ye spy a race\nFavoured as ours, transgressors from the womb\nAnd hasting to a grave, yet doomed to rise\nAnd to possess a brighter heaven than yours?\nAs one who, long detained on foreign shores,\nPants to return, and when he sees afar\nHis country's weather-bleached and battered rocks,\nFrom the green wave emerging, darts an eye\nRadiant with joy towards the happy land;\nSo I with animated hopes behold,\nAnd many an aching wish, your beamy fires,\nThat show like beacons in the blue abyss,\nOrdained to guide the embodied spirit home\nFrom toilsome life to never-ending rest.\nLove kindles as I gaze.  I feel desires\nThat give assurance of their own success,\nAnd that, infused from heaven, must thither tend.\"\n\nSo reads he Nature whom the lamp of truth\nIlluminates.  Thy lamp, mysterious Word!\nWhich whoso sees, no longer wanders lost\nWith intellect bemazed in endless doubt,\nBut runs the road of wisdom.  Thou hast built,\nWith means that were not till by Thee employed,\nWorlds that had never been, hadst Thou in strength\nBeen less, or less benevolent than strong.\nThey are Thy witnesses, who speak Thy power\nAnd goodness infinite, but speak in ears\nThat hear not, or receive not their report.\nIn vain Thy creatures testify of Thee\nTill Thou proclaim Thyself.  Theirs is indeed\nA teaching voice; but 'tis the praise of Thine\nThat whom it teaches it makes prompt to learn,\nAnd with the boon gives talents for its use.\nTill Thou art heard, imaginations vain\nPossess the heart, and fables, false as hell,\nYet deemed oracular, lure down to death\nThe uninformed and heedless souls of men.\nWe give to chance, blind chance, ourselves as blind,\nThe glory of Thy work, which yet appears\nPerfect and unimpeachable of blame,\nChallenging human scrutiny, and proved\nThen skilful most when most severely judged.\nBut chance is not; or is not where Thou reign'st:\nThy providence forbids that fickle power\n(If power she be that works but to confound)\nTo mix her wild vagaries with Thy laws.\nYet thus we dote, refusing, while we can,\nInstruction, and inventing to ourselves\nGods such as guilt makes welcome--gods that sleep,\nOr disregard our follies, or that sit\nAmused spectators of this bustling stage.\nThee we reject, unable to abide\nThy purity, till pure as Thou art pure,\nMade such by Thee, we love Thee for that cause\nFor which we shunned and hated Thee before.\nThen we are free:  then liberty, like day,\nBreaks on the soul, and by a flash from heaven\nFires all the faculties with glorious joy.\nA voice is heard that mortal ears hear not\nTill Thou hast touched them; 'tis the voice of song,\nA loud Hosanna sent from all Thy works,\nWhich he that hears it with a shout repeats,\nAnd adds his rapture to the general praise.\nIn that blest moment, Nature, throwing wide\nHer veil opaque, discloses with a smile\nThe Author of her beauties, who, retired\nBehind His own creation, works unseen\nBy the impure, and hears His power denied.\nThou art the source and centre of all minds,\nTheir only point of rest, eternal Word!\nFrom Thee departing, they are lost and rove\nAt random, without honour, hope, or peace.\nFrom Thee is all that soothes the life of man,\nHis high endeavour, and his glad success,\nHis strength to suffer, and his will to serve.\nBut, oh, Thou Bounteous Giver of all good,\nThou art of all Thy gifts Thyself the crown!\nGive what Thou canst, without Thee we are poor,\nAnd with Thee rich, take what Thou wilt away.\n\n\n\nBOOK VI.\n\nTHE WINTER WALK AT NOON.\n\nThere is in souls a sympathy with sounds,\nAnd as the mind is pitched the ear is pleased\nWith melting airs or martial, brisk or grave;\nSome chord in unison with what we hear\nIs touched within us, and the heart replies.\nHow soft the music of those village bells\nFalling at intervals upon the ear\nIn cadence sweet, now dying all away,\nNow pealing loud again, and louder still,\nClear and sonorous as the gale comes on.\nWith easy force it opens all the cells\nWhere memory slept.  Wherever I have heard\nA kindred melody, the scene recurs,\nAnd with it all its pleasures and its pains.\nSuch comprehensive views the spirit takes,\nThat in a few short moments I retrace\n(As in a map the voyager his course)\nThe windings of my way through many years.\nShort as in retrospect the journey seems,\nIt seemed not always short; the rugged path,\nAnd prospect oft so dreary and forlorn,\nMoved many a sigh at its disheartening length.\nYet feeling present evils, while the past\nFaintly impress the mind, or not at all,\nHow readily we wish time spent revoked,\nThat we might try the ground again, where once\n(Through inexperience as we now perceive)\nWe missed that happiness we might have found.\nSome friend is gone, perhaps his son's best friend\nA father, whose authority, in show\nWhen most severe, and mustering all its force,\nWas but the graver countenance of love;\nWhose favour, like the clouds of spring, might lower,\nAnd utter now and then an awful voice,\nBut had a blessing in its darkest frown,\nThreatening at once and nourishing the plant.\nWe loved, but not enough, the gentle hand\nThat reared us.  At a thoughtless age allured\nBy every gilded folly, we renounced\nHis sheltering side, and wilfully forewent\nThat converse which we now in vain regret.\nHow gladly would the man recall to life\nThe boy's neglected sire! a mother too,\nThat softer friend, perhaps more gladly still,\nMight he demand them at the gates of death.\nSorrow has since they went subdued and tamed\nThe playful humour; he could now endure\n(Himself grown sober in the vale of tears)\nAnd feel a parent's presence no restraint.\nBut not to understand a treasure's worth\nTill time has stolen away the slighted good,\nIs cause of half the poverty we feel,\nAnd makes the world the wilderness it is.\nThe few that pray at all, pray oft amiss,\nAnd, seeking grace to improve the prize they hold,\nWould urge a wiser suit than asking more.\n\nThe night was winter in his roughest mood,\nThe morning sharp and clear; but now at noon\nUpon the southern side of the slant hills,\nAnd where the woods fence off the northern blast,\nThe season smiles, resigning all its rage,\nAnd has the warmth of May.  The vault is blue\nWithout a cloud, and white without a speck\nThe dazzling splendour of the scene below.\nAgain the harmony comes o'er the vale,\nAnd through the trees I view the embattled tower\nWhence all the music.  I again perceive\nThe soothing influence of the wafted strains,\nAnd settle in soft musings, as I tread\nThe walk still verdant under oaks and elms,\nWhose outspread branches overarch the glade.\nThe roof, though movable through all its length,\nAs the wind sways it, has yet well sufficed,\nAnd, intercepting in their silent fall\nThe frequent flakes, has kept a path for me.\nNo noise is here, or none that hinders thought:\nThe redbreast warbles still, but is content\nWith slender notes and more than half suppressed.\nPleased with his solitude, and flitting light\nFrom spray to spray, where'er he rests he shakes\nFrom many a twig the pendant drops of ice,\nThat tinkle in the withered leaves below.\nStillness, accompanied with sounds so soft,\nCharms more than silence.  Meditation here\nMay think down hours to moments.  Here the heart\nMay give an useful lesson to the head,\nAnd learning wiser grow without his books.\nKnowledge and wisdom, far from being one,\nHave ofttimes no connection.  Knowledge dwells\nIn heads replete with thoughts of other men;\nWisdom in minds attentive to their own.\nKnowledge, a rude unprofitable mass,\nThe mere materials with which wisdom builds,\nTill smoothed and squared and fitted to its place,\nDoes but encumber whom it seems to enrich.\nKnowledge is proud that he has learned so much,\nWisdom is humble that he knows no more.\nBooks are not seldom talismans and spells\nBy which the magic art of shrewder wits\nHolds an unthinking multitude enthralled.\nSome to the fascination of a name\nSurrender judgment hoodwinked.  Some the style\nInfatuates, and, through labyrinths and wilds\nOf error, leads them by a tune entranced.\nWhile sloth seduces more, too weak to bear\nThe insupportable fatigue of thought,\nAnd swallowing therefore without pause or choice\nThe total grist unsifted, husks and all.\nBut trees, and rivulets whose rapid course\nDefies the check of winter, haunts of deer,\nAnd sheep-walks populous with bleating lambs,\nAnd lanes, in which the primrose ere her time\nPeeps through the moss that clothes the hawthorn root,\nDeceive no student.  Wisdom there, and truth,\nNot shy as in the world, and to be won\nBy slow solicitation, seize at once\nThe roving thought, and fix it on themselves.\n\nWhat prodigies can power divine perform\nMore grand than it produces year by year,\nAnd all in sight of inattentive man?\nFamiliar with the effect we slight the cause,\nAnd in the constancy of Nature's course,\nThe regular return of genial months,\nAnd renovation of a faded world,\nSee nought to wonder at.  Should God again,\nAs once in Gibeon, interrupt the race\nOf the undeviating and punctual sun,\nHow would the world admire! but speaks it less\nAn agency divine, to make him know\nHis moment when to sink and when to rise\nAge after age, than to arrest his course?\nAll we behold is miracle:  but, seen\nSo duly, all is miracle in vain.\nWhere now the vital energy that moved,\nWhile summer was, the pure and subtle lymph\nThrough the imperceptible meandering veins\nOf leaf and flower?  It sleeps:  and the icy touch\nOf unprolific winter has impressed\nA cold stagnation on the intestine tide.\nBut let the months go round, a few short months,\nAnd all shall be restored.  These naked shoots,\nBarren as lances, among which the wind\nMakes wintry music, sighing as it goes,\nShall put their graceful foliage on again,\nAnd more aspiring and with ampler spread\nShall boast new charms, and more than they have lost.\nThen, each in its peculiar honours clad,\nShall publish even to the distant eye\nIts family and tribe.  Laburnum rich\nIn streaming gold; syringa ivory pure;\nThe scented and the scentless rose; this red\nAnd of a humbler growth, the other tall,\nAnd throwing up into the darkest gloom\nOf neighbouring cypress, or more sable yew,\nHer silver globes, light as the foamy surf\nThat the wind severs from the broken wave;\nThe lilac various in array, now white,\nNow sanguine, and her beauteous head now set\nWith purple spikes pyramidal, as if\nStudious of ornament, yet unresolved\nWhich hue she most approved, she chose them all;\nCopious of flowers the woodbine, pale and wan,\nBut well compensating their sickly looks\nWith never-cloying odours, early and late;\nHypericum all bloom, so thick a swarm\nOf flowers like flies, clothing her slender rods,\nThat scarce a leaf appears; mezereon too,\nThough leafless, well attired, and thick beset\nWith blushing wreaths investing every spray;\nAlthaea with the purple eye; the broom,\nYellow and bright as bullion unalloyed\nHer blossoms; and luxuriant above all\nThe jasmine, throwing wide her elegant sweets,\nThe deep dark green of whose unvarnished leaf\nMakes more conspicuous, and illumines more\nThe bright profusion of her scattered stars.--\nThese have been, and these shall be in their day,\nAnd all this uniform uncoloured scene\nShall be dismantled of its fleecy load,\nAnd flush into variety again.\nFrom dearth to plenty, and from death to life,\nIs Nature's progress when she lectures man\nIn heavenly truth; evincing, as she makes\nThe grand transition, that there lives and works\nA soul in all things, and that soul is God.\nThe beauties of the wilderness are His,\nThat make so gay the solitary place\nWhere no eye sees them.  And the fairer forms\nThat cultivation glories in, are His.\nHe sets the bright procession on its way,\nAnd marshals all the order of the year.\nHe marks the bounds which Winter may not pass,\nAnd blunts his pointed fury.  In its case,\nRusset and rude, folds up the tender germ\nUninjured, with inimitable art,\nAnd, ere one flowery season fades and dies,\nDesigns the blooming wonders of the next.\n\nSome say that in the origin of things,\nWhen all creation started into birth,\nThe infant elements received a law\nFrom which they swerve not since; that under force\nOf that controlling ordinance they move,\nAnd need not His immediate hand, who first\nPrescribed their course, to regulate it now.\nThus dream they, and contrive to save a God\nThe encumbrance of His own concerns, and spare\nThe great Artificer of all that moves\nThe stress of a continual act, the pain\nOf unremitted vigilance and care,\nAs too laborious and severe a task.\nSo man the moth is not afraid, it seems,\nTo span Omnipotence, and measure might\nThat knows no measure, by the scanty rule\nAnd standard of his own, that is to-day,\nAnd is not ere to-morrow's sun go down.\nBut how should matter occupy a charge\nDull as it is, and satisfy a law\nSo vast in its demands, unless impelled\nTo ceaseless service by a ceaseless force,\nAnd under pressure of some conscious cause?\nThe Lord of all, Himself through all diffused\nSustains and is the life of all that lives.\nNature is but a name for an effect\nWhose cause is God.  He feeds the secret fire\nBy which the mighty process is maintained,\nWho sleeps not, is not weary; in whose sight\nSlow-circling ages are as transient days;\nWhose work is without labour, whose designs\nNo flaw deforms, no difficulty thwarts,\nAnd whose beneficence no charge exhausts.\nHim blind antiquity profaned, not served,\nWith self-taught rites and under various names\nFemale and male, Pomona, Pales, Pan,\nAnd Flora and Vertumnus; peopling earth\nWith tutelary goddesses and gods\nThat were not, and commending as they would\nTo each some province, garden, field, or grove.\nBut all are under One.  One spirit--His\nWho bore the platted thorns with bleeding brows--\nRules universal nature.  Not a flower\nBut shows some touch in freckle, streak, or stain,\nOf His unrivalled pencil.  He inspires\nTheir balmy odours and imparts their hues,\nAnd bathes their eyes with nectar, and includes,\nIn grains as countless as the sea-side sands,\nThe forms with which He sprinkles all the earth.\nHappy who walks with Him! whom, what he finds\nOf flavour or of scent in fruit or flower,\nOr what he views of beautiful or grand\nIn nature, from the broad majestic oak\nTo the green blade that twinkles in the sun,\nPrompts with remembrance of a present God.\nHis presence, who made all so fair, perceived,\nMakes all still fairer.  As with Him no scene\nIs dreary, so with Him all seasons please.\nThough winter had been none had man been true,\nAnd earth be punished for its tenant's sake,\nYet not in vengeance; as this smiling sky,\nSo soon succeeding such an angry night,\nAnd these dissolving snows, and this clear stream,\nRecovering fast its liquid music, prove.\n\nWho then, that has a mind well strung and tuned\nTo contemplation, and within his reach\nA scene so friendly to his favourite task,\nWould waste attention at the chequered board,\nHis host of wooden warriors to and fro\nMarching and counter-marching, with an eye\nAs fixt as marble, with a forehead ridged\nAnd furrowed into storms, and with a hand\nTrembling, as if eternity were hung\nIn balance on his conduct of a pin?\nNor envies he aught more their idle sport,\nWho pant with application misapplied\nTo trivial toys, and, pushing ivory balls\nAcross the velvet level, feel a joy\nAkin to rapture, when the bauble finds\nIts destined goal of difficult access.\nNor deems he wiser him, who gives his noon\nTo Miss, the Mercer's plague, from shop to shop\nWandering, and littering with unfolded silks\nThe polished counter, and approving none,\nOr promising with smiles to call again.\nNor him, who, by his vanity seduced,\nAnd soothed into a dream that he discerns\nThe difference of a Guido from a daub,\nFrequents the crowded auction.  Stationed there\nAs duly as the Langford of the show,\nWith glass at eye, and catalogue in hand,\nAnd tongue accomplished in the fulsome cant\nAnd pedantry that coxcombs learn with ease,\nOft as the price-deciding hammer falls\nHe notes it in his book, then raps his box,\nSwears 'tis a bargain, rails at his hard fate\nThat he has let it pass--but never bids.\n\nHere unmolested, through whatever sign\nThe sun proceeds, I wander; neither mist,\nNor freezing sky, nor sultry, checking me,\nNor stranger intermeddling with my joy.\nEven in the spring and play-time of the year\nThat calls the unwonted villager abroad\nWith all her little ones, a sportive train,\nTo gather king-cups in the yellow mead,\nAnd prank their hair with daisies, or to pick\nA cheap but wholesome salad from the brook,\nThese shades are all my own.  The timorous hare,\nGrown so familiar with her frequent guest,\nScarce shuns me; and the stock-dove unalarmed\nSits cooing in the pine-tree, nor suspends\nHis long love-ditty for my near approach.\nDrawn from his refuge in some lonely elm\nThat age or injury has hollowed deep,\nWhere on his bed of wool and matted leaves\nHe has outslept the winter, ventures forth\nTo frisk awhile, and bask in the warm sun,\nThe squirrel, flippant, pert, and full of play.\nHe sees me, and at once, swift as a bird,\nAscends the neighbouring beech; there whisks his brush,\nAnd perks his ears, and stamps and scolds aloud,\nWith all the prettiness of feigned alarm,\nAnd anger insignificantly fierce.\n\nThe heart is hard in nature, and unfit\nFor human fellowship, as being void\nOf sympathy, and therefore dead alike\nTo love and friendship both, that is not pleased\nWith sight of animals enjoying life,\nNor feels their happiness augment his own.\nThe bounding fawn that darts across the glade\nWhen none pursues, through mere delight of heart,\nAnd spirits buoyant with excess of glee;\nThe horse, as wanton and almost as fleet,\nThat skims the spacious meadow at full speed,\nThen stops and snorts, and throwing high his heels\nStarts to the voluntary race again;\nThe very kine that gambol at high noon,\nThe total herd receiving first from one,\nThat leads the dance, a summons to be gay,\nThough wild their strange vagaries, and uncouth\nTheir efforts, yet resolved with one consent\nTo give such act and utterance as they may\nTo ecstasy too big to be suppressed--\nThese, and a thousand images of bliss,\nWith which kind nature graces every scene\nWhere cruel man defeats not her design,\nImpart to the benevolent, who wish\nAll that are capable of pleasure pleased,\nA far superior happiness to theirs,\nThe comfort of a reasonable joy.\n\nMan scarce had risen, obedient to His call\nWho formed him from the dust, his future grave,\nWhen he was crowned as never king was since.\nGod set His diadem upon his head,\nAnd angel choirs attended.  Wondering stood\nThe new-made monarch, while before him passed,\nAll happy and all perfect in their kind,\nThe creatures, summoned from their various haunts\nTo see their sovereign, and confess his sway.\nVast was his empire, absolute his power,\nOr bounded only by a law whose force\n'Twas his sublimest privilege to feel\nAnd own, the law of universal love.\nHe ruled with meekness, they obeyed with joy.\nNo cruel purpose lurked within his heart,\nAnd no distrust of his intent in theirs.\nSo Eden was a scene of harmless sport,\nWhere kindness on his part who ruled the whole\nBegat a tranquil confidence in all,\nAnd fear as yet was not, nor cause for fear.\nBut sin marred all; and the revolt of man,\nThat source of evils not exhausted yet,\nWas punished with revolt of his from him.\nGarden of God, how terrible the change\nThy groves and lawns then witnessed! every heart,\nEach animal of every name, conceived\nA jealousy and an instinctive fear,\nAnd, conscious of some danger, either fled\nPrecipitate the loathed abode of man,\nOr growled defiance in such angry sort,\nAs taught him too to tremble in his turn.\nThus harmony and family accord\nWere driven from Paradise; and in that hour\nThe seeds of cruelty, that since have swelled\nTo such gigantic and enormous growth,\nWere sown in human nature's fruitful soil.\nHence date the persecution and the pain\nThat man inflicts on all inferior kinds,\nRegardless of their plaints.  To make him sport,\nTo gratify the frenzy of his wrath,\nOr his base gluttony, are causes good\nAnd just in his account, why bird and beast\nShould suffer torture, and the streams be dyed\nWith blood of their inhabitants impaled.\nEarth groans beneath the burden of a war\nWaged with defenceless innocence, while he,\nNot satisfied to prey on all around,\nAdds tenfold bitterness to death by pangs\nNeedless, and first torments ere he devours.\nNow happiest they that occupy the scenes\nThe most remote from his abhorred resort,\nWhom once as delegate of God on earth\nThey feared, and as His perfect image loved.\nThe wilderness is theirs with all its caves,\nIts hollow glens, its thickets, and its plains\nUnvisited by man.  There they are free,\nAnd howl and roar as likes them, uncontrolled,\nNor ask his leave to slumber or to play.\nWoe to the tyrant, if he dare intrude\nWithin the confines of their wild domain;\nThe lion tells him, \"I am monarch here;\"\nAnd if he spares him, spares him on the terms\nOf royal mercy, and through generous scorn\nTo rend a victim trembling at his foot.\nIn measure, as by force of instinct drawn,\nOr by necessity constrained, they live\nDependent upon man, those in his fields,\nThese at his crib, and some beneath his roof;\nThey prove too often at how dear a rate\nHe sells protection.  Witness, at his foot\nThe spaniel dying for some venial fault,\nUnder dissection of the knotted scourge;\nWitness the patient ox, with stripes and yells\nDriven to the slaughter, goaded as he runs\nTo madness, while the savage at his heels\nLaughs at the frantic sufferer's fury spent\nUpon the guiltless passenger o'erthrown.\nHe too is witness, noblest of the train\nThat wait on man, the flight-performing horse:\nWith unsuspecting readiness he takes\nHis murderer on his back, and, pushed all day,\nWith bleeding sides, and flanks that heave for life,\nTo the far-distant goal, arrives and dies.\nSo little mercy shows who needs so much!\nDoes law, so jealous in the cause of man,\nDenounce no doom on the delinquent?  None.\nHe lives, and o'er his brimming beaker boasts\n(As if barbarity were high desert)\nThe inglorious feat, and, clamorous in praise\nOf the poor brute, seems wisely to suppose\nThe honours of his matchless horse his own.\nBut many a crime, deemed innocent on earth,\nIs registered in heaven, and these, no doubt,\nHave each their record, with a curse annexed.\nMan may dismiss compassion from his heart,\nBut God will never.  When He charged the Jew\nTo assist his foe's down-fallen beast to rise,\nAnd when the bush-exploring boy that seized\nThe young, to let the parent bird go free,\nProved He not plainly that His meaner works\nAre yet His care, and have an interest all,\nAll, in the universal Father's love?\nOn Noah, and in him on all mankind,\nThe charter was conferred by which we hold\nThe flesh of animals in fee, and claim,\nO'er all we feed on, power of life and death.\nBut read the instrument, and mark it well;\nThe oppression of a tyrannous control\nCan find no warrant there.  Feed then, and yield\nThanks for thy food.  Carnivorous, through sin,\nFeed on the slain, but spare the living brute.\n\nThe Governor of all, Himself to all\nSo bountiful, in whose attentive ear\nThe unfledged raven and the lion's whelp\nPlead not in vain for pity on the pangs\nOf hunger unassuaged, has interposed,\nNot seldom, His avenging arm, to smite\nThe injurious trampler upon nature's law,\nThat claims forbearance even for a brute.\nHe hates the hardness of a Balaam's heart,\nAnd, prophet as he was, he might not strike\nThe blameless animal, without rebuke,\nOn which he rode.  Her opportune offence\nSaved him, or the unrelenting seer had died.\nHe sees that human equity is slack\nTo interfere, though in so just a cause,\nAnd makes the task His own; inspiring dumb\nAnd helpless victims with a sense so keen\nOf injury, with such knowledge of their strength,\nAnd such sagacity to take revenge,\nThat oft the beast has seemed to judge the man.\nAn ancient, not a legendary tale,\nBy one of sound intelligence rehearsed,\n(If such, who plead for Providence may seem\nIn modern eyes) shall make the doctrine clear.\n\nWhere England, stretched towards the setting sun,\nNarrow and long, o'erlooks the western wave,\nDwelt young Misagathus; a scorner he\nOf God and goodness, atheist in ostent,\nVicious in act, in temper savage-fierce.\nHe journeyed, and his chance was, as he went,\nTo join a traveller of far different note--\nEvander, famed for piety, for years\nDeserving honour, but for wisdom more.\nFame had not left the venerable man\nA stranger to the manners of the youth,\nWhose face, too, was familiar to his view.\nTheir way was on the margin of the land,\nO'er the green summit of the rocks whose base\nBeats back the roaring surge, scarce heard so high.\nThe charity that warmed his heart was moved\nAt sight of the man-monster.  With a smile\nGentle and affable, and full of grace,\nAs fearful of offending whom he wished\nMuch to persuade, he plied his ear with truths\nNot harshly thundered forth or rudely pressed,\nBut, like his purpose, gracious, kind, and sweet.\n\"And dost thou dream,\" the impenetrable man\nExclaimed, \"that me the lullabies of age,\nAnd fantasies of dotards such as thou,\nCan cheat, or move a moment's fear in me?\nMark now the proof I give thee, that the brave\nNeed no such aids as superstition lends\nTo steel their hearts against the dread of death.\"\nHe spoke, and to the precipice at hand\nPushed with a madman's fury.  Fancy shrinks,\nAnd the blood thrills and curdles at the thought\nOf such a gulf as he designed his grave.\nBut though the felon on his back could dare\nThe dreadful leap, more rational, his steed\nDeclined the death, and wheeling swiftly round,\nOr ere his hoof had pressed the crumbling verge,\nBaffled his rider, saved against his will.\nThe frenzy of the brain may be redressed\nBy medicine well applied, but without grace\nThe heart's insanity admits no cure.\nEnraged the more by what might have reformed\nHis horrible intent, again he sought\nDestruction, with a zeal to be destroyed,\nWith sounding whip and rowels dyed in blood.\nBut still in vain.  The Providence that meant\nA longer date to the far nobler beast,\nSpared yet again the ignobler for his sake.\nAnd now, his prowess proved, and his sincere,\nIncurable obduracy evinced,\nHis rage grew cool; and, pleased perhaps to have earned\nSo cheaply the renown of that attempt,\nWith looks of some complacence he resumed\nHis road, deriding much the blank amaze\nOf good Evander, still where he was left\nFixed motionless, and petrified with dread.\nSo on they fared; discourse on other themes\nEnsuing, seemed to obliterate the past,\nAnd tamer far for so much fury shown\n(As is the course of rash and fiery men)\nThe rude companion smiled as if transformed.\nBut 'twas a transient calm.  A storm was near,\nAn unsuspected storm.  His hour was come.\nThe impious challenger of power divine\nWas now to learn that Heaven, though slow to wrath,\nIs never with impunity defied.\nHis horse, as he had caught his master's mood,\nSnorting, and starting into sudden rage,\nUnbidden, and not now to be controlled,\nRushed to the cliff, and having reached it, stood.\nAt once the shock unseated him; he flew\nSheer o'er the craggy barrier, and, immersed\nDeep in the flood, found, when he sought it not,\nThe death he had deserved, and died alone.\nSo God wrought double justice; made the fool\nThe victim of his own tremendous choice,\nAnd taught a brute the way to safe revenge.\n\nI would not enter on my list of friends\n(Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,\nYet wanting sensibility) the man\nWho needlessly sets foot upon a worm.\nAn inadvertent step may crush the snail\nThat crawls at evening in the public path;\nBut he that has humanity, forewarned,\nWill tread aside, and let the reptile live.\nThe creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight,\nAnd charged perhaps with venom, that intrudes\nA visitor unwelcome into scenes\nSacred to neatness and repose, the alcove,\nThe chamber, or refectory, may die.\nA necessary act incurs no blame.\nNot so when, held within their proper bounds\nAnd guiltless of offence, they range the air,\nOr take their pastime in the spacious field.\nThere they are privileged; and he that hunts\nOr harms them there is guilty of a wrong,\nDisturbs the economy of Nature's realm,\nWho, when she formed, designed them an abode.\nThe sum is this:  if man's convenience, health,\nOr safety interfere, his rights and claims\nAre paramount, and must extinguish theirs.\nElse they are all--the meanest things that are--\nAs free to live and to enjoy that life,\nAs God was free to form them at the first,\nWho in His sovereign wisdom made them all.\nYe, therefore, who love mercy, teach your sons\nTo love it too.  The spring-time of our years\nIs soon dishonoured and defiled in most\nBy budding ills, that ask a prudent hand\nTo check them.  But, alas! none sooner shoots,\nIf unrestrained, into luxuriant growth,\nThan cruelty, most devilish of them all.\nMercy to him that shows it, is the rule\nAnd righteous limitation of its act,\nBy which Heaven moves in pardoning guilty man;\nAnd he that shows none, being ripe in years,\nAnd conscious of the outrage he commits,\nShall seek it and not find it in his turn.\n\nDistinguished much by reason, and still more\nBy our capacity of grace divine,\nFrom creatures that exist but for our sake,\nWhich having served us, perish, we are held\nAccountable, and God, some future day,\nWill reckon with us roundly for the abuse\nOf what He deems no mean or trivial trust.\nSuperior as we are, they yet depend\nNot more on human help, than we on theirs.\nTheir strength, or speed, or vigilance, were given\nIn aid of our defects.  In some are found\nSuch teachable and apprehensive parts,\nThat man's attainments in his own concerns,\nMatched with the expertness of the brutes in theirs,\nAre ofttimes vanquished and thrown far behind.\nSome show that nice sagacity of smell,\nAnd read with such discernment, in the port\nAnd figure of the man, his secret aim,\nThat oft we owe our safety to a skill\nWe could not teach, and must despair to learn.\nBut learn we might, if not too proud to stoop\nTo quadruped instructors, many a good\nAnd useful quality, and virtue too,\nRarely exemplified among ourselves;\nAttachment never to be weaned, or changed\nBy any change of fortune, proof alike\nAgainst unkindness, absence, and neglect;\nFidelity, that neither bribe nor threat\nCan move or warp; and gratitude for small\nAnd trivial favours, lasting as the life,\nAnd glistening even in the dying eye.\n\nMan praises man.  Desert in arts or arms\nWins public honour; and ten thousand sit\nPatiently present at a sacred song,\nCommemoration-mad; content to hear\n(Oh wonderful effect of music's power!)\nMessiah's eulogy, for Handel's sake.\nBut less, methinks, than sacrilege might serve--\n(For was it less?  What heathen would have dared\nTo strip Jove's statue of his oaken wreath\nAnd hang it up in honour of a man?)\nMuch less might serve, when all that we design\nIs but to gratify an itching ear,\nAnd give the day to a musician's praise.\nRemember Handel! who, that was not born\nDeaf as the dead to harmony, forgets,\nOr can, the more than Homer of his age?\nYes--we remember him; and, while we praise\nA talent so divine, remember too\nThat His most holy Book from whom it came\nWas never meant, was never used before\nTo buckram out the memory of a man.\nBut hush!--the muse perhaps is too severe,\nAnd with a gravity beyond the size\nAnd measure of the offence, rebukes a deed\nLess impious than absurd, and owing more\nTo want of judgment than to wrong design.\nSo in the chapel of old Ely House,\nWhen wandering Charles, who meant to be the third,\nHad fled from William, and the news was fresh,\nThe simple clerk, but loyal, did announce,\nAnd eke did rear right merrily, two staves,\nSung to the praise and glory of King George.\n--Man praises man; and Garrick's memory next,\nWhen time has somewhat mellowed it, and made\nThe idol of our worship while he lived\nThe god of our idolatry once more,\nShall have its altar; and the world shall go\nIn pilgrimage to bow before his shrine.\nThe theatre, too small, shall suffocate\nIts squeezed contents, and more than it admits\nShall sigh at their exclusion, and return\nUngratified.  For there some noble lord\nShall stuff his shoulders with King Richard's bunch,\nOr wrap himself in Hamlet's inky cloak,\nAnd strut, and storm, and straddle, stamp, and stare,\nTo show the world how Garrick did not act,\nFor Garrick was a worshipper himself;\nHe drew the liturgy, and framed the rites\nAnd solemn ceremonial of the day,\nAnd called the world to worship on the banks\nOf Avon famed in song.  Ah! pleasant proof\nThat piety has still in human hearts\nSome place, a spark or two not yet extinct.\nThe mulberry-tree was hung with blooming wreaths,\nThe mulberry-tree stood centre of the dance,\nThe mulberry-tree was hymned with dulcet airs,\nAnd from his touchwood trunk the mulberry-tree\nSupplied such relics as devotion holds\nStill sacred, and preserves with pious care.\nSo 'twas a hallowed time:  decorum reigned,\nAnd mirth without offence.  No few returned\nDoubtless much edified, and all refreshed.\n--Man praises man.  The rabble all alive,\nFrom tippling benches, cellars, stalls, and styes,\nSwarm in the streets.  The statesman of the day,\nA pompous and slow-moving pageant, comes;\nSome shout him, and some hang upon his car\nTo gaze in his eyes and bless him.  Maidens wave\nTheir kerchiefs, and old women weep for joy\nWhile others not so satisfied unhorse\nThe gilded equipage, and, turning loose\nHis steeds, usurp a place they well deserve.\nWhy? what has charmed them?  Hath he saved the state?\nNo.  Doth he purpose its salvation?  No.\nEnchanting novelty, that moon at full\nThat finds out every crevice of the head\nThat is not sound and perfect, hath in theirs\nWrought this disturbance.  But the wane is near,\nAnd his own cattle must suffice him soon.\nThus idly do we waste the breath of praise,\nAnd dedicate a tribute, in its use\nAnd just direction sacred, to a thing\nDoomed to the dust, or lodged already there.\nEncomium in old time was poet's work;\nBut, poets having lavishly long since\nExhausted all materials of the art,\nThe task now falls into the public hand;\nAnd I, contented with a humble theme,\nHave poured my stream of panegyric down\nThe vale of Nature, where it creeps and winds\nAmong her lovely works, with a secure\nAnd unambitious course, reflecting clear\nIf not the virtues yet the worth of brutes.\nAnd I am recompensed, and deem the toil\nOf poetry not lost, if verse of mine\nMay stand between an animal and woe,\nAnd teach one tyrant pity for his drudge.\n\nThe groans of Nature in this nether world,\nWhich Heaven has heard for ages, have an end.\nForetold by prophets, and by poets sung,\nWhose fire was kindled at the prophets' lamp,\nThe time of rest, the promised Sabbath, comes.\nSix thousand years of sorrow have well-nigh\nFulfilled their tardy and disastrous course\nOver a sinful world; and what remains\nOf this tempestuous state of human things,\nIs merely as the working of a sea\nBefore a calm, that rocks itself to rest.\nFor He, whose car the winds are, and the clouds\nThe dust that waits upon His sultry march,\nWhen sin hath moved Him, and His wrath is hot,\nShall visit earth in mercy; shall descend\nPropitious, in His chariot paved with love,\nAnd what His storms have blasted and defaced\nFor man's revolt, shall with a smile repair.\n\nSweet is the harp of prophecy; too sweet\nNot to be wronged by a mere mortal touch;\nNor can the wonders it records be sung\nTo meaner music, and not suffer loss.\nBut when a poet, or when one like me,\nHappy to rove among poetic flowers,\nThough poor in skill to rear them, lights at last\nOn some fair theme, some theme divinely fair,\nSuch is the impulse and the spur he feels\nTo give it praise proportioned to its worth,\nThat not to attempt it, arduous as he deems\nThe labour, were a task more arduous still.\n\nOh scenes surpassing fable, and yet true,\nScenes of accomplished bliss! which who can see,\nThough but in distant prospect, and not feel\nHis soul refreshed with foretaste of the joy?\nRivers of gladness water all the earth,\nAnd clothe all climes with beauty; the reproach\nOf barrenness is past.  The fruitful field\nLaughs with abundance, and the land once lean,\nOr fertile only in its own disgrace,\nExults to see its thistly curse repealed.\nThe various seasons woven into one,\nAnd that one season an eternal spring,\nThe garden fears no blight, and needs no fence,\nFor there is none to covet, all are full.\nThe lion and the libbard and the bear\nGraze with the fearless flocks.  All bask at noon\nTogether, or all gambol in the shade\nOf the same grove, and drink one common stream.\nAntipathies are none.  No foe to man\nLurks in the serpent now.  The mother sees,\nAnd smiles to see, her infant's playful hand\nStretched forth to dally with the crested worm,\nTo stroke his azure neck, or to receive\nThe lambent homage of his arrowy tongue.\nAll creatures worship man, and all mankind\nOne Lord, one Father.  Error has no place;\nThat creeping pestilence is driven away,\nThe breath of heaven has chased it.  In the heart\nNo passion touches a discordant string,\nBut all is harmony and love.  Disease\nIs not.  The pure and uncontaminated blood\nHolds its due course, nor fears the frost of age.\nOne song employs all nations; and all cry,\n\"Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain for us!\"\nThe dwellers in the vales and on the rocks\nShout to each other, and the mountain-tops\nFrom distant mountains catch the flying joy,\nTill nation after nation taught the strain,\nEach rolls the rapturous Hosanna round.\nBehold the measure of the promise filled,\nSee Salem built, the labour of a God!\nBright as a sun the sacred city shines;\nAll kingdoms and all princes of the earth\nFlock to that light; the glory of all lands\nFlows into her, unbounded is her joy\nAnd endless her increase.  Thy rams are there,\nNebaioth,* and the flocks of Kedar there;\nThe looms of Ormus, and the mines of Ind,\nAnd Saba's spicy groves pay tribute there.\nPraise is in all her gates.  Upon her walls,\nAnd in her streets, and in her spacious courts\nIs heard salvation.  Eastern Java there\nKneels with the native of the farthest West,\nAnd AEthiopia spreads abroad the hand,\nAnd worships.  Her report has travelled forth\nInto all lands.  From every clime they come\nTo see thy beauty and to share thy joy,\nO Sion! an assembly such as earth\nSaw never; such as heaven stoops down to see.\n\n* Nebaioth and Kedar, the sons of Ishmael, and progenitors of the\nArabs, in the prophetic scripture here alluded to may be reasonably\nconsidered as representatives of the Gentiles at large.--C.\n\nThus heavenward all things tend.  For all were once\nPerfect, and all must be at length restored.\nSo God has greatly purposed; who would else\nIn His dishonoured works Himself endure\nDishonour, and be wronged without redress.\nHaste then, and wheel away a shattered world,\nYe slow-revolving seasons!  We would see\n(A sight to which our eyes are strangers yet)\nA world that does not dread and hate His laws,\nAnd suffer for its crime:  would learn how fair\nThe creature is that God pronounces good,\nHow pleasant in itself what pleases Him.\nHere every drop of honey hides a sting;\nWorms wind themselves into our sweetest flowers,\nAnd even the joy, that haply some poor heart\nDerives from heaven, pure as the fountain is,\nIs sullied in the stream; taking a taint\nFrom touch of human lips, at best impure.\nOh for a world in principle as chaste\nAs this is gross and selfish! over which\nCustom and prejudice shall bear no sway,\nThat govern all things here, shouldering aside\nThe meek and modest Truth, and forcing her\nTo seek a refuge from the tongue of strife\nIn nooks obscure, far from the ways of men,\nWhere violence shall never lift the sword,\nNor cunning justify the proud man's wrong,\nLeaving the poor no remedy but tears;\nWhere he that fills an office, shall esteem\nThe occasion it presents of doing good\nMore than the perquisite; where laws shall speak\nSeldom, and never but as wisdom prompts,\nAnd equity, not jealous more to guard\nA worthless form, than to decide aright;\nWhere fashion shall not sanctify abuse,\nNor smooth good-breeding (supplemental grace)\nWith lean performance ape the work of love.\n\nCome then, and added to Thy many crowns\nReceive yet one, the crown of all the earth,\nThou who alone art worthy! it was Thine\nBy ancient covenant, ere nature's birth,\nAnd Thou hast made it Thine by purchase since,\nAnd overpaid its value with Thy blood.\nThy saints proclaim Thee King; and in their hearts\nThy title is engraven with a pen\nDipt in the fountain of eternal love.\nThy saints proclaim Thee King; and Thy delay\nGives courage to their foes, who, could they see\nThe dawn of Thy last advent, long-desired,\nWould creep into the bowels of the hills,\nAnd flee for safety to the falling rocks.\nThe very spirit of the world is tired\nOf its own taunting question, asked so long,\n\"Where is the promise of your Lord's approach?\"\nThe infidel has shot his bolts away,\nTill, his exhausted quiver yielding none,\nHe gleans the blunted shafts that have recoiled,\nAnd aims them at the shield of truth again.\nThe veil is rent, rent too by priestly hands,\nThat hides divinity from mortal eyes;\nAnd all the mysteries to faith proposed,\nInsulted and traduced, are cast aside,\nAs useless, to the moles and to the bats.\nThey now are deemed the faithful and are praised,\nWho, constant only in rejecting Thee,\nDeny Thy Godhead with a martyr's zeal,\nAnd quit their office for their error's sake.\nBlind and in love with darkness! yet even these\nWorthy, compared with sycophants, who kneel,\nThy Name adoring, and then preach Thee man!\nSo fares Thy Church.  But how Thy Church may fare,\nThe world takes little thought; who will may preach,\nAnd what they will.  All pastors are alike\nTo wandering sheep resolved to follow none.\nTwo gods divide them all, Pleasure and Gain;\nFor these they live, they sacrifice to these,\nAnd in their service wage perpetual war\nWith conscience and with Thee.  Lust in their hearts,\nAnd mischief in their hands, they roam the earth\nTo prey upon each other; stubborn, fierce,\nHigh-minded, foaming out their own disgrace.\nThy prophets speak of such; and noting down\nThe features of the last degenerate times,\nExhibit every lineament of these.\nCome then, and added to Thy many crowns\nReceive yet one as radiant as the rest,\nDue to Thy last and most effectual work,\nThy Word fulfilled, the conquest of a world.\n\nHe is the happy man, whose life even now\nShows somewhat of that happier life to come;\nWho, doomed to an obscure but tranquil state,\nIs pleased with it, and, were he free to choose,\nWould make his fate his choice; whom peace, the fruit\nOf virtue, and whom virtue, fruit of faith,\nPrepare for happiness; bespeak him one\nContent indeed to sojourn while he must\nBelow the skies, but having there his home.\nThe world o'erlooks him in her busy search\nOf objects more illustrious in her view;\nAnd occupied as earnestly as she,\nThough more sublimely, he o'erlooks the world.\nShe scorns his pleasures, for she knows them not;\nHe seeks not hers, for he has proved them vain.\nHe cannot skim the ground like summer birds\nPursuing gilded flies, and such he deems\nHer honours, her emoluments, her joys;\nTherefore in contemplation is his bliss,\nWhose power is such, that whom she lifts from earth\nShe makes familiar with a heaven unseen,\nAnd shows him glories yet to be revealed.\nNot slothful he, though seeming unemployed,\nAnd censured oft as useless.  Stillest streams\nOft water fairest meadows; and the bird\nThat flutters least is longest on the wing.\nAsk him, indeed, what trophies he has raised,\nOr what achievements of immortal fame\nHe purposes, and he shall answer--None.\nHis warfare is within.  There unfatigued\nHis fervent spirit labours.  There he fights,\nAnd there obtains fresh triumphs o'er himself,\nAnd never-withering wreaths, compared with which\nThe laurels that a Caesar reaps are weeds.\nPerhaps the self-approving haughty world,\nThat, as she sweeps him with her whistling silks,\nScarce deigns to notice him, or if she see,\nDeems him a cipher in the works of God,\nReceives advantage from his noiseless hours\nOf which she little dreams.  Perhaps she owes\nHer sunshine and her rain, her blooming spring\nAnd plenteous harvest, to the prayer he makes\nWhen, Isaac-like, the solitary saint\nWalks forth to meditate at eventide,\nAnd think on her who thinks not for herself.\nForgive him then, thou bustler in concerns\nOf little worth, and idler in the best,\nIf, author of no mischief and some good,\nHe seeks his proper happiness by means\nThat may advance, but cannot hinder thine.\nNor, though he tread the secret path of life,\nEngage no notice, and enjoy much ease,\nAccount him an encumbrance on the state,\nReceiving benefits, and rendering none.\nHis sphere though humble, if that humble sphere\nShine with his fair example, and though small\nHis influence, if that influence all be spent\nIn soothing sorrow and in quenching strife,\nIn aiding helpless indigence, in works\nFrom which at least a grateful few derive\nSome taste of comfort in a world of woe,\nThen let the supercilious great confess\nHe serves his country; recompenses well\nThe state beneath the shadow of whose vine\nHe sits secure, and in the scale of life\nHolds no ignoble, though a slighted place.\nThe man whose virtues are more felt than seen,\nMust drop, indeed, the hope of public praise;\nBut he may boast, what few that win it can,\nThat if his country stand not by his skill,\nAt least his follies have not wrought her fall.\nPolite refinement offers him in vain\nHer golden tube, through which a sensual world\nDraws gross impurity, and likes it well,\nThe neat conveyance hiding all the offence.\nNot that he peevishly rejects a mode\nBecause that world adopts it.

More correctly speaking, it may be said a summer\u2019s evening, for the bright beams were already slanting athwart the substantial garden of Mr. Justice Hare, and the tea hour, seven, was passing. Mr. and Mrs. Hare and Barbara were seated at the meal; somehow, meals always did seem in process at Justice Hare\u2019s; if it was not breakfast, it was luncheon\u2014if it was not luncheon, it was dinner\u2014if it was not dinner, it was tea. Barbara sat in tears, for the justice was giving her a \u201cpiece of his mind,\u201d and poor Mrs. Hare deferently agreeing with her husband, as she would have done had he proposed to set the house on fire and burn her up in it, yet sympathizing with Barbara, moved uneasily in her chair.\n\n\u201cYou do it for the purpose; you do it to anger me,\u201d thundered the justice, bringing down his hand on the tea-table and causing the cups to rattle.\n\n\u201cNo I don\u2019t, papa,\u201d sobbed Barbara.\n\n\u201cThen why do you do it?\u201d\n\nBarbara was silent.\n\n\u201cNo; you can\u2019t answer; you have nothing to urge. What is the matter, pray, with Major Thorn? Come, I will be answered.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like him,\u201d faltered Barbara.\n\n\u201cYou do like him; you are telling me an untruth. You have liked him well enough whenever he has been here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like him as an acquaintance, papa; not as a husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot as a husband!\u201d repeated the exasperated justice. \u201cWhy, bless my heart and body, the girl\u2019s going mad! Not as a husband! Who asked you to like him as a husband before he became such? Did ever you hear that it was necessary or expedient, or becoming for a young lady to act on and begin to \u2018like\u2019 a gentleman as \u2018her husband?\u2019\u201d\n\nBarbara felt a little bewildered.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the whole parish saying that Barbara Hare can\u2019t be married, that nobody will have her, on account of\u2014of\u2014of that cursed stain left by\u2014\u2014, I won\u2019t trust myself to name him, I should go too far. Now, don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a pretty disgrace, a fine state of things?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it is not true,\u201d said Barbara; \u201cpeople do ask me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s the use of their asking when you say \u2018No?\u2019\u201d raved the justice. \u201cIs that the way to let the parish know that they ask? You are an ungrateful, rebellious, self-willed daughter, and you\u2019ll never be otherwise.\u201d\n\nBarbara\u2019s tears flowed freely. The justice gave a dash at the bell handle, to order the tea things carried away, and after their removal the subject was renewed, together with Barbara\u2019s grief. That was the worst of Justice Hare. Let him seize hold of a grievance, it was not often he got upon a real one, and he kept on at it, like a blacksmith hammering at his forge. In the midst of a stormy oration, tongue and hands going together, Mr. Carlyle came in.\n\nNot much altered; not much. A year and three-quarters had gone by and they had served to silver his hair upon the temples. His manner, too, would never again be careless and light as it once had been. He was the same keen man of business, the same pleasant, intelligent companion; the generality of people saw no change in him. Barbara rose to escape.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Justice Hare, planting himself between her and the door; \u201cthat\u2019s the way you like to get out of my reach when I am talking to you. You won\u2019t go; so sit down again. I\u2019ll tell you of your ill-conduct before Mr. Carlyle, and see if that will shame you.\u201d\n\nBarbara resumed her seat, a rush of crimson dyeing her cheeks. And Mr. Carlyle looked inquiringly, seeming to ask an explanation of her distress. The justice continued after his own fashion.\n\n\u201cYou know, Carlyle, that horrible blow that fell upon us, that shameless disgrace. Well, because the parish can\u2019t clack enough about the fact itself, it must begin about Barbara, saying that the disgrace and humiliation are reflected upon her, and that nobody will come near her to ask her to be his wife. One would think, rather than lie under the stigma and afford the parish room to talk, she\u2019d marry the first man that came, if it was the parish beadle\u2014anybody else would. But now, what are the facts? You\u2019ll stare when you know them. She has received a bushel of good offers\u2014a bushel of them,\u201d repeated the justice, dashing his hand down on his knee, \u201cand she says \u2018No!\u2019 to all. The last was to-day, from Major Thorn, and, my young lady takes and puts the stopper upon it, as usual, without reference to me or her mother, without saying with your leave or by your leave. She wants to be kept in her room for a week upon bread and water, to bring her to her senses.\u201d\nMr. Carlyle glanced at Barbara. She was sitting meekly under the infliction, her wet eyelashes falling on her flushed cheeks and shading her eyes. The justice was heated enough, and had pushed his flaxen wig nearly hind-part before, in the warmth of his argument.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d snapped the justice.\n\n\u201cMatrimony may not have charms for Barbara,\u201d replied Mr. Carlyle half jokingly.\n\n\u201cNothing does have charms for her that ought to have,\u201d growled Justice Hare. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the contrary ones. By the way, though,\u201d hastily resumed the justice, leaving the objectionable subject, as another flashed across his memory, \u201cthey were coupling your name and matrimony together, Carlyle, last night, at the Buck\u2019s Head.\u201d\n\nA very perceptible tinge of red rose to the face of Mr. Carlyle, telling of inward emotion, but his voice and manner betrayed none.\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d he carelessly said.\n\n\u201cAh, you are a sly one; you are, Carlyle. Remember how sly you were over your first\u2014\u2014\u201d marriage, Justice Hare was going to bring out, but it suddenly occurred to him that all circumstances considered, it was not precisely the topic to recall to Mr. Carlyle. So he stopped himself in the utterance, coughed, and went on again. \u201cThere you go, over to see Sir John Dobede, not to see Sir John, but paying court to Miss Dobede.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the Buck\u2019s Head was amusing itself with that!\u201d good-naturedly observed Mr. Carlyle. \u201cWell, Miss Dobede is going to be married, and I am drawing up the settlements.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not she; she marries young Somerset; everybody knows that. It\u2019s the other one, Louisa. A nice girl, Carlyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d responded Mr. Carlyle, and it was all the answer he gave. The justice, tired of sitting indoors, tired, perhaps, of extracting nothing satisfactory from Mr. Carlyle, rose, shook himself, set his wig aright before the chimney-glass, and quitted the house on his customary evening visit to the Buck\u2019s Head. Barbara, who watched him down the path, saw that he encountered someone who happened to be passing the gate. She could not at first distinguish who it might be, nothing but an arm and shoulder cased in velveteen met her view, but as their positions changed in conversation\u2014his and her father\u2019s\u2014she saw that it was Locksley; he had been the chief witness, not a vindictive one; he could not help himself, against her brother Richard, touching the murder of Hallijohn.\n\nMeanwhile Mrs. Hare had drawn Mr. Carlyle into a chair close by her own.\n\n\u201cArchibald, will you forgive me if I say a word upon the topic introduced by Mr. Hare?\u201d she said, in a low tone, as she shook his hand. \u201cYou know how fondly I have ever regarded you, second only to my poor Richard. Your welfare and happiness are precious to me. I wish I could in any way promote them. It occurs to me, sometimes, that you are not at present so happy as you might be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have some sources of happiness,\u201d said Mr. Carlyle. \u201cMy children and I have plenty of sources of interest. What do you mean, dear Mrs. Hare?\u201d\n\u201cYour home might be made happier.\u201d\n\nMr. Carlyle smiled, nearly laughed. \u201cCornelia takes care of that, as she did in the old days, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know. Would it not be as well to consider whether she would not be better in a home of her own\u2014and for you to give East Lynne another mistress?\u201d\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\u201cArchibald, it would be happier for you; it would indeed. It is only in new ties that you can forget the past. You might find recompense yet for the sorrow you have gone through; and I know none,\u201d repeated Mrs. Hare, emphatically, \u201cmore calculated to bring it you than that sweet girl, Louisa Dobede.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo long as\u2014\u201d Mr. Carlyle was beginning, and had not got so far in his sentence, when he was interrupted by an exclamation from Barbara.\n\n\u201cWhat can be the matter with papa? Locksley must have said something to anger him. He is coming in the greatest passion, mamma; his face crimson, and his hands and arms working.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, dear, Barbara!\u201d was all poor Mrs. Hare\u2019s reply. The justice\u2019s great bursts of passion frightened her.\n\nIn he came, closed the door, and stood in the middle of the room, looking alternately at Mrs. Hare and Barbara.\n\n\u201cWhat is this cursed report, that\u2019s being whispered in the place!\u201d quoth he, in a tone of suppressed rage, but not unmixed with awe.\n\n\u201cWhat report?\u201d asked Mr. Carlyle, for the justice waited for an answer, and Mrs. Hare seemed unable to speak. Barbara took care to keep silence; she had some misgivings that the justice\u2019s words might be referring to herself\u2014to the recent grievance.\n\n\u201cA report that he\u2014he\u2014has been here disguised as a laborer, has dared to show himself in the place where he\u2019ll come yet, to the gibbet.\u201d\n\nMrs. Hare\u2019s face turned as white as death; Mr. Carlyle rose and dexterously contrived to stand before her, so that it should not be seen. Barbara silently locked her hands, one within the other, and turned to the window.\n\n\u201cOf whom did you speak?\u201d asked Mr. Carlyle, in a matter-of-fact tone, as if he were putting the most matter-of-fact question. He knew too well; but he thought to temporize for the sake of Mrs. Hare.\n\n\u201cOf whom do I speak!\u201d uttered the exasperated justice, nearly beside himself with passion; \u201cof whom would I speak but the bastard Dick! Who else in West Lynne is likely to come to a felon\u2019s death?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Richard!\u201d sobbed forth Mrs. Hare, as she sank back in her chair, \u201cbe merciful. He is our own true son.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever a true son of the Hares,\u201d raved the justice. \u201cA true son of wickedness, and cowardice, and blight, and evil. If he has dared to show his face at West Lynne, I\u2019ll set the whole police of England upon his track, that he may be brought here as he ought, if he must come. When Locksley told me of it just now, I raised my hand to knock him down, so infamously false did I deem the report. Do you know anything of his having been here?\u201d continued the justice to his wife, in a pointed, resolute tone.\n\nHow Mrs. Hare would have extricated herself, or what she would have answered, cannot even be imagined, but Mr. Carlyle interposed.\n\n\u201cYou are frightening Mrs. Hare, sir. Don\u2019t you see that she knows nothing of it\u2014that the very report of such a thing is alarming her into illness? But\u2014allow me to inquire what it may be that Locksley said?\u201d\n\n\u201cI met him at the gate,\u201d retorted Justice Hare, turning his attention upon Mr. Carlyle. \u201cHe was going by as I reached it. \u2018Oh, justice, I am glad I met you. That\u2019s a nasty report in the place that Richard has been here. I\u2019d see what I could do toward hushing it up, sir, if I were you, for it may only serve to put the police in mind of by gone things, which it may be better they should forget.\u2019 Carlyle, I went, as I tell you, to knock him down. I asked him how he could have the hardihood to repeat such slander to my face. He was on the high horse directly; said the parish spoke the slander, not he; and I got out of him what it was he had heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what was it?\u201d interrupted Mr. Carlyle, more eagerly than he generally spoke.\n\n\u201cWhy, they say the fellow showed himself here some time ago, a year or so, disguised as a farm laborer\u2014confounded fools! Not but what he\u2019d have been the fool had he done it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be sure he would,\u201d repeated Mr. Carlyle, \u201cand he is not fool enough for that, sir. Let West Lynne talk, Mr. Hare; but do not put faith in a word of its gossip. I never do. Poor Richard, wherever he may be\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t have him pitied in my presence,\u201d burst forth the justice. \u201cPoor Richard, indeed! Villain Richard, if you please.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was about to observe that, wherever he may be\u2014whether in the backwoods of America, or digging for gold in California, or wandering about the United Kingdom\u2014there is little fear that he will quit his place of safety to dare the dangerous ground of West Lynne. Had I been you, sir, I should have laughed at Locksley and his words.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does West Lynne invent such lies?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, there\u2019s the rub. I dare say West Lynne could not tell why, if it were paid for doing it; but it seems to have been a lame story it had got up this time. If they must have concocted a report that Richard had been seen at West Lynne, why put it back to a year ago\u2014why not have fixed it for to-day or yesterday? If I heard anything more, I would treat it with the silence and contempt it deserves, justice.\u201d\n\nSilence and contempt were not greatly in the justice\u2019s line; noise and explosion were more so. But he had a high opinion of the judgment of Mr. Carlyle; and growling a sort of assent, he once more set forth to pay his evening visit.\n\n\u201cOh, Archibald!\u201d uttered Mrs. Hare, when her husband was half-way down the path, \u201cwhat a mercy that you were here! I should inevitably have betrayed myself.\u201d\n\nBarbara turned round from the window, \u201cBut what could have possessed Locksley to say what he did?\u201d she exclaimed.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt Locksley spoke with a motive,\u201d said Mr. Carlyle. \u201cHe is not unfriendly to Richard, and thought, probably, that by telling Mr. Hare of the report he might get it stopped. The rumor had been mentioned to me.\u201d\n\nBarbara turned cold all over. \u201cHow can it have come to light?\u201d she breathed.\n\n\u201cI am at a loss to know,\u201d said Mr. Carlyle. \u201cThe person to mention it to me was Tom Herbert. \u2018I say,\u2019 said he meeting me yesterday, \u2018what\u2019s this row about Dick Hare?\u2019 \u2018What now?\u2019 I asked him. \u2018Why, that Dick was at West Lynne some time back, disguised as a farm laborer.\u2019 Just the same, you see, that Locksley said to Mr. Hare. I laughed at Tom Herbert,\u201d continued Mr. Carlyle; \u201cturned his report into ridicule also, before I had done with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill it be the means of causing Richard\u2019s detection?\u201d murmured Mrs. Hare from between her dry lips.\n\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d warmly responded Mr. Carlyle. \u201cHad the report arisen immediately after he was really here, it might not have been so pleasant; but nearly two years have elapsed since the period. Be under no uneasiness, dear Mrs. Hare, for rely upon it there is no cause.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how could it have come out, Archibald?\u201d she urged, \u201cand at this distant period of time?\u201d\n\n\u201cI assure you I am quite at a loss to imagine. Had anybody at West Lynne seen and recognized Richard, they would have spoken of it at the time. Do not let it trouble you; the rumor will die away.\u201d\n\nMrs. Hare sighed deeply, and left the room to proceed to her own chamber. Barbara and Mr. Carlyle were alone.\n\n\u201cOh, that the real murderer could be discovered!\u201d she aspirated, clasping her hands. \u201cTo be subjected to these shocks of fear is dreadful. Mamma will not be herself for days to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish the right man could be found; but it seems as far off as ever,\u201d remarked Mr. Carlyle.\n\nBarbara sat ruminating. It seemed that she would say something to Mr. Carlyle, but a feeling caused her to hesitate. When she did at length speak, it was in a low, timid voice.\n\n\u201cYou remember the description Richard gave, that last night, of the person he had met\u2014the true Thorn?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it strike you then\u2014has it ever occurred to you to think\u2014that it accorded with some one?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn what way, Barbara?\u201d he asked, after a pause. \u201cIt accorded with the description Richard always gave of the man Thorn.\u201d\n\n\u201cRichard spoke of the peculiar movement of throwing off the hair from the forehead\u2014in this way. Did that strike you as being familiar, in connection with the white hand and the diamond ring?\u201d\n\n\u201cMany have a habit of pushing off their hair\u2014I think I do it myself sometimes. Barbara, what do you mean? Have you a suspicion of any one?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you?\u201d she returned, answering the question by asking another.\n\n\u201cI have not. Since Captain Thorn was disposed of, my suspicions have not pointed anywhere.\u201d\n\nThis sealed Barbara\u2019s lips. She had hers, vague doubts, bringing wonder more than anything else. At times she had thought the same doubts might have occurred to Mr. Carlyle; she now found that they had not. The terrible domestic calamity which had happened to Mr. Carlyle the same night that Richard protested he had seen Thorn, had prevented Barbara\u2019s discussing the matter with him then, and she had never done so since. Richard had never been further heard of, and the affair had remained in abeyance.\n\n\u201cI begin to despair of its ever being discovered,\u201d she observed. \u201cWhat will become of poor Richard?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can but wait, and hope that time may bring forth its own elucidation,\u201d continued Mr. Carlyle.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d sighed Barbara, \u201cbut it is weary waiting\u2014weary, weary.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is it you contrive to get under the paternal displeasure?\u201d he resumed, in a gayer tone.\n\nShe blushed vividly, and it was her only answer.\n\n\u201cThe Major Thorn alluded to by your papa is our old friend, I presume?\u201d\n\nBarbara inclined her head.\n\n\u201cHe is a very pleasant man, Barbara. Many a young lady in West Lynne would be proud to get him.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause. Barbara broke it, but she did not look at Mr. Carlyle as she spoke.\n\n\u201cThe other rumor\u2014is it a correct one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat other rumor?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you are to marry Louisa Dobede.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not. I have no intention of marrying any one. Nay, I will say it more strongly; it is my intention not to marry any one\u2014to remain as I am.\u201d\n\nBarbara lifted her eyes to his in the surprise of the moment.\n\n\u201cYou look amused, Barbara. Have you been lending your credence to the gossips, who have so kindly disposed of me to Louisa Dobede?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot so. But Louisa Dobede is a girl to be coveted, and, as mamma says, it might be happier for you if you married again. I thought you would be sure to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. She\u2014who was my wife\u2014lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat of that?\u201d uttered Barbara, in simplicity.\n\nHe did not answer for a moment, and when he did, it was in a low, almost imperceptible tone, as he stood by the table at which Barbara sat, and looked down on her.\n\n\u201c\u2018Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd before Barbara could answer, if, indeed, she had found any answer to make, or had recovered her surprise, he had taken his hat and was gone.\n\nTo return for a short while to Lady Isabel. As the year advanced she grew stronger, and in the latter part of the summer she made preparations for quitting Grenoble. Where she would fix her residence, or what she would do, she knew not. She was miserable and restless, and cared little what became of her. The remotest spot on earth, one unpenetrated by the steps of civilized man, appeared the most desirable for her. Where was she to find this?\n\nShe set out on her search, she and the child and its nurse. Not Susanne. Susanne had a sweetheart in Grenoble, and declined to leave it, so a girl was engaged for the child in her place. Lady Isabel wound up her housekeeping, had her things packed and forwarded to Paris, there to wait her orders and finally quitted Grenoble. It was a fine day when she left it\u2014all too fine for the dark ending it was to bring.\n\nWhen a railway accident does take place in France, it is an accident. None of your milk-and-water affairs, where a few bruises and a great fright are the extent of the damages but too often a calamity whose remembrance lasts a lifetime. Lady Isabel had travelled a considerable distance that first day, and at the dusk of evening, as they were approaching a place, Cammere, where she purposed to halt for the night, a dreadful accident occurred. The details need not be given, and will not be. It is sufficient to say that some of the passengers were killed, her child and nurse being amongst them, and she herself was dangerously injured.\n\nThe injuries lay chiefly in her left leg and in her face\u2014the lower part of her face. The surgeons, taking their cursory view of her, as they did of the rest of the sufferers, were not sparing in their remarks, for they believed her to be insensible. She had gathered that the leg was to be amputated, and that she would probably die under the operation\u2014but her turn to be attended to was not yet. How she contrived to write she never knew, but she got a pen and ink brought to her, and did succeed in scrawling a letter to Lord Mount Severn.\n\nShe told him that a sad accident had taken place; she could not say how; all was confusion; and that her child and maid were killed. She herself was dangerously injured, and was about to undergo an operation, which the doctors believed she could not survive; only in case of her death would the letter be sent to Lord Mount Severn. She could not die, she said, without a word of thanks for all his kindness; and she begged him, when he saw Mr. Carlyle, to say that with her last breath she humbly implored his forgiveness, and his children\u2019s whom she no longer dared to call hers.\n\nNow this letter, by the officiousness of a servant at the inn to which the sufferers were carried, was taken at once to the post. And, after all, things turned out not quite so bad as anticipated; for when the doctors came to examine the state of Lady Isabel, not cursorily, they found there would be no absolute necessity for the operation contemplated. Fond as the French surgeons are of the knife, to resort to it in this instance would have been cruel, and they proceeded to other means of cure.\n\nThe letter was duly delivered at the town house of Lord Mount Severn, where it was addressed. The countess was sojourning there for a few days; she had quitted it after the season, but some business, or pleasure, had called her again to town. Lord Vane was with her, but the earl was in Scotland. They were at breakfast, she and her son, when the letter was brought in: eighteen pence to pay. Its scrawled address, its foreign aspect, its appearance, altogether, excited her curiosity; in her own mind, she believed she had dropped upon a nice little conjugal mare\u2019s nest.\n\n\u201cI shall open this,\u201d cried she.\n\n\u201cWhy, it is addressed to papa!\u201d exclaimed Lord Vane who possessed all his father\u2019s notions of honor.\n\n\u201cBut such an odd letter! It may require an immediate answer; or is some begging petition, perhaps. Get on with your breakfast.\u201d\n\nLady Mount Severn opened the letter, and with some difficulty spelt through its contents. They shocked even her.\n\n\u201cHow dreadful!\u201d she uttered, in the impulse of the moment.\n\n\u201cWhat is dreadful?\u201d asked Lord Vane, looking up from his breakfast.\n\n\u201cLady Isabel\u2014Isabel Vane\u2014you have not forgotten her?\u201d\n\n\u201cForgotten her!\u201d he echoed. \u201cWhy, mamma, I must possess a funny memory to have forgotten her already.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is dead. She has been killed in a railway accident in France.\u201d\n\nHis large blue eyes, honest and true as they had been in childhood, filled, and his face flushed. He said nothing, for emotion was strong within him.\n\n\u201cBut, shocking as it is, it is better for her,\u201d went on the countess; \u201cfor, poor creature what could her future life had been?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t say it!\u201d impetuously broke out the young viscount. \u201cKilled in a railway accident, and for you to say that it is better for her!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it is better,\u201d said the countess. \u201cDon\u2019t go into heroics, William. You are quite old enough to know that she had brought misery upon herself, and disgrace upon all connected with her. No one could ever have taken notice of her again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would,\u201d said the boy, stoutly.\n\nLady Mount Severn smiled derisively.\n\n\u201cI would. I never liked anybody in the world half so much as I liked Isabel.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s past and gone. You would not have continued to like her, after the disgrace she wrought.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody else wrought more of the disgrace than she did; and, had I been a man, I would have shot him dead,\u201d flashed the viscount.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I!\u201d returned he, not over dutifully. But Lady Mount Severn had not brought him up to be dutiful.\n\n\u201cMay I read the letter, mamma?\u201d he demanded, after a pause.\n\n\u201cIf you can read it,\u201d she replied, tossing it to him. \u201cIt is written in the strangest style; syllables divided, and the words running one into the other. She wrote it herself when she was dying.\u201d\n\nLord Vane took the letter to a window, and stayed looking over it for some time; the countess ate an egg and a plate of ham meanwhile. Presently he came back with it folded, and laid in on the table.\n\n\u201cYou will forward it to papa to-day,\u201d he observed.\n\n\u201cI shall forward it to him. But there\u2019s no hurry; and I don\u2019t exactly know where your papa may be. I shall send the notice of her death to the papers; and I am glad to do it; it is a blight removed from the family.\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma, I do think you are the unkindest woman that ever breathed!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you something to call me unkind for, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d retorted the countess, her color rising. \u201cDock you of your holiday, and pack you back to school to-day.\u201d\n\nA few mornings after this Mr. Carlyle left East Lynne and proceeded to his office as usual. Scarcely was he seated, when Mr. Dill entered, and Mr. Carlyle looked at him inquiringly, for it was not Mr. Carlyle\u2019s custom to be intruded upon by any person until he had opened his letters; then he would ring for Mr. Dill. The letters and the Times newspaper lay on the table before him. The old gentleman came up in a covert, timid sort of way, which made Mr. Carlyle look all the more.\n\n\u201cI beg pardon, sir; will you let me ask if you have heard any particular news?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I have heard it,\u201d replied Mr. Carlyle.\n\n\u201cThen, sir, I beg your pardon a thousand times over. It occurred to me that you probably had not, Mr. Archibald; and I thought I would have said a word to prepare you, before you came upon it suddenly in the paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo prepare me!\u201d echoed Mr. Carlyle, as old Dill was turning away. \u201cWhy, what has come to you, Dill? Are you afraid my nerves are growing delicate, or that I shall faint over the loss of a hundred pounds? At the very most, we shall not suffer above that extent.\u201d\n\nOld Dill turned back again.\n\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t believe you are speaking of the failure of Kent & Green! It\u2019s not that, Mr. Archibald. They won\u2019t affect us much; and there\u2019ll be a dividend, report runs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you have not heard it, sir! I am glad that I\u2019m in time. It might not be well for you to have seen it without a word of preparation, Mr. Archibald.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you have not gone demented, you will tell me what you mean, Dill, and leave me to my letters,\u201d cried Mr. Carlyle, wondering excessively at his sober, matter-of-fact clerk\u2019s words and manner.\n\nOld Dill put his hands upon the Times newspaper.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here, Mr. Archibald, in the column of deaths; the first on the list. Please, prepare yourself a little before you look at it.\u201d\n\nHe shuffled out quickly, and Mr. Carlyle as quickly unfolded the paper. It was, as old Dill said, the first on the list of deaths:\n\n\u201cAt Cammere, in France, on the 18th inst., Isabel Mary, only child of William, late Earl of Mount Severn.\u201d\n\nClients called; Mr. Carlyle\u2019s bell did not ring; an hour or two passed, and old Dill protested that Mr. Carlyle was engaged until he could protest no longer. He went in, deprecatingly. Mr. Carlyle sat yet with the newspaper before him, and the letters unopened at his elbow.\n\n\u201cThere are one or two who will come in, Mr. Archibald\u2014who will see you; what am I to say?\u201d\n\nMr. Carlyle stared at him for a moment, as if his wits had been in the next world. Then he swept the newspaper from before him, and was the calm, collected man of business again.\n\nAs the news of Lady Isabel\u2019s marriage had first come in the knowledge of Lord Mount Severn through the newspapers, so singular to say did the tidings of her death. The next post brought him the letter, which his wife had tardily forwarded. But, unlike Lady Mount Severn, he did not take her death as entirely upon trust; he thought it possible the letter might have been dispatched without its having taken place; and he deemed it incumbent on him to make inquiries. He wrote immediately to the authorities of the town, in the best French he could muster, asking for particulars, and whether she was really dead.\n\nHe received, in due course a satisfactory answer; satisfactory in so far as that it set his doubts at rest. He had inquired after her by her proper name, and title, \u201cLa Dame Isabelle Vane,\u201d and as the authorities could find none of the survivors owning that name, they took it for granted she was dead. They wrote him word that the child and nurse were killed on the spot; two ladies, occupying the same compartment of the carriage, had since died, one of whom was no doubt the mother and lady he inquired for. She was dead and buried, sufficient money having been found upon her person to defray the few necessary expenses.\n\nThus, through no premeditated intention of Lady Isabel, news of her death went forth to Lord Mount Severn and to the world. Her first intimation that she was regarded as dead, was through a copy of that very day\u2019s Times seen by Mr. Carlyle\u2014seen by Lord Mount Severn. An English traveller, who had been amongst the sufferers, and who received the English newspaper daily, sometimes lent them to her to read. She was not travelling under her own name; she left that behind her when she left Grenoble; she had rendered her own too notorious to risk the chance recognition of travellers; and the authorities little thought that the quiet unobtrusive Madame Vine, slowly recovering at the inn, was the Dame Isabella Vane, respecting whom the grand English comte wrote.\n\nLady Isabel understood it at once; that the dispatching of her letter had been the foundation of the misapprehension; and she began to ask herself now, why she should undeceive Lord Mount Severn and the world. She longed, none knew with what intense longings, to be unknown, obscure, totally unrecognized by all; none can know it, till they have put a barrier between themselves and the world, as she had done. The child was gone\u2014happy being! She thought she could never be sufficiently thankful that it was released from the uncertain future\u2014therefore she had not his support to think of. She had only herself; and surely she could with ease earn enough for that; or she could starve; it mattered little which. No, there was no necessity for her continuing to accept the bounty of Lord Mount Severn, and she would let him and everybody else continue to believe that she was dead, and be henceforth only Madame Vine. A resolution she adhered to.\n\nThus the unhappy Isabel\u2019s career was looked upon as run. Lord Mount Severn forwarded her letter to Mr. Carlyle, with the confirmation of her death, which he had obtained from the French authorities.

Hennigan, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, 1974\n\nTHE SEEK BUTTON on the Ford's radio is working. The downtown recedes. Miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. The SEEK function locks on someplace in stereo, college FM probably. \"Yeah,\" a new friend says, \"Whas up. Whas goin on.\" The radio has another button, VOL, which gets jacked repeatedly while the Ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. Not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to RJam Productions in North Dorchester, where black kids from Boston's now-integrated high schools-Latin, Madison Park, Jeremiah Burke, Mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named Schoolly D who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. \"Before we start this next record\u2026,\" Schooly's saying. The record in question is called \"Signifying Rapper,\" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from Side 2 of Schoolly's Smoke Some Kill.\nThe black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then. On the southbound left of the Fitzgerald Expressway pass 20 blocks of grim Irish-Catholic housing projects, the western border of Belfast, complete with Sinn Fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious United Ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused \"Them\" from wherever it is \"They\" live-the Third World fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white South Boston. On the Expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of Haiti, Jamaica and Georgia; a territory that maps of Boston call North Dorchester.\n\nUniting the two sides of the Expressway is just about nothing. Both neighborhoods are tough and poor. Both hate the college world across the river, which, because of Boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen. And kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto Philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from Smoke Some Kill, very much richer.\n\nNot that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when Morgan v. Hennigan, Boston's own Brown v. Board of Education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected Italians were sometimes unwelcome in the Irish precincts east of the Expressway, kids in Boston's Little Belfast sang along with James Brown over the radio.\n\"Say it loud\nI'm black and I'm proud\nSay it loud\nI'm black and I'm proud!\"\n\nExcept that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: Jesus christ, \"I'm proud to be black\" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, Jesus, and you get the hell outta there. And so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.\n\n\"Say it loud\nI'm mmm hum proud\nSay it loud\nMum hum hum proud!\"\n\nBut rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting \"ghetto\" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. How, for example, does the sing-along fan of Smoke Some Kill mumble his way through these lines:\n\n\"Black is beautiful\nBrown is sick? slick? stiff?\nYellow's OK\nBut white ain't shit.\"\n\nRjam Productions, modestly headquartered in a mixed black/Hispanic Field, Corner section of North Dorchester, is as follows:\n\n* One (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block;\n* One (1) touch-tone telephone (leased);\n* Two (2) Chevy Blazers, vanity-plated RJAM1 and RJAM2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased);\n* One (1) VCR with Kathleen Turner's Body Heat cued up on the morning in question;\n* Most importantly, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract\nIf, as has happened to many local labels, Rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. But there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer's gavel. Schoolly D, the original Signifying Rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap \"fanzines\" Hip-Hop and The Source; and Rjam's prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next Schoolly D. Or the next Ice T, or Kool Moe Dee, or L. L. Cool J., or whoever's the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. On this particular morning, the dream is to be the next MC Lyte--a hard-rapping woman known for jams like \"MC Lyte vs. Vanna Whyte\" and \"10% Dis\"--since today is Tam-Tam's day and Tam-Tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the MC Lyte mold who, like MC Lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once.\n\nOr so claims Tam-Tam's producer, promoter, and dutch uncle, Gary Smith, who opened RJam on Martin Luther King's birthday, '89, with his older brother Nate. Nate, the elder statesman, is 25. Gary, 22, runs the company while Nate travels with his boyhood-friend-turned-boss, quadruple-platinum, Prince-derived rapper/singer, Bobby Brown. RJam was founded in part with an investment from the 23-year-old multi-millionaire Brown, a native of Roxbury. Brown now lives in Los Angeles.\n\nNate and Gary Smith turn a healthy profit making demos at $500/tape, but the brothers aren't in the health business. Their aim: to follow in the corporate footsteps of Def Jam, a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in Hollis, Queens, which since its basement days, has given America Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, and much of the rest of that culture-quake called rap. Gary Smith doesn't compare RJam to Def Jam, and, unlike Def Jam's Russell Simmons, Gary produces pop, soul, and R&B as well as straight rap, and actually prefers R&B. But how many sophomores at nearby Jeremiah Burke can afford to dream in R&B, to front music lessons and $500 for an nth-hand sound set-up, find three friends to learn drums, bass and keyboards, and then raise another $500 to make a demo at RJam? Anybody with a larynx can rap, however, and Rjam's brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman, Boston Edison and the Chevrolet Motor Credit Corp.\n\nTwenty minutes farther south on the Fitzgerald Expressway, across the Neponset River and into the pricey suburbs, is the scene of John Cheever's boyhood, more recently celebrated as Massachusetts Miracle country, where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week, four of which will fail within 12 months. RJam's Gary Smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban Chambers of Commerce, sharing their worries about cash flow, overhead, and the enforceability of his contracts; but Gary's world and theirs are as far apart as those of Ward and Eldridge Cleaver. Worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives' seaside homes. In Gary's neighborhood, property values are actually falling.\n\nWaiting less than patiently for Tam-Tam, Gary honks twice. A tall, grave girl with an angel's heart-shaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of RJAM1. She has, apparently, at least two voices, the cynical, sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling Pebbles men ain't worth it, and the whisper in which she now says hello.\n\nAs RJAM1 re-crosses North Dorchester, heading back to the soundproof studios to get the day's work started, Gary and DJ Reese hash out production details. Tam-Tam's a dignified island in the back seat, and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the Motor City in '63 with Berry Gordy and an eighty-pound teenage Diana Ross, just voted Best Dressed at Cass Technical High School, driving crosstown to record a little number called \"Where Did Our Love Go.\"\n\nAsk Tam-Tam about Diana Ross, and she gives a beatific smile. She's 16; she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to, when rap was new and she was 8; Run-DMC or somebody, she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences. Like most of rap's black audience (as distinct from rap's white audience, which is usually a decade older), Tam-Tam has no first-hand recollection of James Brown except as a source for rap. She is too young to have attended segregated schools. She was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in Boston and can't remember the awful day in '74 when \"pro-neighborhood\" marchers from Irish South Boston came upon a black pedestrian at City Hall and beat him with pole-mounted American flags.\n\nTam-Tam has star presence, and like many who do, she seems to see very little of what goes on around her, the price of the star's intense focus on self. She reminds you of Senator Gary Hart. He, too, had star presence. In front of a crowd, Hart was riveting; in the elevator riding up to the auditorium, he was barely there. Being barely there in the neighborhood Tam-Tam calls home is probably not such a bad thing, and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here. Ambition is, finally, a form of hope, a scarce commodity in North Dorchester.\n\nBack in Rjam's control booth, Dj Reese and producer Ralph Stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be \"Ho, You're Guilty.\" Drum parts are taken from a Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the user's choice of drum-matrix. The TR-909's keys, on a console designed to resemble, vaguely, the familiar piano, are named after the sound each creates-bass, snare, mid-tom, hi-tom--and the sounds are named after the actual drums which, until the TR-909, were required to make those sounds. The TR-909 even sports a key named HAND CLAP, making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger, rendering obsolete the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping. The finished \"Ho, You're Guilty\" will sound lush with percussion, melody, and instrumental breaks. Not one human musician will be employed in the recording process.\n\nEach percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track: a snare track, a bass track, a clap track, etc. Reese has been studying the classics lately, too, viz: James Brown's Dead on the Heavy Funk from '75ish, including the ageless groove, \"Funky President,\" in which James announces his third-party candidacy. Some of Bobby Byrd's Dead guitar, and a holy moment when James exhales rhythmically, have been isolated from a store-bought cassette of Dead, re-recorded on clean tape, then re-re-recorded onto a computer-readable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by Ralph Stacey using a Roland D-50 linear synth. The guitar and the exhalation then go, as altered, from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board. Reese, the DJ, will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands.\n\nAs Reese and Ralph Stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape, Tam-Tam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth. You ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf. She doesn't seem to register the question. \"The other career besides rap I'd like to pursue is modelling,\" she says. \"I'm five-seven. That's the perfect height for a model.\"\n\nMixing takes the rest of the day. Producer Ralph Stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question: \"Why do you want to write about rap, anyway?\" It is lucky that at that minute Reese is done mixing. Tomorrow the RJam staff will tape Tam-Tam's vocal track and lay this over Reese's rhythm track. Then the sound will be \"fattened\" with stacks of horns, guitar hooks, bells, canned applause, and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the Rolands. The final demo tape of \"Ho, You're Guilty\" will then be shopped to the 20 major, minor, and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12-inch single.\n\nEveryone's ready to call it a day. Gary Smith's already huddled with some new wanna-be stars in RJam's reception area. Reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth, and Tam-Tam immediately stands, modelling forgotten, utterly alert. Reese gestures to her with maestro hands. She raps at an absent Antoinette in the hard, sexy voice you haven't heard since this morning, extemporaneous but on beat:\n\"I'm a female\nYou're just a fairytale.\"\n\nThe small-w we here are two white Boston males: one native, one oft-transplanted; both residing in Somerbridge, a dim, ethnic-Portuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet. M. is an attorney with a taste for jazz, Blues, funk; D. a grad student and would-be drifter who watches TV instead of sleeping. Our cultural tastes and interests are day and night. They converged only lately, when D's stereo arrived UPS and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable, somewhat furtive, and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called rap/hip-hop.* About our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague & distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing. For instance, we agreed that real or serious rap is not JJ FAD or Tone Loc or Beasties, Egyptian Lover or Fat Boys, not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush. \"Serious\" rap--a unique U.S. inner-city fusion of funk, technified reggae, teen-to-teen \"hardcore\" rock, and the early 70s \"poetry of the black experience\" of Nikki Giavonni, the Last Poets, etc.--has, since its late-70s delivery at the record-scratching hands of Afrika Bambaataa and his Zulu Nation, Sugarhill Gang, Kool Herc and his automated Herculords, and Grandmaster Flash, always had its real roots in the Neighborhood, the black gang-banger Underground. Black music, of and for blacks.\n\nWe concurred as to the wheres and whens of rap's begetting--mid-to-late 70s' South Bronx house parties; then, by decade's end, block parties, with municipal electric lights tapped for a power source, literal dancing in the streets; by '82, regular rap-houses and then \"floating clubs\"--the Roxy every Sunday, The Bronx's Disco Fever TWTh--everybody Breaking to a new musical antimusic being fashioned from records and turntables and an amateur DJs ad-lib banter; a very heavy reggae influence at the beginning; the more rhythmic pure rap an offshoot, its brisker, sparer, backbeat designed for Breakdance, and the smooth-rapping partygoer who just didn't want to shut up when others' music was on. We agreed, too, on rough chronology: amateur house-partiers giving way to professional DJs, pioneers; they, too, then overshadowed by new art-entrepreneurs, former Breakers, failed singers, gag-majorettes; then the rise of \"Indies,\" the tiny independent labels that keep most new music on life-support--Sugar Hill, Jive, Tommy Boy, Wild Pitch, Profile Records, Enjoy--then, after King Tim III's \"Personality Jock\" and Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight,\" an entree into urban black radio; then to underground \"Mix\" radio; then corporate levels, digital technology, very big money, the early-80s talent that became an early Scene's cream--Spoonie G. and Sequence, Eric Fresh, Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover and Run-DMC. Then, Spring '84, the extraordinary Midas touch of Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons' Def Jam label (now under contract to CBS) from which sprang a mid-80s stable of true stars, in the Underground--Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J, Slick Rick, the still-unparalleled Eric B. and Rakim--and L.A.'s alternatives: Kool Moe Dee, L.A. Dream Team, and others. And now, at decade's end, an absolute explosion of rap-as-pop, big business, MTV, special fashions, posters, merchandise, with only a few big, new, cutting-edge acts--L.A.'s N.W.A., Philadelphia's Schoolly D, Miami's 2 Live Crew, De La Soul's House-blend of rap/funk/jazz--remaining too esoteric or threatening or downright obscene to cross all the way over and cash in with big labels. By '89 rap is finally proving as \"important\" (read also lucrative) to an anemic shock-and rebellion-music industry as Punk was an exact decade ago. This was all just data. We agreed on it, and on how it was curious that we both had such strange, distant facts down cold.\n\nOur point of departure, essay-wise, was always less what we know than what we felt, listening: less what we liked than why. For this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap, trying to summon a kind of objective, critical, purely \"aesthetic\" passion that the music itself made impossible. For outsiders, rap's easy to move to, hard to dissect. The more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued, the more we felt that the stuff's appeal for two highbrow, upscale whites was just plain incongruous. Because serious rap has, right from the start, presented itself as a closed show. Usually critical questions of culture, context, background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions. Not here. No question that serious rap is, and is very self-consciously, music by urban blacks about same to and for same. To mainstream whites it's a tight cohesion that can't but look, from outside the cultural window, like occlusion, clannishness (sic) and inbreeding, a kind of reverse snobbery about what's \"def\" and \"fresh\" and in-the-Scene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college Societies and WASP-only country clubs. Serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or Establishment, and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individuals--the Great White Male is rap's Grand Inquisitor, its idiot questioner--its Alien Other no less than Reds were for McCarthy. The music's paranoia, together with its hermetic racial context, helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary.\n\nOther incongruities. Rap is a \"music\" essentially without melody, built instead around a digitally synthesized drum- and back-beat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waiting-room table, enhanced by \"sampled\" (pirated) \"krush grooves\" (licks or repetitive chord-series) conceived and recorded by pre-rap rock icons, the whole affair characterized by a distinctive, spare, noisy, clattering \"style\" whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of low-I amperage around the performative circuit of the MC/rapper and his record-scratching, sound-mixing Sancho Panza, the DJ.\n\nThe rapper (the guy in the cameo cut or Kangol hat, pricey warm-up, unlaced Adidas, extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion) offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight, stressed, rhymed verse, the verse's syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from Nantucket. The lyrics, nearly always self-referential, tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes, themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull. Eg: just how bad/cool/fresh/def the rapper and his lyrics are; just how equally un-all-these his music rivals are; how troublesome, vacuous and acquisitive women are; how wonderful it is to be \"paid in full\" for rapping instead of stealing or dealing; how gangs are really families, 'caine's constant bad news. And, in particular, how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late-80s American glory.\n\nThe masks are many, too many for anything really but direct aural inspection: rap personae can change frequently even within single albums, the rapper delivering Hard, violent Black Nationalist communique on one cut, dubbing against Trinidadian steel drums on another, basking in big label eclat on a third, cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb, cooing to his \"bitch\" and then on the flip side, threatening to go get his gun again if she can't learn who's boss. Though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face, the quintessential rap group is unquintessential, chameleonesque. This is either by weird design, or it's a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness\u2026or most likely, it's just a good old venerable synecdoche of rap's genre itself, one that's now moving so fast it can't quite fix on its own identity -- much less hold still for anything like cool, critical classification or assessment, from outside.\n\nThe MC's Alice Toklas-esque DJ hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black Germanness of a whole lot of digital editing & playback equipment. His responsibility is the song behind and around the rap -- the backbeat, krush groove, and the \"sound carpet,\" i.e. a kind of electric aural environment, a chaos behind the rapper's rhymed order, a digitalized blend of snippets, squeaks, screams, sirens, snatches from pop media, all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of \"samples\" that results. The most recognizable of these samples range from staccato record-scratches to James Brown and Funkadelic licks, to M.L.K.'s public Dream, to quotidian pop pap like \"The Theme from Shaft,\" Brady Bunch dialogue, and '50s detergent commercials.\n\nWe have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hip-hop available in every single on-line periodical ... xcept for one or two underground newsletters (viz. The City Sun, Fresh-Est) circulated in parts of the Bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine China White or AKs. From the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and PhDs, the following has become clear. Outside England, where the Punk-weaned audience has developed a taste for spectacle-through-windows, for vicarious Rage and Protest against circumstances that have exactly 0% to do with them, most of what Rolling Stone calls \"devoted rock consumers\" (meaning we post-baby-boomers), plus almost all established rock critics, tend to regard non-crossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic, or swaggering and bellicose and dangerous--at all events, basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive self-referentiality\u2026in short, as closed to them, to us, as a music. Unrecognizable as what we've been trained and adverted to buy as pop.... Great to dance to, of course, but then what might the white audience for today's mainstream expect? Rap, whether fecund or sterile, is today's pop music's lone cutting edge, the new, the unfamiliar, the brain-resisted-while-body-boogies. And that resisted, alien, exhilarating cutting edge has always been black.\n\n\"What have you left me? what have I got?\nLast night in cold blood my young brother got shot\nMy homey got jacked\nMy mother's on crack\nMy sister can't work cause her arms show tracks\nMadness, insanity\nLive in profanity\nThen some punk claim that they understandin' me?\nGive me a break--what world do you live in?\nDeath is my sex--guess my religion.\"**\n\nWhat makes this stuff so much more disturbing, more real to outsiders than the Punk Rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously? Maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom: I always found it tough to listen straight-faced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit. All doctrine and pronouncement, exclusively anti-, this Punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void, nothing human to grab onto. I have no idea what a Punk performer thinks, feels, is, day-to-day... in fact I always suspected he had no day, but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow. Can you imagine a Punk with four-foot hair and spiked jacket and nose-ring, say, eating a bologna sandwich? Replacing a light bulb? Putting a quarter in a meter? Not me, boy. And even Barnum, who knew fear sells, also knew that freakshows aren't frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance. 0% affinity = 0% empathy. And fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat.\n\nPublic Enemy and N.W.A., Ice T and Schoolly D discomfit us, our friends, the critics we read and cornered, because the Hard rappers' lyrics are conscientious about being of/for the real lives and attitudes of recognizable, if alien, persons. Here's where it's a level up from mere spectacle: ideology in Hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition. This makes rap not only better than Punk, but way scarier. Serious Hard raps afford white listeners genuine, horse's-mouth access to the life-and-death plight and mood of an American community on the genuine edge of im-/explosion, an ugly new sub-nation we've been heretofore conditioned to avoid, remand to the margins, not even see except through certain carefully abstract, attenuating filters.\n\nFor outsiders, rap is hard to dissect, easy to move to. The command is: dance, don't understand; participate, don't manipulate. Rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology. The first is that nu style of speak--the \"dialect drug,\" De La Soul calls it--that rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us. Some in-words, like \"fly,\" meaning \"finelooking,\" have been in coin since the beginning, now venerable as Old English because they turn up on Grandmaster Flash cuts from '82. Others, like \"dead presidents,\" rap for $$, are either coming into or going out of currency, depending on when you read this. Rap, a club language, has myriad ways to describe one's own or others' looks. \"Fly\" is how a man digs a woman. One would never describe oneself as \"fly,\" even when cataloguing one's own attractions (done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps Village Voice personals). \"Fresh\" means irresistibly stylish, oft-modified by \"funky,\" \"crazy,\" or \"stoopid,\" predominantly used to convey the fly-ness of things other than women, including oneself or one's rap, which two concepts rappers, like schizophrenics, can't always keep separate in their heads. \"Dope\" means \"def,\" and \"def\" means crazy funky stoopid fresh. Synonyms include: the shit, the It, the cool, the thang, the word, the grooviest, the categorical imperative, die weltanschung, the that-which-Potter-Stewart-would-know-if-he-saw. A def rapper is so style-defining as to make the stylish mere copycats. To be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machine--not seeking solitude, but rather confident that others will follow. The def rapper MC's a def rap, which rap def-ly tells of its own (and the rapper's) def-ness--so def, as MC/manager, entrepreneur Russell Rush Simmons brags, that it had to be on a label called Def Jam.\n\nRap celebrates power, equating strength with style, and style with the \"I\" in \"Individuality.\" Rappers \"dis\"--dismiss--the styleless, faceless. To \"ill\" is to be weak or wrong; to \"bite\" is to thieve another's dope beat. And only the ill would bite.\n\nEarly remastered pop was the first fake music ever, since what the record buyer of '63 experienced as Aural Event on his turntable couldn't happen live. Rock began to become an Illusion of Event which technology made possible; rock became more like the movies, starting down a long road at the end of which was MTV.\n\nNot that this kept Phil Spector up nights. The gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean, for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price. With each magnetic jump from live, as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes, the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied. Dual high-bias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10,000 units of Elvis Presley, retaped on similar 2-units-per-10,000 tape, became 4 units of hiss; retaped, 8; then 16; then 32. As the sound got fuller, it decayed.\n\nThe solution was a breakthrough called multi-tracking--using recorders that could capture and play back on 2 (as in stereo), 4 (as in '67's then-ear-shattering Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band), 12, 16, and today 24 parallel tracks, eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next. Rhythms, melodies, harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks, allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and re-mix, adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track. Rap Edisons like Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa began as party DJs, not musicians. Their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer, allowing them to \"stack\" the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike, was a kind of crude, extemporaneous multitracking. Technological loops like those in the NASA-esque studios of CBS and Polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys. Carter was President. The Bee Gees, with five Top-Ten hits in twelve months, were king.\n\nDigital recording, the science dividing Rjam's Tam-Tam on tape from Tam-Tam as heard \"live\" is a technology that converts music to codes or \"digits.\" The codes are \"read\" by a computer, one combining sophisticated sound-to-code translation hardware with a number-crunching COS and a high-response synthesizer, at speeds of 40,000 digits per second and up. The recorded sounds, reduced to numbers, can be shaped, mangled, muffled, amplified, and even canonized.*** Hardware then translates the digits, as read and altered, back into sound, which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds. The result: hiss-free reproduction on an infinity of tracks, each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely.\n\nDigital recording, part of the 80s sea-change in how pop gets made, divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer, the engineer at the mixing board, the producer who coordinates the multi-tracking and mixing process, and the electronic hardware that actually \"makes\" the music we buy. The latest synthesizers**** produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations, with voltage-meters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to \"attack-delay envelope\" (another non-rap term, denoting the microtimed, counterpoised quality of a note's duration, how a note's sound/quaver-structure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fades--the manipulation of a piano's foot-pedals, for example, affects the delay component of each note and chord's envelope). The Kurzweil 250, a state-of-the-art system, is a 1-?track/12,018-note synthesizer linked by software to an Apple MacIntosh Plus, which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound. The Kurzweil could put all of culture in a blender--take Janet Leigh's Cremora-curdling scream from Psycho, store it in the Mac, program the synth such that an F# will be reproduced as Janet Leigh's F# scream, then play \"We Shall Overcome\" as if screamed by Janet Leigh; store this; treat similarly Bach's St. Matthew's Passion, except with vast choruses of screaming Janet Leighs, then \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" then \"Twist and Shout\" (by the Isleys, not the Beatles), all as screams; then replay the four as one horrific jumble, or select amidst the jumble; and then whatever you came up with in the final, painstakingly re-mixed mix you could play backwards. And call that \"finished.\" Or never finish. It's like holding music at gunpoint. You can make it do--or do to you --whatever you can think of. Whim is the only limit.\n\nBasically we decided we were into rap because, even media-hype aside, this music had some kind of hard edge to it. Date of composition here is July '89. Think back. This last has been a fiscal year in which Madonna's \"back on top,\" in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts, in which Rod Stewart's out of cryogenics and back on top.... MTV's ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels; Bobby McFerrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synth-reggae invitation to \"Be Happy,\" a song that has the same verbal-pre-packaging feel as \"Where's the Beef?\"\n\nThis last year heavy metal's fake-Satanist male models accounted for 1/2 of total U.S. record sales; U2 filmed a $20,000,000 homage to their own self-righteousness and Bono's ever more ill-disguised megalomania. A year when even good old REM finally went corporate-pop with Green, when good old Springsteen trashed his bride, when as modest and nascent a talent as Tracy Chapman earned cymbal-crashing critical raves for her competent, updated frappe of Baez and Armatrading, so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh. Just not a notable pop year at all. Except in rap. Rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical Scene the way early jazz, rock, the Summer of Love, folk/protest, god even the way New Wave and Punk were \"Scenes\"--the S-word here simultaneously meaning: something new to look at; something loud and upsetting (\"Oh please, Veronica, let's not have a Scene!\"); and, best, an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet, marry and beget. Whether by virtue or default, rap is pretty much what there is to like right now, if you want to regard today's pop as anything more than covert jingles in 4/4-time. In our opinion.\n\nBut so the point is we enjoy it. Plus we've developed some theses about why serious rap is important, both as art-for-own-sake and as a kind of metaphor-with-larynx for a subbed-culture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the American present.\n\nRap is expanding gas-like through the 80s' dry time, growing from house party schtick, gang anthem, a small-label fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimers--then somehow, when we weren't looking, into Scene, movement, On The Air--finally, in the last 24 months, assuming the fecund role of genuine Genre. Exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track. There's now Dub's mix of rap and reggae, House's mix of rap and 70s-, huge-afro'd funk, Acid House's psychedelic hip-hop. There is black rap for white mass-consumption (Tone Loc, Run?DMC), black rap for local set and -house consumption (countless local stars and wanna-be's in every large city), ultra-black rap superstars for the whole marginal Nation inside (Heavy D, Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane), white rap for white masses (the execrable Beastie Boys). There is Hispanic, Salsa-influenced rap out of different West Coast barrios, rap fused with West Indian or Islamic traditional music in Digital Underground, Eric B. and Rakim, and others, or fused with oh-so-danceable R&B in the new \"jack swing\" offshoot (Bobby Brown, MC Hammer); even gay and bohemian young urban Bs have their trendsetters in Teddy Riley and Guy, De La Soul, Kwabe. Etc. etc.***** A major impediment to sampling this Scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the Scene itself is changing. If you're reading this in print it's already dated.\n\nAnd the rap world's vitality is one of replacement as well as variety, allowing the genre to remain fresh, as band after band is seduced into the \"real\" music biz. This Scene is hydra-like. Almost the moment a rap artist like Run-DMC or L. L. Cool J \"breaks through\" into major-market mix appeal, MTV's land of corporate bankability, certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed. The breakthrough band's B-boys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime: after all, they've been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status, about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice. Their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame, of the now-enhanced authority of their \"Message\"--though it's hard to feature Public Enemy rapping about a Black-Militant renaissance, about revolution and American apocalypse, while lily-white CBS Records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats.\n\nNevertheless, back in the underground Scene, the breakthrough band's tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal, to await feverishly \"their\" crew's spots on the same music TV they love to dis. In short, there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late-60s protest rock. Which if you think about it, is passing strange. The white mainstream Other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s \"Establishment\" too look downright benign.\n\nOur opinion, then, from a distance: not only is a serious rap serious poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great 80s Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we've been encouraged sadly to write off,6 it's quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. \"Real\" (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocab, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred and (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn't get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers, doesn't get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership (most of the moved being poets themselves), doesn't generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best PhD-poets rent their names and time ... and especially does not inspire a whole culture's youth to try to follow in their Connecticut-catalogue brogans' prints. Because of rap's meteoric rise, though, you've got poor kids, tough kids, \"underachievers,\" a \"lost generation\"... more young people--ostensibly forever turned off \"language\" by TV, video games and low U.S.D.E. budgets--more of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time, trying to put words together in striking and creative ways, than the U.S.A. has probably ever had at one time. That few of these will become \"stars\" matters far less than the grim stats about, say, the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status: the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values (and values enough to let rap-dissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing) can obviously be applied in mainstream-approved, \"productive\" ways--G.E.D.'s college, Standard Written English ...perhaps someday even ad-copywriting!\n\nBut is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted four-car garages like North Dorchester's RJam's in spite of the genre's near-disciplinary prosodic restrictions, or because of them? Can't really tell. Probably doesn't matter. The fact remains that, were \"important poetry\" presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a Supply-Side democracy (popularity, effect, the separation of fan from his cash), staid journals like Poetry and American Poetry Review would be featuring some number of fade-cut, multiple-earring'd authors' photos in each issue; and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to \"listen rude\" to Wilbur and Levertov and Ashbery, just as e.g Rimbaud and Pound did to their own contemporaries ... to the delight and invigoration of a time's poetry...\n\n... And even just the prospected fantasy of seeing Public Enemy's be-clocked Flavor Fav and like a Jorie Graham or Amy Clampitt sitting down over beer and Celestial Seasonings to hash out the debate over line-breaks in dactylic pentameter, a very serious young homeboy in Italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhyme's renaissance--at least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhyme-as-form--to the cold corridors of Serious Appreciation.\n\nUnlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s, though, rap's own quality, the def freshness of the MC's bit, is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against. In case you thought we forgot, rap is first of all a movement in rock music, and thus the time-honored requirement is that the rap Scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock 'n roll to justify one of its essential roles, rebellion-against. Except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter, spread, grow in urgency--from the 50s' parents and principals, homework, hot rods, the sweet hurt of teen love, to the urban 80s, police, violent death, homelessness, the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry, fatherlessness, the animal emptiness of sex w/o love, the almost Trilaterally sinister White Establishment (\"THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT'S. . . \"), Everyone Else: life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not, about the betrayal of the past, of the promises exacted by Carmichael, X, and the now-formal martyrdom of King.\n\nSegregation may affect their hearts and minds, Earl Warren warned, as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, both alumni of Boston's old separate-but-awful schools, bear loud witness. Now, 40 years after X disgustedly quit a racist high school and began a career as a kind of be-bop gang-banger, 35 years after Brown v. Board of Education invented integration, 15 years after Morgan v. Hennigan brought Brown to Boston, North Dorchester is worse and its schools aren't better. A former United States Secretary of Education converts to Drug Czar, symbolizing a national change of mind: now drugs, not poor schools (and certainly not the American apartheid of which segregated schools were but one facet), is our root \"innercity\" problem. Tam-Tam's Boston is strangely less hopeful than the notoriously segregated pre-Hennigan city, perhaps because before Hennigan reformers could promise that segregation was why things were so bad. Segregation was blame's bullseye: abolish the bullseye, and blame for the estrangement of the races flies everywhere, hitting the cops, or the courts, or the teachers, or the taught, or what's taught. There's even a rap--B.D.P.'s \"Why is That?\"--blaming our miseries on the failure of the schools to \"teach black kids to be black.\"\n\nBut everything the white rock listener pays to enjoy is black-begotten. If today's Top?40 environment seems bleak or befouled, imagine the present mainstream without its sweetest sourcewaters, without the King-Waters-King Blues trinity, the Brownian soul, the backbeat, cut time, blue notes, funky French curves of sax and brass, the guitar solo, call-and-response, the Cold Medina or Lucky Powder, those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits, the single hand in the white glove holding Pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames.... Black music is American pop's breath and bread; and we, as both born audience and born salesmen, know it.\n\nSo maybe it's them. Them. Maybe we're approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the white-run entertainment industry will have to pack up what it's taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities. Maybe, in serious rap, the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned, part of a neo-Nationalist agenda, the hermetic new Scene's tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat.\n\nYou may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete. And, hazier, of how complicated this stuff of sampler-from-outside can be. What's remained passing strange, for use, is the vague threat's appeal. The unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love. Whence the fear, though, is really no matter. For look at the world, at the masses we're part of. At what you look at closest. The plain 80s data is that, whereas love, devotion, passion seem only to divide, it's fear and strangeness that bind crowds, fill halls, unite Us, somehow, as audience, under the great tent.\n\n*'Hip-hop' is an older synonym, coined by Rap pioneer, Kool Herc, to describe the heavily danceable Jamaican scatting he introduced between records at the huge South Bronx block parties he and other new-Scene celebrities, like Jazzy Five and former Black Spades leader, Afrika Bambaataa, could turn into late-70s frenzies of Breakdance (both music and dance a self-conscious reaction against the glittered unreality of downtown Disco).\n\n**Except but now hey kids! thanks to AT&T you can now speak directly to Ice T and hear his philosophy of life by phone! 1-900-907-9111. \"Chill out with Ice T,\" the rapper adrape in military hardware and ammunition says on MTV, \"I'm just waiting on you to call me,\" pointing at the camera and then himself lest the audience get at all confused. \"Don't forget to ask your parent's permission first\" (white corporate voice-over)--$2.00 first minute, etc. etc.\n\n***\"Canon\" being another non-jive rap term, meaning the division of a single sequence of sound into two or more repeating sound-sequences, like a vocal round.\n\n**** ... themselves the heirs of a long, 20th-century evolutionary process, from the playe-?piano to the 20s Oncles Martenot and Theremin and Trautonium (crude electronic instruments big in France), to Pierre Schaeffer's musique concrete in '48, to the first Electronic Music Synthesizer invented by engineers at RCA in the 50s to the inauguration of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in '59, to Robert Moog's '64 development of the Moog 55, the first emitter of amplified \"blurps, fwipps, simps, twings, and schlonks\" to be commercially produceable. Walter/Wendy Carlos used a Moog 55 for his/her '68 Switched-On Bach, an album that did more than anything to popularize synthesized sound.\n\n***** Note how the ecstatic force's movement extends beyond sound into dance-Chicago-based house-dancing is very different from Coast-based rap-dancing, while both are distinct from the Quaalude sway a De La Soul's lazy complexity invites--and beyond dance into urban haute couture itself. The \"cameo\" or \"fade,\" that troubling cyberpunk flat-top haircut favored by Carl Lewis and Grace Jones but popularized by the group Cameo's rapping Larry Blackmon, has now become less a haircut than a sculptural statement: words, logos, slogans and complex signs razored into the rigid anvil of hair that is, according to the Voice, \"the most culturally conscious unisex hairstyle since the afro.\" The standard 80s-rap uniform--sideways baseball cap or Kangol, ropey chains, acetate warmup and unlaced hightops--\"...now symbolizes a cruder, more casual era,\" and is diffracting into a rap-House-gay-jackswing look replete with polka-dot ties, loose pleated twills, and expensive dance-loafers or British \"moon boots,\" a combination Ricky Ricardo-Frank Sinatra dapper that now befits a Scene with the dignity, silliness and pull of real Genre. Plus don't forget that just one big change in street and school fashions means millions and millions in garment revenue--even more $$ once the white mainstream, as is its won't, follows in the cutting edge's media-delayed wake.\n\n****** \"We've lost a whole generation to their own culture out here,\" rues an LAPD Assistant Commissioner in a 14 May '89 Boston TV news special on the national Wa-?On gangs, drugs, crime, Others\u20269Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/4437209", "artist_names": "URLtv (Ft.

Breyer, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which Stevens, J., joined, and in which Souter and Ginsburg, JJ., joined as to Part IA, post, p. 655.\n\n*601Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court.In these cases we consider the constitutionality of 42 U. S. C.  13981, which provides a federal civil remedy for the *602 victims of gender-motivated violence. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, struck down  13981 because it concluded that Congress lacked constitutional authority to enact the section's civil remedy. Believing that these cases are controlled by our decisions in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 (1883), and the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883), we affirm.IPetitioner Christy Brzonkala enrolled at Virginia Polytechnic Institute (Virginia Tech) in the fall of 1994. In September of that year, Brzonkala met respondents Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, who were both students at Virginia Tech and members of its varsity football team. Brzonkala alleges that, within 30 minutes of meeting Morrison and Crawford, they assaulted and repeatedly raped her. After the attack, Morrison allegedly told Brzonkala, \"You better not have any . . . diseases.\" Complaint  22. In the months following the rape, Morrison also allegedly announced in the dormitory's dining room that he \"like[d] to get girls drunk and . . . .\" Id.,  31. The omitted portions, quoted verbatim in the briefs on file with this Court, consist of boasting, debased remarks about what Morrison would do to women, vulgar remarks that cannot fail to shock and offend.\n\nBrzonkala alleges that this attack caused her to become severely emotionally disturbed and depressed. She sought assistance from a university psychiatrist, who prescribed *603 antidepressant medication. Shortly after the rape Brzonkala stopped attending classes and withdrew from the university.\nIn early 1995, Brzonkala filed a complaint against respondents under Virginia Tech's Sexual Assault Policy. During the school-conducted hearing on her complaint, Morrison admitted having sexual contact with her despite the fact that she had twice told him \"no.\" After the hearing, Virginia Tech's Judicial Committee found insufficient evidence to punish Crawford, but found Morrison guilty of sexual assault and sentenced him to immediate suspension for two semesters.\n\nVirginia Tech's dean of students upheld the judicial committee's sentence. However, in July 1995, Virginia Tech informed Brzonkala that Morrison intended to initiate a court challenge to his conviction under the Sexual Assault Policy. University officials told her that a second hearing would be necessary to remedy the school's error in prosecuting her complaint under that policy, which had not been widely circulated to students. The university therefore conducted a second hearing under its Abusive Conduct Policy, which was in force prior to the dissemination of the Sexual Assault Policy. Following this second hearing the Judicial Committee again found Morrison guilty and sentenced him to an identical 2-semester suspension. This time, however, the description of Morrison's offense was, without explanation, changed from \"sexual assault\" to \"using abusive language.\"\n\nMorrison appealed his second conviction through the university's administrative system. On August 21, 1995, Virginia Tech's senior vice president and provost set aside Morrison's punishment. She concluded that it was \"`excessive when compared with other cases where there has been a finding of violation of the Abusive Conduct Policy,' \" Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ., 132 F. 3d 950, 955 (CA4 1997). Virginia Tech did not inform Brzonkala of this decision. After learning from a *604 newspaper that Morrison would be returning to Virginia Tech for the fall 1995 semester, she dropped out of the university.\n\nIn December 1995, Brzonkala sued Morrison, Crawford, and Virginia Tech in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Her complaint alleged that Morrison's and Crawford's attack violated  13981 and that Virginia Tech's handling of her complaint violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 86 Stat. 373-375, 20 U. S. C.  1681-1688. Morrison and Crawford moved to dismiss this complaint on the grounds that it failed to state a claim and that  13981's civil remedy is unconstitutional. The United States, petitioner in No. 99-5, intervened to defend  13981's constitutionality.\n\nThe District Court dismissed Brzonkala's Title IX claims against Virginia Tech for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 935 F. Supp. 772 (WD Va. 1996). It then held that Brzonkala's complaint stated a claim against Morrison and Crawford under  13981, but dismissed the complaint because it concluded that Congress lacked authority to enact the section under either the Commerce Clause or  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 935 F. Supp. 779 (WD Va. 1996).\n\nA divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court, reinstating Brzonkala's  13981 claim and her Title IX hostile environment claim.[1]Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 132 F. 3d 949 (CA4 1997). The full Court of Appeals vacated the panel's opinion and reheard the case en banc. The en banc court then issued an opinion affirming the District Court's conclusion that Brzonkala stated a claim under  13981 because her complaint alleged a crime of violence and the allegations of Morrison's crude and derogatory statements regarding his *605 treatment of women sufficiently indicated that his crime was motivated by gender animus.[2] Nevertheless, the court by a divided vote affirmed the District Court's conclusion that Congress lacked constitutional authority to enact  13981's civil remedy. Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic and State Univ., 169 F. 3d 820 (CA4 1999). Because the Court of Appeals invalidated a federal statute on constitutional grounds, we granted certiorari. 527 U. S. 1068 (1999).\n\nSection 13981 was part of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994,  40302, 108 Stat. 1941-1942. It states that \"[a]ll persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender.\" 42 U. S. C.  13981(b). To enforce that right, subsection (c) declares:\"A person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.\"Section 13981 defines a \"crim[e] of violence motivated by gender\" as \"a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an *606 animus based on the victim's gender.\"  13981(d)(1). It also provides that the term \"crime of violence\" includes any\"(A) . . . act or series of acts that would constitute a felony against the person or that would constitute a felony against property if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, and that would come within the meaning of State or Federal offenses described in section 16 of Title 18, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction and whether or not those acts were committed in the special maritime, territorial, or prison jurisdiction of the United States; and \"(B) includes an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony described in subparagraph (A) but for the relationship between the person who takes such action and the individual against whom such action is taken.\"  13981(d)(2).Further clarifying the broad scope of  13981's civil remedy, subsection (e)(2) states that \"[n]othing in this section requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section.\" And subsection (e)(3) provides a  13981 litigant with a choice of forums: Federal and state courts \"shall have concurrent jurisdiction\" over complaints brought under the section.\n\nAlthough the foregoing language of  13981 covers a wide swath of criminal conduct, Congress placed some limitations on the section's federal civil remedy. Subsection (e)(1) states that \"[n]othing in this section entitles a person to a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, to be motivated by gender.\" Subsection (e)(4) further states that  13981 shall not be construed \"to confer on the courts of the United States jurisdiction over any State law claim seeking *607 the establishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribution of marital property, or child custody decree.\"\n\nEvery law enacted by Congress must be based on one or more of its powers enumerated in the Constitution. \"The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written.\" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.). Congress explicitly identified the sources of federal authority on which it relied in enacting  13981. It said that a \"Federal civil rights cause of action\" is established \"[p]ursuant to the affirmative power of Congress . . . under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under section 8 of Article I of the Constitution.\" 42 U. S. C.  13981(a). We address Congress' authority to enact this remedy under each of these constitutional provisions in turn.IIDue respect for the decisions of a coordinate branch of Government demands that we invalidate a congressional enactment only upon a plain showing that Congress has exceeded its constitutional bounds. See United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 568, 577-578 (Kennedy, J., concurring); United States v. Harris, 106 U. S., at 635. With this presumption of constitutionality in mind, we turn to the question whether  13981 falls within Congress' power under Article I,  8, of the Constitution. Brzonkala and the United States rely upon the third clause of the section, which gives Congress power \"[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.\"\n\nAs we discussed at length in Lopez, our interpretation of the Commerce Clause has changed as our Nation has developed. See 514 U. S., at 552-557; id., at 568-574 (Kennedy, J., concurring); id., at 584, 593-599 (Thomas, J., concurring). We need not repeat that detailed review of *608 the Commerce Clause's history here; it suffices to say that, in the years since NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,  301 U. S. 1 (1937), Congress has had considerably greater latitude in regulating conduct and transactions under the Commerce Clause than our previous case law permitted. See Lopez, 514 U. S., at 555-556; id., at 573-574 (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n\nLopez emphasized, however, that even under our modern, expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause, Congress' regulatory authority is not without effective bounds. Id., at 557.\"[E]ven [our] modern-era precedents which have expanded congressional power under the Commerce Clause confirm that this power is subject to outer limits. In Jones & Laughlin Steel, the Court warned that the scope of the interstate commerce power `must be considered in the light of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them, in view of our complex society, would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government.' \" Id., at 556-557 (quoting Jones & Laughlin Steel, supra, at 37).[3]As we observed in Lopez, modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence has \"identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power.\" *609 514 U. S., at 558 (citing Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 276-277 (1981); Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146, 150 (1971)). \"First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce.\" 514 U. S., at 558 (citing Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 256 (1964); United States  v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 114 (1941)). \"Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities.\" 514 U. S., at 558 (citing Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914); Southern R. Co. v. United States,  222 U. S. 20 (1911); Perez, supra, at 150). \"Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, . . . i. e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\" 514 U. S., at 558-559 (citing Jones & Laughlin Steel, supra, at 37).\n\nPetitioners do not contend that these cases fall within either of the first two of these categories of Commerce Clause regulation. They seek to sustain  13981 as a regulation of activity that substantially affects interstate commerce. Given  13981's focus on gender-motivated violence wherever it occurs (rather than violence directed at the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, interstate markets, or things or persons in interstate commerce), we agree that this is the proper inquiry.\n\nSince Lopez most recently canvassed and clarified our case law governing this third category of Commerce Clause regulation, it provides the proper framework for conducting the required analysis of  13981. In Lopez, we held that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, 18 U. S. C.  922(q)(1)(A), which made it a federal crime to knowingly possess a firearm in a school zone, exceeded Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause. See 514 U. S., at 551. Several significant considerations contributed to our decision.\n*610 First, we observed that  922(q) was \"a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with `commerce' or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms.\" Id., at 561. Reviewing our case law, we noted that \"we have upheld a wide variety of congressional Acts regulating intrastate economic activity where we have concluded that the activity substantially affected interstate commerce.\" Id., at 559. Although we cited only a few examples, including Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942); Hodel, supra; Perez, supra; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964); and Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, we stated that the pattern of analysis is clear. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 559-560. \"Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained.\" Id., at 560.\n\nBoth petitioners and Justice Souter's dissent downplay the role that the economic nature of the regulated activity plays in our Commerce Clause analysis. But a fair reading of Lopez shows that the noneconomic, criminal nature of the conduct at issue was central to our decision in that case. See, e. g., id., at 551 (\"The Act [does not] regulat[e] a commercial activity\"), 560 (\"Even Wickard, which is perhaps the most far reaching example of Commerce Clause authority over intrastate activity, involved economic activity in a way that the possession of a gun in a school zone does not\"), 561 (\"Section 922(q) is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity\"), 566 (\"Admittedly, a determination whether an intrastate activity is commercial or noncommercial may in some cases result in legal uncertainty. But, so long as Congress' authority is limited to those powers enumerated in the Constitution, and so long as those enumerated powers are interpreted as having judicially enforceable outer limits, congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause always will engender `legal uncertainty' \"), 567 (\"The possession of a gun in a local school zone is in no sense an economic activity that might, through repetition *611 elsewhere, substantially affect any sort of interstate commerce\"); see also id., at 573-574 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (stating that Lopez did not alter our \"practical conception of commercial regulation\" and that Congress may \"regulate in the commercial sphere on the assumption that we have a single market and a unified purpose to build a stable national economy\"), 577 (\"Were the Federal Government to take over the regulation of entire areas of traditional state concern, areas having nothing to do with the regulation of commercial activities, the boundaries between the spheres of federal and state authority would blur\"), 580 (\"[U]nlike the earlier cases to come before the Court here neither the actors nor their conduct has a commercial character, and neither the purposes nor the design of the statute has an evident commercial nexus. The statute makes the simple possession of a gun within 1,000 feet of the grounds of the school a criminal offense. In a sense any conduct in this interdependent world of ours has an ultimate commercial origin or consequence, but we have not yet said the commerce power may reach so far\" (citation omitted)). Lopez `s review of Commerce Clause case law demonstrates that in those cases where we have sustained federal regulation of intrastate activity based upon the activity's substantial effects on interstate commerce, the activity in question has been some sort of economic endeavor. See id., at 559-560.[4]\n\nThe second consideration that we found important in analyzing  922(q) was that the statute contained \"no express jurisdictional element which might limit its reach to a discrete set of firearm possessions that additionally have *612 an explicit connection with or effect on interstate commerce.\" Id., at 562. Such a jurisdictional element may establish that the enactment is in pursuance of Congress' regulation of interstate commerce.\n\nThird, we noted that neither  922(q) \"`nor its legislative history contain[s] express congressional findings regarding the effects upon interstate commerce of gun possession in a school zone.' \" Ibid. (quoting Brief for United States, O. T. 1994, No. 93-1260, pp. 5-6). While \"Congress normally is not required to make formal findings as to the substantial burdens that an activity has on interstate commerce,\" 514 U. S., at 562 (citing McClung, supra, at 304; Perez, 402 U. S., at 156), the existence of such findings may \"enable us to evaluate the legislative judgment that the activity in question substantially affect[s] interstate commerce, even though no such substantial effect [is] visible to the naked eye.\" 514 U. S., at 563.\n\nFinally, our decision in Lopez rested in part on the fact that the link between gun possession and a substantial effect on interstate commerce was attenuated. Id., at 563-567. The United States argued that the possession of guns may lead to violent crime, and that violent crime \"can be expected to affect the functioning of the national economy in two ways. First, the costs of violent crime are substantial, and, through the mechanism of insurance, those costs are spread throughout the population. Second, violent crime reduces the willingness of individuals to travel to areas within the country that are perceived to be unsafe.\" Id.,  at 563-564 (citation omitted). The Government also argued that the presence of guns at schools poses a threat to the educational process, which in turn threatens to produce a less efficient and productive work force, which will negatively affect national productivity and thus interstate commerce. Ibid.\n\nWe rejected these \"costs of crime\" and \"national productivity\" arguments because they would permit Congress *613 to \"regulate not only all violent crime, but all activities that might lead to violent crime, regardless of how tenuously they relate to interstate commerce.\" Id., at 564. We noted that, under this but-for reasoning:\"Congress could regulate any activity that it found was related to the economic productivity of individual citizens: family law (including marriage, divorce, and child custody), for example. Under the[se] theories . . . , it is difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law enforcement or education where States historically have been sovereign. Thus, if we were to accept the Government's arguments, we are hard pressed to posit any activity by an individual that Congress is without power to regulate.\" Ibid. With these principles underlying our Commerce Clause jurisprudence as reference points, the proper resolution of the present cases is clear. Gender-motivated crimes of violence are not, in any sense of the phrase, economic activity. While we need not adopt a categorical rule against aggregating the effects of any noneconomic activity in order to decide these cases, thus far in our Nation's history our cases have upheld Commerce Clause regulation of intrastate activity only where that activity is economic in nature. See, e. g., id., at 559-560, and the cases cited therein.\n\nLike the Gun-Free School Zones Act at issue in Lopez,   13981 contains no jurisdictional element establishing that the federal cause of action is in pursuance of Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce. Although Lopez makes clear that such a jurisdictional element would lend support to the argument that  13981 is sufficiently tied to interstate commerce, Congress elected to cast  13981's remedy over a wider, and more purely intrastate, body of violent crime.[5]\n*614 In contrast with the lack of congressional findings that we faced in Lopez,  13981 is supported by numerous findings regarding the serious impact that gender-motivated violence has on victims and their families. See, e. g., H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, p. 385 (1994); S. Rep. No. 103-138, p. 40 (1993); S. Rep. No. 101-545, p. 33 (1990). But the existence of congressional findings is not sufficient, by itself, to sustain the constitutionality of Commerce Clause legislation. As we stated in Lopez, \"`[S]imply because Congress may conclude that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce does not necessarily make it so.' \" 514 U. S., at 557, n. 2 (quoting Hodel, 452 U. S., at 311 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment)). Rather, \"`[w]hether particular operations affect interstate commerce sufficiently to come under the constitutional power of Congress to regulate them is ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question, and can be settled finally only by this Court.' \" 514 U. S., at 557, n. 2 (quoting Heart of Atlanta Motel, 379 U. S., at 273 (Black, J., concurring)).\n\n*615 In these cases, Congress' findings are substantially weakened by the fact that they rely so heavily on a method of reasoning that we have already rejected as unworkable if we are to maintain the Constitution's enumeration of powers. Congress found that gender-motivated violence affects interstate commerce\"by deterring potential victims from traveling interstate, from engaging in employment in interstate business, and from transacting with business, and in places involved in interstate commerce; . . . by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products.\" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, at 385.Accord, S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 54. Given these findings and petitioners' arguments, the concern that we expressed in Lopez that Congress might use the Commerce Clause to completely obliterate the Constitution's distinction between national and local authority seems well founded. See Lopez, supra, at 564. The reasoning that petitioners advance seeks to follow the but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence of violent crime (the suppression of which has always been the prime object of the States' police power) to every attenuated effect upon interstate commerce. If accepted, petitioners' reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crime as long as the nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption. Indeed, if Congress may regulate gendermotivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or any other type of violence since gender-motivated violence, as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to have lesser economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a part.\n\nPetitioners' reasoning, moreover, will not limit Congress to regulating violence but may, as we suggested in Lopez,  be applied equally as well to family law and other areas of traditional state regulation since the aggregate effect of *616 marriage, divorce, and childrearing on the national economy is undoubtedly significant. Congress may have recognized this specter when it expressly precluded  13981 from being used in the family law context.[6] See 42 U. S. C.  13981(e)(4). Under our written Constitution, however, the limitation of congressional authority is not solely a matter of legislative grace.[7] See Lopez, supra, at 575-579 (Kennedy, J., concurring); Marbury, 1 Cranch, at 176-178.\n\n*617 We accordingly reject the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic, violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregate effect on interstate commerce. The Constitution requires a distinction between what is *618 truly national and what is truly local. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 568 (citing Jones & Laughlin Steel, 301 U. S., at 30). In recognizing this fact we preserve one of the few principles that has been consistent since the Clause was adopted. The regulation and punishment of intrastate violence that is not directed at the instrumentalities, channels, or goods involved in interstate commerce has always been the province of the States. See, e. g., Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 426, 428 (1821) (Marshall, C. J.) (stating that Congress \"has no general right to punish murder committed within any of the States,\" and that it is \"clear . . . that congress cannot punish felonies generally\"). Indeed, we can think of no better example of the police power, which the Founders denied the National Government and reposed in the States, than the suppression of violent crime and vindication of its victims.[8] See, e. g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566 (\"The Constitution . . . withhold[s] from Congress a plenary police power\"); id., at 584-585 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\"[W]e always have rejected readings *619 of the Commerce Clause and the scope of federal power that would permit Congress to exercise a police power\"), 596-597, and n. 6 (noting that the first Congresses did not enact nationwide punishments for criminal conduct under the Commerce Clause).IIIBecause we conclude that the Commerce Clause does not provide Congress with authority to enact  13981, we address petitioners' alternative argument that the section's civil remedy should be upheld as an exercise of Congress' remedial power under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. As noted above, Congress expressly invoked the Fourteenth Amendment as a source of authority to enact  13981.\n\nThe principles governing an analysis of congressional legislation under  5 are well settled. Section 5 states that Congress may \"`enforce' by `appropriate legislation' the constitutional guarantee that no State shall deprive any person of `life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,' nor deny any person `equal protection of the laws.' \" City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U. S. 507, 517 (1997). Section 5 is \"a positive grant of legislative power,\" Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641, 651 (1966), that includes authority to \"prohibi[t] conduct which is not itself unconstitutional and [to] intrud[e] into `legislative spheres of autonomy previously reserved to the States.' \" Flores, supra, at 518 (quoting Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 455 (1976)); see also Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 81 (2000). However, \"[a]s broad as the congressional enforcement power is, it is not unlimited.\" Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112, 128 (1970); see also Kimel, supra, at 81. In fact, as we discuss in detail below, several limitations inherent in  5's text and constitutional context have been recognized since the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted.\n\nPetitioners'  5 argument is founded on an assertion that there is pervasive bias in various state justice systems against victims of gender-motivated violence. This assertion *620 is supported by a voluminous congressional record. Specifically, Congress received evidence that many participants in state justice systems are perpetuating an array of erroneous stereotypes and assumptions. Congress concluded that these discriminatory stereotypes often result in insufficient investigation and prosecution of gendermotivated crime, inappropriate focus on the behavior and credibility of the victims of that crime, and unacceptably lenient punishments for those who are actually convicted of gender-motivated violence. See H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103 711, at 385-386; S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 38, 41-55; S. Rep. No. 102-197, at 33-35, 41, 43-47. Petitioners contend that this bias denies victims of gender-motivated violence the equal protection of the laws and that Congress therefore acted appropriately in enacting a private civil remedy against the perpetrators of gender-motivated violence to both remedy the States' bias and deter future instances of discrimination in the state courts.\nAs our cases have established, state-sponsored gender discrimination violates equal protection unless it \"`serves \"important governmental objectives and . . . the discriminatory means employed\" are \"substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\"` \" United States v. Virginia, 518 U. S. 515, 533 (1996) (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U. S. 718, 724 (1982), in turn quoting Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U. S. 142, 150 (1980)). See also Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 198-199 (1976). However, the language and purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment place certain limitations on the manner in which Congress may attack discriminatory conduct. These limitations are necessary to prevent the Fourteenth Amendment from obliterating the Framers' carefully crafted balance of power between the States and the National Government. See Flores, supra, at 520-524 (reviewing the history of the Fourteenth Amendment's enactment and discussing the contemporary belief that the Amendment \"`does *621 not concentrate power in the general government for any purpose of police government within the States' \") (quoting T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 294, n. 1 (2d ed. 1871)). Foremost among these limitations is the time-honored principle that the Fourteenth Amendment, by its very terms, prohibits only state action. \"[T]he principle has become firmly embedded in our constitutional law that the action inhibited by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment is only such action as may fairly be said to be that of the States. That Amendment erects no shield against merely private conduct, however discriminatory or wrongful.\" Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 13, and n. 12 (1948).\n\nShortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, we decided two cases interpreting the Amendment's provisions, United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 (1883), and the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883). In Harris, the Court considered a challenge to  2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871. That section sought to punish \"private persons\" for \"conspiring to deprive any one of the equal protection of the laws enacted by the State.\" 106 U. S., at 639. We concluded that this law exceeded Congress'  5 power because the law was \"directed exclusively against the action of private persons, without reference to the laws of the State, or their administration by her officers.\" Id., at 640. In so doing, we reemphasized our statement from Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 318 (1880), that \"`these provisions of the fourteenth amendment have reference to State action exclusively, and not to any action of private individuals.' \" Harris, supra, at 639 (misquotation in Harris ).\n\nWe reached a similar conclusion in the Civil Rights Cases.  In those consolidated cases, we held that the public accommodation provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which applied to purely private conduct, were beyond the scope of the  5 enforcement power. 109 U. S., at 11 (\"Individual invasion of individual rights is not the subject-matter of the [Fourteenth] [A]mendment\"). See also, e. g., Romer v. *622 Evans, 517 U. S. 620, 628 (1996) (\"[I]t was settled early that the Fourteenth Amendment did not give Congress a general power to prohibit discrimination in public accommodations\"); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U. S. 922, 936 (1982) (\"Careful adherence to the `state action' requirement preserves an area of individual freedom by limiting the reach of federal law and federal judicial power\"); Blum v. Yaretsky,  457 U. S. 991, 1002 (1982); Moose Lodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U. S. 163, 172 (1972); Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398 U. S. 144, 147, n. 2 (1970); United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 554 (1876) (\"The fourteenth amendment prohibits a state from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; but this adds nothing to the rights of one citizen as against another. It simply furnishes an additional guaranty against any encroachment by the States upon the fundamental rights which belong to every citizen as a member of society\").\n\nThe force of the doctrine of stare decisis behind these decisions stems not only from the length of time they have been on the books, but also from the insight attributable to the Members of the Court at that time. Every Member had been appointed by President Lincoln, Grant, Hayes, Garfield, or Arthurand each of their judicial appointees obviously had intimate knowledge and familiarity with the events surrounding the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nPetitioners contend that two more recent decisions have in effect overruled this longstanding limitation on Congress'  5 authority. They rely on United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745 (1966), for the proposition that the rule laid down in the Civil Rights Cases is no longer good law. In Guest, the Court reversed the construction of an indictment under 18 U. S. C.  241, saying in the course of its opinion that \"we deal here with issues of statutory construction, not with issues of constitutional power.\" 383 U. S., at 749. Three Members of the Court, in a separate opinion by Justice Brennan, expressed the view that the Civil Rights Cases *623 were wrongly decided, and that Congress could under  5 prohibit actions by private individuals. 383 U. S., at 774 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). Three other Members of the Court, who joined the opinion of the Court, joined a separate opinion by Justice Clark which in two or three sentences stated the conclusion that Congress could \"punis[h] all conspiracieswith or without state actionthat interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights.\" Id., at 762 (concurring opinion). Justice Harlan, in another separate opinion, commented with respect to the statement by these Justices:\"The action of three of the Justices who joined the Court's opinion in nonetheless cursorily pronouncing themselves on the far-reaching constitutional questions deliberately not reached in Part II seems to me, to say the very least, extraordinary.\" Id., at 762, n. 1 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).Though these three Justices saw fit to opine on matters not before the Court in Guest, the Court had no occasion to revisit the Civil Rights Cases and Harris, having determined \"the indictment [charging private individuals with conspiring to deprive blacks of equal access to state facilities] in fact contain[ed] an express allegation of state involvement.\" 383 U. S., at 756. The Court concluded that the implicit allegation of \"active connivance by agents of the State\" eliminated any need to decide \"the threshold level that state action must attain in order to create rights under the Equal Protection Clause.\" Ibid. All of this Justice Clark explicitly acknowledged. See id., at 762 (concurring opinion) (\"The Court's interpretation of the indictment clearly avoids the question whether Congress, by appropriate legislation, has the power to punish private conspiracies that interfere with Fourteenth Amendment rights, such as the right to utilize public facilities\").\n\n*624 To accept petitioners' argument, moreover, one must add to the three Justices joining Justice Brennan's reasoned explanation for his belief that the Civil Rights Cases were wrongly decided, the three Justices joining Justice Clark's opinion who gave no explanation whatever for their similar view. This is simply not the way that reasoned constitutional adjudication proceeds. We accordingly have no hesitation in saying that it would take more than the naked dicta contained in Justice Clark's opinion, when added to Justice Brennan's opinion, to cast any doubt upon the enduring vitality of the Civil Rights Cases and Harris.\n\nPetitioners also rely on District of Columbia v. Carter,  409 U. S. 418 (1973). Carter was a case addressing the question whether the District of Columbia was a \"State\" within the meaning of Rev. Stat.  1979, 42 U. S. C.  1983a section which by its terms requires state action before it may be employed. A footnote in that opinion recites the same litany respecting Guest that petitioners rely on. This litany is of course entirely dicta, and in any event cannot rise above its source. We believe that the description of the  5 power contained in the Civil Rights Cases is correct:\"But where a subject is not submitted to the general legislative power of Congress, but is only submitted thereto for the purpose of rendering effective some prohibition against particular [s]tate legislation or [s]tate action in reference to that subject, the power given is limited by its object, and any legislation by Congress in the matter must necessarily be corrective in its character, adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited state laws or proceedings of [s]tate officers.\" 109 U. S., at 18.Petitioners alternatively argue that, unlike the situation in the Civil Rights Cases, here there has been gender-based disparate treatment by state authorities, whereas in those cases there was no indication of such state action. There is *625 abundant evidence, however, to show that the Congresses that enacted the Civil Rights Acts of 1871 and 1875 had a purpose similar to that of Congress in enacting  13981: There were state laws on the books bespeaking equality of treatment, but in the administration of these laws there was discrimination against newly freed slaves. The statement of Representative Garfield in the House and that of Senator Sumner in the Senate are representative:\"[T]he chief complaint is not that the laws of the State are unequal, but that even where the laws are just and equal on their face, yet, by a systematic maladministration of them, or a neglect or refusal to enforce their provisions, a portion of the people are denied equal protection under them.\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 153 (1871) (statement of Rep. Garfield).\"The Legislature of South Carolina has passed a law giving precisely the rights contained in your `supplementary civil rights bill.' But such a law remains a dead letter on her statute-books, because the State courts, comprised largely of those whom the Senator wishes to obtain amnesty for, refuse to enforce it.\" Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 2d Sess., 430 (1872) (statement of Sen. Sumner).See also, e. g., Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., at 653 (statement of Sen. Osborn); id., at 457 (statement of Rep. Coburn); id., at App. 78 (statement of Rep. Perry); 2 Cong. Rec. 457 (1874) (statement of Rep. Butler); 3 Cong. Rec. 945 (1875) (statement of Rep. Lynch).\n\nBut even if that distinction were valid, we do not believe it would save  13981's civil remedy. For the remedy is simply not \"corrective in its character, adapted to counteract and redress the operation of such prohibited [s]tate laws or proceedings of [s]tate officers.\" Civil Rights Cases, supra, at 18. Or, as we have phrased it in more recent cases, prophylactic legislation under  5 must have a \"`congruence *626 and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.\" Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, 527 U. S. 627, 639 (1999); Flores, 521 U. S., at 526. Section 13981 is not aimed at proscribing discrimination by officials which the Fourteenth Amendment might not itself proscribe; it is directed not at any State or state actor, but at individuals who have committed criminal acts motivated by gender bias.\n\nIn the present cases, for example,  13981 visits no consequence whatever on any Virginia public official involved in investigating or prosecuting Brzonkala's assault. The section is, therefore, unlike any of the  5 remedies that we have previously upheld. For example, in Katzenbach v. Morgan,  384 U. S. 641 (1966), Congress prohibited New York from imposing literacy tests as a prerequisite for voting because it found that such a requirement disenfranchised thousands of Puerto Rican immigrants who had been educated in the Spanish language of their home territory. That law, which we upheld, was directed at New York officials who administered the State's election law and prohibited them from using a provision of that law. In South Carolina v. Katzenbach,  383 U. S. 301 (1966), Congress imposed voting rights requirements on States that, Congress found, had a history of discriminating against blacks in voting. The remedy was also directed at state officials in those States. Similarly, in Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339 (1880), Congress criminally punished state officials who intentionally discriminated in jury selection; again, the remedy was directed to the culpable state official.\n\nSection 13981 is also different from these previously upheld remedies in that it applies uniformly throughout the Nation. Congress' findings indicate that the problem of discrimination against the victims of gender-motivated crimes does not exist in all States, or even most States. By contrast, the  5 remedy upheld in Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra, *627 was directed only to the State where the evil found by Congress existed, and in South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra,  the remedy was directed only to those States in which Congress found that there had been discrimination.\n\nFor these reasons, we conclude that Congress' power under  5 does not extend to the enactment of  13981.IVPetitioner Brzonkala's complaint alleges that she was the victim of a brutal assault. But Congress' effort in  13981 to provide a federal civil remedy can be sustained neither under the Commerce Clause nor under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. If the allegations here are true, no civilized system of justice could fail to provide her a remedy for the conduct of respondent Morrison. But under our federal system that remedy must be provided by the Commonwealth of Virginia, and not by the United States. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\n\nAffirmed.Justice Thomas, concurring.The majority opinion correctly applies our decision in United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), and I join it in full. I write separately only to express my view that the very notion of a \"substantial effects\" test under the Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the original understanding of Congress' powers and with this Court's early Commerce Clause cases. By continuing to apply this rootless and malleable standard, however circumscribed, the Court has encouraged the Federal Government to persist in its view that the Commerce Clause has virtually no limits. Until this Court replaces its existing Commerce Clause jurisprudence with a standard more consistent with the original understanding, we will continue to see Congress appropriating state police powers under the guise of regulating commerce.\n\n*628Justice Souter, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.The Court says both that it leaves Commerce Clause precedent undisturbed and that the Civil Rights Remedy of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, 42 U. S. C.  13981, exceeds Congress's power under that Clause. I find the claims irreconcilable and respectfully dissent.[1]IOur cases, which remain at least nominally undisturbed, stand for the following propositions. Congress has the power to legislate with regard to activity that, in the aggregate, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 124-128 (1942); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U. S. 264, 277 (1981). The fact of such a substantial effect is not an issue for the courts in the first instance, ibid., but for the Congress, whose institutional capacity for gathering evidence and taking testimony far exceeds ours. By passing legislation, Congress indicates its conclusion, whether explicitly or not, that facts support its exercise of the commerce power. The business of the courts is to review the congressional assessment, not for soundness but simply for the rationality of concluding that a jurisdictional basis exists in fact. See ibid. Any explicit findings that Congress chooses to make, though not dispositive of the question of rationality, may advance judicial review by identifying factual authority on which Congress relied. Applying those propositions in these cases can lead to only one conclusion.\n\nOne obvious difference from United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549 (1995), is the mountain of data assembled by Congress, *629 here showing the effects of violence against women on interstate commerce.[2] Passage of the Act in 1994 was preceded by four years of hearings,[3] which included testimony from physicians and law professors;[4] from survivors *630 of rape and domestic violence;[5] and from representatives of state law enforcement and private business.[6] The record includes reports on gender bias from task forces in 21 States,[7] and we have the benefit of specific factual findings *631 in the eight separate Reports issued by Congress and its committees over the long course leading to enactment.[8] Cf. Hodel, 452 U. S., at 278-279 (noting \"extended hearings,\" \"vast amounts of testimony and documentary evidence,\" and \"years of the most thorough legislative consideration\").\n\nWith respect to domestic violence, Congress received evidence for the following findings:\"Three out of four American women will be victims of violent crimes sometime during their life.\" H.

[,] by diminishing national productivity, increasing medical and other costs, and decreasing the supply of and the demand for interstate products . . . .\" H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, p. 385 (1994).Congress thereby explicitly stated the predicate for the exercise of its Commerce Clause power. Is its conclusion irrational in view of the data amassed? True, the methodology of particular studies may be challenged, and some of the figures arrived at may be disputed. But the sufficiency of the evidence before Congress to provide a rational basis for the finding cannot seriously be questioned. Cf. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 520 U. S. 180, 199 (1997) *635 (\"The Constitution gives to Congress the role of weighing conflicting evidence in the legislative process\").\n\nIndeed, the legislative record here is far more voluminous than the record compiled by Congress and found sufficient in two prior cases upholding Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Commerce Clause challenges. In Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964), and Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964), the Court referred to evidence showing the consequences of racial discrimination by motels and restaurants on interstate commerce. Congress had relied on compelling anecdotal reports that individual instances of segregation cost thousands to millions of dollars. See Civil RightsPublic Accommodations, Hearings on S. 1732 before the Senate Committee on Commerce, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., App. V, pp. 1383-1387 (1963). Congress also had evidence that the average black family spent substantially less than the average white family in the same income range on public accommodations, and that discrimination accounted for much of the difference. H. R. Rep. No. 88-914, pt. 2,pp. 9-10, and Table II (1963) (Additional Views on H. R. 7152 of Hon. William M. McCulloch, Hon. John V. Lindsay, Hon. William T. Cahill, Hon. Garner E. Shriver, Hon. Clark MacGregor, Hon. Charles McC. Mathias, Hon. James E. Bromwell).\n\nWhile Congress did not, to my knowledge, calculate aggregate dollar values for the nationwide effects of racial discrimination in 1964, in 1994 it did rely on evidence of the harms caused by domestic violence and sexual assault, citing annual costs of $3 billion in 1990, see S. Rep. 101-545, at 33, and $5 to $10 billion in 1993, see S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 41.[9] Equally important, though, gender-based violence in the 1990's was shown to operate in a manner similar to racial *636 discrimination in the 1960's in reducing the mobility of employees and their production and consumption of goods shipped in interstate commerce. Like racial discrimination, \"[g]ender-based violence bars its most likely targets womenfrom full partic[ipation] in the national economy.\" Id., at 54.\n\nIf the analogy to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is not plain enough, one can always look back a bit further. In Wickard,  we upheld the application of the Agricultural Adjustment Act to the planting and consumption of homegrown wheat. The effect on interstate commerce in that case followed from the possibility that wheat grown at home for personal consumption could either be drawn into the market by rising prices, or relieve its grower of any need to purchase wheat in the market. See 317 U. S., at 127-129. The Commerce Clause predicate was simply the effect of the production of wheat for home consumption on supply and demand in interstate commerce. Supply and demand for goods in interstate commerce will also be affected by the deaths of 2,000 to 4,000 women annually at the hands of domestic abusers, see S. Rep. No. 101-545, at 36, and by the reduction in the work force by the 100,000 or more rape victims who lose their jobs each year or are forced to quit, see id., at 56; H. R. Rep. No. 103-395, at 25-26. Violence against women may be found to affect interstate commerce and affect it substantially.[10]=\n\n*637 IIThe Act would have passed muster at any time between Wickard in 1942 and Lopez in 1995, a period in which the law enjoyed a stable understanding that congressional power under the Commerce Clause, complemented by the authority of the Necessary and Proper Clause, Art. I,  8, cl. 18, extended to all activity that, when aggregated, has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. As already noted, this understanding was secure even against the turmoil at the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in the aftermath of which the Court not only reaffirmed the cumulative effects and rational basis features of the substantial effects test, see Heart of Atlanta, supra, at 258; McClung, supra, at 301-305, but declined to limit the commerce power through a formal distinction between legislation focused on \"commerce\" and statutes addressing \"moral and social wrong[s],\" Heart of Atlanta, supra, at 257.\n\nThe fact that the Act does not pass muster before the Court today is therefore proof, to a degree that Lopez was not, that the Court's nominal adherence to the substantial effects test is merely that. Although a new jurisprudence has not emerged with any distinctness, it is clear that some congressional conclusions about obviously substantial, cumulative effects on commerce are being assigned lesser values than the once-stable doctrine would assign them. These devaluations are accomplished not by any express repudiation of the substantial effects test or its application through the aggregation of individual conduct, but by supplanting rational basis scrutiny with a new criterion of review.\n\n*638 Thus the elusive heart of the majority's analysis in these cases is its statement that Congress's findings of fact are \"weakened\" by the presence of a disfavored \"method of reasoning.\" Ante, at 615. This seems to suggest that the \"substantial effects\" analysis is not a factual enquiry, for Congress in the first instance with subsequent judicial review looking only to the rationality of the congressional conclusion, but one of a rather different sort, dependent upon a uniquely judicial competence.\n\nThis new characterization of substantial effects has no support inour cases (the self-fulfilling prophecies of Lopez  aside), least of all those the majority cites. Perhaps this explains why the majority is not content to rest on its cited precedent but claims a textual justification for moving toward its new system of congressional deference subject to selective discounts. Thus it purports to rely on the sensible and traditional understanding that the listing in the Constitution of some powers implies the exclusion of others unmentioned. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 195 (1824); ante, at 610; The Federalist No. 45, p. 313 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison).[11] The majority stresses that Art. I,  8,enumerates *639 the powers of Congress, including the commerce power, an enumeration implying the exclusion of powers not enumerated. It follows, for the majority, not only that there must be some limits to \"commerce,\" but that some particular subjects arguably within the commerce power can be identified in advance as excluded, on the basis of characteristics other than their commercial effects. Such exclusions come into sight when the activity regulated is not itself commercial or when the States have traditionally addressed it in the exercise of the general police power, conferred under the state constitutions but never extended to Congress under the Constitution of the Nation, see Lopez, 514 U. S., at 566. Ante, at 615-616.\n\nThe premise that the enumeration of powers implies that other powers are withheld is sound; the conclusion that some particular categories of subject matter are therefore presumptively beyond the reach of the commerce power is, however, a non sequitur. From the fact that Art. I,  8, cl. 3, grants an authority limited to regulating commerce, it follows only that Congress may claim no authority under that section to address any subject that does not affect commerce. It does not at all follow that an activity affecting commerce nonetheless falls outside the commerce power, depending on the specific character of the activity, or the authority of a State to regulate it along with Congress.[12] My disagreement *640 with the majority is not, however, confined to logic, for history has shown that categorical exclusions have proven as unworkable in practice as they are unsupportable in theory.AObviously, it would not be inconsistent with the text of the Commerce Clause itself to declare \"noncommercial\" primary activity beyond or presumptively beyond the scope of the commerce power. That variant of categorical approach is not, however, the sole textually permissible way of defining the scope of the Commerce Clause, and any such neat limitation would at least be suspect in the light of the final sentence of Art. I,  8, authorizing Congress to make \"all Laws . . . necessary and proper\" to give effect to its enumerated powers such as commerce. See United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 118 (1941) (\"The power of Congress . . . extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce\"). Accordingly, for significant periods of our history, the Court has defined the commerce power as plenary, unsusceptible to categorical exclusions, and this was the view expressed throughout the latter part of the 20th century in the substantial effects test. These two conceptions of the commerce power, plenary and categorically limited, are in fact old rivals, and today's revival of their competition summons up familiar history, a brief reprise of which may be helpful in posing what I take to be the key question going to the legitimacy of the majority's decision to breathe new life into the approach of categorical limitation.\n\n*641 Chief Justice Marshall's seminal opinion in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 193-194, construed the commerce power from the start with \"a breadth never yet exceeded,\" Wickard  v. Filburn, 317 U. S., at 120. In particular, it is worth noting, the Court in Wickard did not regard its holding as exceeding the scope of Chief Justice Marshall's view of interstate commerce; Wickard applied an aggregate effects test to ostensibly domestic, noncommercial farming consistently with Chief Justice Marshall's indication that the commerce power may be understood by its exclusion of subjects, among others, \"which do not affect other States,\" Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 195. This plenary view of the power has either prevailed or been acknowledged by this Court at every stage of our jurisprudence. See, e. g., id., at 197; Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Alabama, 128 U. S. 96, 99-100 (1888); Lottery Case, 188 U. S. 321, 353 (1903); Minnesota Rate Cases, 230 U. S. 352, 398 (1913); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175, 185 (1936); United States v. Darby, supra, at 115; Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States,  379 U. S., at 255; Hodel v. Indiana, 452 U. S., at 324. And it was this understanding, free of categorical qualifications, that prevailed in the period after 1937 through Lopez, as summed up by Justice Harlan: \"`Of course, the mere fact that Congress has said when particular activity shall be deemed to affect commerce does not preclude further examination by this Court. But where we find that the legislators . . . have a rational basis for finding a chosen regulatory scheme necessary to the protection of commerce, our investigation is at an end.' \" Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 190 (1968) (quoting Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S., at 303-304).\n\nJustice Harlan spoke with the benefit of hindsight, for he had seen the result of rejecting the plenary view, and today's attempt to distinguish between primary activities affecting commerce in terms of the relatively commercial or noncommercial character of the primary conduct proscribed comes with the pedigree of near tragedy that I outlined in *642 United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 603 (dissenting opinion). In the half century following the modern activation of the commerce power with passage of the Interstate Commerce Act in 1887, this Court from time to time created categorical enclaves beyond congressional reach by declaring such activities as \"mining,\" \"production,\" \"manufacturing,\" and union membership to be outside the definition of \"commerce\" and by limiting application of the effects test to \"direct\" rather than \"indirect\" commercial consequences. See, e. g., United States v. E. C. Knight Co., 156 U. S. 1 (1895) (narrowly construing the Sherman Antitrust Act in light of the distinction between \"commerce\" and \"manufacture\"); In re Heff, 197 U. S. 488, 505-506 (1905) (stating that Congress could not regulate the intrastate sale of liquor); The Employers' Liability Cases, 207 U. S. 463, 495-496 (1908) (invalidating law governing tort liability for common carriers operating in interstate commerce because the effects on commerce were indirect); Adair v. United States, 208 U. S. 161 (1908) (holding that labor union membership fell outside \"commerce\"); Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251 (1918) (invalidating law prohibiting interstate shipment of goods manufactured with child labor as a regulation of \"manufacture\"); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 545 548 (1935) (invalidating regulation of activities that only \"indirectly\" affected commerce); Railroad Retirement Bd.  v. Alton R. Co., 295 U. S. 330, 368-369 (1935) (invalidating pension law for railroad workers on the grounds that conditions of employment were only indirectly linked to commerce); Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 303-304 (1936) (holding that regulation of unfair labor practices in mining regulated \"production,\" not \"commerce\").\n\nSince adherence to these formalistically contrived confines of commerce power in large measure provoked the judicial crisis of 1937, one might reasonably have doubted that Members of this Court would ever again toy with a return to the days before NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., *643 301 U. S. 1 (1937), which brought the earlier and nearly disastrous experiment to an end. And yet today's decision can only be seen as a step toward recapturing the prior mistakes. Its revival of a distinction between commercial and noncommercial conduct is at odds with Wickard, which repudiated that analysis, and the enquiry into commercial purpose, first intimated by the Lopez concurrence, see Lopez, supra, at 580 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), is cousin to the intent-based analysis employed in Hammer, supra, at 271 272, but rejected for Commerce Clause purposes in Heart of Atlanta, supra, at 257, and Darby, 312 U. S., at 115.\n\nWhy is the majority tempted to reject the lesson so painfully learned in 1937? An answer emerges from contrasting Wickard with one of the predecessor cases it superseded. It was obvious in Wickard that growing wheat for consumption right on the farm was not \"commerce\" in the common vocabulary,[13] but that did not matter constitutionally so long as the aggregated activity of domestic wheat growing affected commerce substantially. Just a few years before *644 Wickard, however, it had certainly been no less obvious that \"mining\" practices could substantially affect commerce, even though Carter Coal Co., supra, had held mining regulation beyond the national commerce power. When we try to fathom the difference between the two cases, it is clear that they did not go in different directions because the Carter Coal Court could not understand a causal connection that the Wickard Court could grasp; the difference, rather, turned on the fact that the Court in Carter Coal had a reason for trying to maintain its categorical, formalistic distinction, while that reason had been abandoned by the time Wickard was decided. The reason was laissez-faire economics, the point of which was to keep government interference to a minimum. See Lopez, supra, at 605-606 (Souter, J., dissenting). The Court in Carter Coal was still trying to create a laissez-faire world out of the 20thcentury economy, and formalistic commercial distinctions were thought to be useful instruments in achieving that object. The Court in Wickard knew it could not do any such thing and in the aftermath of the New Deal had long since stopped attempting the impossible. Without the animating economic theory, there was no point in contriving formalisms in a war with Chief Justice Marshall's conception of the commerce power.\n\nIf we now ask why the formalistic economic/noneconomic distinction might matter today, after its rejection in Wickard, the answer is not that the majority fails to see causal connections in an integrated economic world. The answer is that in the minds of the majority there is a new animating theory that makes categorical formalism seem useful again. Just as the old formalism had value in the service of an economic conception, the new one is useful in serving a conception of federalism. It is the instrument by which assertions of national power are to be limited in favor of preserving a supposedly discernible, proper sphere of state autonomy to legislate or refrain from legislating as the individual *645 States see fit. The legitimacy of the Court's current emphasis on the noncommercial nature of regulated activity, then, does not turn on any logic serving the text of the Commerce Clause or on the realism of the majority's view of the national economy. The essential issue is rather the strength of the majority's claim to have a constitutional warrant for its current conception of a federal relationship enforceable by this Court through limits on otherwise plenary commerce power. This conception is the subject of the majority's second categorical discount applied today to the facts bearing on the substantial effects test.BThe Court finds it relevant that the statute addresses conduct traditionally subject to state prohibition under domestic criminal law, a fact said to have some heightened significance when the violent conduct in question is not itself aimed directly at interstate commerce or its instrumentalities. Ante, at 609. Again, history seems to be recycling, for the theory of traditional state concern as grounding a limiting principle has been rejected previously, and more than once. It was disapproved in Darby, 312 U. S., at 123-124, and held insufficient standing alone to limit the commerce power in Hodel, 452 U. S., at 276-277. In the particular context of the Fair Labor Standards Act it was rejected in Maryland  v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968), with the recognition that \"[t]here is no general doctrine implied in the Federal Constitution that the two governments, national and state, are each to exercise its powers so as not to interfere with the free and full exercise of the powers of the other.\" Id., at 195 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court held it to be \"clear that the Federal Government, when acting within a delegated power, may override countervailing state interests, whether these be described as `governmental' or `proprietary' in character.\" Ibid. While Wirtz was later overruled by National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. *646 833 (1976), that case was itself repudiated in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), which held that the concept of \"traditional governmental function\" (as an element of the immunity doctrine under Hodel ) was incoherent, there being no explanation that would make sense of the multifarious decisions placing some functions on one side of the line, some on the other. 469 U. S., at 546-547. The effort to carve out inviolable state spheres within the spectrum of activities substantially affecting commerce was, of course, just as irreconcilable with Gibbons `s explanation of the national commerce power as being as \"absolut[e] as it would be in a single government,\" 9 Wheat., at 197.[14]\n*647 The objection to reviving traditional state spheres of action as a consideration in commerce analysis, however, not only rests on the portent of incoherence, but is compounded by a further defect just as fundamental. The defect, in essence, is the majority's rejection of the Founders' considered judgment that politics, not judicial review, should mediate between state and national interests as the strength and legislative jurisdiction of the National Government inevitably increased through the expected growth of the national economy.[15] Whereas today's majority takes a leaf from the book of the old judicial economists in saying that the Court should somehow draw the line to keep the federal relationship in a proper balance, Madison, Wilson, and Marshall understood the Constitution very differently.\n\nAlthough Madison had emphasized the conception of a National Government of discrete powers (a conception that a number of the ratifying conventions thought was too indeterminate to protect civil liberties),[16] Madison himself must have sensed the potential scope of some of the powers granted (such as the authority to regulate commerce), for he *648 took care in The Federalist No. 46 to hedge his argument for limited power by explaining the importance of national politics in protecting the States' interests. The National Government \"will partake sufficiently of the spirit [of the States], to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States, or the prerogatives of their governments.\" The Federalist No. 46, p. 319 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). James Wilson likewise noted that \"it was a favorite object in the Convention\" to secure the sovereignty of the States, and that it had been achieved through the structure of the Federal Government. 2 Elliot's Debates 438-439.[17] The Framers of the Bill of Rights, in turn, may well have sensed that Madison and Wilson were right about politics as the determinant of the federal balance within the broad limits of a power like commerce, for they formulated the Tenth Amendment without any provision comparable to the specific guarantees proposed for individual liberties.[18] In any case, this Court recognized the political component of federalism in the seminal Gibbons  opinion. After declaring the plenary character of congressional power within the sphere of activity affecting commerce, the Chief Justice spoke for the Court in explaining that there was only one restraint on its valid exercise:*649 \"The wisdom and the discretion of Congress, their identity with the people, and the influence which their constituents possess at elections, are, in this, as in many other instances, as that, for example, of declaring war, the sole restraints on which they have relied, to secure them from its abuse. They are the restraints on which the people must often rely solely, in all representative governments.\" Gibbons, 9 Wheat., at 197.Politics as the moderator of the congressional employment of the commerce power was the theme many years later in Wickard, for after the Court acknowledged the breadth of the Gibbons formulation it invoked Chief Justice Marshall yet again in adding that \"[h]e made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature of this power by warning that effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than judicial processes.\" Wickard, 317 U. S., at 120 (citation omitted). Hence, \"conflicts of economic interest . . . are wisely left under our system to resolution by Congress under its more flexible and responsible legislative process. Such conflicts rarely lend themselves to judicial determination. And with the wisdom, workability, or fairness, of the plan of regulation we have nothing to do.\" Id., at 129 (footnote omitted).\n\nAs with \"conflicts of economic interest,\" so with supposed conflicts of sovereign political interests implicated by the Commerce Clause: the Constitution remits them to politics. The point can be put no more clearly than the Court put it the last time it repudiated the notion that some state activities categorically defied the commerce power as understood in accordance with generally accepted concepts. After confirming Madison's and Wilson's views with a recitation of the sources of state influence in the structure of the National Constitution, Garcia, 469 U. S., at 550-552, the Court disposed of the possibility of identifying \"principled constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress' Commerce Clause powers over the States merely *650 by relying on a priori definitions of state sovereignty,\" id.,  at 548. It concluded that\"the Framers chose to rely on a federal system in which special restraints on federal power over the States inhered principally in the workings of the National Government itself, rather than in discrete limitations on the objects of federal authority. State sovereign interests, then, are more properly protected by procedural safeguards inherent in the structure of the federal system than by judicially created limitations on federal power.\" Id., at 552.The Garcia Court's rejection of \"judicially created limitations\" in favor of the intended reliance on national politics was all the more powerful owing to the Court's explicit recognition that in the centuries since the framing the relative powers of the two sovereign systems have markedly changed. Nationwide economic integration is the norm, the national political power has been augmented by its vast revenues, and the power of the States has been drawn down by the Seventeenth Amendment, eliminating selection of senators by state legislature in favor of direct election.\n\nThe Garcia majority recognized that economic growth and the burgeoning of federal revenue have not amended the Constitution, which contains no circuit breaker to preclude the political consequences of these developments. Nor is there any justification for attempts to nullify the natural political impact of the particular amendment that was adopted. The significance for state political power of ending state legislative selection of senators was no secret in 1913, and the amendment was approved despite public comment on that very issue. Representative Franklin Bartlett, after quoting Madison's Federalist No. 62, as well as remarks by George Mason and John Dickinson during the Constitutional Convention, concluded, \"It follows, therefore, that the *651 framers of the Constitution, were they present in this House to-day, would inevitably regard this resolution as a most direct blow at the doctrine of State's rights and at the integrity of the State sovereignties; for if you once deprive a State as a collective organism of all share in the General Government, you annihilate its federative importance.\" 26 Cong. Rec. 7774 (1894). Massachusetts Senator George Hoar likewise defended indirect election of the Senate as \"a great security for the rights of the States.\" S. Doc. No. 232, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., 21 (1906). And Elihu Root warned that if the selection of senators should be taken from state legislatures, \"the tide that now sets toward the Federal Government will swell in volume and power.\" 46 Cong. Rec. 2243 (1911). \"The time will come,\" he continued, \"when the Government of the United States will be driven to the exercise of more arbitrary and unconsidered power, will be driven to greater concentration, will be driven to extend its functions into the internal affairs of the States.\" Ibid.  See generally Rossum, The Irony of Constitutional Democracy: Federalism, the Supreme Court, and the Seventeenth Amendment, 36 San Diego L. Rev. 671, 712-714 (1999) (noting federalism-based objections to the Seventeenth Amendment). These warnings did not kill the proposal; the Amendment was ratified, and today it is only the ratification, not the predictions, which this Court can legitimately heed.[19]\n*652 Amendments that alter the balance of power between the National and State Governments, like the Fourteenth, or that change the way the States are represented within the Federal Government, like the Seventeenth, are not rips in the fabric of the Framers' Constitution, inviting judicial repairs. The Seventeenth Amendment may indeed have lessened the enthusiasm of the Senate to represent the States as discrete sovereignties, but the Amendment did not convert the judiciary into an alternate shield against the commerce power.CThe Court's choice to invoke considerations of traditional state regulation in these cases is especially odd in light of a distinction recognized in the now-repudiated opinion for the Court in Usery. In explaining that there was no inconsistency between declaring the States immune to the commerce power exercised in the Fair Labor Standards Act, but subject to it under the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as decided in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), the Court spoke of the latter statute as dealing with a serious threat affecting all the political components of the federal *653 system, \"which only collective action by the National Government might forestall.\" Usery, 426 U. S., at 853. Today's majority, however, finds no significance whatever in the state support for the Act based upon the States' acknowledged failure to deal adequately with gender-based violence in state courts, and the belief of their own law enforcement agencies that national action is essential.[20]\n\nThe National Association of Attorneys General supported the Act unanimously, see Violence Against Women: Victims of the System, Hearing on S. 15 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 37-38 (1991), and Attorneys General from 38 States urged Congress to enact the Civil Rights Remedy, representing that \"the current system for dealing with violence against women is inadequate,\" see Crimes of Violence Motivated by Gender, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 34-36 (1993). It was against this record of failure at the state level that the Act was passed to provide the choice of a federal forum in place of the state-court systems found inadequate to stop gender-biased violence. See Women and Violence, Hearing before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 101st Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1990) (statement of Sen. Biden) (noting importance of federal forum).[21] The Act accordingly offers a federal civil rights remedy aimed exactly *654 at violence against women, as an alternative to the generic state tort causes of action found to be poor tools of action by the state task forces. See S. Rep. No. 101-545, at 45 (noting difficulty of fitting gender-motivated crimes into commonlaw categories). As the 1993 Senate Report put it, \"The Violence Against Women Act is intended to respond both to the underlying attitude that this violence is somehow less serious than other crime and to the resulting failure of our criminal justice system to address such violence. Its goals are both symbolic and practical . . . .\" S. Rep. No. 103-138, at 38.\n\nThe collective opinion of state officials that the Act was needed continues virtually unchanged, and when the Civil Rights Remedy was challenged in court, the States came to its defense. Thirty-six of them and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have filed an amicus brief in support of petitioners in these cases, and only one State has taken respondents' side. It is, then, not the least irony of these cases that the States will be forced to enjoy the new federalism whether they want it or not. For with the Court's decision today, Antonio Morrison, like Carter Coal `s James Carter before him, has \"won the states' rights plea against the states themselves.\" R. Jackson, The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 160 (1941).IIIAll of this convinces me that today's ebb of the commerce power rests on error, and at the same time leads me to doubt that the majority's view will prove to be enduring law. There is yet one more reason for doubt. Although we sense the presence of Carter Coal, Schechter, and Usery once again, the majority embraces them only at arm's-length. Where such decisions once stood for rules, today's opinion points to considerations by which substantial effects are discounted. Cases standing for the sufficiency of substantial effects are not overruled; cases overruled since 1937 are not quite revived. The Court's thinking betokens less clearly *655 a return to the conceptual straitjackets of Schechter and Carter Coal and Usery than to something like the unsteady state of obscenity law between Redrup v. New York, 386 U. S. 767 (1967) (per curiam), and Miller v. California,  413 U. S. 15 (1973), a period in which the failure to provide a workable definition left this Court to review each case ad hoc. See id., at 22, n. 3; Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. Dallas,  390 U. S. 676, 706-708 (1968) (Harlan, J., dissenting). As our predecessors learned then, the practice of such ad hoc review cannot preserve the distinction between the judicial and the legislative, and this Court, in any event, lacks the institutional capacity to maintain such a regime for very long. This one will end when the majority realizes that the conception of the commerce power for which it entertains hopes would inevitably fail the test expressed in Justice Holmes's statement that \"[t]he first call of a theory of law is that it should fit the facts.\" O. Holmes, The Common Law 167 (Howe ed. 1963). The facts that cannot be ignored today are the facts of integrated national commerce and a political relationship between States and Nation much affected by their respective treasuries and constitutional modifications adopted by the people. The federalism of some earlier time is no more adequate to account for those facts today than the theory of laissez-faire was able to govern the national economy 70 years ago.Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens joins, and with whom Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg join as to Part IA, dissenting.No one denies the importance of the Constitution's federalist principles. Its state/federal division of authority protects libertyboth by restricting the burdens that government can impose from a distance and by facilitating citizen participation in government that is closer to home. The question is how the judiciary can best implement that *656 original federalist understanding where the Commerce Clause is at issue.IThe majority holds that the federal commerce power does not extend to such \"noneconomic\" activities as \"noneconomic, violent criminal conduct\" that significantly affects interstate commerce only if we \"aggregate\" the interstate \"effect[s]\" of individual instances. Ante, at 617. Justice Souter explains why history, precedent, and legal logic militate against the majority's approach. I agree and join his opinion. I add that the majority's holding illustrates the difficulty of finding a workable judicial Commerce Clause touchstonea set of comprehensible interpretive rules that courts might use to impose some meaningful limit, but not too great a limit, upon the scope of the legislative authority that the Commerce Clause delegates to Congress.AConsider the problems. The \"economic/noneconomic\" distinction is not easy to apply. Does the local street corner mugger engage in \"economic\" activity or \"noneconomic\" activity when he mugs for money? See Perez v. United States,  402 U. S. 146 (1971) (aggregating local \"loan sharking\" instances); United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 559 (1995) (loan sharking is economic because it consists of \"intrastate extortionate credit transactions\"); ante, at 610. Would evidence that desire for economic domination underlies many brutal crimes against women save the present statute? See United States General Accounting Office, Health, Education, and Human Services Division, Domestic Violence: Prevalence and Implications for Employment Among Welfare Recipients 7-8 (Nov. 1998); Brief for Equal Rights Advocates et al. as Amicus Curiae 10-12.\n\nThe line becomes yet harder to draw given the need for exceptions. The Court itself would permit Congress to aggregate, hence regulate, \"noneconomic\" activity taking place *657 at economic establishments. See Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 (1964) (upholding civil rights laws forbidding discrimination at local motels); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 (1964) (same for restaurants); Lopez, supra, at 559 (recognizing congressional power to aggregate, hence forbid, noneconomically motivated discrimination at public accommodations); ante, at 610 (same). And it would permit Congress to regulate where that regulation is \"an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity, in which the regulatory scheme could be undercut unless the intrastate activity were regulated.\" Lopez, supra, at 561; cf. Controlled Substances Act, 21 U. S. C.  801 et seq. (regulating drugs produced for home consumption). Given the former exception, can Congress simply rewrite the present law and limit its application to restaurants, hotels, perhaps universities, and other places of public accommodation? Given the latter exception, can Congress save the present law by including it, or much of it, in a broader \"Safe Transport\" or \"Workplace Safety\" act?\n\nMore important, why should we give critical constitutional importance to the economic, or noneconomic, nature of an interstate-commerce-affecting cause? If chemical emanations through indirect environmental change cause identical, severe commercial harm outside a State, why should it matter whether local factories or home fireplaces release them? The Constitution itself refers only to Congress' power to \"regulate Commerce . . . among the several States,\" and to make laws \"necessary and proper\" to implement that power. Art. I,  8, cls. 3, 18. The language says nothing about either the local nature, or the economic nature, of an interstatecommerce-affecting cause.\n\nThis Court has long held that only the interstate commercial effects, not the local nature of the cause, are constitutionally relevant. See NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.,  301 U. S. 1, 38-39 (1937) (focusing upon interstate effects); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 125 (1942) (aggregating *658 interstate effects of wheat grown for home consumption); Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 258 (\"`[I]f it is interstate commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local the operation which applies the squeeze' \" (quoting United States v. Women's Sportswear Mfrs. Assn., 336 U. S. 460, 464 (1949))). Nothing in the Constitution's language, or that of earlier cases prior to Lopez, explains why the Court should ignore one highly relevant characteristic of an interstatecommerce-affecting cause (how \"local\" it is), while placing critical constitutional weight upon a different, less obviously relevant, feature (how \"economic\" it is).\n\nMost importantly, the Court's complex rules seem unlikely to help secure the very object that they seek, namely, the protection of \"areas of traditional state regulation\" from federal intrusion. Ante, at 615. The Court's rules, even if broadly interpreted, are underinclusive. The local pickpocket is no less a traditional subject of state regulation than is the local gender-motivated assault. Regardless, the Court reaffirms, as it should, Congress' well-established and frequently exercised power to enact laws that satisfy a commerce-related jurisdictional prerequisitefor example, that some item relevant to the federally regulated activity has at some time crossed a state line. Ante, at 609, 611-612, 613, and n. 5; Lopez, supra, at 558; Heart of Atlanta Motel, supra, at 256 (\"`[T]he authority of Congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained, and is no longer open to question' \" (quoting Caminetti v. United States,  242 U. S. 470, 491 (1917))); see also United States v. Bass,  404 U. S. 336, 347-350 (1971) (saving ambiguous felon-inpossession statute by requiring gun to have crossed state line); Scarborough v. United States, 431 U. S. 563, 575 (1977) (interpreting same statute to require only that gun passed \"in interstate commerce\" \"at some time,\" without questioning constitutionality); cf., e. g., 18 U. S. C.  2261(a)(1) (making it a federal crime for a person to cross state lines to commit *659 a crime of violence against a spouse or intimate partner);  1951(a) (federal crime to commit robbery, extortion, physical violence or threat thereof, where \"article or commodity in commerce\" is affected, obstructed, or delayed);  2315 (making unlawful the knowing receipt or possession of certain stolen items that have \"crossed a State . . . boundary\");  922(g)(1) (prohibiting felons from shipping, transporting, receiving, or possessing firearms \"in interstate . . . commerce\").\n\nAnd in a world where most everyday products or their component parts cross interstate boundaries, Congress will frequently find it possible to redraft a statute using language that ties the regulation to the interstate movement of some relevant object, thereby regulating local criminal activity or, for that matter, family affairs. See, e. g., Child Support Recovery Act of 1992, 18 U. S. C.  228. Although this possibility does not give the Federal Government the power to regulate everything, it means that any substantive limitation will apply randomly in terms of the interests the majority seeks to protect. How much would be gained, for example, were Congress to reenact the present law in the form of \"An Act Forbidding Violence Against Women Perpetrated at Public Accommodations or by Those Who Have Moved in, or through the Use of Items that Have Moved in, Interstate Commerce\"? Complex Commerce Clause rules creating fine distinctions that achieve only random results do little to further the important federalist interests that called them into being. That is why modern (pre-Lopez ) case law rejected them. See Wickard, supra, at 120; United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 116-117 (1941); Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, at 37.\n\nThe majority, aware of these difficulties, is nonetheless concerned with what it sees as an important contrary consideration. To determine the lawfulness of statutes simply by asking whether Congress could reasonably have found that aggregated local instances significantly affect interstate commerce will allow Congress to regulate almost anything. *660 Virtually all local activity, when instances are aggregated, can have \"substantial effects on employment, production, transit, or consumption.\" Hence Congress could \"regulate any crime,\" and perhaps \"marriage, divorce, and childrearing\" as well, obliterating the \"Constitution's distinction between national and local authority.\" Ante, at 615, 616; Lopez, 514 U. S., at 558; cf. A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp.  v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 548 (1935) (need for distinction between \"direct\" and \"indirect\" effects lest there \"be virtually no limit to the federal power\"); Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251, 276 (1918) (similar observation).\n\nThis consideration, however, while serious, does not reflect a jurisprudential defect, so much as it reflects a practical reality. We live in a Nation knit together by two centuries of scientific, technological, commercial, and environmental change. Those changes, taken together, mean that virtually every kind of activity, no matter how local, genuinely can affect commerce, or its conditions, outside the Stateat least when considered in the aggregate. Heart of Atlanta Motel,  379 U. S., at 251. And that fact makes it close to impossible for courts to develop meaningful subject-matter categories that would exclude some kinds of local activities from ordinary Commerce Clause \"aggregation\" rules without, at the same time, depriving Congress of the power to regulate activities that have a genuine and important effect upon interstate commerce.\n\nSince judges cannot change the world, the \"defect\" means that, within the bounds of the rational, Congress, not the courts, must remain primarily responsible for striking the appropriate state/federal balance. Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 552 (1985); ante, at 645-649 (Souter, J., dissenting); Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U. S. 62, 93-94 (2000) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (Framers designed important structural safeguards to ensure that, when Congress legislates, \"the normal operation of the legislative process itself would adequately defend *661 state interests from undue infringement\"); see also Kramer, Putting the Politics Back into the Political Safeguards of Federalism, 100 Colum. L. Rev. 215 (2000) (focusing on role of political process and political parties in protecting state interests). Congress is institutionally motivated to do so. Its Members represent state and local district interests. They consider the views of state and local officials when they legislate, and they have even developed formal procedures to ensure that such consideration takes place. See, e. g., Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, Pub. L. 104-4, 109 Stat. 48 (codified in scattered sections of 2 U. S. C.). Moreover, Congress often can better reflect state concerns for autonomy in the details of sophisticated statutory schemes than can the Judiciary, which cannot easily gather the relevant facts and which must apply more general legal rules and categories. See, e. g., 42 U. S. C.  7543(b) (Clean Air Act); 33 U. S. C.  1251 et seq. (Clean Water Act); see also New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 167-168 (1992) (collecting other examples of \"cooperative federalism\"). Not surprisingly, the bulk of American law is still state law, and overwhelmingly so.BI would also note that Congress, when it enacted the statute, followed procedures that help to protect the federalism values at stake. It provided adequate notice to the States of its intent to legislate in an \"are[a] of traditional state regulation.\" Ante, at 615. And in response, attorneys general in the overwhelming majority of States (38) supported congressional legislation, telling Congress that \"[o]ur experience as Attorneys General strengthens our belief that the problem of violence against women is a national one, requiring federal attention, federal leadership, and federal funds.\" Crimes of Violence Motivated by Gender, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 34-36 (1993); see also Violence Against Women: Victims of *662 the System, Hearing on S. 15 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 1st Sess., 37-38 (1991) (unanimous resolution of the National Association of Attorneys General); but cf. Crimes of Violence Motivated by Gender, supra, at 77-84 (Conference of Chief Justices opposing legislation).\n\nMoreover, as Justice Souter has pointed out, Congress compiled a \"mountain of data\" explicitly documenting the interstate commercial effects of gender-motivated crimes of violence. Ante, at 628-635, 653-654 (dissenting opinion). After considering alternatives, it focused the federal law upon documented deficiencies in state legal systems. And it tailored the law to prevent its use in certain areas of traditional state concern, such as divorce, alimony, or child custody. 42 U. S. C.  13981(e)(4). Consequently, the law before us seems to represent an instance, not of state/federal conflict, but of state/federal efforts to cooperate in order to help solve a mutually acknowledged national problem. Cf.  300w10, 3796gg, 3796hh, 10409, 13931 (providing federal moneys to encourage state and local initiatives to combat gender-motivated violence).\n\nI call attention to the legislative process leading up to enactment of this statute because, as the majority recognizes, ante, at 614, it far surpasses that which led to the enactment of the statute we considered in Lopez. And even were I to accept Lopez as an accurate statement of the law, which I do not, that distinction provides a possible basis for upholding the law here. This Court on occasion has pointed to the importance of procedural limitations in keeping the power of Congress in check. See Garcia, supra, at 554 (\"Any substantive restraint on the exercise of Commerce Clause powers must find its justification in the procedural nature of this basic limitation, and it must be tailored to compensate for possible failings in the national political process rather than to dictate a `sacred province of state autonomy' \" (quoting EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 236 (1983))); see *663 also Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460-461 (1991) (insisting upon a \"plain statement\" of congressional intent when Congress legislates \"in areas traditionally regulated by the States\"); cf. Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 103 105, 114-117 (1976); Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 548-554 (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\nCommentators also have suggested that the thoroughness of legislative procedurese. g., whether Congress took a \"hard look\"might sometimes make a determinative difference in a Commerce Clause case, say, when Congress legislates in an area of traditional state regulation. See, e. g.,  Jackson, Federalism and the Uses and Limits of Law: Printz  and Principle?, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 2180, 2231-2245 (1998); Gardbaum, Rethinking Constitutional Federalism, 74 Texas L. Rev. 795, 812-828, 830-832 (1996); Lessig, Translating Federalism: United States v. Lopez, 1995 S. Ct. Rev. 125, 194-214 (1995); see also Treaty Establishing the European Community Art. 5; Bermann, Taking Subsidiarity Seriously: Federalism in the European Community and the United States, 94 Colum. L. Rev. 331, 378-403 (1994) (arguing for similar limitation in respect to somewhat analogous principle of subsidiarity for European Community); Gardbaum, supra,  at 833-837 (applying subsidiarity principles to American federalism). Of course, any judicial insistence that Congress follow particular procedures might itself intrude upon congressional prerogatives and embody difficult definitional problems. But the intrusion, problems, and consequences all would seem less serious than those embodied in the majority's approach. See supra, at 656-659.\n\nI continue to agree with Justice Souter that the Court's traditional \"rational basis\" approach is sufficient. Ante, at 628 (dissenting opinion); see also Lopez, 514 U. S., at 603-615 (Souter, J., dissenting); id., at 615-631 (Breyer, J., dissenting). But I recognize that the law in this area is unstable and that time and experience may demonstrate both the unworkability of the majority's rules and the superiority *664 of Congress' own procedural approachin which case the law may evolve toward a rule that, in certain difficult Commerce Clause cases, takes account of the thoroughness with which Congress has considered the federalism issue.\n\nFor these reasons, as well as those set forth by Justice Souter, this statute falls well within Congress' Commerce Clause authority, and I dissent from the Court's contrary conclusion.IIGiven my conclusion on the Commerce Clause question, I need not consider Congress' authority under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nonetheless, I doubt the Court's reasoning rejecting that source of authority. The Court points out that in United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 (1883), and the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 (1883), the Court held that  5 does not authorize Congress to use the Fourteenth Amendment as a source of power to remedy the conduct of private persons. Ante, at 621-622. That is certainly so. The Federal Government's argument, however, is that Congress used  5 to remedy the actions of state actors, namely, those States which, through discriminatory design or the discriminatory conduct of their officials, failed to provide adequate (or any) state remedies for women injured by gender-motivated violencea failure that the States, and Congress, documented in depth. See ante, at 630-631, n. 7, 653-654 (Souter, J., dissenting) (collecting sources).\n\nNeither Harris nor the Civil Rights Cases considered this kind of claim. The Court in Harris specifically said that it treated the federal laws in question as \"directed exclusively  against the action of private persons, without reference to the laws of the State or their administration by her officers.\" 106 U. S., at 640 (emphasis added); see also Civil Rights Cases, supra, at 14 (observing that the statute did \"not profess to be corrective of any constitutional wrong committed by the States\" and that it established \"rules for the conduct *665 of individuals in society towards each other, . . . without referring in any manner to any supposed action of the State or its authorities\").\n\nThe Court responds directly to the relevant \"state actor\" claim by finding that the present law lacks \"`congruence and proportionality' \" to the state discrimination that it purports to remedy. Ante, at 625-626; see City of Boerne v. Flores,  521 U. S. 507, 526 (1997). That is because the law, unlike federal laws prohibiting literacy tests for voting, imposing voting rights requirements, or punishing state officials who intentionally discriminated in jury selection, Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966); South Carolina v. Katzenbach,  383 U. S. 301 (1966); Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339 (1880), is not \"directed . . . at any State or state actor.\" Ante,  at 626.\n\nBut why can Congress not provide a remedy against private actors? Those private actors, of course, did not themselves violate the Constitution. But this Court has held that Congress at least sometimes can enact remedial \"[l]egislation . . .[that] prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional.\" Flores, supra, at 518; see also Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra, at 651; South Carolina v. Katzenbach, supra, at 308. The statutory remedy does not in any sense purport to \"determine what constitutes a constitutional violation.\" Flores, supra, at 519. It intrudes little upon either States or private parties. It may lead state actors to improve their own remedial systems, primarily through example. It restricts private actors only by imposing liability for private conduct that is, in the main, already forbidden by state law. Why is the remedy \"disproportionate\"? And given the relation between remedy and violationthe creation of a federal remedy to substitute for constitutionally inadequate state remedieswhere is the lack of \"congruence\"?\n\nThe majority adds that Congress found that the problem of inadequacy of state remedies \"does not exist in all States, *666 or even most States.\" Ante, at 626. But Congress had before it the task force reports of at least 21 States documenting constitutional violations. And it made its own findings about pervasive gender-based stereotypes hampering many state legal systems, sometimes unconstitutionally so. See, e. g., S. Rep. No. 103-138, pp. 38, 41-42, 44-47 (1993); S. Rep. No. 102-197, pp. 39, 44-49 (1991); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103-711, p. 385 (1994). The record nowhere reveals a congressional finding that the problem \"does not exist\" elsewhere. Why can Congress not take the evidence before it as evidence of a national problem? This Court has not previously held that Congress must document the existence of a problem in every State prior to proposing a national solution. And the deference this Court gives to Congress' chosen remedy under  5, Flores, supra, at 536, suggests that any such requirement would be inappropriate.\n\nDespite my doubts about the majority's  5 reasoning, I need not, and do not, answer the  5 question, which I would leave for more thorough analysis if necessary on another occasion. Rather, in my view, the Commerce Clause provides an adequate basis for the statute before us. And I would uphold its constitutionality as the \"necessary and proper\" exercise of legislative power granted to Congress by that Clause.NOTES[*]   Together with No. 99-29, Brzonkala v.

As the foregoing language from Jones & Laughlin Steel makes clear however, this Court has always recognized a limit on the commerce power inherent in \"our dual system of government.\" 301 U. S., at 37. It is the dissent's remarkable theory that the commerce power is without judicially enforceable boundaries that disregards the Court's caution in Jones & Laughlin Steel against allowing that power to \"effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local.\" Ibid.\n\n[4]  Justice Souter's dissent does not reconcile its analysis with our holding in Lopez because it apparently would cast that decision aside. See post, at 637-643. However, the dissent cannot persuasively contradict Lopez `s conclusion that, in every case where we have sustained federal regulation under the aggregation principle in Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), the regulated activity was of an apparent commercial character. See, e. g., Lopez, 514 U. S., at 559-560, 580.\n\n[5]  Title 42 U. S. C.  13981 is not the sole provision of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 to provide a federal remedy for gender-motivated crime. Section 40221(a) of the Act creates a federal criminal remedy to punish \"interstate crimes of abuse including crimes committed against spouses or intimate partners during interstate travel and crimes committed by spouses or intimate partners who cross State lines to continue the abuse.\" S. Rep. No. 103-138, p. 43 (1993). That criminal provision has been codified at 18 U. S. C.  2261(a)(1), which states: \"A person who travels across a State line or enters or leaves Indian country with the intent to injure, harass, or intimidate that person's spouse or intimate partner, and who, in the course of or as a result of such travel, intentionally commits a crime of violence and thereby causes bodily injury to such spouse or intimate partner, shall be punished as provided in subsection (b).\"\n\nThe Courts of Appeals have uniformly upheld this criminal sanction as an appropriate exercise of Congress' Commerce Clause authority, reasoning that \"[t]he provision properly falls within the first of Lopez `s categories as it regulates the use of channels of interstate commercei. e., the use of the interstate transportation routes through which persons and goods move.\" United States v. Lankford, 196 F. 3d 563, 571-572 (CA5 1999) (collecting cases) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n[6]  We are not the first to recognize that the but-for causal chain must have its limits in the Commerce Clause area. In Lopez, 514 U. S., at 567, we quoted Justice Cardozo's concurring opinion in A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935): \"There is a view of causation that would obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local in the activities of commerce. Motion at the outer rim is communicated perceptibly, though minutely, to recording instruments at the center. A society such as ours `is an elastic medium which transmits all tremors throughout its territory; the only question is of their size.' \" Id., at 554 (quoting United States v. A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp., 76 F. 2d 617, 624 (CA2 1935) (L. Hand, J., concurring)).\n\n[7]  Justice Souter's theory that Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), and the Seventeenth Amendment provide the answer to these cases, see post, at 645-652, is remarkable because it undermines this central principle of our constitutional system. As we have repeatedly noted, the Framers crafted the federal system of Government so that the people's rights would be secured by the division of power. See, e. g., Arizona v. Evans, 514 U. S. 1, 30 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 458-459 (1991) (cataloging the benefits of the federal design); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 242 (1985) (\"The `constitutionally mandated balance of power' between the States and the Federal Government was adopted by the Framers to ensure the protection of `our fundamental liberties' \") (quoting Garcia, supra, at 572 (Powell, J., dissenting)). Departing from their parliamentary past, the Framers adopted a written Constitution that further divided authority at the federal level so that the Constitution's provisions would not be defined solely by the political branches nor the scope of legislative power limited only by public opinion and the Legislature's self-restraint. See, e. g., Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 176 (1803) (Marshall, C. J.) (\"The powers of the legislature are defined and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written\"). It is thus a \"`permanent and indispensable feature of our constitutional system' \" that \"`the federal judiciary is supreme in the exposition of the law of the Constitution.' \" Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 922-923 (1995) (quoting Cooper  v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1, 18 (1958)).\n\nNo doubt the political branches have a role in interpreting and applying the Constitution, but ever since Marbury this Court has remained the ultimate expositor of the constitutional text. As we emphasized in United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683 (1974): \"In the performance of assigned constitutional duties each branch of the Government must initially interpret the Constitution, and the interpretation of its powers by any branch is due great respect from the others. . . . Many decisions of this Court, however, have unequivocally reaffirmed the holding of Marbury  that `[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.' \" Id., at 703 (citation omitted).\n\nContrary to Justice Souter's suggestion, see post, at 647-652, and n. 14, Gibbons did not exempt the commerce power from this cardinal rule of constitutional law. His assertion that, from Gibbons on, public opinion has been the only restraint on the congressional exercise of the commerce power is true only insofar as it contends that political accountability is and has been the only limit on Congress' exercise of the commerce power within that power's outer bounds. As the language surrounding that relied upon by Justice Souter makes clear, Gibbons did not remove from this Court the authority to define that boundary. See Gibbons, supra, at 194-195 (\"It is not intended to say that these words comprehend that commerce, which is completely internal, which is carried on between man and man in a State, or between different parts of the same State, and which does not extend to or affect other States. . . . Comprehensive as the word `among' is, it may very properly be restricted to that commerce which concerns more States than one. The phrase is not one which would probably have been selected to indicate the completely interior traffic of a State, because it is not an apt phrase for that purpose; and the enumeration of the particular classes of commerce to which the power was to be extended, would not have been made, had the intention been to extend the power to every description. The enumeration presupposes something not enumerated; and that something, if we regard the language or the subject of the sentence, must be the exclusively internal commerce of a State\").\n\n[8]  Justice Souter disputes our assertion that the Constitution reserves the general police power to the States, noting that the Founders failed to adopt several proposals for additional guarantees against federal encroachment on state authority. See post, at 645-646, and n. 14. This argument is belied by the entire structure of the Constitution. With its careful enumeration of federal powers and explicit statement that all powers not granted to the Federal Government are reserved, the Constitution cannot realistically be interpreted as granting the Federal Government an unlimited license to regulate. See, e. g., New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144, 156-157 (1992). And, as discussed above, the Constitution's separation of federal power and the creation of the Judicial Branch indicate that disputes regarding the extent of congressional power are largely subject to judicial review. See n. 7, supra. Moreover, the principle that \"`[t]he Constitution created a Federal Government of limited powers,' \" while reserving a generalized police power to the States, is deeply ingrained in our constitutional history. New York, supra, at 155 (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, supra, at 457); see also Lopez, 514 U. S., at 584-599 (Thomas, J., concurring) (discussing the history of the debates surrounding the adoption of the Commerce Clause and our subsequent interpretation of the Clause); Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196 (1968).\n\n[1]  Finding the law a valid exercise of Commerce Clause power, I have no occasion to reach the question whether it might also be sustained as an exercise of Congress's power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n[2]  It is true that these data relate to the effects of violence against women generally, while the civil rights remedy limits its scope to \"crimes of violence motivated by gender\"presumably a somewhat narrower subset of acts. See 42 U. S. C.  13981(b). But the meaning of \"motivated by gender\" has not been elucidated by lower courts, much less by this one, so the degree to which the findings rely on acts not redressable by the civil rights remedy isunclear. As will appear, however, much of the data seems to indicate behavior with just such motivation. In any event, adopting a cramped reading of the statutory text, and thereby increasing the constitutional difficulties, would directly contradict one of the most basic canons of statutory interpretation. See NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1, 30 (1937). Having identified the problem of violence against women, Congress may address what it sees as the most threatening manifestation; \"reform may take one step at a time.\" Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483, 489 (1955).\n\n[3]  See, e. g., Domestic Violence: Terrorism in the Home, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Children, Family, Drugs and Alcoholism of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 101st Cong., 2d Sess.

S.314, 325,n. 11 (1981) (statingthat corn production with a value of $5.16 million\"surely isnot an insignificant amount of commerce\").\n\n[10]  Itshould go without saying that my view of the limit of thecongressional commerce power carries no implication about the wisdom of exercising it to the limit.I and other Members of this Court appearing before Congress have repeatedly argued against the federalization of traditionalstate crimes and the extension of federal remedies to problems for which the States have historically taken responsibility and may deal with today ifthey have the will to do so. See Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 7, pp. 13-14 (1995) (testimony of Justice Kennedy); Hearings on H. R. 4603 before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Appropriations,103d Cong., 2d Sess.,100-107 (1994) (testimony of Justices Kennedy and Souter). The JudicialConference of the United States originallyopposed the Act, though after the originalbillwas amended to include the gender-based animus requirement, the objection was withdrawn for reasons that are not apparent. See Crimes of Violence Motivated by Gender, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 1st Sess., 70-71 (1993).\n\n[11]  The claim that powers not granted were withheld was the chief Federalist argument against the necessity of a bill of rights.Bills of rights, Hamilton claimed, \"have no application to constitutions professedly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by their immediate representatives and servants. Here, in strictness, the people surrender nothing, and as they retain every thing, they have no need of particular reservations.\" The Federalist No. 84,at 578. James Wilson went further in the Pennsylvania ratifying convention, asserting that an enumeration of rights was positivelydangerous because it suggested, conversely, that every right not reserved was surrendered. See 2 J.Elliot, Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 436-437 (2d ed. 1863) (hereinafter Elliot'sDebates). The Federalists did not, of course, prevailon this point; most States voted for the Constitution only after proposing amendments and the First Congress speedily adopted a Bill of Rights. See Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 569 (1985) (Powell, J., dissenting). While that document protected a range of specific individual rights against federal infringement, it did not, with the possible exception of the Second Amendment, offer any similarly specific protections to areas of state sovereignty.\n\n[12]  Tothe contrary,we have always recognized thatwhile the federal commerce power may overlap the reserved state police power, in such cases federal authority is supreme. See, e. g., Lake Shore & Michigan Southern R. Co. v. Ohio, 173 U. S. 285, 297-298 (1899) (\"When Congress acts with reference to a matter confided to itby the Constitution, then its statutes displace all conflicting local regulations touching that matter, although such regulations may have been established in pursuance of a power not surrendered by the States to the General Government\"); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175, 185 (1936) (\"[W]e look to the activities in which the states have traditionally engaged as marking the boundary of the restriction upon the federal taxing power. But there is no such limitation upon the plenary power to regulate commerce\").\n\n[13]  Contrary to the Court's suggestion, ante, at 611, n. 4, Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942), applied the substantial effects test to domestic agricultural production for domestic consumption, an activity that cannot fairly be described as commercial, despite its commercial consequences in affecting or being affected by the demand for agricultural products in the commercial market. The Wickard Court admitted that Filburn's activity \"may not be regarded as commerce\" but insisted that \"it may still, whatever its nature, be reached by Congress if it exerts a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce . . . .\" Id., at 125. The characterization of home wheat production as \"commerce\" or not is, however, ultimately beside the point. For if substantial effects on commerce are proper subjects of concern under the Commerce Clause, what difference should it make whether the causes of those effects are themselves commercial? Cf., e. g., National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 258 (1994) (\"An enterprise surely can have a detrimental influence on interstate or foreign commerce without having its own profit-seeking motives\"). The Court's answer is that it makes a difference to federalism, and the legitimacy of the Court's new judicially derived federalism is the crux of our disagreement. See infra, at 644-646.\n\n[14]  The Constitution of 1787 did, in fact, forbid some exercises of the commerce power. Article I,  9, cl. 6, barred Congress from giving preference to the ports of one State over those of another. More strikingly, the Framers protected the slave trade from federal interference, see Art. I,  9, cl. 1, and confirmed the power of a State to guarantee the chattel status of slaves who fled to another State, see Art. IV,  2, cl. 3. These reservations demonstrate the plenary nature of the federal power; the exceptions prove the rule. Apart from them, proposals to carve islands of state authority out of the stream of commerce power were entirely unsuccessful. Roger Sherman's proposed definition of federal legislative power as excluding \"matters of internal police\" met Gouverneur Morris's response that \"[t]he internal police . . . ought to be infringed in many cases\" and was voted down eight to two. 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 25-26 (M. Farrand ed. 1911) (hereinafter Farrand). The Convention similarly rejected Sherman's attempt to include in Article V a proviso that \"no state shall . . . be affected in its internal police.\" 5 Elliot's Debates 551-552. Finally, Rufus King suggested an explicit bill of rights for the States, a device that might indeed have set aside the areas the Court now declares off-limits. 1 Farrand 493 (\"As the fundamental rights of individuals are secured by express provisions in the State Constitutions; why may not a like security be provided for the Rights of States in the National Constitution\"). That proposal, too, came to naught. In short, to suppose that enumerated powers must have limits is sensible; to maintain that there exist judicially identifiable areas of state regulation immune to the plenary congressional commerce power even though falling within the limits defined by the substantial effects test is to deny our constitutional history.\n\n[15]  That the national economy and the national legislative power expand in tandem is not a recent discovery. This Court accepted the prospect well over 100 years ago, noting that the commerce powers \"are not confined to the instrumentalities of commerce, or the postal service known or in use when the Constitution was adopted, but they keep pace with the progress of the country, and adapt themselves to the new developments of time and circumstances.\" Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 96 U. S. 1, 9 (1878). See also, e. g., Farmers Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, 280 U. S. 204, 211-212 (1930) (\"Primitive conditions have passed; business is now transacted on a national scale\").\n\n[16]  As mentioned in n. 11, supra, many state conventions voted in favor of the Constitution only after proposing amendments. See 1 Elliot's Debates 322-323 (Massachusetts), 325 (South Carolina), 325-327 (New Hampshire), 327 (Virginia), 327-331 (New York), 331-332 (North Carolina), 334 337 (Rhode Island).\n\n[17]  Statements to similar effect pervade the ratification debates. See, e. g., 2 id., at 166-170 (Massachusetts, remarks of Samuel Stillman); 2 id.,  at 251-253 (New York, remarks of Alexander Hamilton); 4 id., at 95-98 (North Carolina, remarks of James Iredell).\n\n[18]  The majority's special solicitude for \"areas of traditional state regulation,\" ante, at 615, is thus founded not on the text of the Constitution but on what has been termed the \"spirit of the Tenth Amendment,\" Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S., at 585 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). Susceptibility to what Justice Holmes more bluntly called \"some invisible radiation from the general terms of the Tenth Amendment,\" Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416, 434 (1920), has increased in recent years, in disregard of his admonition that \"[w]e must consider what this country has become in deciding what that Amendment has reserved,\" ibid.\n\n[19]  The majority tries to deflect the objection that it blocks an intended political process by explaining that the Framers intended politics to set the federal balance only within the sphere of permissible commerce legislation, whereas we are looking to politics to define that sphere (in derogation even of Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803)), ante, at 616. But we all accept the view that politics is the arbiter of state interests only within the realm of legitimate congressional action under the commerce power. Neither Madison nor Wilson nor Marshall, nor the Jones & Laughlin, Darby, Wickard, or Garcia Courts, suggested that politics defines the commerce power. Nor do we, even though we recognize that the conditions of the contemporary world result in a vastly greater sphere of influence for politics than the Framers would have envisioned. Politics has legitimate authority, for all of us on both sides of the disagreement, only within the legitimate compass of the commerce power. The majority claims merely to be engaging in the judicial task of patrolling the outer boundaries of that congressional authority. See ante, at 616-617, n. 7. That assertion cannot be reconciled with our statements of the substantial effects test, which have not drawn the categorical distinctions the majority favors. See, e. g., Wickard, 317 U. S., at 125; United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 118-119 (1941). The majority's attempt to circumscribe the commerce power by defining it in terms of categorical exceptions can only be seen as a revival of similar efforts that led to near tragedy for the Court and incoherence for the law. If history's lessons are accepted as guides for Commerce Clause interpretation today, as we do accept them, then the subject matter of the Act falls within the commerce power and the choice to legislate nationally on that subject, or to except it from national legislation because the States have traditionally dealt with it, should be a political choice and only a political choice.\n\n[20]  See n. 7, supra. The point here is not that I take the position that the States are incapable of dealing adequately with domestic violence if their political leaders have the will to do so; it is simply that the Congress had evidence from which it could find a national statute necessary, so that its passage obviously survives Commerce Clause scrutiny.\n\n[21]  The majority's concerns about accountability strike me as entirely misplaced. Individuals, such as the defendants in this action, haled into federal court and sued under the United States Code, are quite aware of which of our dual sovereignties is attempting to regulate their behavior. Had Congress chosen, in the exercise of its powers under  5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, to proceed instead by regulating the States, rather than private individuals, this accountability would be far less plain.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1594442", "artist_names": "Etta James", "full_title": "Fools Rush In by\u00a0Etta\u00a0James",

First National Realty Corp. LyricsCitation: 428 F.2d 1071\n\nJ. SKELLY WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:These cases present the question whether housing code[1] violations which arise during the term of a lease have any effect upon the tenant's obligation to pay rent. The Landlord and Tenant Branch of the District of Columbia Court of General Sessions ruled proof of such violations inadmissible when proffered as a defense to an eviction action for nonpayment of rent. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals upheld this ruling. Saunders v. First National Realty Corp., 245 A.2d 836 (1968).Because of the importance of the question presented, we granted appeallants' petitions for leave to appeal. We now reverse and hold that a warranty of habitability, measured by the standards set out in the Housing Regulations for the District of Columbia, is implied by operation of law into leases of urban dwelling units covered by those Regulations and that breach of this warranty gives rise to the usual remedies for breach of contract.IThe facts revealed by the record are simple. By separate written leases,[2] each of the appellants rented an apartment in a three-building apartment complex in Northwest Washington known as Clifton Terrace. The landlord, First National Realty Corporation, filed separate actions in the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the Court of General Sessions on April 8, 1966, seeking possession on the ground that each of the appellants had defaulted in the payment of rent due for the month of April. The tenants, appellants here, admitted that they had not paid the landlord any rent for April. However, they alleged numerous violations of the Housing Regulations as \"an equitable defense or [a] claim by way of recoupment or set-off in an amount equal to the rent claim,\" as provided in the rules of the Court of General Sessions.[3] They offered to prove[t]hat there are approximately 1500 violations of the Housing Regulations of the District of Columbia in the building at Clifton Terrace, where Defendant resides some affecting the premises of this Defendant directly, others indirectly, and all tending to establish a course of conduct of violation of the Housing Regulations to the damage of Defendants * * *.\nSettled Statement of Proceedings and Evidence, p. 2 (1966). Appellants conceded at trial, however, that this offer of proof reached only violations which had arisen since the term of the lease had commenced. The Court of General Sessions refused appellants' offer of proof[4] and entered judgment for the landlord. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting the argument made by appellants that the landlord was under a contractual duty to maintain the premises in compliance with the Housing Regulations. Saunders v. First National Realty Corp., supra, 245 A.2d at 838.[5]IISince, in traditional analysis, a lease was the conveyance of an interest in land, courts have usually utilized the special rules governing real property transactions to resolve controversies involving leases. However, as the Supreme Court has noted in another context, \"the body of private property law * * *, more than almost any other branch of law, has been shaped by distinctions whose validity is largely historical.\"[6] Courts have a duty to reappraise old doctrines in the light of the facts and values of contemporary life \u2014 particularly old common law doctrines which the courts themselves created and developed.[7] As we have said before, \"[T]he continued vitality of the common law * * * depends upon its ability to reflect contemporary community values and ethics.\"[8]\n\nThe assumption of landlord-tenant law, derived from feudal property law, that a lease primarily conveyed to the tenant an interest in land may have been reasonable in a rural, agrarian society; it may continue to be reasonable in some leases involving farming or commercial land. In these cases, the value of the lease to the tenant is the land itself. But in the case of the modern apartment dweller, the value of the lease is that it gives him a place to live. The city dweller who seeks to lease an apartment on the third floor of a tenement has little interest in the land 30 or 40 feet below, or even in the bare right to possession within the four walls of his apartment. When American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek \"shelter\" today, they seek a well known package of goods and services[9] \u2014 a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.\n\nProfessor Powell summarizes the present state of the law:* * * The complexities of city life, and the proliferated problems of modern society in general, have created new problems for lessors and lessees and these have been commonly handled by specific clauses inserted in leases. This growth in the number and detail of specific lease covenants has reintroduced into the law of estates for years a predominantly contractual ingredient. In practice, the law today concerning estates for years consists chiefly of rules determining the construction and effect of lease covenants. * * *[10]Ironically, however, the rules governing the construction and interpretation of \"predominantly contractual\" obligations in leases have too often remained rooted in old property law.\n\nSome courts have realized that certain of the old rules of property law governing leases are inappropriate for today's transactions. In order to reach results more in accord with the legitimate expectations of the parties and the standards of the community, courts have been gradually introducing more modern precepts of contract law in interpreting leases.[11] Proceeding piecemeal has, however, led to confusion where \"decisions are frequently conflicting, not because of a healthy disagreement on social policy, but because of the lingering impact of rules whose policies are long since dead.\"[12]\nIn our judgment the trend toward treating leases as contracts is wise and well considered. Our holding in this case reflects a belief that leases of urban dwelling units should be interpreted and construed like any other contract.[13]IIIModern contract law has recognized that the buyer of goods and services in an industrialized society must rely upon the skill and honesty of the supplier to assure that goods and services purchased are of adequate quality.[14] In interpreting most contracts, courts have sought to protect the legitimate expectations of the buyer and have steadily widened the seller's responsibility for the quality of goods and services through implied warranties of fitness and merchantability.[15] Thus without any special agreement a merchant will be held to warrant that his goods are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used and that they are at least of reasonably average quality. Moreover, if the supplier has been notified that goods are required for a specific purpose, he will be held to warrant that any goods sold are fit for that purpose. These implied warranties have become widely accepted and well established features of the common law, supported by the overwhelming body of case law.[16] Today most states as well as the District of Columbia[17] have codified and enacted these warranties into statute, as to the sale of goods, in the Uniform Commercial Code.\n\nImplied warranties of quality have not been limited to cases involving sales. The consumer renting a chattel, paying for services, or buying a combination of goods and services must rely upon the skill and honesty of the supplier to at least the same extent as a purchaser of goods. Courts have not hesitated to find implied warranties of fitness and merchantability in such situations.[18] In most areas product liability law has moved far beyond \"mere\" implied warranties running between two parties in privity with each other.[19]\n\nThe rigid doctrines of real property law have tended to inhibit the application of implied warranties to transactions involving real estate.[20] Now, however, courts have begun to hold sellers and developers of real property responsible for the quality of their product.[21] For example, builders of new homes have recently been held liable to purchasers for improper construction on the ground that the builders had breached an implied warranty of fitness.[22] In other cases courts have held builders of new homes liable for breach of an implied warranty that all local building regulations had been complied with.[23] And following the developments in other areas, very recent decisions[24] and commentary[25] suggest the possible extension of liability to parties other than the immediate seller for improper construction of residential real estate.\n\nDespite this trend in the sale of real estate, many courts have been unwilling to imply warranties of quality, specifically a warranty of habitability, into leases of apartments. Recent decisions have offered no convincing explanation for their refusal[26]; rather they have relied without discussion upon the old common law rule that the lessor is not obligated to repair unless he covenants to do so in the written lease contract.[27] However, the Supreme Courts of at least two states, in recent and well reasoned opinions, have held landlords to implied warranties of quality in housing leases. Lemle v. Breeden, S.Ct.Hawaii, 462 P. 2d 470 (1969); Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 53 N.J. 444, 251 A.2d 268 (1969). See also Pines v. Perssion, 14 Wis.2d 590, 111 N.W.2d 409 (1961). In our judgment, the old no-repair rule cannot coexist with the obligations imposed on the landlord by a typical modern housing code, and must be abandoned[28] in favor of an implied warranty of habitability.[29] In the District of Columbia, the standards of this warranty are set out in the Housing Regulations.IVA. In our judgment the common law itself must recognize the landlord's obligation to keep his premises in a habitable condition. This conclusion is compelled by three separate considerations. First, we believe that the old rule was based on certain factual assumptions which are no longer true; on its own terms, it can no longer be justified. Second, we believe that the consumer protection cases discussed above require that the old rule be abandoned in order to bring residential landlord-tenant law into harmony with the principles on which those cases rest. Third, we think that the nature of today's urban housing market also dictates abandonment of the old rule.\n\nThe common law rule absolving the lessor of all obligation to repair originated in the early Middle Ages.[30] Such a rule was perhaps well suited to an agrarian economy; the land was more important[31] than whatever small living structure was included in the leasehold, and the tenant farmer was fully capable of making repairs himself.[32] These historical facts were the basis on which the common law constructed its rule; they also provided the necessary prerequisites for its application.[33]\n\nCourt decisions in the late 1800's began to recognize that the factual assumptions of the common law were no longer accurate in some cases. For example, the common law, since it assumed that the land was the most important part of the leasehold, required a tenant to pay rent even if any building on the land was destroyed.[34] Faced with such a rule and the ludicrous results it produced, in 1863 the New York Court of Appeals declined to hold that an upper story tenant was obliged to continue paying rent after his apartment building burned down.[35] The court simply pointed out that the urban tenant had no interest in the land, only in the attached building.\n\nAnother line of cases created an exception to the no-repair rule for short term leases of furnished dwellings.[36] The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, a court not known for its willingness to depart from the common law, supported this exception, pointing out:* * * [A] different rule should apply to one who hires a furnished room, or a furnished house, for a few days, or a few weeks or months. Its fitness for immediate use of a particular kind, as indicated by its appointments, is a far more important element entering into the contract than when there is a mere lease of real estate. One who lets for a short term a house provided with all furnishings and appointments for immediate residence may be supposed to contract in reference to a well-understood purpose of the hirer to use it as a habitation. * * * It would be unreasonable to hold, under such circumstances, that the landlord does not impliedly agree that what he is letting is a house suitable for occupation in its condition at the time. * * *[37]These as well as other similar cases[38] demonstrate that some courts began some time ago to question the common law's assumptions that the land was the most important feature of a leasehold and that the tenant could feasibly make any necessary repairs himself. Where those assumptions no longer reflect contemporary housing patterns, the courts have created exceptions to the general rule that landlords have no duty to keep their premises in repair.\n\nIt is overdue for courts to admit that these assumptions are no longer true with regard to all urban housing. Today's urban[39] tenants, the vast majority of whom live in multiple dwelling houses, are interested, not in the land, but solely in \"a house suitable for occupation.\" Furthermore, today's city dweller usually has a single, specialized skill unrelated to maintenance work; he is unable to make repairs like the \"jack-of-all-trades\" farmer who was the common law's model of the lessee.[40] Further, unlike his agrarian predecessor who often remained on one piece of land for his entire life, urban tenants today are more mobile than ever before. A tenant's tenure in a specific apartment will often not be sufficient to justify efforts at repairs. In addition, the increasing complexity of today's dwellings renders them much more difficult to repair than the structures of earlier times. In a multiple dwelling repair may require access to equipment and areas in the control of the landlord. Low and middle income tenants, even if they were interested in making repairs, would be unable to obtain any financing for major repairs since they have no long-term interest in the property.\n\nOur approach to the common law of landlord and tenant ought to be aided by principles derived from the consumer protection cases referred to above.[41] In a lease contract, a tenant seeks to purchase from his landlord shelter for a specified period of time. The landlord sells housing as a commercial businessman and has much greater opportunity, incentive and capacity to inspect and maintain the condition of his building. Moreover, the tenant must rely upon the skill and bona fides of his landlord at least as much as a car buyer must rely upon the car manufacturer. In dealing with major problems, such as heating, plumbing, electrical or structural defects, the tenant's position corresponds precisely with \"the ordinary consumer who cannot be expected to have the knowledge or capacity or even the opportunity to make adequate inspection of mechanical instrumentalities, like automobiles, and to decide for himself whether they are reasonably fit for the designed purpose.\" Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., 32 N.J. 358, 375, 161 A.2d 69, 78 (1960).[42]\n\nSince a lease contract specifies a particular period of time during which the tenant has a right to use his apartment for shelter, he may legitimately expect that the apartment will be fit for habitation for the time period for which it is rented. We point out that in the present cases there is no allegation that appellants' apartments were in poor condition or in violation of the housing code at the commencement of the leases.[43] Since the lessees continue to pay the same rent, they were entitled to expect that the landlord would continue to keep the premises in their beginning condition during the lease term. It is precisely such expectations that the law now recognizes as deserving of formal, legal protection.\n\nEven beyond the rationale of traditional products liability law, the relationship of landlord and tenant suggests further compelling reasons for the law's protection of the tenants' legitimate expectations of quality. The inequality in bargaining power between landlord and tenant has been well documented.[44] Tenants have very little leverage to enforce demands for better housing. Various impediments to competition in the rental housing market, such as racial and class discrimination[45] and standardized form leases,[46] mean that landlords place tenants in a take it or leave it situation. The increasingly severe shortage[47] of adequate housing further increases the landlord's bargaining power and escalates the need for maintaining and improving the existing stock. Finally, the findings by various studies of the social impact of bad housing has led to the realization that poor housing is detrimental to the whole society, not merely to the unlucky ones who must suffer the daily indignity of living in a slum.[48]\n\nThus we are led by our inspection of the relevant legal principles and precedents to the conclusion that the old common law rule imposing an obligation upon the lessee to repair during the lease term was really never intended to apply to residential urban leaseholds. Contract principles established in other areas of the law provide a more rational framework for the apportionment of landlord-tenant responsibilities; they strongly suggest that a warranty of habitability be implied into all contracts[49] for urban dwellings.\n\nB. We believe, in any event, that the District's housing code requires that a warranty of habitability be implied in the leases of all housing that it covers. The housing code \u2014 formally designated the Housing Regulations of the District of Columbia \u2014 was established and authorized by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia on August 11, 1955.[50] Since that time, the code has been updated by numerous orders of the Commissioners. The 75 pages of the Regulations provide a comprehensive regulatory scheme setting forth in some detail: (a) the standards which housing in the District of Columbia must meet;[51] (b) which party, the lessor or the lessee, must meet each standard; and (c) a system of inspections, notifications and criminal penalties. The Regulations themselves are silent on the question of private remedies.\nTwo previous decisions of this court, however, have held that the Housing Regulations create legal rights and duties enforceable in tort by private parties. In Whetzel v. Jess Fisher Management Co., 108 U.S.App.D.C. 385, 282 F.2d 943 (1960), we followed the leading case of Altz v. Lieberson, 233 N.Y. 16, 134 N.E. 703 (1922), in holding (1) that the housing code altered the common law rule and imposed a duty to repair upon the landlord, and (2) that a right of action accrued to a tenant injured by the landlord's breach of this duty. As Judge Cardozo wrote in Lieberson:* * * We may be sure that the framers of this statute, when regulating tenement life, had uppermost in thought the care of those who are unable to care for themselves. The Legislature must have known that unless repairs in the rooms of the poor were made by the landlord, they would not be made by any one. The duty imposed became commensurate with the need. The right to seek redress is not limited to the city or its officers. The right extends to all whom there was a purpose to protect. * * *\n134 N.E. at 704. Recently, in Kanelos v. Kettler, 132 U.S.App.D.C. 133, 135, 406 F.2d 951, 953 (1968), we reaffirmed our position in Whetzel, holding that the Housing Regulations did impose maintenance obligations upon appellee [landlord] which he was not free to ignore.[52]The District of Columbia Court of Appeals gave further effect to the Housing Regulations in Brown v. Southall Realty Co., 237 A.2d 834 (1968). There the landlord knew at the time the lease was signed that housing code violations existed which rendered the apartment \"unsafe and unsanitary.\" Viewing the lease as a contract, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the premises were let in violation of Sections 2304[53] and 2501[54] of the Regulations and that the lease, therefore, was void as an illegal contract. In the light of Brown, it is clear not only that the housing code creates privately enforceable duties as held in Whetzel, but that the basic validity of every housing contract depends upon substantial compliance with the housing code at the beginning of the lease term. The Brown court relied particularly upon Section 2501 of the Regulations which provides:Every premises accommodating one or more habitations shall be maintained and kept in repair so as to provide decent living accommodations for the occupants. This part of this Code contemplates more than mere basic repairs and maintenance to keep out the elements; its purpose is to include repairs and maintenance designed to make a premises or neighborhood healthy and safe.By its terms, this section applies to maintenance and repair during the lease term. Under the Brown holding, serious failure to comply with this section before the lease term begins renders the contract void. We think it untenable to find that this section has no effect on the contract after it has been signed. To the contrary, by signing the lease the landlord has undertaken a continuing obligation to the tenant to maintain the premises in accordance with all applicable law.\n\nThis principle of implied warranty is well established. Courts often imply relevant law into contracts to provide a remedy for any damage caused by one party's illegal conduct.[55] In a case closely analogous to the present ones, the Illinois Supreme Court held that a builder who constructed a house in violation of the Chicago building code had breached his contract with the buyer:* * * [T]he law existing at the time and place of the making of the contract is deemed a part of the contract, as though expressly referred to or incorporated in it. * * *\nThe rationale for this rule is that the parties to the contract would have expressed that which the law implies `had they not supposed that it was unnecessary to speak of it because the law provided for it.' * * * Consequently, the courts, in construing the existing law as part of the express contract, are not reading into the contract provisions different from those expressed and intended by the parties, as defendants contend, but are merely construing the contract in accordance with the intent of the parties.[56]We follow the Illinois court in holding that the housing code must be read into housing contracts \u2014 a holding also required by the purposes and the structure of the code itself.[57] The duties imposed by the Housing Regulations may not be waived or shifted by agreement if the Regulations specifically place the duty upon the lessor.[58] Criminal penalties are provided if these duties are ignored. This regulatory structure was established by the Commissioners because, in their judgment, the grave conditions in the housing market required serious action. Yet official enforcement of the housing code has been far from uniformly effective.[59] Innumerable studies have documented the desperate condition of rental housing in the District of Columbia and in the nation. In view of these circumstances, we think the conclusion reached by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin as to the effect of a housing code on the old common law rule cannot be avoided:* * * [T]he legislature has made a policy judgment \u2014 that it is socially (and politically) desirable to impose these duties on a property owner \u2014 which has rendered the old common law rule obsolete. To follow the old rule of no implied warranty of habitability in leases would, in our opinion, be inconsistent with the current legislative policy concerning housing standards. * * *[60]VIn the present cases, the landlord sued for possession for nonpayment of rent. Under contract principles,[61] however, the tenant's obligation to pay rent is dependent upon the landlord's performance of his obligations, including his warranty to maintain the premises in habitable condition. In order to determine whether any rent is owed to the landlord, the tenants must be given an opportunity to prove the housing code violations alleged as breach of the landlord's warranty.[62]\n\nAt trial, the finder of fact must make two findings: (1) whether the alleged violations[63] existed during the period for which past due rent is claimed, and (2) what portion, if any or all, of the tenant's obligation to pay rent was suspended by the landlord's breach. If no part of the tenant's rental obligation is found to have been suspended, then a judgment for possession may issue forthwith. On the other hand, if the jury determines that the entire rental obligation has been extinguished by the landlord's total breach, then the action for possession on the ground of nonpayment must fail.[64]\n\nThe jury may find that part of the tenant's rental obligation has been suspended but that part of the unpaid back rent is indeed owed to the landlord.[65] In these circumstances, no judgment for possession should issue if the tenant agrees to pay the partial rent found to be due.[66] If the tenant refuses to pay the partial amount, a judgment for possession may then be entered.\n\nThe judgment of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals is reversed and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[67]\n\nSo ordered.\n\nCircuit Judge ROBB concurs in the result and in Parts IV-B and V of the opinion.\n\nFootnotes\n[1] Housing Regulations of the District of Columbia (1956).\n\n[2] A clause in the lease provided that the tenant waived the statutory 30-day notice to quit. 45 D.C.Code \u00a7 908 (1967) expressly permits waiver of this notice. Appellants' answer put in issue the validity of the waivers. In view of our disposition, we have no occasion to pass upon this aspect of the case.\n\n[3] Rule 4(c) of the Landlord and Tenant Branch of the Court of General Sessions provides:In suits in this branch for recovery of possession of property in which the basis of recovery of possession is nonpayment of rent, tenants may set up an equitable defense or claim by way of recoupment or set-off in an amount equal to the rent claim. No counterclaim may be filed unless plaintiff asks for money judgment for rent. The exclusion of prosecution of any claims in this branch shall be without prejudice to the prosecution of any claims in other branches of the court.\n\nAppellants have sought only to defeat the landlord's action; they have not as yet claimed any money damages for the landlord's alleged breach of contract. Under Rule 4(c) supra, they may not counterclaim for money damages if the landlord seeks only possession and no money judgment, as it has done here. For the considerations to be applied in determining whether this rule conforms \"as nearly as may be practicable\" to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure as required by 13 D.C.Code \u00a7 101 (1967), see McKelton v. Bruno, 138 U.S.App. D.C. \u2014, 428 F.2d 718 (decided February 17, 1970).[4] According to established procedure, this case was submitted to both the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and this court on the basis of a sparse \"Settled Statement of Proceedings and Evidence,\" as approved by both parties and the trial judge. Unfortunately, the court's ruling on the offer of proof was made from the bench, and the basis of the ruling is not reflected in the \"Settled Statement.\" We have recently noted the inadequacy of such records for review by an appellate court. Lee v.

The interpretation and construction of contracts between private parties has always required courts to be sensitive and responsive to myriad different factors. We believe contract doctrines allow courts to be properly sensitive to all relevant factors in interpreting lease obligations.\n\nWe also intend no alteration of statutory or case law definitions of the term \"real property\" for purposes of statutes or decisions on recordation, descent, conveyancing, creditors' rights, etc. We contemplate only that contract law is to determine the rights and obligations of the parties to the lease agreement, as between themselves. The civil law has always viewed the lease as a contract, and in our judgment that perspective has proved superior to that of the common law. See 2 M.

Del Monte, N.Y.S.Ct., App.T., 217 N.Y.S.2d 792 (1961).\n\n[27] The cases which recite this old rule are legion. A representative sampling is cited in 32 Am.Jur. Landlord and Tenant \u00a7 655 n. 14 (1941).\n\n[28] As far as tort liability is concerned, we have previously held that the old common law rule has been changed by passage of the housing code and that the landlord has a duty to maintain reasonably safe premises. See Note 52 infra.\n[29] Although the present cases involve written leases, we think there is no particular significance in this fact. The landlord's warranty is implied in oral and written leases for all types of tenancies.\n\n[30] The rule was \"settled\" by 1485. 3 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 122-123 (6th ed. 1934). The common law rule discussed in text originated in the even older rule prohibiting the tenant from committing waste. The writ of waste expanded as the tenant's right to possession grew stronger. Eventually, in order to protect the landowner's reversionary interest, the tenant became obligated to make repairs and liable to eviction and damages if he failed to do so. Ibid.\n[31] The land was so central to the original common law conception of a leasehold that rent was viewed as \"issuing\" from the land:[T]he governing idea is that the land is bound to pay the rent * *. We may almost go to the length of saying that the land pays it through [the tenant's] hand. 2 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, The History of English Law 131 (2d ed. 1923).[32] Many later judicial opinions have added another justification of the old common law rule. They have invoked the timeworn cry of caveat emptor and argued that a lessee has the opportunity to inspect the premises. On the basis of his inspection, the tenant must then take the premises \"as is,\" according to this reasoning. As an historical matter, the opportunity to inspect was not thought important when the rule was first devised. See Note 30 supra. To the extent the no-repair rule rests on caveat emptor, see page 1079, infra.\n[33] Even the old common law courts responded with a different rule for a landlord-tenant relationship which did not conform to the model of the usual agrarian lease. Much more substantial obligations were placed upon the keepers of inns (the only multiple dwelling houses known to the common law). Their guests were interested solely in shelter and could not be expected to make their own repairs. \"The modern apartment dweller more closely resembles the guest in an inn than he resembles an agrarian tenant, but the law has not generally recognized the similarity.\" J. Levi, P. Hablutzel, L. Rosenberg & J. White, Model Residential Landlord-Tenant Code 6-7 (Tent. Draft 1969).\n\n[34] Paradine v. Jane, Aleyn 26, 82 Eng.

Powell, supra Note 10, \u00b6 225 [3]. See also Gladden v. Walker & Dunlop, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 224, 168 F.2d 321 (1948) (landlord has duty to maintain portions of apartment \"under his control\" including plumbing, heating and electrical systems); J. D.

Rothschild, 179 N.Y. 273, 72 N.E. 112 (1904) (duty to disclose latent defects).\n\n[39] In 1968 more than two thirds of America's people lived in the 228 largest metropolitan areas. Only 5.2% lived on farms. The World Almanac 1970 at 251 (L. Long ed.). More than 98% of all housing starts in 1968 were non-farm. Id. at 313.\n\n[40] See J. Levi et al., supra Note 33, at 6.\n\n[41] See Part III, supra.\n[42] Nor should the average tenant be thought capable of \"inspecting\" plaster, floorboards, roofing, kitchen appliances, etc. To the extent, however, that some defects are obvious, the law must take note of the present housing shortage. Tenants may have no real alternative but to accept such housing with the expectation that the landlord will make necessary repairs. Where this is so, caveat emptor must of necessity be rejected.\n\n[43] In Brown v. Southall Realty Co., 237 A.2d 834 (1968), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that unsafe and unsanitary conditions existing at the beginning of the tenancy and known to the landlord rendered any lease of those premises illegal and void.\n\n[44] See Edwards v. Habib, 130 U.S.App. D.C. 126, 140, 397 F.2d 687, 701 (1968); 2 R.

Schorr, Slums and Insecurity (1963); J.

See Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., supra Note 19; Kay v. Cain, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 24, 25, 154 F.2d 305, 306 (1946). See also Note 58, infra.\n[50] 2 D.C.Register 47 (1955).\n\n[51] These include standards for nursing homes and other similar institutions. The full scheme of the Regulations is set out in Whetzel v. Fisher Management Co., supra Note 8.\n\n[52] Kanelos and Whetzel have effectively overruled, on the basis of the enactment of the housing code, Bowles v. Mahoney, 91 U.S.App.D.C. 155, 202 F.2d 320 (1952) (two to one decision, Judge Bazelon dissenting).\n\n[53] \"No person shall rent or offer to rent any habitation, or the furnishings thereof, unless such habitation and its furnishings are in a clean, safe and sanitary condition, in repair, and free from rodents or vermin.\"\n\n[54] See infra.\n[55] See cases cited in Annot., 110 A.L.R. 1048 (1937).\n\n[56] Schiro v. W. E. Gould & Co., supra Note 23, 18 Ill.2d at 544, 165 N.E.2d at 290. As a general proposition, it is undoubtedly true that parties to a contract intend that applicable law will be complied with by both sides. We recognize, however, that reading statutory provisions into private contracts may have little factual support in the intentions of the particular parties now before us. But, for reasons of public policy, warranties are often implied into contracts by operation of law in order to meet generally prevailing standards of honesty and fair dealing. When the public policy has been enacted into law like the housing code, that policy will usually have deep roots in the expectations and intentions of most people. See Costigan, Implied-in-Fact Contracts and Mutual Assent, 33 Harv. L.Rev. 376, 383-385 (1920).\n\n[57] \"The housing and sanitary codes, especially in light of Congress' explicit direction for their enactment, indicate a strong and pervasive congressional concern to secure for the city's slum dwellers decent, or at least safe and sanitary, places to live.\" Edwards v. Habib, supra Note 44, 130 U.S.App.D.C. at 139, 397 F.2d at 700.\n\n[58] Any private agreement to shift the duties would be illegal and unenforceable. The precedents dealing with industrial safety statutes are directly in point:* * * [T]he only question remaining is whether the courts will enforce or recognize as against a servant an agreement express or implied on his part to waive the performance of a statutory duty of the master imposed for the protection of the servant, and in the interest of the public, and enforceable by criminal prosecution. We do not think they will. To do so would be to nullify the object of the statute. * * *\n\nNarramore v. Cleveland, C., C. & St. L. Ry. Co., 6 Cir., 96 F. 298, 302 (1899). See W. Prosser, Torts \u00a7 67 at 468-469 (3d ed. 1964) and cases cited therein.[59] See Gribetz & Grad, Housing Code Enforcement: Sanctions and Remedies, 66 Colum.L.Rev. 1254 (1966); Note, Enforcement of Municipal Housing Codes, 78 Harv.L.Rev. 801 (1965).\n\n[60] Pines v.

Azulai, 251 Cal.App.2d Supp. 1013, 59 Cal.Rptr. 806 (1967).\n\n[61] In extending all contract remedies for breach to the parties to a lease, we include an action for specific performance of the landlord's implied warranty of habitability.\n\n[62]To be relevant, of course, the violations must affect the tenant's apartment or common areas which the tenant uses. Moreover, the contract principle that no one may benefit from his own wrong will allow the landlord to defend by proving the damage was caused by the tenant's wrongful action. However, violations resulting from inadequate repairs or materials which disintegrate under normal use would not be assignable to the tenant. Also we agree with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals that the tenant's private rights do not depend on official inspection or official finding of violation by the city government. Diamond Housing Corp. v. Robinson, 257 A.2d 492, 494 (1969).\n\n[63] The jury should be instructed that one or two minor violations standing alone which do not affect habitability are de minimis and would not entitle the tenant to a reduction in rent.\n\n[64] As soon as the landlord made the necessary repairs rent would again become due. Our holding, of course, affects only eviction for nonpayment of rent. The landlord is free to seek eviction at the termination of the lease or on any other legal ground.\n\n[65] In George Y. Worthington & Son Management Corp. v. Levy, 204 A.2d 334, 336 (1964), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals approved a similar procedure:In actions for possession of real property by reason of default in rent, where no money judgment for the back rent is sought, it is nevertheless proper practice for the trial court to specifically find the amount of rent in arrears. * * *[66] Compare Molyneaux v. Town House, Inc., D.C.C.A., 195 A.2d 744 (1963). A jury finding that the landlord had failed to live up to all of his obligations would operate as a conclusive finding that the tenant was entitled to equitable relief under Molyneaux.\n[67] Appellants in the present cases offered to pay rent into the registry of the court during the present action. We think this is an excellent protective procedure. If the tenant defends against an action for possession on the basis of breach of the landlord's warranty of habitability, the trial court may require the tenant to make future rent payments into the registry of the court as they become due; such a procedure would be appropriate only while the tenant remains in possession. The escrowed money will, however, represent rent for the period between the time the landlord files suit and the time the case comes to trial. In the normal course of litigation, the only factual question at trial would be the condition of the apartment during the time the landlord alleged rent was due and not paid.\n\nAs a general rule, the escrowed money should be apportioned between the landlord and the tenant after trial on the basis of the finding of rent actually due for the period at issue in the suit. To insure fair apportionment, however, we think either party should be permitted to amend its complaint or answer at any time before trial, to allege a change in the condition of the apartment. In this event, the finder of fact should make a separate finding as to the condition of the apartment at the time at which the amendment was filed. This new finding will have no effect upon the original action; it will only affect the distribution of the escrowed rent paid after the filing of the amendment.Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

thinking lots of times about back when I was a lad\nOf the old homeplace where I grew up of the days both good and bad\nMy overalls were hand-me-downs my shoes were full of holes\nI used to walk four miles to school every day through the rain the sleet and the cold\nI've seen the nights when my daddy would cry\nFor the things that his family would need\nBut all he ever got was a badland farm and seven hungry mouths to feed\nAnd yet and yet our homefire never flickered once\nCause when all these things went wrong\nMama took the hymn book down and mama sang a song\n(What a friend we have in Jesus)\nI've been rocked to sleep many a night to the tune of What a Friend\nAnd come morning Rock of Ages would wake me gently once again\nAnd when daddy would reach up and he'd take the Bible down\nAnd he'd read it read it loud and long\nAnd I always felt that maybe our house was blessed\nWhen daddy would say mama sing a song\nSister left home first I guess and then Bob and then Tommy and then Dan\nBy then dad's hair was turning white and I had to be mama's little man\nBut it seemed that as daddy's back grew weak my mother's faith just grew strong\nAnd those were the greatest days of all when mama sang a song\n(Rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in Thee)\nI guess the house is still standing I don't get to go back much anymore\nNo voice is left to fill those halls and no steps to grace the floor\nFor you see my mother sings in heaven now around God's golden throne\nBut I'll always believe that this world is a better place\nBecause one time my mama sang a song

The revolt in the\ndesert played a decisive part in the\nMiddle-Eastern Campaign.\nREPORTER\nYes, sir. But about Colonel Lawrence\nhimself?\n\nALLENBY\nNo, I didn't know him well, you know.\n\nREPORTER\nEh, Mr Bentley. You must know as much\nabout Colonel Lawrence as anybody does.\n\nBENTLEY\nYes. It was my privilege to know him, and\nto make him known to the world. He was a\npoet, a scholar, and a mighty warrior.\n\nREPORTER\nThank you.\n\nBENTLEY\nHe was also the most shameless\nexhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.\n\nMAN\nYou, sir. Who are you?\n\nBENTLEY\nMy name is Jackson Bentley.\n\nMAN\nWell, whoever you are, I overheard your\nlast remark and I take the gravest\npossible exception. He was a very great\nman.\n\nBENTLEY\nDid you know him?\n\nMAN\nNo, sir. I can't claim to have known him.\nI once had the honour to shake his hand\nin Damascus.\n\nMURRAY\nKnew him? No, I never knew him. He had\nsome minor function on my staff in Cairo.\n\n(Cairo)\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nMichael George Hartley. This is a nasty,\ndark little room.\n\nHARTLEY\nThat's right.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe are not happy in it.\n\nHARTLEY\nI am. It's better than a nasty, dark\nlittle trench.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen, you're a big noble fellow.\n\nHARTLEY\nThat's right.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAh! Here is William Potter with my\nnewspaper.\n\nPOTTER\nHere you are, Tosh!\n\nLAWRENCE\nThanks. Would you care for one of\nCorporal Hartley's cigarettes?\n\nPOTTER\nTa. Is it there?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOf course. Headlines, but I bet it isn't\nmentioned in The Times. \"Bedouin tribes\nattack Turkish stronghold\", and I bet\nthat no one in this whole headquarters\neven knows it happened, or cared if it\ndid. Allow me to ignite your cigarette.\n\nMESSENGER\nSir. Mr Lawrence?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes?\n\nFLIMSEY\nFlimsey, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThank you.\n\nHARTLEY\nYou'll do that once too often; it's only\nflesh and blood!\n\nLAWRENCE\nMichael George Hartley, you're a\nphilosopher.\n\nHARTLEY\nAnd you're balmy!\n\nPOTTER\nOw! It damn well hurts.\n\nLAWRENCE\nCertainly, it hurts!\n\nPOTTER\nWell, what's the trick then?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThe trick, William Potter, is not minding\nthat it hurts.\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, by the way. If Captain Gibbon should\ninquire for me, tell him I've gone for a\nchat with the General.\n\nPOTTER\nHe's balmy!\n\nHARTLEY\nHe's all right.\n\n\nFREDDY\nLawrence!\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes?\n\nFREDDY\nYou're supposed to be... Do you usually\nwear your cap in the mess?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, yes.\n\nFREDDY\nYou're supposed to be on duty, aren't\nyou? Where are you going?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMustn't talk shop, Freddy. Not in the\nmess. Matter of fact I'm going for a\n'powwow' with the General.\n\nFREDDY\nI'm not asking as a superior; I'm asking\nas the secretary of this mess. We don't\nwant chaps in here who should be on duty.\n\nORDERLY\nWhere are you going, please?\n\nFREDDY\nI must say! Lawrence!\n\nLAWRENCE\nSorry!\n\nFREDDY\nYou're a clown, Lawrence.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAh well, we can't all be lion-tamers...\nSorry!\n\nMURRAY\nIt's an intrigue, Dryden, and I do not\npropose to let an over-wheeling,\nfinicking, crass lieutenant thumb his\nnose at his general officer commanding\nand get away with it.\n\nDRYDEN\nHe doesn't sound as though he'd be any\ngreat loss, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nNow, don't try that, Dryden. There's a\nprinciple involved.\n\nDRYDEN\nThere is, indeed. He's of no use here in\nCairo; he might be in Arabia. He knows\nhis stuff, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nKnows the books, you mean. I've already\nsent out Colonel Brighton, who's a\nsoldier, and if Brighton thinks we should\nsend them some small arms, then we will.\nWhat more do you want?\n\nDRYDEN\nThere would be no question of Lieutenant\nLawrence giving military advice, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nBy God, I should hope not!\n\nDRYDEN\nIt's just that the Arab Bureau would like\nits own man on the spot, sir, to eh...\n\nMURRAY\nTo what?\n\nDRYDEN\n...to make our own appraisal of the\nsituation.\n\nMURRAY\nI may as well tell you it's my considered\nopinion, and that of my staff, that any\ntime spent on the Bedouin will be time\nwasted. They're a nation of sheep-\nstealers.\n\nDRYDEN\nThey did attack Medina.\n\nMURRAY\nWell, the Turks made mincemeat of them.\n\nDRYDEN\nWe don't know that, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nWe know they didn't take it. A storm in a\ntea-cup, Dryden; a side-show. Do you want\nmy own opinion? This whole theatre of\noperations is a side-show. The real war's\nbeing fought against the Germans, not the\nTurks, and not here but on the Western\nFront, in the trenches. Your Bedouin\narmy, or whatever it calls itself, would\nbe a side-show of a side-show.\n\nDRYDEN\nBig things have small beginnings, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nDoes the Arab Bureau want a 'big thing'\nin Arabia? If they rise against the\nTurks, does the Bureau think they're\ngoing to sit down quietly under us when\nthey're asked until this war's over?\n\nDRYDEN\nThe Bureau thinks the job at the moment,\nsir, is to win the war.\n\nMURRAY\nDon't tell me my duties, Dryden!\n\nOFFSCREEN\nLawrence, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nSend him in!\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood morning, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nSalute! If you're insubordinate of me,\nLawrence, I shall put you under arrest.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's my manner, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nYour what?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy manner, sir. It looks insubordinate,\nbut it isn't really.\n\nMURRAY\nNo, I can't make out whether you're\nbloody bad-mannered, or just half-witted.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI have the same problem, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nShut up!\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nNow, the Arab Bureau seem to think you\nwould be of some use to them in Arabia.\nWhy? I can't imagine! You don't seem able\nto perform your present duties properly.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI cannot fiddle, but I can make a great\nstate from a little city.\n\nMURRAY\nWhat!\n\nLAWRENCE\nThemistocles, sir. A Greek philosopher.\n\nMURRAY\nI know you've been well educated,\nLawrence. It says so in your dossier.\nYou're the kind of creature I can't\nstand, Lawrence, but I suppose I could be\nwrong. All right, Dryden, you can have\nhim for six weeks. Who knows? Might even\nmake a man of him. Come in. Yes? What is\nit, Hallon?\n\nHALLON\nNavy signal, sir. the convoy will be in\nPort Said tomorrow night.\n\nMURRAY\nIs that certain?\n\nHALLON\nYes, sir. There doesn't seem to be any\nartillery, sir.\n\nMURRAY\nBut there must be artillery!\n\nDRYDEN\nSir, this is something of an expedition.\nHe has to get to Yenbo, find a guide,\nfind the Arabs, and then get back. He\ncan't do that in six weeks.\n\nMURRAY\nTwo months, then.\n\nDRYDEN\nThree.\n\nMURRAY\nAll right. Three. Now, will you let me do\nsome work, Mr Dryden.\n\nDRYDEN\nThank you, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'd like to say, sir, that I am grateful\nfor this...\n\nMURRAY\nShut up and get out!\n\nLAWRENCE\nSir!\n\nMURRAY\nHow can I fight a bloody war without\nbloody artillery!\n\nLAWRENCE\nHow did you do it. sir?\n\nDRYDEN\nYou might better ask why I bothered to.\n\nLAWRENCE\nBecause I'm the man for the job.\n\nDRYDEN\nI just wonder about that\n\nLAWRENCE\nOf course I'm the man for the job. What\nis the job, by the way?\n\nDRYDEN\nFind Prince Feisal.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood. And when I've found him?\n\nDRYDEN\nFind out what kind of man he is; find out\nwhat his intentions are. I don't mean his\nimmediate intentions. That's of Colonel\nBrighton's business, not yours. I mean,\nhis intentions in Arabia altogether.\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh! That's new. Where are they now?\n\nDRYDEN\nAnywhere within three hundred miles of\nMedina. They're Hasami Bedouins. They can\ncross sixty miles of desert in a day.\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, thanks, Dryden. This is going to be\nfun.\n\nDRYDEN\nLawrence, only two kinds of creature get\nfun of the desert: Bedouins and gods, and\nyou're neither. Take it from me; for\nordinary men, it's a burning, fiery\nfurnace.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, Dryden. It's going to be fun.\n\nDRYDEN\nIt is recognised that you have a funny\nsense of fun.\nTAFAS\nHere, you may drink. One cup.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou do not drink?\n\nTAFAS\nNo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll drink when you do.\n\nTAFAS\nI am Bedu.\n\n\nTAFAS\nTruly, now, you are a British Officer?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nTAFAS\nFrom Cairo?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nTAFAS\nYou did not ride from Cairo?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. Thank Heavens. It's nine hundred\nmiles; I came by boat.\n\nTAFAS\nAnd before? From Britain?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nTAFAS\nTruly?\n\nLAWRENCE\nFrom Oxfordshire.\n\nTAFAS\nIs that a desert country?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo; a fat country; fat people.\n\nTAFAS\nYou are not fat?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. I'm different... Here, take it.\n\nTAFAS\nFirst, I take you to Lord Feisal, then\nyou give it to me.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTake it now.\n\nTAFAS\nBedu food.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood.\n\nTAFAS\nMore...Bedu!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhere?\n\nTAFAS\nFrom here to Lord Feisal's camp is Harif\ncountry.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, I know.\n\nTAFAS\nI am not Harif.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. Hasimi of the Beni Salim.\n\nTAFAS\nPut the right foot in tight. Lock it with\nyour left foot. Then, when you're ready\nto go, hit her on the shoulder and say,\n'Hut, hut, hut!'\n\nLAWRENCE\nHut, hut, hut!\n\nTAFAS\nAh, today will be difficult, but tomorrow\ngood riding...  I think we reach Mastura\nWell tomorrow. Yes? And from Mastura Well\nto Lord Feisal's camp one day more. Now!\n\nAt the Harif Well\n\nTAFAS\nGood?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's all right.\n\nTAFAS\nThis is a Harif well. The Harif are a\ndirty people.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTurks?\n\nTAFAS\nBedu!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWho is he?... Tafas!\n\nALI\nHe's dead.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. Why?\n\nALI\nThis is my well.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI have drunk from it.\n\nALI\nYou are welcome.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHe was my friend.\n\nALI\nThat!\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. That.\n\nALI\nThis pistol yours?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, his.\n\nALI\nHis?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMine.\n\nALI\nThen I will use it. Your friend was a\nHasami of the Beni Salim.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI know.\n\nALI\nI am Ali of El Karish.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI've heard of you.\n\nALI\nSo, what was a Hasami doing here?\n\nLAWRENCE\nHe was taking me to help Prince Feisal.\n\nALI\nYou have been sent from Cairo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALI\nI have been in Cairo for my schooling. I\ncan both read and write. My Lord Feisal\nalready has an Englishman.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALI\nWhat is your name?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy name is for my friends. None of my\nfriends is a murderer.\n\nALI\nYou are angry, English. He was nothing.\nThe well is everything. The Hasami may\nnot drink at our wells. He knew that.\nSalaam. Hut, hut, hut.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSherif Ali. So long as the Arabs fight\ntribe against tribe, so long will they be\na little people; a silly people; greedy,\nbarbarous, and cruel, as you are.\n\nALI\nCome. I will take you to Feisal.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI do not want your company, Sherif.\n\nALI\nWadi Safra is another day from here. You\nwill not find it, and not finding it, you\nwill die.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI will find it with this.\n\nALI\nGood army compass. How if I take it?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen you would be a thief.\n\nALI\nHave you no fear, English?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy fear is my concern.\n\nALI\nTruly. God be with you, English.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nAs I walk along the Bois Bou-long,\nWith an independent air,\nYou can here the girls declare,\n'He must be a millionaire,\nYou can rum-ti-tum-ti-tum-ti-tum,\nTi-tuddely-tun-ti-tun-ti-tun,\nI'm the man who broke the bank at\nMonte Carlo.\n\nBRIGHTON\nHey! You!...  I've been waiting for you.\n\nLAWRENCE\nDid you know I was coming?\n\nBRIGHTON\nI knew someone was coming; Feisal told\nme.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHow did he know?\n\nBRIGHTON\nNot much happens within fifty miles of\nFeisal that Feisal doesn't know, I'll\ngive him that. No escort?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy guide was killed at the Matsra well.\n\nBRIGHTON\nTurks?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. An Arab.\n\nBRIGHTON\nBloody savages!\n\nLAWRENCE\nThis is Wadi Safra, isn't it?\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes, they're over there; now, just a\nminute. What's your name and who sent\nyou?\n\nLAWRENCE\nLawrence. I've been seconded to the Arab\nBureau.\n\nBRIGHTON\nOh. and what are you to do for the Arab\nBureau?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWell, it's rather vague, sir. I'm to\nappreciate the situation.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, that won't be difficult. The\nsituation's bloody awful. The morale, if\never they had any, which I doubt, the\nTurks knocked out of them in front of\nMedina with howitzers. They're fading\naway by dozens every night. What I want\nto say to you is this; that wherever you\nare and whoever you're with, you're a\nBritish serving officer, and here's an\norder; when we get into that camp you're\nto keep your mouth shut. Do you\nunderstand what I'm saying?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, sir. I understand what you're\nsaying.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou'll make your appreciation and get\nback to...Oh my God; not again!... I've\ntold him; God knows I've told him. 'Move\nsouth', I've said, 'You're still in\nrange'. They simply will not understand\nwhat modern weapons do.\n\n\nFEISAL\nStand and fight! Stand and fight! Fire\nback at them!...  Who are you?\n\nBRIGHTON\nLieutenant Lawrence, sir. Seconded to the\nArab Bureau. This is a bloody mess, sir,\nwe'll have to move south.\n\nFEISAL\nYes, yes, Colonel; fifty miles south. You\nwere right and I was wrong. We must take\nsome thought for the wounded.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, we can take care of them at Yenbo,\nsir.\n\nFEISAL\nIf they get to Yenbo.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, they can hardly come with us, sir.\n\nFEISAL\nNo, they must try to reach Yenbo.\nLieutenant, eh..\n\nLAWRENCE\nLawrence.\n\nFEISAL\nYou understand, Lieutenant Lawrence, my\npeople are unused to explosives and\nmachines. First the guns, and now this.\n\n\nDAUD\nCigarette?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm sorry.\n\nSOLDIER\nEh?\n\nDAUD\nCigarette, Your Excellency?\n\nSOLDIER\nHump off!\n\nDAUD\nPlease, Your Excellency. Just one for\ntwo?\n\nBRIGHTON\nHold it, Jenkins! Jenkins! Jenk...!\nJenkins!\n\nMAJID\n'Aurens?\n\nLAWRENCE\n'Aurens!\n\nMAJID\n'Aurens, you have no servant.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't need a servant.\n\nDAUD\nNo? We can do everything. Light fires;\ncook food; wash clothes.\n\nFERRAJ\nYes, everything.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't doubt it.\n\nDAUD\nIt will be very nice for you...\n\nLAWRENCE\nI can't afford it.\n\n\nSILIAM\nRecite, then, as much of the Koran as may\nbe easy to you. God knoweth that there be\nsome among you sick while others travel\nthrough the Earth in quest for the\nbounties of God; others do battle in his\ncause; recite, therefore, as much as may\nbe easy and observe the prayers; this\nwill be best and richest in the\nrecompense. Seek ye the forgiveness of\nGod; verily, God is forgiving, merciful.\n\nFEISAL\nGreetings, Ali.\n\nALI\nMy lord.\n\nBRIGHTON\nSherif Ali.\n\nFEISAL\nLieutenant Lawrence, you have met Sherif\nAli, I think.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, my lord.\n\nFEISAL\nAnd now, Siliam, the brightness.\n\nSILIAM\nBy the noon-day brightness, by the light\nwhen it darkeneth; thy Lord hath not\nforsaken thee; neither hath he been\ndispleased...\n\nFEISAL\n...and surely the future will be better\nfor thee than the past...\n\nLAWRENCE\n...And in the end shall your Lord be\nbounteous to thee and thou be satisfied.\n\nFEISAL\nSo...? Yes, Colonel?\n\nBRIGHTON\nI want a decision, sir.\n\nFEISAL\nYou want me to fall back on Yenbo.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, you're not doing much good here,\nsir. I'm sorry to rub it in, sir, but we\ncan't supply you here.\n\nFEISAL\nYou could supply us through Aqaba.\n\nBRIGHTON\nAqaba! Well, if you can get hold of\nAqaba, sir, of course we can supply you,\nbut you can't.\n\nFEISAL\nYou could.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou mean the Navy? The Turks have twelve-\ninch guns at Aqaba, sir; can you imagine\nwhat that means?\n\nFEISAL\nYes, I can imagine.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, put that out of your mind, sir. The\nNavy's got other things to do.\n\nFEISAL\nOh, yes. Protecting the Suez Canal.\n\nBRIGHTON\nThe one essential sector of this front is\nand must be the Canal. You can see that,\nsir, surely.\n\nFEISAL\nI see that the Canal is an essential\nBritish interest; it is of little\nconsequence to us.\n\nBRIGHTON\nI must ask you not to speak like that,\nsir. British and Arab interests are one\nand the same.\n\nFEISAL\nPossibly.\n\nALI\nHa! Ha!\n\nBRIGHTON\nUpon my word, sir, you're ungrateful.\nFall back on Yenbo and we will give you\nequipment; give you arms, advice,\ntraining, everything!\n\nFEISAL\nGuns?\n\nBRIGHTON\nA modern rifle for every man.\n\nFEISAL\nNo, guns! Artillery! Guns like the\nTurkish guns at Medina.\n\nALI\nYes. Give us guns and keep the training.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYour men need training far more then\nguns, sir.\n\nALI\nThe English will teach the Bedu to fight?\n\nBRIGHTON\nWe will teach them, Sherif Ali, to fight\na modern, mechanised army.\n\nFEISAL\nYes, Lieutenant? What do you think about\nYenbo?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI think it is far from Damascus.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWe'll have you in Damascus and never\nfear.\n\nFEISAL\nHave you been in Damascus, Mr Lawrence?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, my lord.\n\nFEISAL\nIt is beautiful, is it not?\n\nLAWRENCE\nVery.\n\nBRIGHTON\nThat'll do, Lawrence. Dreaming won't get\nyou to Damascus, sir, but discipline\nwill. Look, sir, Great Britain is a small\ncountry; it's much smaller than yours; a\nsmall population compared with some; it's\nsmall but it's great, and why?\n\nALI\nBecause it has guns!\n\nBRIGHTON\nBecause it has discipline!\n\nFEISAL\nBecause it has a navy; because of this,\nthe English go where they please and\nstrike where they please and this makes\nthem great.\n\nLAWRENCE\nRight.\n\nBRIGHTON\nMr Lawrence, that will do! Lieutenant\nLawrence, sir, is not your military\nadviser.\n\nFEISAL\nBut I would like to hear his opinion.\n\nBRIGHTON\nDamn it, Lawrence! Who do you take your\norders from?\n\nSILIAM\nFrom Lord Feisal in Feisal's tent.\n\nALI\nOld fool! Why turn from him to him; they\nare master and man!\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy lord, I think... I think your book is\nright. The desert is an ocean in which no\noar is dipped and on this ocean the Bedu\ngo where they please and strike where\nthey please. This is the way the Bedu\nhave always fought. You're famed\nthroughout the world for fighting in this\nway and this is the way you should fight\nnow!\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, I don't know.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm sorry, sir, but you're wrong. Fall\nback on Yenbo, sir, and the Arab Rising\nbecome's one poor unit in the British\nArmy.\n\nFEISAL\nWhat is this to you?\n\nBRIGHTON\nLawrence, do you know you're a traitor?\n\nFEISAL\nNo, no, Colonel, eh... he is a young man\nand young men are passionate, but they\nmust say their say, but wiser people must\ndecide, I know you are right.\n\nBRIGHTON\nVery well, sir, once we move; the sooner\nthe better, you'll lose another fifty men\ntonight.\n\nFEISAL\nYou tread heavily, but you speak the\ntruth. I will give you my answer\ntomorrow, now it is late... Colonel\nBrighton means to put my men under\nEuropean officers, does he not?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIn effect, my lord, yes.\n\nFEISAL\nAnd I must do it because the Turks have\nEuropean guns, but I fear to do it; upon\nmy soul, I do. The English have a great\nhunger for desolate places. I fear they\nhunger for Arabia\n\nFEISAL\nThen you must deny it to them.\n\nFEISAL\nYou are an Englishman. Are you not loyal\nto England?\n\nLAWRENCE\nTo England and to other things.\n\nFEISAL\nTo England and Arabia, both? And is that\npossible? I think you are another of\nthese desert-loving English. Doughty. Stanhope. Gordon of\nKhartoum. No Arab loves the desert. We\nlove water and green trees. There's\nnothing in the desert. No man needs\nnothing. Or is it that you think we are\nsomething you can play with? Because we\nare little people; a silly people;\ngreedy, and barbarous, and cruel. Do you\nknow, Lieutenant, in the Arab city of\nC\u00a2rdoba were two miles of public lighting\nin the streets when London was a village?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, you were great.\n\nFEISAL\nNine centuries ago.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTime to be great again, my lord.\n\nFEISAL\nWhich is why my father made this war upon\nthe Turks. My father, Mr Lawrence, not\nthe English. But my father is old and\nI...I long for the vanished gardens of\nCordoba. However, before the gardens must\ncome the fighting. To be great again, it\nseems that we need the English, or...\n\nLAWRENCE\n...Or?\n\nFEISAL\nWhat no man can provide, Mr Lawrence. We\nneed a miracle.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nAqaba! Aqaba...from the land!\n\nALI\nYou are mad! To come to Aqaba by land we\nshould have to cross the Nefud Desert.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThat's right.\n\nALI\nThe Nefud cannot be crossed.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll cross it if you will.\n\nALI\nYou! It takes more than a compass,\nEnglishman. The Nefud is the worst place\nGod created.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI can't answer for the place, only for\nmyself. Fifty men?\n\nALI\nFifty! Against Aqaba?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIf fifty men came out of the Nefud, they\nwould be fifty men other men might join.\nThe Howitat are there, I hear.\n\nALI\nThe Howitat are brigands; they will sell\nthemselves to anyone.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood fighters, though.\n\nALI\nGood? Yes. There are guns at Aqaba.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey face the sea, Sherif Ali, and cannot\nbe turned round. From the landward side\nthere are no guns at Aqaba.\n\nALI\nWith good reason. It cannot be approached\nfrom the landward side!\n\nLAWRENCE\nCertainly the Turks don't dream of it.\nAqaba is over there. It's only a matter\nof going.\n\nALI\nYou are mad!\n\n\nFEISAL\nAnd where are you going, lieutenant, with\nfifty of my men?\n\nLAWRENCE\nTo work your miracle.\n\nFEISAL\nBlasphemy is a bad beginning for such a\njourney.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWho told you?\n\nFEISAL\nAli did. Why not you?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou are falling back on Yenbo, sir?\n\nALI\nYes. Yes, I must. But I will spare these\nto you. Did Ali break confidence to tell\nme?\n\nLAWRENCE\nSherif Ali owes you his allegiance, my\nlord.\n\nFEISAL\nYet, you did not tell Colonel Brighton.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. But since you do know, we can claim\nto ride in the name of Feisal of Mecca.\n\nFEISAL\nYes, Lieutenant Lawrence, you may claim\nit, but in whose name do you ride?\n\n\nGASIM\nSherif! I caught them. They had tracked\nus. They were here. I caught them.\n\nALI\nWhy are you here? Boy!\n\nDOUD\nTo serve lord Aurens, Sherif.\n\nGASIM\nThis is true, Aurens. They do wish it.\n\nALI\nYou have been tracking us. You were told\nto stay.\n\nDOUD\nNo, Sherif. Our camel strayed; we\nfollowed her.\n\nFERRAJ\nShe led us here to be lord Aurens'\nservants. It is the Will of Allah.\n\nALI\nBlasphemy!\n\nLAWRENCE\nDon't do that!\n\nGASIM\nNo, no! Aurens. These are not servants.\nThese are outcasts. Parentless!\n\nALI\nBe warned! They are not suitable.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey sound very suitable. You can ride\nwith the baggage.\n\nALI\nThese are not servants. These are\nworshippers!\n\nFERRAJ\nAurens?\n\nLAWRENCE\nHm?\n\nFERRAJ\nOne shilling...every week.\n\nGASIM\nThat is fair.\n\nFERRAJ\nEach.\n\nGASIM\nNO! That is too much!\n\nLAWRENCE\nAlright.\n\nGASIM\nThey will be lucky for you. Allah favours\nthe compassionate.\n\n\nALI\nThere is the railway...and that is the\ndesert. From here until the other side;\nno water but what we carry: for the\ncamels; no water at all. If the camels\ndie, we die. And in twenty days they will\nstart to die.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThere's no time to waste, then, is there?\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nI was thinking.\n\nALI\nYou were drifting.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. It will not happen again.\n\nALI\nBe warned! You were drifting.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt will not happen again!\n\n\nALI\nThat water is wasted. From now on we must\ntravel by night and rest while it is too\nhot to travel. A few hours each day.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy don't we start now?\n\nALI\nNo. We will rest now. Three hours.\n\nLAWRENCE\nFine. I'll wake you.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nDo we rest here?\n\nALI\nThere is no rest, now, short of water,\nAurens. On the other side of that.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAnd how much of that is there?\n\nALI\nI'm not sure, but however much it must be\ncrossed before tomorrow's sun gets up.\nThis is the Sun's Anvil.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nHave we done it?\n\nSILIAM\nNo! But we're off the Anvil.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThank God for that, anyway!\n\nSILIAM\nYes. Thank Him! Aurens, I do not think\nyou know how you have tempted him.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI know. We've done it.\n\nALI\nGod willing.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhen do we reach the wells?\n\nALI\nGod willing, midday.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen we've done it.\n\nSILIAM\nThank Him, Aurens. Thank Him.\n\nDOUD\nAurens!\n\nALI\nGasim's!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhat's happened to him?\n\nALI\nGod knows!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy don't you stop?\n\nALI\nFor what? He will be dead by midday!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe must go back.\n\nALI\nWhat for? To die with Gasim? In one hour\ncomes the sun. In God's name, understand!\nWe cannot go back!\n\nLAWRENCE\nI can! Take the boy!\n\nALI\nIf you go back, you kill yourself, is\nall! Gasim you have killed already.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGet out of my way!\n\nALI\nGasim's time is come, Aurens. It is\nwritten.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNothing is written!\n\nALI\nGo back, then! What did you bring us here\nfor with your blasphemous conceit! Hey?\nEnglish blasphemer! Aqaba? Was it Aqaba?\nYou will not be at Aqaba, English! Go\nback, blasphemer, but you will not be at\nAqaba!\n\nLAWRENCE\nI shall be at Aqaba; that is written...in\nhere.\n\nALI\nEnglish!!! English!!!\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nNothing is written.\n\nGASIM\nAurens?\n\nGASIM\nAurens?\n\nALI\nEl Aurens?\n\nLAWRENCE\nFerraj. Wash!\n\n\nALI\nFerraj. El Aurens, truly for some men\nnothing is written unless they write it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNot 'El' Aurens; just Aurens.\n\nALI\nEl Aurens is better\n\nLAWRENCE\nTrue.\n\nALI\nYour father, too, just Mr Lawrence.\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy father is Sir Thomas Chapman.\n\nALI\nIs that a lord?\n\nLAWRENCE\nA kind of lord.\n\nALI\nAnd when he dies, you too will be a lord.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo.\n\nALI\nAh, you have an elder brother.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo.\n\nALI\nBut, then? I do not understand this. Your\nfather's name is Chapman...\n\nLAWRENCE\nAli, he didn't marry my mother.\n\nALI\nI see.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm sorry.\n\nALI\nIt seems to me that you are free to\nchoose your own name, then.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. I suppose I am.\n\nALI\nEl Aurens is best.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAlright. I'll settle for 'El Aurens'.\n\n\nALI\nThey are the robes of a Sherif of the\nBeni Wadji.\n\nLAWRENCE\nVery fine. A great honour.\n\nONLOOKER\nThe honour is to us. Salaam, Sherif.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIs it permitted?\n\nALI\nSurely.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSalaam.\n\nCROWD\nSalaam.\n\nSILIAM\nHe for whom nothing is written may write\nhimself a                 , salaam.\n\nALI\nThey are good for riding. Try!\n\n\nAUDAR\nWhat are you doing, Englishman?\n\nLAWRENCE\nAs you see. Are you alone?\n\nAUDAR\nAlmost. Are you with that party of dogs\nwho are drinking at my well?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYours?\n\nAUDAR\nI am Audar Abu Tayi.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI've heard of another man of that name.\n\nAUDAR\nOther? What other?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThe Audar I'd heard of wouldn't need\nsomeone's help to look after his wells.\n\nAUDAR\nAh. He must be a great hero.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHe is. He wouldn't refuse water to men\ncoming out of the great Nefud Desert.\n\nAUDAR\nNow, would he not? Hm. No, that must be\nsome other man. Here is my help.  Son,\nwhat fashion is this?\n\nSON\nHarif, father.\n\nAUDAR\nWhat manner of Harif?\n\nSON\nA Beni Wadji Sherif.\n\nAUDAR\nAnd is he Harif?\n\nSON\nNo, father. English!\n\nAUDAR\nSon! They are stealing our water; tell\nthem we're coming. Tell them!... Empty\nthat!\n\nALI\nDo not!!\n\nAUDAR\nIt is Audar of the Howitat who speaks.\n\nALI\nIt is Ali of the Harif who answers.\n\nAUDAR\nHarif? Ali, does your father still steal?\n\nALI\nNo. Does Audar take me for one of his own\nbastards?\n\nAUDAR\nNo, there is no resemblance. Alas, you\nresemble your father.\n\nALI\nAudar flatters me.\n\nAUDAR\nYou're easily flattered. I knew your\nfather well.\n\nALI\nDid you know your own?\n\nLAWRENCE\nAuda! We are fifty, you are two. How if\nwe shot you down?\n\nAUDAR\nWhy, then you have a blood feud with the\nHowitat. Do you desire it?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNot the generals in Cairo, nor the Sultan\nhimself desire that. Call off your men.\n\nAUDAR\nNo, no, boy. This honours the unworthy.\nI've only just begun to teach him.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAnd what are you teaching him today?\nHowitat hospitality?\n\nAUDAR\nBe not clever with me, English! Who is\nhe?\n\nLAWRENCE\nA friend of Prince Feisal's.\n\nAUDAR\nOh. So, you desire my hospitality.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nAUDAR\nIs he your tongue?\n\nALI\nWe do desire it.\n\nAUDAR\nUgh. Then, it is given, if you will take\nit. I am at my summer camp; a poor place.\nWell, to me it seems a poor place. Some\nmen find it marvellous. Tomorrow, maybe,\nI will allow the Turks to buy you,\nfriends of Feisal. But, dine with me.\nDine with Auda, English; dine with the\nHowitat, Harif. It is my pleasure that\nyou dine with me in Wadi Ram.\n\nIn Auda's tent\n\nAUDAR\nThis thing you work against Aqaba, what\nprofit do you hope from it?\n\nALI\nWe work it for Feisal of Mecca. The Harif\ndo not work for profit.\n\nAUDAR\nWell, if a man was meant to be a servant,\nAli, he could find worse masters than\nFeisal, but I...I cannot serve.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou permit the Turks to stay in Aqaba.\n\nAUDAR\nYes, it is my pleasure.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe do not work this thing for Feisal.\n\nAUDAR\nNo? For the English, then?\n\nLAWRENCE\nFor the Arabs.\n\nAUDAR\nThe Arabs. The Howitat, Ajili, Rala, Beni\nSaha; these I know, I have even heard of\nthe Harif, but the Arabs! What tribe is\nthat?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey're a tribe of slaves; they serve the\nTurks.\n\nAUDAR\nWell, they are nothing to me. My tribe is\nthe Howitat...\n\nALI\nWho work only for profit.\n\nAUDAR\nWho work at Auda's pleasure.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAnd Auda's pleasure is to serve the\nTurks.\n\nAUDAR\nServe. I serve?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt is the servant who takes money.\n\nAUDAR\nI am Audar Abu Tayi! Does Audar serve?\n\nCROWD\nNo!\n\nAUDAR\nDoes Audar Abu Tayi serve?\n\nCROWD\nNo!! Ha! Ha! Ha!\n\nAUDAR\nI carry twenty-three great wounds, all\ngot in battle. Seventy-five men have I\nkilled with my own hands in battle. I\nscatter, I burn my enemies tents. I take\naway their flocks and herds. The Turks\npay me a golden treasure. Yet, I am poor,\nbecause I  am a river to my people! Is\nthat service?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo.\n\nSILIAM\nAnd yet now it seems Audar has grown old\nand lost his taste for fighting.\n\nAUDAR\nIt is well you say it in my tent, thou\nold tulip!\n\nALI\nYet, this is a tulip that the Turks could\nnot buy.\n\nAUDAR\nWhy should they wish to? Now! I will tell\nyou what they pay me, and you will tell\nme if this is a servant's wages. They pay\nme, month by month, one hundred golden\nguineas.\n\nLAWRENCE\nOne hundred and fifty, Auda.\n\nAUDAR\nWho told you that?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI have long ears.\n\nAUDAR\nAnd a long tongue between them.\n\nLAWRENCE\nA hundred; a hundred and fifty; what\nmatters? It's a trifle...a trifle which\nthey take from a great box they have...\n\nALI\nIn Aqaba.\n\nAUDAR\nIn Aqaba!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhere else?\n\nAUDAR\nYou trouble me like women.\n\nLAWRENCE\nFriends, we have been foolish. Audar will\nnot come to Aqaba.\n\nAUDAR\nNo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nFor money.\n\nAUDAR\nNo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nFor Feisal?\n\nAUDAR\nNo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNor to drive away the Turks. He will come\nbecause it is his pleasure.\n\nAUDAR\nThy mother mated with a scorpion.\n\n\nAUDAR\nMake God your agent! Aqaba!\n\nCROWD\nAqaba!\n\nAUDAR\nGod be with you.\n\n\nALI\nYes, Aqaba. Tomorrow, we will go and get\nit.\n\nLAWRENCE\nDo you think we shall?\n\nALI\nYes. If you're right about the guns.\n\n\nAUDAR\nHe killed: he dies.\n\nALI\nThis is the end of Aqaba.\n\nSILIAM\nOne of our men murdered one of Auda's\nmen.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy?\n\nSILIAM\nTheft? Blood-feud? It makes no matter\nwhy.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAli!\n\nALI\nIt is an ancient wound.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI didn't come here to watch a tribal\nbloodbath.\n\nAUDAR\nIt is the law, Aurens.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThe Law says the man must die.\n\nAUDAR\nHm!\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt he dies, would that content the\nHowitat?\n\nAUDAR\nYes.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSherif Ali. If none of lord Auda's men\nharms any of yours, will that content the\nHarif?\n\nALI\nYes.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen, I will execute the Law. I have no\ntribe and no one is offended. Gasim! Did\nyou do it?\n\nAUDAR\nWell. Aurens. What ails the Englishman?\n\nALI\nThat man he killed was the man he brought\nout of the Nefud.\n\nAUDAR\nAh, it was written, then. Better to have\nleft him.\n\nALI\nIt was execution, Aurens: no shame in\nthat. Besides, it was necessary. You gave\nlife and you took it. The writing is\nstill yours.\n\nOn the beach at Aqaba\n\nALI\nThe miracle is accomplished. Garlands for\nthe conqueror. Tribute for the prince;\nflowers for the man.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm none of those things, Ali.\n\nALI\nWhat, then?\n\nLAWRENCE\nDon't know. Thanks. My God I love this\ncountry. What!\n\nAUDAR\nNo gold in Aqaba!\n\nMAN\nI've found it!\n\nLAWRENCE\nThat's a pity. Ali. You get a message\ndown the coast to Yenbo. Tell Feisal to\nfind boats...any boats, and bring the\nArab army here to Aqaba quickly.\n\nALI\nAnd you?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm going to tell the generals in Cairo.\nYes, cross Sinai. Come on!\n\nALI\nSinai!?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes!\n\nALI\nWith these?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey'll be alright with me. Look, Ali. If\nany of your Bedouin arrived in Cairo and\nsaid, 'We've taken Aqaba. the generals\nwould laugh.\n\nALI\nI see. In Cairo you will put off these\nfunny clothes. You will wear trousers and\ntell stories of our quaintness and\nbarbarity, and then, they will believe\nyou.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou're an ignorant man.\n\nAUDAR\nPaper! Paper! There is no gold in Aqaba.\nNo gold! No great box!\n\nLAWRENCE\nDid Audar come to Aqaba for gold?\n\nAUDAR\nFor my pleasure as you said, but gold is\nhonourable, and Aurens promised gold.\nAurens lied.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSee, Auda. The Crown of England promises\nto pay five thousand golden guineas\nto Audar Abu Tayi, signed in His\nMajesty's absence, by...me. In ten days,\nI'll be back with the gold. With gold,\nwith guns, ...with everything.\n\nAUDAR\nTen days. You'll cross Sinai?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy not? Moses did.\n\nAUDAR\nAnd you will take the children?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMoses did!\n\nAUDAR\nMoses was a prophet and beloved of God.\nHe said there was gold here: he lied. He\nis not perfect.\n\n\nFERRAJ\nLord, can we not rest?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI told you, 'No rest till they know I\nhold Aqaba'. Have you two slept in beds?\nFerraj? Doud? With sheets. Tomorrow the\nfinest sheets in the finest room in the\nfinest hotel in Cairo, I promise.\n\nMAJID\nThen it shall be so, lord.\n\nLAWRENCE\nLook! a pillar of fire.\n\nDOUD\nNo, lord. Dust.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nMy compass! No matter. If we ride west,\nwe must strike the Canal...\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nCome on!\n\n\nDOUD\nAurens!! Aurens!!\n\nFERRAJ\nAurens!\n\nLAWRENCE\nFerraj! Ferraj! Don't!

He likes your\nlemonade.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou mean the Turks have gone?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, they're still there, but they've no\nboots. Prisoners, sir. We took them\nprisoners; the entire garrison. No,\nthat's not true. We killed some; too many\nreally. I'll manage it better next time.\nThere's been a lot of killing, one way or\nanother. Cross my heart and hope to die,\nit's all perfectly true.\n\nBRIGHTON\nIt isn't possible.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, it is. I did it.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou'd better talk to Allenby.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGeneral Allenby?\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes, He's in command now Murray's gone.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWell, that's a step in the right\ndirection. First I want a room, with a\nbed, with sheets.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes, yes, of course.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's for him.\n\nBRIGHTON\nRight! You want a bed yourself, don't\nyou?\n\nLAWRENCE\nSee Allenby first, though. Will he see\nme?\n\nBRIGHTON\nI think so.\n\nLAWRENCE\nDo that then. I'd better shave\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes, you had. You'd better get into some\ntrousers too.\n\n\nALLENBY\nUndisciplined...unpunctual...untidy...sev\neral languages...knowledge of\nmusic...literature...knowledge\nof...knowledge of...you're an interesting\nman, there's no doubt about it. Who told\nyou to take Aqaba?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNobody.\n\nALLENBY\nSir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSir.\n\nALLENBY\nThen, why did you?\n\nLAWRENCE\nAqaba's important.\n\nALLENBY\nWhy is it important?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's the Turkish route to the Canal.\n\nALLENBY\nNot any more. They're coming through\nBethsheda.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI know, but we've gone forward to Gaza.\n\nALLENBY\nSo?\n\nLAWRENCE\nSo that left Aqaba behind your right.\n\nALLENBY\nTrue.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAnd it will be further behind your right\nwhen you go for Jerusalem.\n\nALLENBY\nAm I going for Jerusalem?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALLENBY\nVery well. Aqaba behind my right.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt threatened El Herish and Gaza.\n\nALLENBY\nAnything else?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. Aqaba's linked with Medina.\n\nALLENBY\nDo you think we should shift them out of\nMedina now?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. I think you should leave them there.\n\nALLENBY\nYou acted without orders, you know?\n\nLAWRENCE\nShouldn't officers use their initiative\nat all times?\n\nALLENBY\nNot really. It's awfully dangerous,\nLawrence.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes. I know.\n\nALLENBY\nAlready?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALLENBY\nI'm promoting you major.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't think that's a very good idea.\n\nALLENBY\nI didn't ask you; I want you to go\nback...and carry on the good work.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, thank you, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nWhy not?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWell, I...eh, let me see...I killed two\npeople. I mean two Arabs; one was a boy.\nthat was... yesterday! I led him into\nquicksand. The other was a man; that was\nbefore Aqaba, anyway. I had to execute\nhim with my pistol. There was something\nabout it I didn't like.\n\nALLENBY\nWell, naturally...\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, something else...\n\nALLENBY\nI see, well, that's all right. We'll give\nyou a warning.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. Something else.\n\nALLENBY\nWhat then?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI enjoyed it.\n\nALLENBY\nRubbish! Rubbish! You know that you're\ntired. What do you mean by coming here\ndressed like that? Amateur theatricals?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, yes. Entirely.\n\nALLENBY\nLet me see that hat-thing, or whatever it\nis. Fascinating gear they wear. How do\nyou think I would look in this hat,\nHarry?\n\nBRIGHTON\nDamn ridiculous, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nHere, you keep it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhat I'm trying to say is I don't think\nI'm fit for it.\n\nALLENBY\nReally!? What do you think, Dryden?\n\nDRYDEN\nBefore he did it, sir, I'd have said it\ncouldn't be done.\n\nALLENBY\nBrighton?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI know what he thinks.\n\nBRIGHTON\nI think you should recommend a\ndecoration, sir. I don't think it matters\nwhat his motives were; 'twas a brilliant\nbit of soldiering.\n\nALLENBY\nMr Perkins!\n\nPERKINS\nSah!\n\nALLENBY\nLet's have a drink, gentlemen.\n\nPERKINS\nSah!\n\nALLENBY\nYou've heard about this, Mr Perkins.\n\nPERKINS\nYes, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nWhat do you think about it?\n\nPERKINS\nBloody marvellous, sir. Well done, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nThank you, Mr Perkins.\n\nPERKINS\nSah!\n\nALLENBY\nCome on, then.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou're a clever man, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nNo, but I know a good thing when I see\none. That's fair, surely.  Look here,\nlad. If I'm going to break through to\nJerusalem, I must concentrate not\ndissipate...\n\nLAWRENCE\nGuns.\n\nALLENBY\nDo you know of better?...\n\nALLENBY\nI fight like Clausewitz, you fight like Saxe.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe shall do very well, indeed, sir.\n\n\nALLENBY\nEasy, gentlemen, please. Will you give us\nsomething to drink? Waiter    Of course,\nsir.\n\nALLENBY\nI'm here at the invitation of Major\nLawrence. Tracy. Shall we go outside?\nSo, you'll hold down the Turkish desert\narmy.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALLENBY\nWith a thousand Arabs?\n\nLAWRENCE\nA thousand Arabs means a thousand knives,\ndelivered anywhere, day or night...means\na thousand camels; that means a thousand\npacks of high explosive and a thousand\ncrack rifles. We can cross Arabia while\nJohnny Turk is still turning round. I'll\nsmash his railways, and while he's\nmending them I'll smash them somewhere\nelse. In thirteen weeks I can have Arabia\nin chaos.\n\nALLENBY\nYou are going back then?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, of course I'm going back.\n\nALLENBY\nWell, if we can see it, so can the Turk.\nIf he finds he's using four divisions to\nfend off a handful of bandits, he'll\nwithdraw.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHe daren't withdraw. Arabia's part of his\nempire: if he gets out now, he knows\nhe'll never get back again.\n\nBRIGHTON\nI wonder who will.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo one will. Arabia's for the Arabs now.\nThat's what I've told them, anyway.\nThat's what they think: that's why\nthey're fighting.\n\nALLENBY\nOh, surely.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey've only one suspicion, if we'll let\nthem drive the Turks out and then move in\nourselves. I've told them that that's\nfalse: that we've no ambitions in Arabia,\nhave we?\n\nALLENBY\nI'm not a politician, thank God. have we\nany ambition in Arabia, Dryden?\n\nDRYDEN\nDifficult question, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI want to know, sir, if I can tell them\nin your name that we have no ambitions in\nArabia.\n\nALLENBY\nCertainly.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTwo thousand small arms is not enough: I\nneed five.\n\nALLENBY\nRight.\n\nLAWRENCE\nMoney. It'll have to be sovereigns: they\ndon't like paper.\n\nALLENBY\nRight.\n\nLAWRENCE\nInstructors for the Lewis guns.\n\nALLENBY\nRight.\n\nLAWRENCE\nMore money.\n\nALLENBY\nHow much more?\n\nLAWRENCE\nTwenty-five thousand now: a lot more\nlater.\n\nALLENBY\nDryden?\n\nDRYDEN\nIt can be done, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nA couple of armoured cars.\n\nALLENBY\nRight.\n\nLAWRENCE\nField artillery.\n\nALLENBY\nRight. I'm going to give you every\nblessed thing I can, Major Lawrence,\nbecause I know you'll use it.\nCongratulations and thank you. Thank you\nfor your hospitality, gentlemen.\n\nCROWD\nCongratulations.\n\nDRYDEN\nAre you really going to give them\nartillery, sir?\n\nBRIGHTON\nI was wondering that, sir. It might be\ndeuced difficult to get it back again.\n\nDRYDEN\nGive them artillery and you've made them\nindependent.\n\nALLENBY\nThen, I can't give them artillery, can I?\n\nDRYDEN\nFor you to say, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nNo, it's not. I've got orders to obey,\nthank God. Not like that poor devil. He's\nriding the whirlwind.\n\nDRYDEN\nLet's hope we're not.\n\n\nBENTLEY\nExcuse me, friend. Who do these bags\nbelong to?\n\nSILIAM\nTo Prince Feisal.\n\nBENTLEY\nYou're not Prince Feisal, by any chance.\n\nSILIAM\nNo.\n\nBENTLEY\nYou know him, though.\n\nSILIAM\nHe is my master. I am his servant.\n\nBENTLEY\nEm. Can you read?  The Chicago Courier is\nmy own particular paper, but my work is\nsyndicated throughout America.\n\nFEISAL\nI understood so from your letter, Mr\nBentley.   Now?\n\nBENTLEY\nWhere can I find Major Lawrence?\n\nFEISAL\nIs that what you've come for?\n\nBENTLEY\nNot all together, sir, no.\n\nFEISAL\nWell, Mr Bentley, you will find Major\nLawrence with my army.\n\nBENTLEY\nWell, that's what I meant, sir. Where can\nI find your army?\n\nFEISAL\nI don't know. Last week they were near El\nHira.\n\nBENTLEY\nGira!\n\nFEISAL\nOh, yes. I fear you have a long journey.\nCan you ride a camel?\n\nBENTLEY\nI've never tried.\n\nFEISAL\nTake a mule. Avoid Malal. The Turks are\nthere.\n\nBENTLEY\nIn Malal, now? They move fast.\n\nFEISAL\nThey do, but not so fast as we do, you\nwill find.\n\nFEISAL\nMyself? I am going to Cairo, as you know.\n\nBENTLEY\nYes.\n\nFEISAL\nThere is work for me there of a different\nkind.\n\nBENTLEY\nYes. I understand you've been given no\nartillery.\n\nFEISAL\nThat is so.\n\nBENTLEY\nYou're handicapped.\n\nFEISAL\nIt restricts us to small things.\n\nBENTLEY\nIt's intended to.\n\nFEISAL\nDo you know General Allenby?\n\nBENTLEY\nWatch out for Allenby. He's a 'slim\ncustomer'.\n\nFEISAL\nExcuse me?\n\nBENTLEY\nA clever man.\n\nFEISAL\n'Slim customer'. Very good. I will\ncertainly watch out for him. You're being\nvery sympathetic, Mr Bentley.\n\nBENTLEY\nYour Highness, we Americans were once a\ncolonial people and we naturally feel\nsympathetic to any people, anywhere, who\nare struggling for their freedom.\n\nFEISAL\nVery gratifying.\n\nBENTLEY\nAlso, my interests are the same as yours.\nYou want your story told: I badly want a\nstory to tell.\n\nFEISAL\nAh, now you are 'talking turkey', are you\nnot?\n\nBENTLEY\nHa! Ha!\n\nFEISAL\nWell, Mr Bentley, I will give you a guide\nand a letter, and before I leave\nhere...Ah, which must be presently, I\nwill have some facts and figures put on\npaper for you. You know, of course, that\nwe are destroying the Turkish railways?\n\nBENTLEY\nI do, sir. Major Lawrence is in charge of\nall this, is he?\n\nFEISAL\nMy army is made up of tribes. The tribes\nare led by the tribal leaders.\n\nBENTLEY\nWell, your people do think very highly of\nMajor Lawrence, though.\n\nFEISAL\nOh, yes. And rightly. In this country, Mr\nBentley, the man who gives victory in\nbattle is prized beyond every other man.\nOne figure I can give you from my head\nbecause it never leaves my head. Since\nstarting this campaign four months ago,\nwe have lost thirty-seven wounded, one\nhundred and fifty-six dead. You remark\nthe disproportion between our dead and\nwounded.\n\nBENTLEY\nYeah. Four times as many.\n\nFEISAL\nThat's because those too badly wounded to\nbring away we ourselves kill. We leave no\nwounded for the Turks.\n\nBENTLEY\nYou mean...\n\nFEISAL\nI mean we leave no wounded for the Turks.\nIn their eyes we are not soldiers, but\nrebels, and rebels wounded or whole are\nnot protected by the Geneva Code and are\ntreated harshly.\n\nBENTLEY\nHow harshly?\n\nFEISAL\nMore harshly than I hope you can imagine.\n\nBENTLEY\nI see.\n\nFEISAL\nOur own prisoners, Mr Bentley, are taken\ncare of until the British can relieve us\nof them according to the Code. I should\nlike you to notice that.\n\nBENTLEY\nYes, sir. Is that the influence of Major\nLawrence?\n\nFEISAL\nWhy should you suppose so?\n\nBENTLEY\nWell, it's just I heard in Cairo that\nMajor Lawrence has a horror of bloodshed.\n\nFEISAL\nThat is exactly so. with Major Lawrence,\nmercy is a passion: with me it is merely\ngood manners. You may judge which motive\nis the more reliable. And now, perhaps...\n\nBENTLEY\nOh, sure. Sure. Thank you, sir. Do you\nthink you'd be able to manage the letter?\n\nFEISAL\nI'll do everything I have said, Mr\nBentley, if you will tell me truly the\nnature of your interest in my people and\nMajor Lawrence.\n\nBENTLEY\nIt's very simple, sir. I'm looking for a\nhero.\n\nFEISAL\nIndeed? You do not seem a romantic man.\n\nBENTLEY\nOh, no. But certain influential men back\nhome believe that the time has come for\nAmerica to lend her weight to the\npatriotic struggle against Germany...and\nTurkey. Now, I've been sent to find\nmaterial which will show our people that\nhis war is...\n\nFEISAL\nEnjoyable?\n\nBENTLEY\nHardly that, sir. But to show it in its\nmore adventurous aspects.\n\nFEISAL\nYou are looking for a figure who will\ndraw your country towards war.\n\nBENTLEY\nAlright. Yes.\n\nFEISAL\nAurens is your man.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nStop! Stop it! Stop it! Come on, men!\n\nAUDAR\nAurens!\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, good God!\n\nBENTLEY\nJimeny! Never seen a man killed with a\nsword before.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy don't you take a picture?\n\nBENTLEY\nWish I had.\n\nAUDAR\nHow is it with thee, Aurens? No! Am I in\nthis?\n\nLAWRENCE\nDid you take his picture?\n\nBENTLEY\nYeah.\n\nAUDAR\nYou are using up your nine lives very\nquickly.\n\nBENTLEY\nCharming company you keep.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAuda? he's a bit old fashioned. He thinks\nthese things will steal his virtue. He\nthinks you're a kind of thief.\n\nBENTLEY\nIs it alright if I take your picture?\n\nLAWRENCE\nAll right.\n\nBENTLEY\nOK. Just walk.\n\nCROWD\nAurens! Aurens!\n\nBENTLEY\nMajor Lawrence? Yes, sir, that's my baby.\n\n\nBRIGHTON\nThis looting has got to stop.\n\nALI\nIt is customary.\n\nBRIGHTON\nIt's theft, and theft makes thieves.\n\nALI\nI would not say that to Auda. It is their\npayment, Colonel.\n\nBRIGHTON\nPayment!\n\nALI\nTruly, are not British soldiers paid?\n\nBRIGHTON\nThey don't go home when they're paid.\n\nALI\nThey are not free to.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, there's another lot you've seen the\nlast of.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey'll come back.\n\nBRIGHTON\nHe says they'll come back. Will they?\n\nALI\nNot this year, Aurens.\n\nBRIGHTON\nLook, Lawrence. How many men do you think\nyou'll have left? Two hundred?\n\nLAWRENCE\nLess.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, then.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI said they'll come back.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou badly hurt?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNot hurt at all. Didn't you know? They\ncan only kill me with a golden bullet.\n\n\nALI\nIt is for children. I have set myself to\nlearn again.\n\nBENTLEY\nWhat are you learning from this?\n\nALI\nPolitics.\n\nBENTLEY\nYou gonna be a democracy in this country?\nYou gonna have a parliament?\n\nALI\nI will tell you that when I have a\ncountry.\n\nBENTLEY\nHa! Ha!...\n\nALI\nDid I answer well?\n\nBENTLEY\nYou answered without saying anything.\nThat's politics. You learn quickly.\n\nALI\nI have a good teacher.\n\nBENTLEY\nYeah. Yeah.\nHow's your hurt?\n\nLAWRENCE\nFine.\n\nBENTLEY\nBefore I return to the flesh-pots, which\nI shall be very glad to do, may I put two\nquestions to you? Straight?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'd be interested to hear you put a\nquestion straight, Mr Bentley.\n\nBENTLEY\nOne: What, in your opinion, do these\npeople hope to gain from this war?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey hope to gain their freedom. Freedom.\n\nBENTLEY\nThey hope to gain their freedom. There's\none born every minute.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey're going to get it, Mr Bentley. I'm\ngoing to give it to them. The second\nquestion?\n\nBENTLEY\nOh. Well, I was going to ask...eh; what\nis it, Major Lawrence, that attracts you\npersonally to the desert?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's clean.\n\nBENTLEY\nWell, now. That's a very illuminating\nanswer. May I take one farewell picture?\n\nAUDAR\nI gave Math Budad two lamps for it. One\nclock for two lamps.\n\nBRIGHTON\nA fair bargain.\n\nAUDAR\nI robbed him. I must find something\nhonourable.\n\nBRIGHTON\nHonourable?\n\nAUDAR\nYes, the year is running out, Brighton. I\nmust find something honourable.\n\n\nAUDAR\nNow, you may blow up my train.\n\nBRIGHTON\nAnd what will you do now?\n\nAUDAR\nOh, now I go home. They will carry my\ntoys. They will carry my toys, too, do\nyou see?\n\nBRIGHTON\nMajor Lawrence will campaign this winter,\nbut you've got what you wanted so you're\ngoing home. Is that it?\n\nAUDAR\nOf course! When Aurens has got what he\nwants, he will go home. When you have got\nwhat you want, you will go home.\n\nBRIGHTON\nOh, no, I shan't, Auda.\n\nAUDAR\nThen you are a fool.\n\nBRIGHTON\nMaybe. I am not a deserter.\n\nAUDAR\nGive thanks to God, Brighton, that when\nhe made you a fool, he gave you a fool's\nface.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYou are an impudent rascal!\n\nAUDAR\nI must go, Aurens, before I soil myself\nwith a fool's blood.\n\nBRIGHTON\nIt's like talking to a brick wall. So,\nwhat'll you do now? What can you do?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll go north. That's what Allenby wants,\nisn't it?\n\nBRIGHTON\nAllenby wanted the Arab army behind\nDar'a.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen that's where I'll take it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTell Allenby to hurry up; that we'll be\nin Dar'a before he's in Jerusalem, won't\nwe?\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nTrain! Ferraj.\n\nFERRAJ\nYa! Aurens.\nBedouin   Aii!\n\nLAWRENCE\nHide yourself, my friend.     Detonator.\nAlright, fetch another.\n\nFERRAJ\nPardon, Aurens, I put it in...\n\nLAWRENCE\nThere's plenty of time; fetch another!\nFerraj? Ferraj!\n\nALI\nWhat happened?\n\nLAWRENCE\nDetonator. A detonator.\n\nBEDOUIN\nHe cannot ride, Aurens. Look.\n\nALI\nIf they take him alive, you know what\nthey will do to him.\n\nFERRAJ\nDaud will be angry with you.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSalute him for me.\n\n\nALI\nWhat will you do now?\n\nLAWRENCE\nGo north.\n\nALI\nWith twenty?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhat would you recommend me to do, Ali?\nWhat would you recommend?\n\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, he hasn't one-tenth so many men,\nsir.\n\nALLENBY\nHe's lied, in fact.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes and no. He doesn't claim to have done\nanything he hasn't done.\n\nALLENBY\nThen there is an Arab north army?\n\nBRIGHTON\nNo, sir, he has lied about that.\n\nALLENBY\nAny idea why?\n\nBRIGHTON\nIt's his army, I suppose.\n\nALLENBY\nIt's Prince Feisal's army. Do you think\nhe's gone native, Harry?\n\nBRIGHTON\nNo. He would if he could, I think. Not my\nline of country this, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nOh, it doesn't matter; I'm just curious.\nWhat matters is I believed it. The Turks\nbelieve it. They're offering twenty\nthousand pounds for him.\n\nBRIGHTON\nGood Heavens!\n\nALLENBY\nNo. Shouldn't say he'd long to live,\nwould you?\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, whatever else, sir, he's a brave\nman.\n\nALLENBY\nOh, surely, surely. If he's still going\nnorth with fifty men, he doesn't lack\n'guts'. I wonder if they'd offer that\nmuch for me. What about next year? Will\nthey still come back?\n\nBRIGHTON\nI wouldn't be surprised. They think he's\na kind of prophet.\n\nALLENBY\nThey do or he does?\n\n\nALI\nNow, may I speak?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nALI\nAurens. One more failure, and you will\nfind yourself alone. I do not include\nmyself.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI do not include the others.\n\nALI\nSo, say they love you: the more reason to\nbe thrifty with them. give them something\nto do that can be done. But you? No, no,\nthey must move mountains for you: they\nmust walk on water.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThat's right. That's right! Who are you\nto know what can be done. If we'd done\nwhat you thought could be done, we'd be\nback in Yenbo now, and nowhere. Whatever\nI ask them to do, can be done, that's\nall. They know that if you don't. Do you\nthink I'm just anybody, Ali? Do you?\nMy friends. Who will walk on water with\nme? Who will come with me into Dar'a?\n\nBEDOUIN\nDar'a is garrisoned. Will you take twenty\nagainst two thousand?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll go by myself if I have to.\n\nBEDOUIN\nWhy?\n\nLAWRENCE\nBecause I told the English generals the\nArab revolt will be in Dar'a when they\nwould be in Jerusalem.\n\nBEDOUIN\nOr perhaps you are here for the English\ngenerals.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWho says this?\n\nALI\nRumour.\n\nBEDOUIN\nThat is not an argument.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo argument. This afternoon, I will take\nthe Arab revolt into Dar'a while the\nArabs argue.\n\nBEDOUIN\nAurens! Can you pass for an Arab in an\nArab town?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, if one of you would lend me some\ndirty clothes.\n\nDar'a\n\nALI\nThis is madness! What are you looking\nfor?\n\nLAWRENCE\nSome way to announce myself.\n\nALI\nBe patient with him, God.\n\nALI\nDo you not see how they look at you?\nCome!\n\nLAWRENCE\nPlease, Ali. I am invisible.\n\nTURK\nHalt!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWalk on.\n\nTURK\nHalt!\n\nLAWRENCE\nWalk on.\n\nTURK\nYou! And You!\n\nBEY\nYou.      You have blue eyes? I say you\nhave blue eyes.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, efendi.\n\nBEY\nAre you Sicasian?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, efendi.\n\nBEY\nHow old are you?\n\nLAWRENCE\nTwenty-seven, efendi. I think.\n\nBEY\nYou look older. You have had a lot of\nexperience. It's an interesting face. I'm\nsurrounded by cattle. He wouldn't know an\ninteresting face from a sow's belly. I\nhave been in Dar'a now for three and a\nhalf years. If they'd posted me to the\ndark side of the moon, I could not be\nmore isolated. You haven't the least idea\nof what I'm talking about, have you?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, efendi.\n\nBEY\nHave you? No. That would be too lucky.\nWhere did you get that?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, eh, it's old, efendi.\n\nBEY\nNo, no. This is recent. You are a\ndeserter.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, efendi.\n\nBEY\nYes, you're a deserter, but from which\narmy? Not that it matters at all. A man\ncannot be always in uniform. Your skin is\nvery fair.      Beat him.\n\n\nALI\nSleep. Sleep!       Eat. Eat! You have a\nbody like other men. Good. Then sleep.\n\n\nALI\nBetter?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMuch better. You were right.\n\nALI\nRest, rest. Can you not learn?\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, I've learned alright. I'm going, Ali.\n\nALI\nWhy?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy? Heavens!\n\nALI\nWhy?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI've come to the end of myself, I\nsuppose.\n\nALI\nAnd the end of the Arab revolt?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm not the Arab revolt, Ali. I'm not\neven Arab.\n\nALI\nA man can be whatever he wants, you said.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'm sorry. I thought it was, too.\n\nALI\nYou proved it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nLook, Ali. Look! That's me. What colour\nis it? That's me! And there's nothing I\ncan do about it.\n\nALI\nA man can do whatever he wants, you said.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHe can, but he can't want what he wants.\nThis is the stuff that decides what he\nwants. You may as well know, I would have\ntold them anything; I would have told\nthem who I am; I would have told them\nwhere you were; I tried to.\n\nALI\nSo would any man.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWell, any man is what I am and I'm going\nback to Allenby to ask him for a job that\nany man can do.\n\nALI\nAllenby's in Jerusalem.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI'll make easy stages.\n\nALI\nYou!\n\nLAWRENCE\nOh, yes. Easy stages. Look, Ali, I think\nI see a way of being just ordinarily\nhappy. Can I take this?\n\nALI\nIt is not clean.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, but it's warm.\n\nALI\nAnd these? Having led them here! Have you\nno care for them?\n\nALI\nYou'll lead them. They're yours. Trust\nyour own people and let me go back to\nmine.\n\n\nSOLDIER\nI say, don't forget those form fives.\n\nSOLDIER\nAll right!\n\nLAWRENCE\nHey? Mind if I join you?\n\nOFFICER\nOh. Honoured, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood to be back.\n\nOFFICER\nWe heard you were, sir. What's doing out\nthere?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhere? Oh, Arabia.\n\nOFFICER\nEh, yes, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNothing much. Wrong time of year. What's\ndoing here?\n\nOFFICER\nWe're settling in alright, sir.     We've\nbuilt a squash court.\n\nLAWRENCE\nJolly good. Well, I have to go up there.\nIt's borrowed. Someone pinched mine.\n\nOFFICER\nBloody wogs!\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, probably. Jolly good about the\nsquash court.\n\nOFFICER\nLays it on a bit thick, doesn't he?\n\nLAWRENCE\nMorning.\n\nMP\nOh, morning, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nGood to be back.\n\nMP\nI'll believe you, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, really, it is.       Hello.\n\nBRIGHTON\nMorning. You're to go right in.\n\nFEISAL\nAurens, or is it Major Lawrence?\n\nLAWRENCE\nSir.\n\nFEISAL\nAh. Ai. Well, General, I will leave you.\nMajor Lawrence, doubtless, has reports to\nmake about my people and their weakness,\nand the need to keep them weak in the\nBritish interest...and the French\ninterest too, of course. We must not\nforget the French now...\n\nALLENBY\nI've told you, sir, no such treaty\nexists.\n\nFEISAL\nYes, General, you have lied most bravely,\nbut not convincingly. I know this treaty\ndoes exist.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTreaty, sir?\n\nFEISAL\nHe does it better than you, General, but\nthen, of course, he is almost an Arab.\n\nDRYDEN\nYou really don't know?\n\nALLENBY\nThen what the devil's this?\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's my request for release from Arabia,\nsir.\n\nALLENBY\nFor what reason? Are you sure you haven't\nheard of the Sykes-Picot Treaty?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo. I can guess\n\nALLENBY\nDon't guess! Tell him!\n\nDRYDEN\nWell, now. Mr Sykes is and English civil\nservant. Monsieur Picot is a French civil\nservant. Mr Sykes and Monsieur Picot met\nand they agreed that after the war,\nFrance and England would share the\nTurkish Empire, including Arabia. They\nsigned an agreement, not a treaty, sir.\nAn agreement to that effect.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThere may be honour among thieves, but\nthere's none in politicians.\n\nDRYDEN\nAnd let's no have displays of\nindignation. You may not have known, but\nyou certainly had suspicions. If we've\ntold lies, you've told half-lies and a\nman who tells lies, like me, merely hides\nthe truth, but a man who tells half-lies\nhas forgotten where he put it.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThe truth is I'm an ordinary man. You\nmight have told me that, Dryden, and I\nwant an ordinary job, sir. That's my\nreason for resigning. It's personal.\n\nALLENBY\nPersonal?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nPersonal? You're a serving officer in the\nfield, and as it happens, a damned\nimportant one. Personal? Are you mad?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo, and if you don't mind, I'd rather not\ngo mad. That's my reason, too.\n\nALLENBY\nLook, Lawrence. I'm making my big push on\nDamascus the sixteenth of next month and\nyou are part of it. Can you understand\nthat? You're an important part of the big\npush.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't want to be part of your big push!\n\nALLENBY\nWhat about your Arab friends? What about\nthem?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI have no Arab friends! I don't want Arab\nfriends!\n\nALLENBY\nWhat in hell do you want, Lawrence?\n\nLAWRENCE\nI've told you. I just want my ration of\ncommon humanity.\n\nDRYDEN\nLawrence?\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes?\n\nDRYDEN\nNothing. Sorry I interrupted, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nOh, that's quite all right, thank you, Mr\nDryden.\n\nDRYDEN\nThank you, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nLook. Why don't we...there's blood on\nyour back. Do you want a doctor?\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo.\n\nALLENBY\nTell me what happened.\n\n\nBENTLEY\nSo, what goes on in there?\n\nDRYDEN\nNothing.\n\nBENTLEY\nOh, come on!\n\nDRYDEN\nNo, really. Nothing at all.\n\nBENTLEY\nIs the man in trouble?\n\nDRYDEN\nI expect so. We all have troubles. Life's\na vale of troubles.\n\nBENTLEY\nJust let me know if the man's in trouble;\nI've got an interest in that man; I've\ngot a claim!\n\nDRYDEN\nWhat claim?\n\nBENTLEY\nYou've read my stuff. I've made that boy\na hero. When the war's over, that boy can\nbe anything he wants.\n\nDRYDEN\nYes. Well, at the moment he wants to be\nsomebody else. Will you kindly allow me\nto pass?\n\nBENTLEY\nWalk away, Dryden. Walk away. Always\nwalking away, aren't you?\n\nDRYDEN\nWell, I'll tell you. It's a little clash\nof temperament that's going on in there,\ninevitably. One of them's half-mad, and\nthe other, wholly unscrupulous.\n\n\nALLENBY\nI believe your name will be a household\nword when you'll have to go to the War\nMuseum to find who Allenby was. You're\nthe most extraordinary man I've ever met.\n\nLAWRENCE\nLeave me alone!\n\nALLENBY\nWhat?\n\nLAWRENCE\nLeave me alone!\n\nALLENBY\nWell, that's a feeble thing to say.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI know I'm not ordinary.\n\nALLENBY\nThat's not what I'm saying.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAll right! I'm extraordinary. What of it?\n\nALLENBY\nNot many people have a destiny, Lawrence.\nIt's a terrible thing for a man to funk\nit if he has.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAre you speaking from experience?\n\nALLENBY\nNo.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYou're guessing, then. Suppose you're\nwrong.\n\nALLENBY\nWhy suppose that? We both know I'm right.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes...\n\nALLENBY\n...After all...\n\nLAWRENCE\nI said, 'Yes'. The sixteenth?\n\nALLENBY\nCan you do it? I'll give you a lot of\nmoney.\n\nLAWRENCE\nArtillery?\n\nALLENBY\nI can't.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey won't be coming for money; not the\nbest of them. They's be coming for\nDamascus, which I'm going to give them.\n\nALLENBY\nThat's all I want.\n\nLAWRENCE\nAll you want is someone holding down the\nTurkish right, but I'm going to give them\nDamascus. We'll get there before you do,\nand when we've got it, we'll keep it. You\ncan tell the politicians to burn their\nbit of paper, now.\n\nALLENBY\nFair enough.\n\nLAWRENCE\nFair. What's 'fair' got to do with it?\nIt's going to happen. I shall want quite\na lot of money.\n\nALLENBY\nAll there is.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNot that much. The best of them won't\ncome for money; they'll come for me.\n\n\nAUDA\nNo pictures! You take no pictures!\n\nBENTLEY\nIt's not for you, sheika, it's for Major\nLawrence. He doesn't mind having his\npicture taken. He doesn't mind at all.\n\nAUDA\nWell, there's only one Aurens.\n\nBENTLEY\nHave you met Major Lawrence since he's\ncome back, sherif?\n\nALI\nYes.\n\nBENTLEY\nChanged, hasn't he?\n\nALI\nNo!\n\nBENTLEY\nOh, I'd say he had. Different man, I'd\nsay. What did that Turkish general do to\nhim  in Dar'a?\n\nALI\nHe was the same man after Dar'a. The same\nman. Humbled. What did the English\ngeneral do to him in Jerusalem?\n\nBENTLEY\nSearch me? Ask Aurens.\n\nALI\nI did.\n\nBENTLEY\nWhat did he say?\n\nALI\nHe laughed. He told me to gather the\nHarif here. He offered me money.\n\nBENTLEY\nDid you take it?\n\nALI\nNo. But many did.     What is this?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThis is my bodyguard.\n\nALI\nThere's not a man there without a price\non his head.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThere's a price on my head, too.\n\nALI\nBut these are murderers. You know the\nsheiks will hang these men.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThese men are mine.\n\nALI\nAurens. These things know nothing of the\nArab revolt. You! You son of a leper.\n\nGUARD\nSherif?\n\nALI\nWhere do we ride?\n\nGUARD\nDamascus, sherif.\n\nALI\nAye, but for what?\n\nGUARD\nSherif? For Aurens.\n\nALI\nYou have bought these things!\n\nLAWRENCE\nI bought half the men here, Ali.\n\nALI\nThat is different. These are not ordinary\nmen!\n\nLAWRENCE\nI don't want ordinary men!     Damascus!!\n\nAUDAR\nAurens!\n\n\nALLENBY\nVery well, gentlemen. The cavalry's gone\nthrough Masseriel and Dar'a. Very good,\nby the way. very good indeed. Now your\nturn.\n\nCHARLEY\nWell, sir, if the enemy's retreating in\nany kind of order, which we'd better\nassume,...\n\nALLENBY\nCertainly.\n\nCHARLEY\n...he can't be further than this Malad\nplace. In which case I can have him\nwithin range by, eh,  o-nine hundred\nhours tomorrow.\n\nALLENBY\nSplendid! Philip.\n\nPHILIP\nWell, these are the last infantry\nsupports going up now, sir, but Malad\ncould have the Fusiliers there by\nWednesday, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nThat'll do for now. The guns are what\nmatter. Any questions?\n\nOFFICER\nThis Arab army on the right, sir. What\ndoes it consist of?\n\nBRIGHTON\nIrregular cavalry, sir. About two\nthousand.\n\nOFFICER\nWhere are they now?\n\nBENTLEY\n(We) Can only know that by being with\nthem, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nThen get with them, Harry. I want to\nknow.\n\nBRIGHTON\nYes, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nPound them, Charley! Pound them!\n\n\nALI\nGod help the men who lie under that!\n\nLAWRENCE\nThey're Turks.\n\nALI\nGod help them!\n\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, he's got the bit between his teeth\nalright.\n\nALLENBY\nCocky?\n\nBRIGHTON\nMore than cocky, sir. He's got the bit\nbetween his teeth. All right. I tell you,\nsir, I think he'll get to Damascus before\nwe do unless...\n\nALLENBY\nUnless?\n\nBENTLEY\nWell, there's a Turkish column in front\nof him. Out of Masriel.\n\nALLENBY\nWhat do the Turks have in Masriel? I\nwonder where they are now.\n\n\n\nGUARD\nNo prisoners.\n\nALI\nDamascus, Aurens.     Aurens. Not this.\nGo round. Damascus, Aurens! Damascus!\n\nGUARD\nNo prisoners.\n\nALI\nAurens?\n\nAUDAR\nThis was Talal's village.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo prisoners! No prisoners!\n\nALI\nGod. God! God!!     Aurens! Enough!\nEnough! Make them stop!     Aurens!\n\nBENTLEY\nMajor! Major Lawrence! Jesus wept! Jesus\nwept!\n\nALI\nDoes it surprise you, Mr Bentley? Surely,\nyou know the Arabs are a barbarous\npeople. Barbarous and cruel. Who but\nthey! Who but they!\n\nBENTLEY\nOh, you rotten man. Here, let me take\nyour rotten bloody picture for the rotten\nbloody newspapers.\n\n\nBEDOUIN\nThese were cut last night, Aurens, in\nDamascus. Damascus!\n\nLAWRENCE\nTake them to Sherif Ali. Tell him. Remind\nhim. Is Allenby in Damascus?\n\nBEDOUIN\nNear.\n\nLAWRENCE\nTell Sherif Ali that.\n\nBEDOUIN\nThey are not ripe, ha, ha.\n\n\nSOLDIER\nGeneral salute! Present arms! Hold Arms!\n\nBRIGHTON\nLawrence is behind it, sir. Lawrence. The\nwhole town has passed onto the Arab flag.\n\nALLENBY\nWhen?\n\nBRIGHTON\nA day and a night, sir. They've been here\na day and a night. They've occupied the\ntown, sir. They've done it. He's set up\nhis own headquarters in the town hall.\n\nALLENBY\nWhat else besides the town hall?\n\nBRIGHTON\nThe telephone exchange, post office,\npower house, hospital, fire station,\neverything, sir. They call themselves the\nArab National Council and they're in the\ntown hall.\n\nALLENBY\nWell, they're your pigeon, Harry. What do\nyou think we should do about it?\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, get them out of it, sir, quick\ntime.\n\nALLENBY\nHow about that, Dryden?\n\nDRYDEN\nNot unless you want a full-scale rising\non your hands, sir.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, what, then?\n\nDRYDEN\nWhen will Prince Feisal be in Damascus?\n\nALLENBY\nBy special train in two days' time.\n\nDRYDEN\nTwo days.\n\nALLENBY\nTwo days is what you asked me for. I\ncan't keep him out any longer. Isn't it\nenough?\n\nDRYDEN\nYes, ample. I should think.\n\nBRIGHTON\nLook, sir, we can't just do nothing.\n\nALLENBY\nWhy not? It's usually best.\n\nALLENBY\nGet us something to drink, Tracy.\nTracy     Yes, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nAnd Tracy, all troops to remain quartered\nuntil further notice.\n\nTRACY\nYes, sir. Does that apply to technical\nunits, sir?\n\nALLENBY\nTechnical Units particularly.\n\nTRACY\nYes, sir.\n\nBRIGHTON\nMedicals, too, sir?\n\nALLENBY\nI'm afraid so, Harry. Medicals too.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe, here, are neither Harif, nor Howetat,\nnor any other tribe, but Arabs at the\nArab Council, acting for Prince Feisal.\n\nAUDA\nHe insulted me.\n\nLAWRENCE\nSherif Ali said that the telephones were\nin the care of the Howetat, and that the\ntelephones had ceased to work, and this\nis true, Auda.\n\nAUDA\nThey will not work because they are given\nno electricity. The electricity is in the\ncare of the Harif.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIf you answer there'll be bloodshed.\n\nALI\nYou speak to me of bloodshed? I ask\npardon of Auda Bute.\n\nAUDA\nHumbly? Humbly! Harif!\n\nALI\nYes! Humbly!\n\nAUDA\nThis is a new trick.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhy is there no electricity?\n\nALI\nI have been to that electrical house,\nAurens. There are three large machines.\n\nVOICE FROM THE BALCONY\nHe means 'generators'!\n\nALI\nSo, one of them is burned. They are of an\nincredible size, but helpless.\n\nAUDA\nIt is so of all machines. Let them burn!\nWhat need of telephones?\n\nLAWRENCE\nThe need is absolute.\n\nALI\nThen, we need the English engineers.\n\nLAWRENCE\nNo! Take English engineers and you take\nEnglish government. Take...\n\nSOLIDER\nFire has broken out.\n\nALI\nWhere?\n\nSOLIDER\nIn the Gensebe district.\n\nALI\nIt is not a district that matters.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt will spread.\n\nALI\nThen, in God's name, use the fire\nbrigade!\n\nSOLIDER\nWe have tried, Aurens, but there is force\nin the water.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen, you must carry it.\n\nALI\nThe Urala do not carry water.\n\nAUDA\nWhat else are they good for?\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe will hear petitions this afternoon.\nThis afternoon!\n\n\nALLENBY\nI'm going to take this up after the war.\n\nBRIGHTON\nSurely, we should do something, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nIt's an old man's sport.\n\nDRYDEN\nAre you an old man, sir?\n\nALLENBY\nHmm.\n\nBRIGHTON\nWell, all I can say is, sir, it's a heavy\nresponsibility. Sorry, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nMaybe, it's the bulb.\n\nDRYDEN\nNo, sir. It's the power. They're leaving,\nsir.\n\nALLENBY\nThat's it, then. Marvellous-looking\nbeggars, aren't they?\n\n\nAUDA\nLeave this, Aurens. Come with me!\n\nLAWRENCE\nCome where?\n\nAUDA\nBack! I know your heart. What is it? Is\nit this? I tell you; this is nothing. Is\nit the blood? The desert has dried up\nmore blood than you could think of.\n\nLAWRENCE\nI pray that I may never see the desert\nagain. Hear me, God!\n\nAUDA\nYou will come. There is only the desert\nfor you.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhat about you, Ali?\n\nALI\nNo. I shall stay here and learn politics.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThat's a very low occupation.\n\nALI\nI had no thought of it when I met you.\nYou tried very hard to give us Damascus.\n\nLAWRENCE\nIt's what I came for. And that would be\nsomething.\n\nALI\nYes. Much.\n\nAUDAR\nHe is your friend?\n\nALI\nTake your hand away!\n\nAUDA\nYou love him.\n\nALI\nNo, I fear him.\n\nAUDAR\nThen, why do you weep?\n\nALI\nI fear him who love him? Or must he fear\nhimself or hate himself. Take your hand\naway!  Howitat!\n\nAUDA\nOh, so you are not yet entirely\npolitician.\n\nALI\nNot yet.\n\nAUDA\nWell, these are new tricks and I am an\nold dog. And Allah be thanked. I'll tell\nthee what, though; being an Arab will be\nthornier than you suppose, Harif!\n\n\nDOCTOR\nIn all my years as a medical officer I've\nnever seen anything like it.\n\nALLENBY\nIt comes within the jurisdiction of the\nArab Council.\n\nDOCTOR\nI'm sorry, sir, under the circumstances I\nthink I must take over immediately.\n\nALLENBY\nUnder any circumstance at all, you must\nobey your orders.\n\nDOCTOR\nNo, sir, I will not.\n\nALLENBY\nControl yourself. Now, go over to the\nTown Hall and see what they say.\n\n\nLAWRENCE\nWe did what we could in the civic\nhospitals.\n\nDOCTOR\nBut you forgot the Turkish military\nhospital.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes.\n\nDOCTOR\nIt has six hundred beds. There are about\ntwo thousand Turkish wounded in it. all\nof whom are the responsibility of your\nprecious Arab Council.\n\nLAWRENCE\nWhat's it like?\n\n\nOFFICER\nThis is outrageous! Outrageous!\nOutrageous!! You filthy little wog!\n\n\nFEISAL\nMy friend, Aurens, if I may call him\nthat. My friend, Aurens. How many men\nwill claim the right to use that phrase?\nHow proudly! He longs for the greenness\nof his native land; he pines for the\ngothic cottages of, eh, Surrey? Is it\nnot? Already, in imagination he catches\ntrout and engages in all the activities\nof the English gentleman.\n\nALLENBY\nThat's me you're describing, sir, not\nColonel Lawrence. You're promoted\nColonel.\n\nLAWRENCE\nYes? What for?\n\nFEISAL\nTake the honour, Colonel. Be a little\nkind.\n\nALLENBY\nAs a Colonel, you'll have a cabin to\nyourself on the boat home.\n\nLAWRENCE\nThen, thank you.\n\nALLENBY\nWell, then, God speed.\n\nFEISAL\nThere's nothing further here for a\nwarrior. We drive bargains. Old men's\nwork. Young men make wars and the virtues\nof war are the virtues of young men;\ncourage and hope for the future. Then,\nold men make the peace. And the vices of\npeace are the vices of old men; mistrust\nand caution. It must be so. What I owe\nyou is beyond evaluation. The power-\nhouse, the telephone exchange - these I\nconcede; the pumping plant I must retain.\n\nALLENBY\nIf you retain the pumping-plant, there'll\nbe no water, sir.\n\nFEISAL\nI shall be glad of any technical\nassistance.\n\nALLENBY\nIn fairness then, you must bring down\nyour flag.\n\nFEISAL\nI shall not bring down my flag, and if\nyour men attempt it, my men will resist\nit.\n\nALLENBY\nHave you any men, sir?\n\nFEISAL\nEnough for that. It's the kind of thing\nthat makes a very ugly incident. I'm sure\nyou're government does not wish to appear\nat the peace conference in the light of\nan aggressor.\n\nSOLDIER\nI say! It's Lawrence, isn't it? Well, may\nI shake you're hand, sir? Just want to be\nable to say I'd done it, sir.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHaven't we met before?\n\nSOLDIER\nDon't think so, sir. Oh, no, sir. I\nshould have remembered that.\n\n\nFEISAL\nIt is widely known the Arab council took\npower in my name.\n\nALLENBY\nThey have no power, sir. It's illusory.\n\nFEISAL\nIllusions can be very powerful;\nparticularly when they take this form.\nThe world is delighted at the picture of\nDamascus liberated by the Arab army.\n\nALLENBY\nLed, may I remind you, sir, by a British\nserving officer.\n\nFEISAL\nAh, yes. But then Aurens is a sword with\ntwo edges. We are equally glad to be rid\nof him. Are we not?\n\nALLENBY\nI thought I was a hard man, sir.\n\nFEISAL\nYou are merely a general. I must be a\nking.\n\nBRIGHTON\nExcuse me, sir.\n\nALLENBY\nWell?\n\nDRYDEN\nWell. It seems we're to have a British\nwaterworks with an Arab flag on it. Do\nyou think it was worth it?\n\nALLENBY\nNot my business. Thank God I'm a soldier!\n\nDRYDEN\nYes, sir. So you keep saying.\n\nFEISAL\nYou, I suspect, are chief architect of\nthis compromise. What do you think?\n\nDRYDEN\nMe? Your Highness? On the whole, I wish\nI'd stayed in Tunbridge Wells.\n\n\nSOLDIER\nWell, sir. Going 'ome.\n\nLAWRENCE\nHmm?\n\nSOLDIER\n'Ome, sir.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe End3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/130934", "artist_names": "Kahlil Gibran", "full_title": "The Farewell by\u00a0Kahlil\u00a0Gibran", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fab9fa8269d0c962abd5c8a1dc99a14b.236x236x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fab9fa8269d0c962abd5c8a1dc99a14b.236x236x1.jpg", "id": 130934, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 86871, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": null, "path": "/Kahlil-gibran-the-farewell-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Kahlil-gibran-the-farewell-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fab9fa8269d0c962abd5c8a1dc99a14b.236x236x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fab9fa8269d0c962abd5c8a1dc99a14b.236x236x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "The Farewell", "title_with_featured": "The Farewell", "updated_by_human_at": 1639178036, "url": "https://genius.com/Kahlil-gibran-the-farewell-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/35964", "header_image_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1359821919_Khalil_Gibran.jpg", "id": 35964, "image_url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1359821919_Khalil_Gibran.jpg", "index_character": "k", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Kahlil Gibran", "slug": "Kahlil-gibran", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Kahlil-gibran"}, "artist": "Kahlil Gibran", "lyrics": "The Farewell LyricsAnd now it was evening.\nAnd Almitra the seeress said, \"Blessed be this day and this place and your spirit that has spoken.\"\nAnd he answered, Was it I who spoke? Was I not also a listener?\nThen he descended the steps of the Temple and all the people followed him. And he reached his ship and stood upon the deck.\nAnd facing the people again, he raised his voice and said:\nPeople of Orphalese, the wind bids me leave you.\nLess hasty am I than the wind, yet I must go.\nWe wanderers, ever seeking the lonelier way, begin no day where we have ended another day; and no sunrise finds us where sunset left us.\nEven while the earth sleeps we travel.\nWe are the seeds of the tenacious plant, and it is in our ripeness and our fullness of heart that we are given to the wind and are scattered.\nBrief were my days among you, and briefer still the words I have spoken.\nBut should my voice fade in your ears, and my love vanish in your memory, then I will come again,\nAnd with a richer heart and lips more yielding to the spirit will I speak.\nYea, I shall return with the tide,\nAnd though death may hide me, and the greater silence enfold me, yet again will I seek your understanding.\nAnd not in vain will I seek.\nIf aught I have said is truth, that truth shall reveal itself in a clearer voice, and in words more kin to your thoughts.\nI go with the wind, people of Orphalese, but not down into emptiness;\nAnd if this day is not a fulfillment of your needs and my love, then let it be a promise till another day. Know therefore, that from the greater silence I shall return.\nThe mist that drifts away at dawn, leaving but dew in the fields, shall rise and gather into a cloud and then fall down in rain.\nAnd not unlike the mist have I been.\nIn the stillness of the night I have walked in your streets, and my spirit has entered your houses,\nAnd your heart-beats were in my heart, and your breath was upon my face, and I knew you all.\nAy, I knew your joy and your pain, and in your sleep your dreams were my dreams.\nAnd oftentimes I was among you a lake among the mountains.\nI mirrored the summits in you and the bending slopes, and even the passing flocks of your thoughts and your desires.\nAnd to my silence came the laughter of your children in streams, and the longing of your youths in rivers.\nAnd when they reached my depth the streams and the rivers ceased not yet to sing.\nBut sweeter still than laughter and greater than longing came to me.\nIt was boundless in you;\nThe vast man in whom you are all but cells and sinews;\nHe in whose chant all your singing is but a soundless throbbing.\nIt is in the vast man that you are vast,\nAnd in beholding him that I beheld you and loved you.\nFor what distances can love reach that are not in that vast sphere?\nWhat visions, what expectations and what presumptions can outsoar that flight?\nLike a giant oak tree covered with apple blossoms is the vast man in you.\nHis mind binds you to the earth, his fragrance lifts you into space, and in his durability you are deathless.\nYou have been told that, even like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest link.\nThis is but half the truth. You are also as strong as your strongest link.\nTo measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by the frailty of its foam.\nTo judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconsistency.\nAy, you are like an ocean,\nAnd though heavy-grounded ships await the tide upon your shores, yet, even like an ocean, you cannot hasten your tides.\nAnd like the seasons you are also,\nAnd though in your winter you deny your spring,\nYet spring, reposing within you, smiles in her drowsiness and is not offended.\nThink not I say these things in order that you may say the one to the other, \"He praised us well. He saw but the good in us.\"\nI only speak to you in words of that which you yourselves know in thought.\nAnd what is word knowledge but a shadow of wordless knowledge?\nYour thoughts and my words are waves from a sealed memory that keeps records of our yesterdays,\nAnd of the ancient days when the earth knew not us nor herself,\nAnd of nights when earth was upwrought with confusion,\nWise men have come to you to give you of their wisdom. I came to take of your wisdom:\nAnd behold I have found that which is greater than wisdom.\nIt is a flame spirit in you ever gathering more of itself,\nWhile you, heedless of its expansion, bewail the withering of your days.\nIt is life in quest of life in bodies that fear the grave.\nThere are no graves here.\nThese mountains and plains are a cradle and a stepping-stone.\nWhenever you pass by the field where you have laid your ancestors look well thereupon, and you shall see yourselves and your children dancing hand in hand.\nVerily you often make merry without knowing.\nOthers have come to you to whom for golden promises made unto your faith you have given but riches and power and glory.\nLess than a promise have I given, and yet more generous have you been to me.\nYou have given me deeper thirsting after life.\nSurely there is no greater gift to a man than that which turns all his aims into parching lips and all life into a fountain.\nAnd in this lies my honour and my reward, -\nThat whenever I come to the fountain to drink I find the living water itself thirsty;\nAnd it drinks me while I drink it.\nSome of you have deemed me proud and over-shy to receive gifts.\nTo proud indeed am I to receive wages, but not gifts.\nAnd though I have eaten berries among the hill when you would have had me sit at your board,\nAnd slept in the portico of the temple where you would gladly have sheltered me,\nYet was it not your loving mindfulness of my days and my nights that made food sweet to my mouth and girdled my sleep with visions?\nFor this I bless you most:\nYou give much and know not that you give at all.\nVerily the kindness that gazes upon itself in a mirror turns to stone,\nAnd a good deed that calls itself by tender names becomes the parent to a curse.\nAnd some of you have called me aloof, and drunk with my own aloneness,\nAnd you have said, \"He holds council with the trees of the forest, but not with men.\nHe sits alone on hill-tops and looks down upon our city.\"\nTrue it is that I have climbed the hills and walked in remote places.\nHow could I have seen you save from a great height or a great distance?\nHow can one be indeed near unless he be far?\nAnd others among you called unto me, not in words, and they said,\nStranger, stranger, lover of unreachable heights, why dwell you among the summits where eagles build their nests?\nWhy seek you the unattainable?\nWhat storms would you trap in your net,\nAnd what vaporous birds do you hunt in the sky?\nCome and be one of us.\nDescend and appease your hunger with our bread and quench your thirst with our wine.\"\nIn the solitude of their souls they said these things;\nBut were their solitude deeper they would have known that I sought but the secret of your joy and your pain,\nAnd I hunted only your larger selves that walk the sky.\nBut the hunter was also the hunted:\nFor many of my arrows left my bow only to seek my own breast.\nAnd the flier was also the creeper;\nFor when my wings were spread in the sun their shadow upon the earth was a turtle.\nAnd I the believer was also the doubter;\nFor often have I put my finger in my own wound that I might have the greater belief in you and the greater knowledge of you.\nAnd it is with this belief and this knowledge that I say,\nYou are not enclosed within your bodies, nor confined to houses or fields.\nThat which is you dwells above the mountain and roves with the wind.\nIt is not a thing that crawls into the sun for warmth or digs holes into darkness for safety,\nBut a thing free, a spirit that envelops the earth and moves in the ether.\nIf this be vague words, then seek not to clear them.\nVague and nebulous is the beginning of all things, but not their end,\nAnd I fain would have you remember me as a beginning.\nLife, and all that lives, is conceived in the mist and not in the crystal.\nAnd who knows but a crystal is mist in decay?\nThis would I have you remember in remembering me:\nThat which seems most feeble and bewildered in you is the strongest and most determined.\nIs it not your breath that has erected and hardened the structure of your bones?\nAnd is it not a dream which none of you remember having dreamt that building your city and fashioned all there is in it?\nCould you but see the tides of that breath you would cease to see all else,\nAnd if you could hear the whispering of the dream you would hear no other sound.\nBut you do not see, nor do you hear, and it is well.\nThe veil that clouds your eyes shall be lifted by the hands that wove it,\nAnd the clay that fills your ears shall be pierced by those fingers that kneaded it.\nAnd you shall see\nAnd you shall hear.\nYet you shall not deplore having known blindness, nor regret having been deaf.\nFor in that day you shall know the hidden purposes in all things,\nAnd you shall bless darkness as you would bless light.\nAfter saying these things he looked about him, and he saw the pilot of his ship standing by the helm and gazing now at the full sails and now at the distance.\nAnd he said:\nPatient, over-patient, is the captain of my ship.\nThe wind blows, and restless are the sails;\nEven the rudder begs direction;\nYet quietly my captain awaits my silence.\nAnd these my mariners, who have heard the choir of the greater sea, they too have heard me patiently.\nNow they shall wait no longer.\nI am ready.\nThe stream has reached the sea, and once more the great mother holds her son against her breast.\nFare you well, people of Orphalese.\nThis day has ended.\nIt is closing upon us even as the water-lily upon its own tomorrow.\nWhat was given us here we shall keep,\nAnd if it suffices not, then again must we come together and together stretch our hands unto the giver.\nForget not that I shall come back to you.\nA little while, and my longing shall gather dust and foam for another body.\nA little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me.\nFarewell to you and the youth I have spent with you.\nIt was but yesterday we met in a dream.\nYou have sung to me in my aloneness, and I of your longings have built a tower in the sky.\nBut now our sleep has fled and our dream is over, and it is no longer dawn.\nThe noontide is upon us and our half waking has turned to fuller day, and we must part.\nIf in the twilight of memory we should meet once more, we shall speak again together and you shall sing to me a deeper song.\nAnd if our hands should meet in another dream, we shall build another tower in the sky.\nSo saying he made a signal to the seamen, and straightaway they weighed anchor and cast the ship loose from its moorings, and they moved eastward.\nAnd a cry came from the people as from a single heart, and it rose the dusk and was carried out over the sea like a great trumpeting.\nOnly Almitra was silent, gazing after the ship until it had vanished into the mist.\nAnd when all the people were dispersed she still stood alone upon the sea-wall, remembering in her heart his saying,\nA little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me.\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2234531",

it\u2019s amazing how you can always relate, to whatever they\u2019re talking about. You know like you\u2019re watching the African Dung Beetle and you\u2019re going \u201cBoy, his life is a lot like mine.\u201d And you always root for whichever animal is the star of the show that week -- like if it\u2019s the antelope, and there\u2019s a lion chasing the antelope you go, \u201cRun antelope Run! Use your Speed, Get away!\u201d But the next week it\u2019s the lion, and then you go \u201cGet the antelope, eat him, bite his head! -- Trap him, don\u2019t let him use his speed!\u201d\n\nJERRY'S APARTMENT\nJerry is at the table and Elaine is on the phone\n\nELAINE: (to the phone) Well did he bring it up in the meeting?\n\nJerry picks up a yellow shirt and walks to Elaine\nJERRY: Elaine, see this T-shirt, six years I've had this T-shirt. It's my best one, I call him\u2026 Golden Boy.\nJerry unfurls the shirt and holds it up for Elaine to see\nELAINE: Yeah, I'm on the phone here.\n\nJERRY: Golden Boy\u2019s always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry. Here touch Golden Boy!\n\nELAINE: No thanks. (to the phone) Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.\n\nJERRY: But see look at the collar, it's fraying. Golden Boy is slowly dying. Each wash brings him one step closer, that's what makes the T-shirt such a tragic figure.\n\nELAINE: Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with some Woolight?\n\nJERRY: No!!! The reason he's the iron man is because he goes out there and plays every game. Wash!!! Spin!!! Rinse!!! Spin!!! You take that away from him, you break his spirit!\nElaine is suddenly excited\n\nELAINE: (to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! that\u2019s fantastic! I'm so excited! Yes I'm excited, OK, OK I'll be in soon! yeah, yeah, I'm coming, I'm coming! OK bye.

Jessep], from the 1992 movie A Few Good Men)\n\nJERRY: What?\n\nGEORGE: (still in Jack\u2019s voice) I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the truth!

I don't know what else I could tell ya, ah, Oh I-I just got back from a trip to the Galapagos Islands, I was living with the turtles.\n\nLIMO DRIVING ON THE STREET -- THEN INSIDE THE LIMO: ELAINE, LIPPMAN, AND TESTIKOV ARE TALKIN'\n\nLIPPMAN: We have got you in a very nice hotel, I-I don't know how you like to work, but ah, I can arrange for an office if you like.\n\nTESTIKOV: (Russian accent) I work in hotel.\n\nLIPPMAN: Oh.\n\nTESTIKOV: \u2026 is better.\n\nElaine gestures towards Testikov, she nods in agreement -- trying to tell Lippman, she quietly says he\u2019ll work at the hotel -- of course he just heard it directly from Testikov\n\nTESTIKOV: Away from all your little petty bickerings and interference.\n\nLIPPMAN: You know, Tolstoy use to write in the village square. The faces inspired him.\n\nTESTIKOV: (proudly) He did not need inspiration\u2026 God spoke through his pen. Hu Hu Hu (pounds his fist lightly on his heart)\n\nELAINE: Ohh, That is so true! (clutches her hands to her chest)\n\nLIPPMAN: Yes.\n\nELAINE: Although one wonders if \"War and Peace\" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was, had it was published under it's original title \"War---What Is It Good For?\"\n\nLIPPMAN: What?\n\nELAINE: Yeah. Mr. Lippman. It was *his mistress* who insisted that he call it\u2026\n\nLIPPMAN: Elaine\u2026\n\nBACKGROUND CARS: HONK HONK\n\nELAINE: \"War and Peace.\"\n\nLIPPMAN: Elaine\u2026\n\nELAINE: \"War--What Is It Good For.\" (sings) Absolutely nothin' HUH! Say it Again! ahehehehe\n\nTESTIKOV: (quietly) Ahhuuh\n\nELAINE: (spoken to Testikov) that's a song \u2026\n\nLIPPMAN: It\u2026 (frustrated and trying to keep her from saying more)\n\nELAINE: \u2026they-they took it from Tolstoy.\n\nLIPPMAN: No. e-Elaine.\n\nElaine's organizer starts beeping\n\nTESTIKOV: War--What Is It Good For?\n\nLIPPMAN: It-no- it's just her sense of humor.\n\nELAINE: No it\u2019s not. That really is true.\n\nTESTIKOV: What is that noise!\n\nLIPPMAN: It\u2019s Not\u2026\n\nELAINE: Yes it is\u2026\n\nLIPPMAN: No It\u2019s Not!!\n\nTESTIKOV: That noise! \u2026\n\nLIPPMAN: it-it-it\u2019s her purse.\n\nTESTIKOV: Where is that noise? It\u2019s traveling up my spine! Into my Brain!\n\nELAINE: Oh, I\u2026\n\nLIPPMAN: It's coming from your purse.\n\nELAINE: Oh\u2026 It must be my new organizer.\n\nTESTIKOV: That noise! \u2026\n\nLIPPMAN: Yes\u2026Turn it off.\n\nELAINE: Right, I think it\u2019s this\u2026\n\nLIPPMAN: No it\u2019s the Button. Elaine\u2026\n\nTESTIKOV: I can not stand it!\n\nLIPPMAN: It's the button at the top, the top.\n\nELAINE: OK. I don\u2019t quite know\u2026\n\nTESTIKOV: Will you Turn it off!\n\nLIPPMAN: The one at the top.\n\nELAINE: Yeah, I\u2019m gonna work on that\u2026\n\nTESTIKOV: Aaach!\n\nTestikov grabs the organizer and throws it out the window of the limo\n\nLIPPMAN: Yeah\u2026 Ohoo.\n\nON THE BEACH KRAMER IS GETTING READY TO HIT A BALL. HE TAKES A BIG SWING AND MISSES. HE LOOKS FOR THE BALL IN THE AIR AND THE REALIZES THAT IT\u2019S STILL ON THE GROUND.\nJERRY'S APARTMENT\n\nJERRY: I did it for you.\n\nGEORGE: I don\u2019t know what\u2019cha had to tell her that for. You put me in a very difficult position, Marine Biologist! I'm very uncomfortable with this whole thing.\n\nJERRY: You know with all do respect I would think it's right up your alley.\n\nGEORGE: Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it up. I know what I'm doin, I know my alleys! You got me in the Galapagos Islands livin' with the turtles, I don't know where the hell I am.\n\nJERRY: Well you came in the other day with all that whale stuff, the squeaking and the squealing and\u2026\n\nGEORGE: Look, why couldn't you make me an architect? You know I always wanted to pretend that I was an architect. Well I-I'm supposed to see her tomorrow, I-I-I'm gonna tell her what's goin on. I mean maybe she just likes me for me.\n\nKramer bangs into the room with his golf clubs\n\nKRAMER: Hey.\n\nJERRY: Hey.\n\nKRAMER: Hey ya want these (He throws down the golf clubs -- kicks the bag hard) I don't want em!\n\nJERRY: What?\n\nKRAMER: I stink! I can't play! The ball is just sitting there, Jerry, and I can't hit it! I only hit one really good ball that went way out there!\n\nJERRY: Well what happened?\n\nKRAMER: I have no concentration!\n\nKramer starts to brush his hands at the back of his neck and scratch his body\n\nJERRY: What, what, what's wrong with you?\n\nKRAMER: Sand, I can get rid of the sand. (he sits at the table, looking down his shirt) Look there\u2019s still some in here, it won't go away! Look I even got sand in the pockets!\n\nHe empties his pocket and a bunch of sand falls out\n\nJERRY: Hey come on, you're getting it all over the floor!\n\nKramer gets sand in his eye, as he puts his hands to his eyes he falls over on to the floor. Then the phone rings -- George picks up the receiver and, without even looking, tosses it to Jerry\n\nJERRY: (to the phone) Hello\u2026 yeah\u2026 yes it is\u2026 really\u2026 ah, ah\u2026 Could you hold on a second? (to George and Kramer) Hey listen to this, some woman found an electronic organizer, my name was in it, she wants me to help her track down the owner.\n\nGEORGE: How'd she find it?\n\nJERRY: She\u2019s waking down the street and it hit her in the head!\n\nMONK'S WHERE JERRY AND CORINNE (THE WOMAN HE WAS TALKING WITH ON THE PHONE) ARE SITTING IN THE BOOTH\n\nCORINNE: So I am walkin' along, minding my own business when all off the sudden this thing comes flying out of nowhere and clonks me right on the head.\n\nJERRY: Wow.\n\nCORINNE: Yeah, So they took me to the hospital\u2026\n\nJERRY: Yeah\u2026\n\nCORINNE: \u2026and they put me in this thing, that feels like a coffin, for forty-five minutes. Have you ever been in one of those things? You could go berserk in there!\n\nJERRY: Well you have insurance\n\nCORINNE: I wish!\n\nJERRY: Unbelievable!\n\nCORINNE: Yeah.\n\nOrganizer beeps\n\nJERRY: What is with this thing.\n\nCORINNE: (hits the organizer) I don't know, it never shuts up. So anyway, you could see why I would be interested in finding this person.\n\nJERRY: Absolutely. You should not have to pay for that.\n\nOrganizer beeps again\n\nCORINNE: (hits the organizer, picks it up and hits it on to the table -- shouting) Stop it! Stop it!\n\nJERRY: Let me have a look at this thing.\n\nCORINNE: Ya know it was somebody told me they thought they saw that thing come out of a limousine.\n\nJERRY: Typical rich people, using the world for their personal garbage can.\n\nCORINNE: Boy am I lucky your name came up. I just pushed a button.\n\nJERRY: I would like to know what my name\u2019s doin in this creep's organizer to begin with.\n\nCORINNE: Yeah.\n\nJERRY: Who do I know who would have even been in a limousine yesterday anyway. Uhh-O h-owow!\n\nEXTERIOR OF JERRY AND KRAMER\u2019S BUILDING, THEN IN THE HALLWAY -- ELAINE KNOCKS ON KRAMER'S DOOR, HE ANSWERS -- HIS RIGHT ELBOW IS WAY UP ABOVE HIS HEAD AND HIS ARM IS DOWN HIS BACK AS HE IS STILL ITCHING CAUSE OF THE SAND\n\nKRAMER: Wha-- Oh, hey.\n\nELAINE: Hey, \"great\" organizer you gave me.\n\nKRAMER: Oh, you liked it huh.\n\nELAINE: It wouldn't stop beeping, in the car so Testikov, through it out the window.\n\nKRAMER: Oh. (continuing to itch and scratch from the sand)\n\nELAINE: I transferred everything in there. I threw out my old book. I'm lost now, Kramer.\n\nflapping his shirt vigorusly to get the sand out\n\nELAINE: What, what is it?\n\nKRAMER: The sand, it's everywhere! (blows on his arm)\n\nELAINE: OK I'll see you later.\n\nKRAMER: Yei-\n\nKramer closes the door and Jerry walks up to his door\n\nJERRY: Oh, there you are!\n\nELAINE: There you are!\n\nJERRY: So?\n\nELAINE: So?\n\nJERRY: So what do you have to say for yourself?\n\nELAINE: So what do you have to say for yourself?\n\nJerry unlocks the door and they both walk in and close the door\n\nJERRY: Why should I have anything for say for myself?\n\nELAINE: \"War-- What is it good for?\"!\n\nJERRY: A-Ahahahahah. Who told you?\n\nELAINE: A-hu hu hu hu. Yuri Testikov, the Russian writer! Hellooo!\n\nJERRY: You told Testikov, (Elaine nods) that Tolstoy wanted to name his book \"War-- What Is IT Good For?\"?\n\nELAINE: Uh-hu. And do you know what happened?\n\nJERRY: Can I take a guess?\n\nELAINE: Oh, Please.\n\nJERRY: Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?\n\nElaine pushes Jerry\n\nELAINE: What, how did you know that?\n\nJERRY: Because I know who has it.\n\nELAINE: (gasps) How did you find it?\n\nJERRY: Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found my name, called me up, and we met!\n\nELAINE: (gasps) Where is it, give it to me!\n\nJERRY: I don't have it!\n\nELAINE: Why not.\n\nJERRY: Because she's not returning it until she gets the money back for the hospital bill.\n\nELAINE: But I didn't do it. Testikov did it, he should pay for it!\n\nJERRY: How much is Testikov getting from Pendant for this book?\n\nELAINE: One million.\n\nJERRY: Well that's a start.\n\nGEORGE AND DIANE ARE WALKING ON THE BEACH\n\nGEORGE: Then of course with evolution, the octopus lost the nostrils and took on the more familiar look that we know today.\n\nDIANE: Uh-Really?\n\nGEORGE: Yeah, but if you still look closely you can see ah, a little bump where the nose use to be. huhuhuhu.\n\nDIANE: Wow.\n\nGEORGE: But enough about fish, huhuhu. I can discuss other things you know, ah\u2026 architecture. Huhu. (makes a wide gesture with his arms)\n\nAT THE HOTEL THAT TESTIKOV IS STAYING AT\n\nJERRY: You know what room Testikov's in?\n\nELAINE: Yeah, 308. Oh, I'm crazy for doing this!\n\nJERRY: Well, you want your organizer back don't you?\n\nELAINE: Why are you so interested -- you want to take her out?\n\nJERRY: Hey you know when Superman saves someone no one asks if he's trying to hit on her!\n\nELAINE: Well, you're not Superman.\n\nJERRY: Well you're not Lois Lane.\n\nELAINE: Oh. Listen, you got the tape-recorder.\n\nJERRY: Yeah I got it. You sure you want to do this? (hands Elaine the tape recorder.)\n\nELAINE: Yeah I gotta get Testikov on tape. If this woman ends up in the \"New England Journal Of Medicine\" I'm not gonna pay for it.\n\nJERRY: Oh, here she comes.\n\nCorinne enters through the hotel\u2019s revolving door\n\nJERRY: Hi.\n\nCORINNE: Hi.\n\nJERRY: Elaine, this is Corinne.\n\nCORINNE: Hello.\n\nELAINE: Hi, (sighs) you got the organizer?\n\nThe organizer starts to beep as Corinne opens her coat to show the organizer in her inside coat pocket\n\nJERRY: All right lets go. We'll meet you back down here in ten minutes, hopefully with the money.\n\nAT THE BEACH GEORGE AND DIANE ARE STILL WALKING\n\nDIANE: Your parents must be so proud of you, George.\n\nGEORGE: Oh, they're busting!\n\nDIANE: Hmhm.\n\nThere is a large crowd of men and women looking and pointing into the ocean\n\nDIANE: What are those people doing over there?\n\nEXTERIOR SHOT OF THE HOTEL, THEN IN TESTIKOV'S HOTEL ROOM THERE ARE FIVE QUICK KNOCKS AT THE DOOR. HE HOLDS THE MANUSCRIPT IN HIS LEFT ARM. LEANING OVER A BIT, AND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND, OPENS THE DOOR SLIGHTLY TO SEE WHO IS WAITING -- IT IS JERRY AND ELAINE. THEN HE OPENS THE DOOR WIDE\n\nTESTIKOV: (In a loud and cranky voice) What, Come in - come in - Come in Miss Benes! That is if you can spare a minute from your busy schedule! And you bring guest for my entertainment?\n\nTestikov goes to get a drink while Elaine is talking -- his back to them as he downs the full drink\n\nELAINE: Um, yes this is my friend Jerry. Um, he accompanied me, ya know (clears throat), single women in a big city can be dangerous, so\u2026\n\nJERRY: Yeah. Th-That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble -- Zip, I'm gone. (makes a running motion with both arms and his right foot)\n\nTESTIKOV: Yeah, Yeah. The sneakers. All the Americans with the sneakers. Always running from something. Ya ya, well Sit, stop running, Ehh. two minutes, I give you latest manuscript!\n\nThey both sit down and Jerry picks out a very large book from the coffee table\n\nJERRY: Oh! Rimsky -- great great book if I may say so sir. I almost read the whole thing.\n\nELAINE: Hmm. (she nods in agreement)\n\nCORINNE IS STANDING IN THE HOTEL LOBBY SMOKING WHILE THE ORGANIZER IS STILL BEEPING\n\nCORINNE: What!\n\nHOTEL CLERK: If you can't thing off, I'll have to ask you to leave.\n\nCORINNE: I'm waitin for two people! (takes a drag on the cigarette)\n\nHOTEL CLERK: Well you can wait for them outside.\n\nCORINNE: Yeah, (she blows smoke out as she speaks -- it rises as in front of her) I guess I'd better. I wouldn't want to take any attention away from the hookers!\n\nHOTEL CLERK: All right, All right. Out, Out.\n\nCORINNE: Whatever you say, Cro..w-well!\n\nshe exits through the hotel\u2019s revolving door, the organizer continues to beep\nON THE BEACH GEORGE AND DIANE ARE STANDING WITH THE CROWD\n\nDIANE: What's going on over here?\n\nWOMAN AT BEACH: There is a beached whale, she's dying.\n\nVOICE: Is anyone here a marine biologist?\n\nDiane looks at George as he turns slowly towards her realizing the irony of the situation he is in.\nUPWARDS VIEW OF THE EXTERIOR OF THE HOTEL, THEN IN TESTIKOV'S ROOM\n\nTESTIKOV: Here is latest draft. I see you next week. Same time, same day. (smacks the manuscript into Elaine\u2019s hand) On time please.\n\nELAINE: (quietly) OK.\n\nJERRY: It was nice meeting you\u2026\n\nTESTIKOV: Aah.\n\nJERRY: \u2026 you\u2019re a real pleasure. (Jerry is being sarcastic)\n\nTESTIKOV: Ya ya. (wipes his nose with a handkerchief)\n\nElaine and Jerry take a few steps towards the door, as Jerry turns to her and motions with his hand to ask Testikov about the organizer incident. They stop and turn back.\n\nELAINE: Uh-Oh-ah, by the way Mr. Testikov um, do you remember the other day when we were in the limo and ah, my organizer started making noise and you threw it out the window?\n\nTESTIKOV: (quietly) yes. How could I forget? heehe.\n\nELAINE: ( laughs) Well um, would you believe that it actually, hit somebody in the head.\n\nJERRY: Right in the head! (leans in and points at Testikov)\n\nThe tape-recorder in Elaine's purse starts to squeak\n\nELAINE: Boing! Hehe hehe. (makes a hand gesture to her forehead and away)\n\nThe tape-recorder is squeaking much louder as it rewinds\n\nTESTIKOV: (Shouting) What is that noise!\n\nELAINE: Oh that\u2019s nothing. Um and anyway um\u2026\n\nTESTIKOV: What\u2019s going on Huh! (he grabs Elaine\u2019s purse) That Noise!\u2026\n\nELAINE: No, No that's my purse!\n\nTESTIKOV: That Noise!\n\nJerry watches the action as he rubs his hand on the top of his head\n\nELAINE: No, get-get off my purse!\n\nTESTIKOV: Agh, it\u2019s recorder!\n\nHe pulls out the recorder\n\nELAINE: No that's\u2026 Radio!\n\nTESTIKOV: Ha! (he clicks the player off) You are spying on me!\n\n(Elaine bites her finger as Testikov throws the recorder out of the hotel window -- from below, we see the recorder falling -- with blue sky above it. The sound of the tape playing in fast motion as it falls (odd, because Testikov had turned the player off. --\n\nCORINNE IS STANDING OUTSIDE OF THE HOTEL AND LOOKS UP TO SEE THE TAPE-RECORDER FALLING TOWARDS HER. A SOUND INDICATES THAT IT HITS HER IN THE HEAD\nNEWMAN IS STROLLING DOWN THE STREET WHISTLING. KRAMER IS STANDING AT HIS OPEN WINDOW, KNOCKING HIS BOOT ON THE WINDOW SILL TRYING TO GET THE SAND OUT BUT HE DROPS IT. A HIGH PITCHED SOUND AND A SHOT OF THE FALLING BOOT AS NEWMAN STOPS AND LOOKS UP -- AND HE YELLS AS THE BOOT IS OBVIOUSLY ABOUT TO HIT HIM IN THE HEAD\nAT THE BEACH EVERYONE IS YELLING AT GEORGE\n\nCROWD: Come on! Save the whale! You gotta do it!\n\nDIANE: Save the whale George for me.\n\nGeorge turns and slowly walks towards the ocean with a determined look. He takes off his hat and throws it down. He walks into the ocean -- his pant legs are rolled up\nAT THE COFFEE SHOP JERRY AND KRAMER ARE AWAITING THE STORY\n\nGEORGE: So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified! But I pressed on -- and as I made my way passed the breakers a strange calm came over me. I-I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment \u2026 I was a Marine Biologist!\n\nElaine enters and sits down\n\nELAINE: George I\u2019ve just reading this thing in the paper, it's unbelievable!\n\nGEORGE: I know I was just telling them the story.\n\nKRAMER: Well come on George, finish the story.\n\nGEORGE: The sea was angry that day my friends\u2026 like an old man trying to send back soup in a deli!\n\nJerry gives Kramer a \"What the --\" glance\n\nGEORGE: I got about fifty-feet out and suddenly, the great beast appeared before me. I tell ya he was ten stories high if he was a foot. As if sensing my presence he let out a great bellow. I said, \"Easy big fella!\" And then, as I watched him struggling I realized, that something was obstructing its\u2019 breathing. From where I was standing I could see directly into the eye of the great fish!\n\nJERRY: Mammal.\n\nGEORGE: Whatever.\n\nKRAMER: Well then, what did you do next?\n\nGEORGE: Well then, from out of nowhere, a huge tidal wave lifted me, tossed like a cork and I found myself right on top of him, (ELAINE: gasps quietly Ahhhh) face to face with the blow-hole. I-I, I could barely see from the waves crashing down upon me but, I knew something was there\u2026 so I reached my hand in, felt around and pulled out the obstruction!\n\nGeorge reaches into his inside jacket pocket and dramatically pulls something out in his clenched fist -- holding it up in the air for a second, then displays a golf ball holding it in mid air for the remaining 28 seconds of the scene\nElaine looks on, mouth wide open in amazement. Jerry turns and looks at Kramer also in amazement and George, while staring at Kramer, holds out the ball in the air\u2026 Kramer sits quietly, squirming -- and it\u2019s 21 seconds until Kramer speaks\n\nKRAMER: What is that a Titleist?\n\nGEORGE: (Silently squinches his mouth and nods at Kramer)\n\nKRAMER: A hole in one eh.\n\nSTILL IN THE COFFEE SHOP\n\nJERRY: Well the-the crowd must have gone wild!\n\nGEORGE: Ohh yes, yes. Yes Jerry they were all over me. It was like Rocky 1, Hm. Diane came up to me, threw her arms around me\u2026\n\nKRAMER: (quietly) Um-hm.\n\nGEORGE: \u2026kissed me. We both had tears streaming down our faces. I never saw anyone so beautiful. It was at that moment that I decided to tell her that, I was not a marine biologist.\n\nJERRY: Wow! What'd she say?\n\nGEORGE: Told me to \"Go to hell!\" and I took the bus home.\n\nGeorge stuffs the golf ball in his shirt pocket\n\nJERRY: All right lets go.\n\nJerry, Elaine and George all get up from the booth -- Kramer takes the last four spoonfuls of food from his bowl and wipes his mouth with a napkin before getting up.\n\nELAINE: What, are you in a bad mood?\n\nJERRY: Ahhh\u2026 got my laundry back.\n\nELAINE: Ohhh!

This melancholy event became speedily a subject of general regret. The succession to the British throne was soon made a matter of contention; and the scenes which ensued were a demonstration of the serious affliction in which the kingdom was involved. As his loss to the nation was more and more unfolded, the remembrance of his government was more and more the basis of grateful recollection. The very awful prospect, which was soon presented to the friends of Edward's administration, under the direction of his counsellors and servants, was a contemplation which the reflecting mind was compelled to regard with most alarming apprehensions. The rapid approaches which were made towards a total reversion of the proceedings of the young king's reign, denoted the advances which were thereby represented to an entire resolution in the management of public affairs both in Church and state.\n\nAlarmed for the condition in which the kingdom was likely to be involved by the king's death, an endeavor to prevent the consequences, which were but too plainly foreseen, was productive of the most serious and fatal effects. The king, in his long and lingering affliction, was induced to make a will, by which he bequeathed the English crown to Lady Jane, the daughter of the duke of Suffolk, who had been married to Lord Guilford, the son of the duke of Northumberland, and was the granddaughter of the second sister of King Henry, by Charles, duke of Suffolk. By this will, the succession of Mary and Elizabeth, his two sisters, was entirely superseded, from an apprehension of the returning system of popery; and the king's council, with the chief of the nobility, the lord-mayor of the city of London, and almost all the judges and the principal lawyers of the realm, subscribed their names to this regulation, as a sanction to the measure. Lord Chief Justice Hale, though a true Protestant and an upright judge, alone declined to unite his name in favor of the Lady Jane, because he had already signified his opinion that Mary was entitled to assume the reins of government. Others objected to Mary's being placed on the throne, on account of their fears that she might marry a foreigner, and thereby bring the crown into considerable danger. Her partiality to popery also left little doubt on the minds of any, that she would be induced to revive the dormant interests of the pope, and change the religion which had been used both in the days of her father, King Henry, and in those of her brother Edward: for in all his time she had manifested the greatest stubbornness and inflexibility of temper, as must be obvious from her letter to the lords of the council, whereby she put in her claim to the crown, on her brother's decease.\n\nWhen this happened, the nobles, who had associated to prevent Mary's succession, and had been instrumental in promoting, and, perhaps, advising the measures of Edward, speedily proceeded to proclaim Lady Jane Gray, to be queen of England, in the city of London and various other populous cities of the realm. Though young, she possessed talents of a very superior nature, and her improvements under a most excellent tutor had given her many very great advantages.\n\nHer reign was of only five days' continuance, for Mary, having succeeded by false promises in obtaining the crown, speedily commenced the execution of her avowed intention of extirpating and burning every Protestant. She was crowned at Westminster in the usual form, and her elevation was the signal for the commencement of the bloody persecution which followed.\n\nHaving obtained the sword of authority, she was not sparing in its exercise. The supporters of Lady Jane Gray were destined to feel its force. The duke of Northumberland was the first who experienced her savage resentment. Within a month after his confinement in the Tower, he was condemned, and brought to the scaffold, to suffer as a traitor. From his varied crimes, resulting out of a sordid and inordinate ambition, he died unpitied and unlamented.\n\nThe changes, which followed with rapidity, unequivocally declared that the queen was disaffected to the present state of religion. Dr. Poynet was displaced to make room for Gardiner to be bishop of Winchester, to whom she also gave the important office of lord-chancellor. Dr. Ridley was dismissed from the see of London, and Bonne introduced. J. Story was put out of the bishopric of Chichester, to admit Dr. Day. J. Hooper was sent prisoner to the Fleet, and Dr. Heath put into the see of Worcestor. Miles Coverdale was also excluded from Exeter, and Dr. Vesie placed in that diocese. Dr. Tonstall was also promoted to the see of Durham. These things being marked and perceived, great heaviness and discomfort grew more and more to all good men's hearts; but to the wicked great rejoicing. They that could dissemble took no great care how the matter went; but such, whose consciences were joined with the truth, perceived already coals to be kindled, which after should be the destruction of many a true Christian.The Words and Behavior of the Lady Jane upon the Scaffold The next victim was the amiable Lady Jane Gray, who, by her acceptance of the crown at the earnest solicitations of her friends, incurred the implacable resentment of the bloody Mary. When she first mounted the scaffold, she spoke to the specators in this manner: \"Good people, I am come hither to die, and by a law I am condemned to the same. The fact against the queen's highness was unlawful, and the consenting thereunto by me: but, touching the procurement and desire thereof by me, or on my behalf, I do wash my hands thereof in innocency before God, and the face of you, good Christian people, this day:\" and therewith she wrung her hands, wherein she had her book. Then said she, \"I pray you all, good Christian people, to bear me witness, that I die a good Christian woman, and that I do look to be saved by no other mean, but only by the mercy of God in the blood of His only Son Jesus Christ: and I confess that when I did know the Word of God, I neglected the same, loved myself and the world, and therefore this plague and punishment is happily and worthily happened unto me for my sins; and yet I thank God, that of His goodness He hath thus given me a time and a respite to repent. And now, good people, while I am alive, I pray you assist me with your prayers.\" And then, kneeling down, she turned to Feckenham, saying, \"Shall I say this Psalm?\" and he said, \"Yea.\" Then she said the Psalm of Miserere mei Deus, in English, in a most devout manner throughout to the end; and then she stood up, and gave her maid, Mrs. Ellen, her gloves and handkerchief, and her book to Mr. Bruges; and then she untied he gown, and the executioner pressed upon her to help her off with it: but she, desiring him to let her alone, turned towards her two gentlewomen, who helped her off therewith, and also with her frowes, paaft, and neckerchief, giving to her a fair handkerchief to put about her eyes.\nThen the executioner kneeled down, and asked her forgiveness, whom she forgave most willingly. Then he desired her to stand upon the straw, which doing, she saw the block. Then she said, \"I pray you, despatch me quickly.\" Then she kneeled down, saying, \"Will you take it off before I lay me down?\" And the executioner said, \"No, madam.\" Then she tied a handkerchief about her eyes, and feeling for the block, she said, \"What shall I do? Where is it? Where is it?\" One of the standers-by guiding her therunto, she laid her head upon the block, and then stretched forth her body, and said, \"Lord, into Thy hands I commend my spirit;\" and so finished her life, in the year of our Lord 1554, the twelfth day of February, about the seventeenth year of her age.\n\nThus died Lady Jane; and on the same day Lord Guilford, her husband, one of the duke of Northumberland's sons, was likewise beheaded, two innocents in comparison with them that sat upon them. For they were both very young, and ignorantly accepted that which others had contrived, and by open proclamation consented to take from others, and give to them.\n\nTouching the condemnation of this pious lady, it is to be noted that Judge Morgan, who gave sentence against her, soon after he had condemned her, fell mad, and in his raving cried out continually to have the Lady Jane taken away from him, and so he ended his life.\n\nOn the twenty-first day of the same month, Henry, duke of Suffolk, was beheaded on Tower-hill, the fourth day after his condemnation: about which time many gentlemen and yeomen were condemned, whereof some were executed at London, and some in the country. In the number of whom was Lord Thomas Gray, brother to the said duke, being apprehended not long after in North Wales, and executed for the same. Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, also, very narrowly escaped.John Rogers, Vicar of St. Sepulchre's, and Reader of St. Paul's, LondonJohn Rogers was educated at Cambridge, and was afterward many years chaplain to the merchant adventurers at Antwerp in Brabant. Here he met with the celebrated martyr William Tyndale, and Miles Coverdale, both voluntary exiles from their country for their aversion to popish superstition and idolatry. They were the instruments of his conversion; and he united with them in that translation of the Bible into English, entitled \"The Translation of Thomas Matthew.\" From the Scriptures he knew that unlawful vows may be lawfully broken; hence he married, and removed to Wittenberg in Saxony, for the improvement of learning; and he there learned the Dutch language, and received the charge of a congregation, which he faithfully executed for many years. On King Edward's accession, he left Saxony to promote the work of reformation in England; and, after some time, Nicholas Ridley, then bishop of London, gave him a prebend in St. Paul's Cathedral, and the dean and chapter appointed him reader of the divinity lesson there. Here he continued until Queen Mary's succession to the throne, when the Gospel and true religion were banished, and the Antichrist of Rome, with his superstition and idolatry, introduced.\n\nThe circumstance of Mr. Rogers having preached at Paul's cross, after Queen Mary arrived at the Tower, has been already stated. He confirmed in his sermon the true doctrine taught in King Edward's time, and exhorted the people to beware of the pestilence of popery, idolatry, and superstition. For this he was called to account, but so ably defended himself that, for that time, he was dismissed. The proclamation of the queen, however, to prohibit true preaching, gave his enemies a new handle against him. Hence he was again summoned before the council, and commanded to keep his house. He did so, though he might have escaped; and though he perceived the state of the true religion to be desperate. Heknew he could not want a living in Germany; and he could not forget a wife and ten children, and to seek means to succor them. But all these things were insufficient to induce him to depart, and, when once called to answer in Christ's cause, he stoutly defended it, and hazarded his life for that purpose.\n\nAfter long imprisonment in his own house, the restless Bonner, bishop of London, caused him to be committed to Newgate, there to be lodged among thieves and murderers.\n\nAfter Mr. Rogers had been long and straitly imprisoned, and lodged in Newgate among thieves, often examined, and very uncharitably entreated, and at length unjustly and most cruelly condemned by Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, the fourth day of February, in the year of our Lord 1555, being Monday in the morning, he was suddenly warned by the keeper of Newgate's wife, to prepare himself for the fire; who, being then sound asleep, could scarce be awaked. At length being raised and awaked, and bid to make haste, then said he, \"IKf it be so, I need not tie my points.\" And so was had down, first to bishop Bonner to be degraded: which being done, he craved of Bonner but one petition; and Bonner asked what that should be. Mr. Rogers replied that he might speak a few words with his wife before his burning, but that could not be obtained of him.\n\nWhen the time came that he should be brought out of Newgate to Smithfield, the place of his execution, Mr. Woodroofe, one of the sheriffs, first came to Mr. Rogers, and asked him if he would revoke his abominable doctrine, and the evil opinion of the Sacrament of the altar. Mr. Rogers answered, \"That which I have preached I will seal with my blood.\" Then Mr. Woodroofe said, \"Thou art an heretic.\" \"That shall be known,\" quoth Mr. Rogers, \"at the Day of Judgment.\" \"Well,\" said Mr. Woodroofe, \"I will never pray for thee.\" \"But I will pray for you,\" said Mr. Rogers; and so was brought the same day, the fourth of February, by the sheriffs, towards Smithfield, saying the Psalm Miserere by the way, all the people wonderfully rejoicing at his constancy; with great praises and thanks to God for the same. And there in the presence of Mr. Rochester, comptroller of the queen's household, Sir Richard Southwell, both the sheriffs, and a great number of people, he was burnt to ashes, washing his hands in the flame as he was burning. A little before his burning, his pardon was brought, if he would have recanted; but he utterly refused it. He was the first martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in Queen Mary's time that gave the first adventure upon the fire. His wife and children, being eleven in number, ten able to go, and one sucking at her breast, met him by the way, as he went towards Smithfield. TGhis sorrowful sight of his own flesh and blood could nothing move him, but that he constantly and cheerfully took his death with wonderful patience, in the defence and quarrel of the Gospel of Christ.\"The Rev. Lawrence SaundersMr. Saunders, after passing some time in the school of Eaton, was chosen to go to King's College in Cambridge, where he continued three years, and profited in knowledge and learning very much for that time. Shortly after he quitted the university, and went to his parents, but soon returned to Cambridge again to his study, where he began to add to the knowledge of the Latin, the study of the Greek and Hebrew tongues, and gave himself up to the study of the Holy Scriptures, the better to qualify himself for the office of preacher.\n\nIn the beginning of King Edward's reign, when God's true religion was introduced, after license obtained, he began to preach, and was so well liked of them who then had authority that they appointed him to read a divinity lecture in the College of Forthringham. The College of Fothringham being dissolved he was placed to be a reader in the minster at Litchfield. After a certain space, he departed from Litchfield to a benefice in Leicestershire, called Church-langton, where he held a residence, taught diligently, and kept a liberal house. Thence he was orderly called to take a benefice in the city of London, namely, All-hallows in Bread-street. After this he preached at Northhampton, nothing meddling with the state, but boldly uttering his conscience against the popish doctrines which were likely to spring up again in England, as a just plague for the little love which the English nation then bore to the blessed Word of God, which had been so plentifully offered unto them.\n\nThe queen's party who were there, and heard him, were highly displeased with him for his sermon, and for it kept him among them as a prisoner. But partly for love of his brethren and friends, who were chief actors for the queen among them, and partly because there was no law broken by hbis preaching, they dismissed him.\n\nSome of his friends, perceiving such fearful menacing, counselled him to fly out of the realm, which he refused to do. But seeing he was with violence kept from doing good in that place, he returned towards London, to visit his flock.\n\nIn the afternoon of Sunday, October 15, 1554, as he was reading in his church to exhort his people, the bishop of London interrupted him, by sending an officer for him.\n\nHis treason and sedition the bishop's charity was content to let slip until another time, but a heretic he meant to prove him, and all those, he said, who taught and believed that the administration of the Sacraments, and all orders of the Church, are the most pure, which come the nearest to the order of the primitive Church.\nAfter much talk concerning this matter, the bishop desired him to write what he believed of transubstantiation. Lawrence Saunders did so, saying, \"My Lord, you seek my blood, and you shall have it: I pray God that you may be so baptized in it that you may ever after loathe blood-sucking, and become a better man.\" Upon being closely charged with contumacy, the severe replies of Mr. Saunders to the bishop, (who had before, to get the favor of Henry VIII written and set forth in print, a book of true obedience, wherein he had openly declared Queen Mary to be a bastard) so irritated him that he exclaimed, \"Carry away this frenzied fool to prison.\"\n\nAfter this good and faithful martyr had been kept in prison one year and a quarter, the bishops at length called him, as they did his fellow-prisoners, openly to be examined before the queen's council.\n\nHis examination being ended, the officers led him out of the place, and stayed until the rest of his fellow-prisoners were likewise examined, that they might lead them all together to prison.\n\nAfter his excommunication and delivery over to the secular power, he was brought by the sheriff of London to the Compter, a prison in his own parish of Bread-street, at which he rejoiced greatly, both because he found there a fellow-prisoner, Mr. Cardmaker, with whom he had much Christian and comfortable discourse; and because out of prison, as before in his pulpit, he might have an opportunity of preaching to his parishioners. On the fourth of February, Bonner, bishop of London, came to the prison to degrade him; the day following, in the morning the sheriff of London delivered him to certain of the queen's guard, who were appointed to carry him to the city of Coventry, there to be burnt.\n\nWhen they had arrived at Coventry, a poor shoemaker, who used to serve him with shoes, came to him, and said, \"O my good master, God strengthen and comfort you.\" \"Good shoemaker,\" Mr. Saunders replied, \"I desire thee to pray for me, for I am the most unfit man for this high office, that ever was appointed to it; but my gracious God and dear Father is able to make me strong enough.\" The next day, being the eighth of February, 1555, he was led to the place of execution, in the park, without the city. He went in an old gown and a shirt, barefooted, and oftentimes fell flat on the ground, and prayed. When he was come to nigh the place, the officer, appointed to see the execution done, said to Mr. Saunders that he was one of them who marred the queen's realm, but if he would recant, there was pardon for him. \"Not I,\" replied the holy martyr, \"but such as you have injured the realm. The blessed Gospel of Christ is what I hold; that do I believe, that have I taught, and that will I never revoke!\" Mr. Saunders then slowly moved towards the fire, sank to the earth and prayed; he then rose up, embraced the stake, and frequently said, \"Welcome, thou cross of Christ! welcome everlasting life!\" Fire was then put to the fagots, and, he was overwhelmed by the dreadful flames, and sweetly slept in the Lord Jesus.The History, Imprisonment, and Examination of Mr. John Hooper, Bishop of Worcester and GloucesterJohn Hooper, student and graduate in the University of Oxford, was stirred with such fervent desire to the love and knowledge of the Scriptures that he was compelled to move from thence, and was retained in the house of Sir Thomas Arundel, as his steward, until Sir Thomas had intelligence of his opinions and religion, which he in no case did favor, though he exceedingly favored his person and condition and wished to be his friend. Mr. Hooper now prudently left Sir Thomas' house and arrived at Paris, but in a short time returned to England, and was retained by Mr. Sentlow, until the time that he was again molested and sought for, when he passed through France to the higher parts of Germany; where, commencing acquaintance with learned men, he was by them free and lovingly entertained, both at Basel, and especially at Zurich, by Mr. Bullinger, who was his singular friend; here also he married his wife, who was a Burgonian, and applied very studiously to the Hebrew tongue.\n\nAt length, when God saw it good to stay the bloody time of the six articles, and to give us King Edward to reign over this realm, with some peace and rest unto the Church, amongst many other English exiles, who then repaired homeward, Mr. Hooper also, moved in conscience, thought not to absent himself, but seeing such a time and occasion, offered to help forward the Lord's work, to the uttermost of his ability.\n\nWhen Mr. Hooper had taken his farewell of Mr. Bullinger, and his friends in Zurich, he repaired again to England in the reign of King Edward VI, and coming to London, used continually to preach, most times twice, or at least once a day.\n\nIn his sermons, according to his accustomed manner, he corrected sin, and sharply inveighed against the iniquity of the world and the corrupt abuses of the Church. The people in great flocks and companies daily came to hear his voice, as the most melodious sound and tune of Orpheus' harp, insomuch, that oftentimes when he was preaching, the church would be so full that none could enter farther than the doors thereof. In his doctrine he was earnest, in tongue eloquent, in the Scriptures perfect, in pains indefatigable, in his life exemplary.\n\nHaving preached before the king's majesty, he was soon after made bishop of Gloucester. In that office he continued two years, and behaved himself so well that his very enemies could find no fault with him, and after that he was made bishop of Worcester.\n\nDr. Hooper executed the office of a most careful and vigilant pastor, for the space of two years and more, as long as the state of religion in King Edward's time was sound and flourishing.\n\nAfter he had been cited to appear before Bonner and Dr. Heath, he was led to the Council, accused falsely of owing the queen money, and in the next year, 1554, he wrote an account of his severe treatment during near eighteen months' confinement in the Fleet, and after his third examination, January 28, 1555, at St. Mary Overy's, he, with the Rev. Mr. Rogers, was conducted to the Compter in Southwark, there to remain until the next day at nine o'clock, to see whether they would recant. \"Come, Brother Rogers,\" said Dr. Hooper, \"must we two take this matter first in hand, and begin to fry in these fagots?\" \"Yes, Doctor,\" said Mr. Rogers, \"by God's grace.\" \"Doubt not,\" said Dr. Hooper, \"but God will give us strength;\" and the people so applauded their constancy that they had much ado to pass.\n\nJanuary 29, Bishop Hooper was degraded and condemned, and the Rev. Mr. Rogers was treated in like manner. At dark, Dr. Hooper was led through the city to Newgate; notwithstanding this secrecy, many people came forth to their doors with lights, and saluted him, praising God for his constancy.\n\nDuring the few days he was in Newgate, he was frequently visited by Bonner and others, but without avail. As Christ was tempted, so they tempted him, and then maliciously reported that he had recanted. The place of his martyrdom being fixed at Gloucester, he rejoiced very much, lifting up his eyes and hands to heaven, and praising God that he saw it good to send him among the people over whom he was pastor, there to confirm with his death the truth which he had before taught them.\nOn February 7, he came to Gloucester, about five o'clock, and lodged at one Ingram's house. After his first sleep, he continued in prayer ujntil morning; and all the day, except a little time at his meals, and when conversing such as the guard kindly permitted to speak to him, he spent in prayer.\n\nSir Anthony Kingston, at one time Dr. Hooper's good friend, was appointed by the queen's letters to attend at his execution. As soon as he saw the bishop he burst into tears. WIth tender entreaties he exhorted him to live. \"True it is,\" said the bishop, \"that death is bitter, and life is sweet; but alas! consider that the death to come is more bitter, and the life to come is more sweet.\"\n\nThe same day a blind boy obtained leave to be brought into Dr. Hooper's presence. The same boy, not long before, had suffered imprisonment at Gloucester for confessing the truth. \"Ah! poor boy,\" said the bishop, \"though God hath taken from thee thy outward sight, for what reason He best knoweth, yet He hath endued thy soul with the eye of knowledge and of faith. God give thee grace continually to pray unto Him, that thou lose not that sight, for then wouldst thou indeed be blind both in body and soul.\"\n\nWhen the mayor waited upon him preparatory to his execution, he expressed his perfect obedience, and only requested that a quick fire might terminate his torments. After he had got up in the morning, he desired that no man should be suffered to come into the chamber, that he might be solitary until the hour of execution.\n\nAbout eight o'clock, on February 9, 1555, he was led forth, and many thousand persons were collected, as it was market-day. All the way, being straitly charged not to speak, and beholding the people, who mourned bitterly for him, he would sometimes lift up his eyes towards heaven, and look very cheerfully upon such as he knew: and he was never known, during the time of his being among them, to look with so cheerful and ruddy a countenance as he did at that time. When he came to the place appointed where he should die, he smilingly beheld the stake and preparation made for him, which was near unto the great elm tree over against the college of priests, where he used to preach.\n\nNow, after he had entered into prayer, a box was brought and laid before him upon a stool, with his pardon from the queen, if he would turn. At the sight whereof he cried, \"If you love my soul, away with it!\" The box being taken away, Lord Chandois said, \"Seeing there is no remedy; despatch him quickly.\"\n\nCommand was now given that the fire should be kindled. But because there were not more green fagots than two horses could carry, it kindled not speedily, and was a pretty while also before it took the reeds upon the fagots. At length it burned about him, but the wind having full strength at that place, and being a lowering cold morning, it blew the flame from him, so that he was in a manner little more than touched by the fire.\n\nWithin a space after, a few dry fagots were brought, and a new fire kindled with fagots, (for there were no more reeds) and those burned at the nether parts, but had small power above, because of the wind, saving that it burnt his hair and scorched his skin a little. In the time of which fire, even as at the first flame, he prayed, saying mildly, and not very loud, but as one without pain, \"O Jesus, Son of David, have mercy upon me, and receive my soul!\" After the second fire was spent, he wiped both his eyes with his hands, and beholding the people, he said with an indifferent, loud voice, \"For God's love, good people, let me have more fire!\" and all this while his nether parts did burn; but the fagots were so few that the flame only singed his upper parts.\n\nThe third fire was kindled within a while after, which was more extreme than the other two. In this fire he prayed with a loud voice, \"Lord Jesus, have mercy upon me! Lord Jesus receive my spirit!\" And these were the last words he was heard to utter. But when he was black in the mouth, and his tongue so swollen that he could not speak, yet his lips went until they were shrunk to the gums: and he knocked his breast with his hands until one of his arms fell off, and then knocked still with the other, while the fat, water, and blood dropped out at his fingers' ends, until by renewing the fire, his strength was gone, and his hand clave fast in knocking to the iron upon his breast. Then immediately bowing forwards, he yielded up his spirit.\n\nThus was he three quarters of an hour or more in the fire.\n\nEven as a lamb, patiently he abode the extremity thereof, neither moving forwards, backwards, nor to any side; but he died as quietly as a child in his bed. And he now reigneth, I doubt not, as a blessed martyr in the joys of heaven, prepared for the faithful in Christ before the foundations of the world; for whose constancy all Christians are bound to praise God.The Life and Conduct of Dr. Rowland Taylor of HadleyDr. Rowland Taylor, vicar of Hadley, in Suffolk, was a man of eminent learning, and had been admitted to the degree of doctor of the civil and canon law.\n\nHis attachment to the pure and uncorrupted principles of Christianity recommended him to the favor and friendship of Dr. Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, with whom he lived a considerable time, until through his interest he obtained the living at Hadley.\n\nNot only was his word a preaching unto them, but all his life and conversation was an example of unfeigned Christian life and true holiness. He was void of all pride, humble and meek as any child; so that none were so poor but they might boldly, as unto their father, resort unto him; neither was his lowliness childish or fearful, but, as occasion, time, and place required, he would be stout in rebuking the sinful and evildoers; so that none was so rich but he would tell them plainly his fault, with such earnest and grave rebukes as became a good curate and pastor. He was a man very mild, void of all rancor, grudge or evil will; ready to do good to all men; readily forgiving his enemies; and never sought to do evil to any.\n\nTo the poor that were blind, lame, sick, bedrid, or that had many children, he was a very father, a careful patron, and diligent provider, insomuch that he caused the parishioners to make a general provision for them; and he himself (beside the continual relief that they always found at his house) gave an honest portion yearly to the common almsbox. His wife also was an honest, discreet, and sober matron, and his children well nurtured, brought up in the fear of God and good learning.\n\nHe was a good salt of the earth, savorly biting the corrupt manners of evil men; a light in God's house, set upon a candlestick for all good men to imitate and follow.\n\nThus continued this good shepherd among his flock, governing and leadning them through the wilderness of this wicked world, all the days of the most innocent and holy king of blessed memory, Edward VI. But on his demise, and the succession of Queen Mary to the throne, he escaped not the cloud that burst on so many besdie; for two of his parishioners, Foster, an attorney, and Clark, a tradesman, out of blind zeal, resolved that Mass should be celebrated, in all its superstitious forms, in the parish church of Hadley, on Monday before Easter. This Dr. Taylor, entering the church, strictly forbade; but Clark forced the Doctor out of the church, celebrated Mass, and immediately informed the lord-chancellor, bishop of Winchester of his behavior, who summoned him to appear, and answer the complaints that were alleged against him.\n\nThe doctor upon the receipt of the summons, cheerfully prepared to obey the same; and rejected the advice of his friends to fly beyond sea. When Gardiner saw Dr. Taylor, he, according to his common custom, reviled him. Dr. Taylor heard his abuse patiently, and when the bishop said, \"How darest thou look me in the face! knowest thou not who I am?\" Dr. Taylor replied, \"You are Dr. Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester, and lord-chancellor, and yet but a mortal man. But if I should be afraid of your lordly looks, why fear ye not God, the Lord of us all? With what countenance will you appear before the judgment seat of Christ, and answer to your oath made first unto King Henry VIII, and afterward unto King Edward VI, his son?\"\n\nA long conversation ensued, in which Dr. Taylor was so piously collected and severe upon his antagonist, that he exclaimed:\n\n\"Thou art a blasphemous heretic! Thou indeed blasphemist the blessed Sacrament, (here he put off his cap) and speakest against the holy Mass, which is made a sacrifice for the quick and the dead.\" The bishop afterward committed him into the king's bench.\n\nWhen Dr. Taylor came there, he found the virtuous and vigilant preacher of God's Word, Mr. Bradford; who equally thanked God that He had provided him with such a comfortable fellow-prisoner; and they both together praised God, and continued in prayer, reading and exhorting one another.\n\nAfter Dr. Taylor had lain some time in prison, he was cited to appear in the arches of Bow-church.\n\nDr. Taylor being condemned, was committed to the Clink, and the keepers were charged to treat him roughly; at night he was removed to the Poultry Compter.\n\nWhen Dr. Taylor had lain in the Compter about a week on the fourth of February, Bonner came to degrade him, bringing with him such ornaments as appertained to the massing mummery; but the Doctor refused these trappings until they were forced upon him.\n\nThe night after he was degraded his wife came with John Hull, his servant, and his son Thomas, and were by the gentleness of the keepers permitted to sup with him.\n\nAfter supper, walking up and down, he gave God thanks for His grace, that had given him strength to abide by His holy Word. With tears they prayed together, and kissed one another. Unto his son Thomas he gave a Latin book, containing the notable sayings of the old martyrs, and in the end of that he wrote his testament:\n\n\"I say to my wife, and to my children, The Lord gave you unto me, and the Lord hath taken me from you, and you from me: blessed be the name of the Lord! I believe that they are blessed which die in the Lord. God careth for sparrows, and for the hairs of our heads. I have ever found Him more faithful and favorable, than is any father or husband. Trust ye therefore in Him by the means of our dear Savior Christ's merits: believe, love, fear, and obey Him: pray to Him, for He hath promised to help. Count me not dead, for I shall certainly live, and never die. I go before, and you shall follow after, to our long home.\"\n\nOn the morrow the sheriff of London with his officers came to the Compter by two o'clock in the morning, and brought forth Dr. Taylor; and without any light led him to the Woolsack, an inn without Aldgate. Dr. Taylor's wife, suspecting that her husband should that night be carried away, watched all night in St. Botolph's church-porch beside Aldgate, having her two children, the one named Elizabeth, of thirteen years of age (whom, being left without father or mother, Dr. Taylor had brought up of alms from three years old), the other named Mary, Dr. Taylor's own daughter.\n\nNow, when the sheriff and his company came against St.\n\nBotolph's church, Elizabeth cried, saying, \"O my dear father! mother, mother, here is my father led away.\" Then his wife cried, \"Rowland, Rowland, where art thou?\"-for it was a very dark morning, that the one could not well see the other. Dr. Taylor answered, \"Dear wife, I am here\"; and stayed. The sheriff's men would have led him forth, but the sheriff said, \"Stay a little, masters, I pray you; and let him speak to his wife\"; and so they stayed.\n\nThen came she to him, and he took his daughter Mary in his arms; and he, his wife, and Elizabeth kneeled down and said the Lord's Prayer, at which sight the sheriff wept apace, and so did divers others of the company. After they had prayed, he rose up and kissed his wife, and shook her by the hand, and said, \"Farewell, my dear wife; be of good comfort, for I am quiet in my conscience. God shall stir up a father for my children.\"\n\nAll the way Dr. Taylor was joyful and merry, as one that ccounted himself going to a most pleasant banquet or bridal. He spake many notable things to the sheriff and yeomen of the guard that conducted him, and often moved them to weep, through his much earnest calling upon them to repent, and to amend their evil and wicked living. Oftentimes also he caused them to wonder and rejoice, to see him so constant and steadfast, void of all fear, joyful in heart, and glad to die.\n\nWhen Dr. Taylor had arrived at Aldham Common, the place where he should suffer, seeing a great multitude of people, he asked, \"What place is this, and what meaneth it that so much people are gathered hither?\" It was answered, \"It is Aldham Common, the place where you must suffer; and the people have come to look upon you.\" Then he said, \"Thanked be God, I am even at home\"; and he alighted from his horse and with both hands rent the hood from his head.\n\nHis head had been notched and clipped like as a man would clip a fool's; which cost the good bishop Bonner had bestowed upon him. But when the people saw his reverend and ancient face, with a long white beard, they burst out with weeping tears, and cried, saying: \"God save thee, good Dr. Taylor! Jesus Christ strengthen thee, and help thee! the Holy Ghost comfort thee!\" with such other like good wishes.\n\nWhen he had prayed, he went to the stake and kissed it, and set himself into a pitch barrel, which they had put for him to stand in, and stood with his back upright against the stake, with his hands folded together, and his eyes towards heaven, and continually prayed.\n\nThey then bound him with the chains, and having set up the fagots, one Warwick cruelly cast a fagot at him, which struck him on his head, and cut his face, sot hat the blood ran down. Then said Dr. Taylor, \"O friend, I have harm enough; what needed that?\"\n\nSir John Shelton standing by, as Dr. Taylor was speaking, and saying the Psalm Miserere in English, struck him on the lips:\n\n\"You knave,\" he said, \"speak Latin: I will make thee.\" At last they kindled the fire; and Dr. Taylor holding up both his hands, calling upon God, and said, \"Merciful Father of heaven! for Jesus Christ, my Savior's sake, receive my soul into Thy hands!\" So he stood still without either crying or moving, with his hands folded together, until Soyce, with a halberd struck him on the head until his brains fell out, and the corpse fell down into the fire.\n\nThus rendered up this man of God his blessed soul into the hands of his merciful Father, and to his most dear Savior Jesus Christ, whom he most entirely loved, faithfully and earnestly preached, obediently followed in living, and constantly glorified in death.Martyrdom of William HunterWilliam Hunter had been trained to the doctrines of the Reformation from his earliest youth, being descended from religious parents, who carefully instructed him in the principles of true religion.\n\nHunter, then nineteen years of age, refusing to receive the communion at Mass, was threatened to be brought before the bishop; to whom this valiant young martyr was conducted by a constable.\n\nBonner caused William to be brought into a chamber, where he began to reason with him, proimising him security and pardon if he would recant. Nay, he would have been content if he would have gone only to receive and to confession, but William would not do so for all the world.\n\nUpon this the bishop commanded his men to put William in the stocks in his gate house, where he sat two days and nights, with a crust of brown bread and a cup of water only, which he did not touch.\n\nAt the two days' end, the bishop came to him, and finding him steadfast in the faith, sent him to the convict prison, and commanded the keeper to lay irons upon him as many as he could bear. He continued in prison three quarters of a year, during which time he had been before the bishop five times, besides the time when he was condemned in the consistory in St. Paul's, February 9, at which time his brother, Robert Hunter, was present.\n\nThen the bishop, calling William, asked him if he would recant, and finding he was unchangeable, pronounced sentence upon him, that he should go from that place to Newgate for a time, and thence to Brentwood, there to be burned.\n\nAbout a month afterward, William was sent down to Brentwood, where he was to be executed. On coming to the stake, he knelt down and read the Fifty-first Psalm, until he came to these words, \"The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God, Thou wilt not despise.\" Steadfast in refusing the queen's pardon, if he would become an apostate, at length one Richard Ponde, a bailiff, came, and made the chain fast about him.\n\nWilliam now cast his psalter into his brother's hand, who said, \"William, think on the holy passion of Christ, and be not afraid of death.\" \"Behold,\" answered William, \"I am not afraid.\" Then he lifted up his hands to heaven, and said, \"Lord, Lord, Lord, receive my spirit;\" and casting down he head again into the smothering smoke, he yielded up his life for the truth, sealing it with his blood to the praise of God.Dr. Robert FarrarThis worthy and learned prelate, the bishop of St. David's in Wales, having in the former reign, as well as since the accession of Mary, been remarkably zealous in promoting the reformed doctrines, and exploding the rrors of popish idolatry, was summoned, among others, before the persecuting bishop of Winchester, and other commissioners set apart for the abominable work of devastation and massacre.\n\nHis principal accusers and persecutors, on a charge of praemunire in the reign of Edward VI were George Constantine Walter, his servant; Thomas Young, chanter of the cathedral, afterward bishop of Bangor, etc. Dr. Farrar ably replied to the copies of information laid against him, consisting of fifty-six articles. The whole process of this trial was long and tedious. Delay succeeded delay, and after that Dr. Farrar had been long unjustly detained in custody under sureties, in the reign of King Edward, because he had been promoted by the duke of Somerset, whence after his fall he found fewer friends to support him against such as wanted his bishopric by the coming in of Queen Mary, he was accused and examined not for any matter of praemunire, but for his faith and doctrine; for which he was called before the bishop of Winchester with Bishop Hooper, Mr. Rogers, Mr. Bradford, Mr. Saunders, and others, February 4, 1555; on which day he would also with them have been condemned, but his condemnation was deferred, and he sent to prison again, where he continued until February 14, and then was sent into Wales to receive sentence. He was six times brought up before Henry Morgan, bishop of St. David's, who demanded if he would abjure; from which he zealously dissented, and appealed to Cardinal Pole; notwithstanding which, the bishop, proceeding in his rage, pronounced him a heretic excommunicate, and surrendered him to the secular power.\n\nDr. Farrar, being condemned and degraded, was not long after brought to the place of execution in the town of Carmathen, in the market-place of which, on the south side of the market-cross, March 30, 1555, being Saturday next before Passion Sunday, he most constantly sustained the torments of the fire.\n\nConcerning his constancy, it is said that one Richard Jones, a knight's son, coming to Dr. Farrar a little before his death, seemed to lament the painfulness of the death he had to suffer; to whom the bishop answered that if he saw him once stir in the pains of his burning, he might then give no credit to his doctrine; and as he said, so did he maintain his promise, patiently standing without emotion, until one Richard Gravell with a staff struck him down.Martyrdom of Rawlins WhiteRawlins White was by his calling and occupation a fisherman, living and continuing in the said trade for the space of twenty years at least, in the town of Cardiff, where he bore a very good name amongst his neighbors.\n\nThough the good man was altogether unlearned, and withal very simple, yet it pleased God to remove him from error and idolatry to a knowledge of the truth, through the blessed Reformation in Edward's reign. He had his son taught to read English, and after the little boy could read pretty well, his father every night after supper, summer and winter, made the boy read a portion of the Holy Scriptures, and now and then a part of some other good book.\n\nWhen he had continued in his profession the space of five years, King Edward died, upon whose decease Queen Mary succeeded and with her all kinds of superstition crept in. White was taken by the officers of the town, as a man suspected of heresy, brought before the Bishop Llandaff, and committed to prison in Chepstow, and at last removed to the castle of Cardiff, where he continued for the space of one whole year. Being brought before the bishop in his chapel, he counselled him by threats and promises. But as Rawlins would in no wise recant his opinions, the bishop told him plainly that he must proceed against him by law, and condemn him as a heretic.\n\nBefore they proceeded to this extremity, the bishop proposed that prayer should be said for his conversion. \"This,\" said White, \"is like a godly bishop, and if your request be godly and right, and you pray as you ought, no doubt God will hear you; pray you, therefore, to your God, and I will pray to my God.\" After the bishop and his party had done praying, he asked Rawlins if he would now revoke. \"You find,\" said the latter, \"your prayer is not granted, for I remain the same; and God will strengthen me in support of this truth.\" After this, the bishop tried what saying Mass would do; but Rawlins called all the people to witness that he did not bow down to the host. Mass being ended, Rawlins was called for again; to whom the bishop used many persuasions; but the blessed man continued so steadfast in his former profession that the bishop's discourse was to no purpose. The bishop now caused the definitive sentence to be read, which being ended, Rawlins was carried again to Cardiff, to a loathsome prison in the town, called Cockmarel, where he passed his time in prayer, and in the singing of Psalms. In about three weeks the order came from town for his execution.\n\nWhen he came to the place, where his poor wife and children stood weeping, the sudden sight of them so pierced his heart, that the tears trickled down his face. Being come to the altar of his sacrifice, in going toward the stake, he fell down upon his knees, and kissed the ground; and in rising again, a little earth sticking on his face, he said these words. \"Earth unto earth, and dust unto dust; thou art my mother, and unto thee I shall return.\"\n\nWhen all things were ready, directly over against the stake, in the face of Rawlins White, there was a stand erected, whereon stepped up a priest, addressing himself to the people, but, as he spoke of the Romish doctrines of the Sacraments, Rawlins cried out, \"Ah! thou wicked hypocrite, dost thou presume to prove thy false doctrine by Scripture? Look in the text that followeth; did not Christ say, 'Do this in remembrance of me?'\"\n\nThen some that stood by cried out, \"Put fire! set on fire!\" which being done, the straw and reeds cast up a great and sudden flame. In which flame this good man bathed his hands so long, until such time as the sinews shrank, and the fat dropped away, saving that once he did, as it were, wipe his face with one of them. All this while, which was somewhat long, he cried with a loud voice, \"O Lord, receive my spirit!\" until he could not open his mouth. At last the extremity of the fire was so vehement against his legs that they were consumed almost before the rest of his body was hurt, which made the whole body fall over the chains into the fire sooner than it would have done. Thus died this good old man for his testimony of God's truth, and is now rewarded, no doubt, with the crown of eternal life.The Rev. George MarshGeorge Marsh, born in the parish of Deane, in the county of Lancaster, received a good education and trade from his parents; about his twenty-fifth year he married, and lived, blessed with several children, on his farm until his wife died. He then went to study at Cambridge, and became the curate of Rev. Lawrence Saunders, in which duty he constantly and zealously set forth the truth of God's Word, and the false doctrines of the modern Antichrist.\n\nBeing confined by Dr. Coles, the bishop of Chester, within the precincts of his own house, he was dept from any intercourse with his friends during four months; his friends and mother, earnestly wished him to have flown from \"the wrath to come;\" but Mr. Marsh thought that such a step would ill agree with that profession he had during nine years openly made. He, however, secreted himself, but he had much struggling, and in secret prayer begged that God would direct him, through the advice of his best friends, for his own glory and to what was best. At length, determined by a letter he received, boldly to confess the faith of Christ, he took leave of his mother-in-law and other friends, recommending his children to their care and departed for Smethehills, whence he was, with others, conducted to Lathum, to undergo examination before the earl of Derby, Sir William Nores, Mr. Sherburn, the parson of Garpnal, and others. The various questions put to him he answered with a good conscience, but when Mr. Sherburn interrogated him upon his belief of the Sacrament of the altar, Mr. Marsh answered like a true Protestant that the essence of the bread and wine was not at all changed, hence, after receiving dreadful threats from some, and fair words from others, for his opinions, he was remanded to ward, where he lay two nights without any bed.\n\nOn Palm Sunday he underwent a second examination, and Mr.\n\nMarsh much lamented that his fear should at all have induced him to prevaricate, and to seek his safety, as long as he did not openly deny Christ; and he again cried more earnestly to God for strength that he might not be overcome by the subtleties of those who strove to overrule the purity of his faith. He underwent three examinations before Dr. Coles, who, finding him steadfast in the Protestant faith, began to read his sentence; but he was interrupted by the chancellor, who prayed the bishop to stay before it was too late. The priest then prayed for Mr. Marsh, but the latter, upon being again solicited to recant, said he durst not deny his Savior Christ, lest he lose His everlasting mercy, and so obtain eternal death. The bishop then proceeded in the sentence. He was committed to a dark dungeon, and lay deprived of the consolation of any one (for all were afraid to relieve or communicate with him) until the day appointed came that he should suffer. The sheriffs of the city, Amry and Couper, with their officers, went to the north gate, and took out Mr. George Marsh, who walked all the way with the Book in his hand, looking upon the same, whence the people said, \"This man does not go to his death as a thief, nor as one that deserveth to die.\"\n\nWhen he came to the place of execution without the city, near Spittal=Boughton, Mr. Cawdry, deputy chamberlain of Chester, showed Mr. Marsh a writing under a great seal, saying that it was a pardon for him if he would recant. He answered that he would gladly accept the same did it not tend to pluck him from God.\n\nAfter that, he began to speak to the people showing the cause of his death, and would have exhorted them to stick unto Christ, but one of the sheriffs prevented him. Kneeling down, he then said his prayers, put off his clothes unto his shirt, and was chained to the post, having a number of fagots under him, and a thing made like a firkin, with pitch and tar in it, over his head. The fire being unskilfully made, and the wind driving it in eddies, he suffered great extremity, which notwithstanding he bore with Christian fortitude.\n\nWhen he had been a long time tormented in the fire without moving, having his flesh so broiled and puffed up that they who stood before him could not see the chain wherewith he was fastened, and therefore supposed that he had been dead, suddenly he spread abroad his arms, saying, \"Father of heaven have mercy upon me!\" and so yielded his spirit into the hands of the Lord. Upon this, many of the people said he was a martyr, and died gloriously patient. This caused the bishop shortly after to make a sermon in the cathedral church, and therein he affirmed, that the said 'Marsh was a heretic, burnt as such, and is a firebrand in hell.' Mr. Marsh suffered April 24, 1555.William FlowerWilliam Flower, otherwise Branch, was born at Snow-hill, in the county of Cambridge, where he went to school some years, and then came to the abby of Ely. After he had remained a while he became a professed monk, was made a priest in the same house, and there celebrated and sang Mass. After that, by reason of a visitation, and certain injunctions by the authority of Henry VIII he took upon him the habit of a secular priest, and returned to Snow-hill, where he was born, and taught children about half a year.\n\nHe then went to Ludgate, in Suffolk, and served as a secular priest about a quarter of a year; from thence to Stoniland; at length to Tewksbury, where he married a wife, with whom he ever after faithfully and honestly continued. After marriage he resided at Tewksbury about two years, and thence went to Brosley, where he practiced physic and surgery; but departing from those parts he came to London, and finally settled at Lambeth, where he and his wife dwelt together. However, he was generally abroad, excepting once or twice in a month, to visit and see his wife. Being at home upon Easter Sunday morning, he came over the water from lambeth into St. Margaret's Church at Westminster; when seeing a priest, named John Celtham, administering and giving the Sacrament of the alter to the people, and being greatly offended in his conscience with the priest for the same, he struck and wounded him upon the head, and also upon the arm and hand, with his wood knife, the priest having at the same time in his hand a chalice with the consecrated host therein, which became sprinkled with blood.\n\nMr. Flower, for this injudicious zeal, was heavily ironed, and put into the gatehouse at Westminster; and afterward summoned before bishop Bonner and his ordinary, where the bishop, after he had sworn him upon a Book, ministered articles and interrogatories to him.\n\nAfter examination, the bishop began to exhort him again to return to the unity of his mother the Catholic Church, with many fair promises. These Mr. Flower steadfastly rejecting, the bishop ordered him to appear in the same place in the afternoon, and in the meantime to consider well his former answer; but he, neither apologizing for having struck the priest, nor swerving from his faith, the bishop assigned him the next day, April 20, to receive sentence if he would not recant. The next morning, the bishop accordingly proceeded to the sentence, condemning and excommunicating him for a heretic, and after pronouncing him to be degraded, committed him to the secular power.\n\nOn April 24, St. Mark's eve, he was brought to the place of martyrdom, in St. Margaret's churchyard, Westminster, where the fact was committed: and there coming to the stake, he prayed to Almighty God, made a confession of his faith, and forgave all the world.\n\nThis done, his hand was held up against the stake, and struck off, his left hand being fastened behind him. Fire was then set to him, and he burning therein, cried with a loud voice, \"O Thou Son of God receive my soul!\" three times. His speech being now taken from him, he spoke no more, but notwithstanding he lifted up the stump with his other arm as long as he could.\n\nThus he endured the extremity of the fire, and was cruelly tortured, for the few fagots that were brought being insufficient to burn him they were compelled to strike him down into the fire, where lying along upon the ground, his lower part was consumed in the fire, whilst his upper part was little injured, his tongue moving in his mouth for a considerable time.The Rev. John Cardmaker and John WarneMay 30, 1555, the Rev. John Cardmaker, otherwise called Taylor, prebendary of the Church of Wells, and John Warne, upholsterer, of St. John's, Walbrook, suffered together in Smithfield. Mr. Cardmaker, who first was an observant friar before the dissolution of the abbeys, afterward was a married minister, and in King Edward's time appointed to be a reader in St. Paul's; being apprehended in the beginning of Queen Mary's reign, with Dr. Barlow, bishop of Bath, he was brought to London, and put in the Fleet prison, King Edward's laws being yet in force. In Mary's reign, when brought before the bishop of Winchester, the latter offered them the queen's mercy, if they would recant.\n\nArticles having been preferred against Mr. John Warne, he was examined upon them by Bonner, who earnestly exhorted him to recant his opinions, to whom he answered, \"I am persuaded that I am in the right opinion, and I see no cause to recant; for all the filthiness and idolatry lies in the Church of Rome.\"\n\nThe bishop then, seeing that all his fair promises and terrible threatenings could not prevail, pronounced the definitive sentence of condemnation, and ordered May 30, 1555, for the execution of John Cardmaker and John Warne, who were brought by the sheriffs to Smithfield. Being come to the stake, the sheriffs called Mr. Cardmaker aside, and talked with him secretly, during which Mr. Warne prayed, was chained to the stake, and had wood and reeds set about him.\n\nThe people were greatly afflicted, thinking that Mr. Cardmaker would recant at the burning of Mr. Warne. At length Mr. Cardmaker departed from the sheriffs, and came towards the stake, knelt down, and made a long prayer in silence to himself. He then rose up, put off his clothes to his shirt, and went with a bold courage unto the stake and kissed it; and taking Mr. Warne by the hand, he heartily comforted him, and was bound to the stake, rejoicing. The people seeing this so suddenly done, contrary to their previous expectation, cried out, \"God be praised! the Lord strengthen thee, Cardmaker! the Lord Jesus receive thy spirit!\" And this continued while the executioner put fire to them, and both had passed through the fire to the blessed rest and peace among God's holy saints and martyrs, to enjoy the crown of triumph and victory prepared for the elect soldiers and warriors of Christ Jesus in His blessed Kingdom, to whom be glory and majesty forever. Amen.John Simpson and John ArdeleyJohn Simpson and John Ardeley were condemned on the same day with Mr. Carmaker and John Warne, which was the twenty-fifth of May. They were shortly after sent down from London to Essex, where they were burnt in one day, John Simpson at Rochford, and John Ardeley at Railey, glorifying God in His beloved Son, and rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer.Thomas Haukes, Thomas Watts, and Anne AskewThomas Haukes, with six others, was condemned on the ninth of February, 1555. In education he was erudite; in person, comely, and of good stature; in manners, a gentleman, and a sincere Christian. A little before death, several of Mr. Hauke's friends, terrified by the sharpness of the punishment he was going to suffer, privately desired that in the midst of the flames he should show them some token, whether the pains of burning were so great that a man might not collectedly endure it. This he promised to do; and it was agreed that if the rage of the pain might be suffered, then he should lift up his hands above his head towards heaven, before he gave up the ghost.\n\nNot long after, Mr. Haukes was led away to the place appointed for slaughter by Lord Rich, and being come to the stake, mildly and patiently prepared himself for the fire, having a strong chain cast about his middle, with a multitude of people on every side compassing him about, unto whom after he had spoken many things, and poured out his soul unto God, the fire was kindled.\n\nWhen he had continued long in it, and his speech was taken away by violence of the flame, his skin drawn together, and his fingers consumed with the fire, so that it was thought that he was gone, suddenly and contrary to all expectation, this good man being mindful of his promise, reached up his hands burning in flames over his head to the living God, and with great rejoicings as it seemed, struck or clapped them three times together. A great shout followed this wonderful circumstance, and then this blessed martyr of Christ, sinking down in the fire, gave up his spirit, June 10, 1555.\n\nThomas Watts, of Billerica, in Essex, of the diocese of London, was a linen draper. He had daily expected to be taken by God's adversaries, and this came to pass on the fifth of April, 1555, when he was brought before Lord Rich, and other commissioners at Chelmsford, and accused for not coming to the church.\n\nBeing consigned over to the bloody bishop, who gave him several hearings, and, as usual, many arguments, with much entreaty, that he would be a disciple of Antichrist, but his preaching availed not, and he resorted to his last revenge-that of condemnation.\n\nAt the stake, after he had kissed it, he spake to Lord Rich, charging him to repent, for the Lord would revenge his death. Thus did this good martyr offer his body to the fire, in defence of the true Gospel of the Savior.\n\nThomas Osmond, William Bamford, and Nicholas Chamberlain, all of the town of Coxhall, being sent up to be examined, Bonner, after several hearings, pronounced them obstinate heretics, and delivered them to the sheriffs, in whose custody they remained until they were delivered to the sheriff of Essex county, and by him were executed, Chamberlain at Colchester, the fourteenth of June; Thomas Osmond at Maningtree, and William Bamford, alias Butler, at Harwich, the fifteenth of June, 1555; all dying full of the glorious hope of immortality.\n\nThen Wriotheseley, lord chancellor, offered Anne Askew the king's pardon if she would recant; who made this answer, that she came not thither to deny her Lord and Master. And thus the good Anne Askew, being compassed in with flames of fire, as a blessed sacrifice unto God, slept in the Lord, A.D. 1546, leaving behind her a singular example of Christian constancy for all men to follow.Rev. John Bradford, and John Leaf, an ApprenticeRev. John Bradford was born at Manchester, in Lancashire; he was a good Latin scholar, and afterward became a servant of Sir John Harrington, knight.\n\nHe continued several years in an honest and thriving way; but the Lord had elected him to a better function. Hence he departed from his master, quitting the Temple, at London, for the University of Cambridge, to learn, by God's law, how to further the building of the Lord's temple. In a few years after, the university gave him the degree of master of arts, and he became a fellow of Pembroke Hall.\n\nMartin Bucer first urged him to preach, and when he modestly doubted his ability, Bucer was wont to reply, \"If thou hast not fine wheat bread, yet give the poor people barley bread, or whatsoever else the Lord hath committed unto thee.\" Dr. Ridley, that worthy bishop of London, and glorious martyr of Christ, first called him to take the degree of a deacon and gave him a prebend in his cathedral Church of St. Paul.\n\nIn this preaching office Mr. Bradford diligently labored for the space of three years. Sharply he reproved sin, sweetly he preached Christ crucified, ably he disproved heresies and errors, earnestly he persuaded to godly life. After the death of blessed King Edward VI Mr. Bradford still continued diligent in preaching, until he was suppressed by Queen Mary.\n\nAn act now followed of the blackest ingratitude, and at which a pagan would blush. It has been recited, that a tumult was occasioned by Mr. Bourne's (then bishop of Bath) preaching at St. Paul's Cross; the indignation of the people placed his life in imminent danger; indeed a dagger was thrown at him. In this situation he entreated Mr. Bradford, who stood behind him. to speak in his place, and assuage the tumult. The people welcomed Mr. Bradford, and the latter afterward kept close to him, that his presence might prevent the populace from renewing their assaults.\n\nThe same Sunday in the afternoon, Mr. Bradford preached at Bow Church in Cheapside, and reproved the people sharply for their seditious misdemeanor. Notwithstanding this conduct, within three days after, he was sent for to the Tower of London, where the queen then was, to appear before the Council. There he was charged with this act of saving Mr. Bourne, which was called seditious, and they also objected against him for preaching. Thus he was committed, first to the Tower, then to other prisons, and, after his condemnation, to the Poultry Compter, where he preached twice a day continually, unless sickness hindered him. Such as his credit with the keeper of the king's Bench, that he permitted him in an evening to visit a poor, sick person near the steel-yard, upon his promise to return in time, and in this he never failed.\n\nThe night before he was sent to Newgate, he was troubled in his sleep by foreboding dreams, that on Monday after he should be burned in Smithfield. In the afternoon the keeper's wife came up and announced this dreadful news to him, but in him it excited only thankfulness to God. At night half a dozen friends came, with whom he spent all the evening in prayer and godly exercises.\n\nWhen he was removed to Newgate, a weeping crowd accompanied him, and a rumor having been spread that he was to suffer at four the next morning, an immense multitude attended. At nine o'clock Mr. Bradford was brought into Smithfield. The cruelty of the sheriff deserves notice; for his brother-in-law, Roger Beswick, having taken him by the hand as he passed, Mr. Woodroffe, with his staff, cut his head open.\n\nMr. Bradford, being come to the place, fell flat on the ground, and putting off his clothes unto the shirt, he went to the stake, and there suffered with a young man of twenty years of age, whose name was John Leaf, an apprentice to Mr. Humphrey Gaudy, tallow-chandler, of Christ-church, London. Upon Friday before Palm Sunday, he was committed to the Compter in Bread-street, and afterward examined and condemned by the bloody bishop.\n\nIt is reported of him, that, when the bill of his confession was read unto him, instead of pen, he took a pin, and pricking his hand, sprinkled the blood upon the said bill, desiring the reader thereof to show the bishop that he had sealed the same bill with his blood already.\n\nThey both ended this mortal life, July 12, 1555, like two lambs, without any alteration of their countenances, hoping to obtain that prize they had long run for; to which may Almighty God conduct us all, through the merits of Christ our Savior!\n\nWe shall conclude this article with mentioning that Mr.\n\nSheriff Woodroffe, it is said, within half a year after, was struck on the right side with a palsy, and for the space of eight years after, (until his dying day,) he was unable to turn himself in his bed; thus he became at last a fearful object to behold.\n\nThe day after Mr. Bradford and John Leaf suffered in Smithfield William Minge, priest, died in prison at Maidstone. With as great constancy and boldness he yielded up his life in prison, as if it had pleased God to have called him to suffer by fire, as other godly men had done before at the stake, and as he himself was ready to do, had it pleased God to have called him to this trial.Rev. John Bland, Rev. John Frankesh, Nicholas Shetterden, and Humphrey MiddletonThese Christian persons were all burnt at Canterbury for the same cause. Frankesh and Bland were ministers and preachers of the Word of God, the one being parson of Adesham, and the other vicar of Rolvenden. Mr. Bland was cited to answer for his opposition to antichristianism, and underwent several examinations before Dr. Harpsfield, archdeacon of Canterbury, and finally on the twenty-fifth of June, 1555, again withstanding the power of the pope, he was condemned, and delivered to the secular arm. On the same day were condemned John Frankesh, Nicholas Shetterden, Humphrey Middleton, Thacker, and Crocker, of whom Thacker only recanted.\n\nBeing delivered to the secular power, Mr. Bland, with the three former, were all burnt together at Canterbury, July 12, 1555, at two several stakes, but in one fire, when they, in the sight of God and His angels, and before men, like true soldiers of Jesus Christ, gave a constant testimony to the truth of His holy Gospel.Dirick Carver and John LaunderThe twenty-second of July, 1555, Dirick Carver, brewer, of Brighthelmstone, aged forty, was burnt at Lewes. And the day following John Launder, husbandman, aged twenty-five, of Godstone, Surrey, was burnt at Stening.\n\nDirick Carver was a man whom the Lord had blessed as well with temporal riches as with his spiritual treasures. At his coming into the town of Lewes to be burnt, the people called to him, beseeching God to strengthen him in the faith of Jesus Christ; and, as he came to the stake, he knelt down, and prayed earnestly. Then his Book was thrown into the barrel, and when he had stripped himself, he too, went into a barrel. As soon as he was in, he took the Book, and threw it among the people, upon which the sheriff commanded, in the name of the king and queen, on pain of death , to throw in the Book again. And immediately the holy martyr began to address the people. After he had prayed a while, he said, \"O Lord my God, Thou hast written, he that will not forsake wife, children, house, and every thing that he hath, and take up Thy cross and follow Thee, is not worthy of Thee! but Thou, Lord, knowest that I have forsaken all to come unto Thee. Lord, have mercy upon me, for unto Thee I commend my spirit! and my soul doth rejoice in Thee!\" These were the last words of this faithful servant of Christ before enduring the fire. And when the fire came to him, he cried, \"O Lord, have mercy upon me!\" and sprang up in the fire, calling upon the name of Jesus, until he gave up the ghost.\n\nJames Abbes. This young man wandered about to escape apprehension, but was at last informed against, and brought before the bishop of Norwich, who influenced him to recant; to secure him further in apostasy, the bishop afterward gave him a piece of money; but the interference of Providence is here remarkable. This bribe lay so heavily upon his conscience, that he returned, threw back the money, and repented of his conduct. Like Peter, he was contrite, steadfast in the faith, and sealed it with his blood at Bury, August 2, 1555, praising and glorifying God.John Denley, John Newman, and Patrick PackinghamMr. Denley and Newman were returning one day to Maidstone, the place of their abode, when they were met by E. Tyrrel, Esq., a bigoted justice of the peace in Essex, and a cruel persecutor of the Protestants. He apprehended them merely on suspicion. On the fifth of July, 1555, they were condemned, and consigned to the sheriffs, who sent Mr. Denley to Uxbridge, where he perished, August eighth, 1555. While suffering in agony, and singing a Psalm, Dr. Story inhumanly ordered one of the tormentors to throw a fagot at him, which cut his face severely, caused him to cease singing, and to raise his hands to his face. Just as Dr. Story was remarking in jest that he had spoiled a good song, the pious martyr again changed, spread his hands abroad in the flames, and through Christ Jesus resigned his soul into the hands of his Maker.\n\nMr. Packingham suffered at the same town on the twenty-eigth of the same month.\n\nMr. Newman, pewterer, was burnt at Saffron Waldon, in Essex, August 31, for the same cause, and Richard Hook about the same time perished at Chichester.W. Coker, W. Hooper, H. Laurence, R. Colliar, R. Wright and W. StereThese persons all of Kent, were examined at the same time with Mr. Bland and Shetterden, by Thornton, bishop of Dover, Dr. Harpsfield, and others. These six martyrs and witnesses of the truth were consigned to the flames in Canterbury, at the end of August, 1555.\n\nElizabeth Warne, widow of John Warne, upholsterer, martyr, was burnt at Stratford-le-bow, near London, at the end of August, 1555.\n\nGeorge Tankerfield, of London, cook, born at York, aged twenty-seven, in the reign of Edward VI had been a papist; but the cruelty of bloody Mary made him suspect the truth of those doctrines which were enforced by fire and torture. Tankerfield was imprisoned in Newgate about the end of February, 1555, and on August 26, at St. Alban's, he braved the excruciating fire, and joyfully died for the glory of his Redeemer.\n\nRev. Robert Smith was first in the service of Sir T. Smith, provost of Eton; and was afterward removed to Windsor, where he had a clerkship of ten pounds a year.\n\nHe was condemned, July 12, 1555, and suffered August 8, at Uxbridge. He doubted not but that God would give the spectators some token in support of his own cause; this actually happened; for, when he was nearly half burnt, and supposed to be dead, he suddenly rose up, moved the remaining parts of his arms and praised God, then, hanging over the fire, he sweetly slept in the Lord Jesus.\n\nMr. Stephen Harwood and Mr. Thomas Fust suffered about the same time with Smith and Tankerfield, with whom they were condemned. Mr. William Hale also, of Thorp, in Essex, was sent to Barnet, where about the same time he joined the ever-blessed company of martyrs.\n\nGeorge King, Thomas Leyes, and John Wade, falling sick in Lollard's Tower, were removed to different houses, and died. Their bodies were thrown out in the common fields as unworthy of burial, and lay until the faithful conveyed them away at night.\n\nMr. William Andrew of Horseley, Essex, was imprisoned in Newgate for heresy; but God chose to call him to himself by the severe treatment he endured in Newgate, and thus to mock the snaguinary expectations of his Catholic persecutors. His body was thrown into the open air, but his soul was received into the everlasting mansions of his heavenly Creator.The Rev. Robert SamuelThis gentleman was minister ofr Bradford, Suffolk, where he industriously taught the flock committed to his charge, while he was openly permitted to discharge his duty. He was first persecuted by Mr. Foster, of Copdock, near Ipswich, a severe and bigoted persecutor of the followers of Christ, according to the truth in the Gospel. Notwithstanding Mr. Samuel was ejected from his living, he continued to exhort and instruct privately; nor would he obey the order for putting away his wife, whom he had married in King Edward's reign; but kept her at Ipswich, where Foster, by warrant, surprised him by night with her. After being imprisoned in Ipswich jail, he was taken before Dr. Hopton, bishop of Norwich, and Dr. Dunnings, his chancellor, two of the most sanguinary among the bigots of those days. To intimidate the worthy pastor, he was in prison chained to a post in such a manner that the weight of his body was supported by the points of his toes: added to this his allowance of provision was reduced to a quantity so insufficient to sustain nature that he was almost ready to devour his own flesh. From this dreadful extremity there was even a degree of mercy in ordering him to the fire. Mr. Samuel suffered August 31, 1555.Bishop Ridley and Bishop LatimerThese reverend prelates suffered October 17, 1555, at Oxford, on the same day Wolsey and Pygot perished at Ely. Pillars of the Church and accomplished ornaments of human nature, they were the admiration of the realm, amiably conspicuous in their lives, and glorious in their deaths.\n\nDr. Ridley was born in Northumberland, was first tauht grammar at Newcastle, and afterward removed to Cambridge, where his aptitude in education raised him gradually until he came to be the head of Pembroke College, where he received the title of Doctor of Divinity. Having returned from a trip to Paris, he was appointed chaplain by Henry VIII and bishop of Rochester, and was afterwards translated to the see of London in the time of Edward VI.\n\nTo his sermons the people resorted, swarming about him like bees, coveting the sweet flowers and wholesome juice of the fruitful doctrine, which he did not only preach, but showed the same by his life, as a glittering lanthorn to the eyes and senses of the blind, in such pure order that his very enemies could not reprove him in any one jot.\n\nHis tender treatment of Dr. Heath, who was a prisoner with him during one year, in Edward's reign, evidently proves that he had no Catholic cruelty in his disposition. In person he was erect and well proportioned; in temper forgiving; in self-mortification severe. His first duty in the morning was private prayer: he remained in his study until ten o'clock, and then attended the daily prayer used in his house. Dinner being done, he sat about an hour, conversing pleasantly, or playing at chess. His study next engaged his attention, unless business or visits occurred; about five o'clock prayers followed; and after he would recreate himself at chess for about an hour, then retire to his study until eleven o'clock, and pray on his knees as in the morning. In brief, he was a pattern of godliness and virtue, and such he endeavored to make men wherever he came.\n\nHis attentive kindness was displayed particularly to old Mrs. Bonner, mother of Dr. Bonner, the cruel bishop of London. Dr. Ridley, when at his manor at Fulham, always invited her to his house, placed her at the head of his table, and treated her like his own mother; he did the same by Bonner's sister and other relatives; but when Dr. Ridley was under persecution, Bonner pursued a conduct diametrically opposite, and would have sacrificed Dr. Ridley's sister and her husband, Mr. George Shipside, had not Providence delivered him by the means of Dr. Heath, bishop of Worcester.\n\nDr. Ridley was first in part converted by reading Bertram's book on the Sacrament, and by his conferences with archbishop Cranmer and Peter Martyr.\n\nWhen Edward VI was removed from the throne, and the bloody Mary succeeded, Bishop Ridley was immediately marked as an object of slaughter. He was first sent to the Tower, and afterward, at Oxford, was consigned to the common prison of Bocardo, with archbishop Cranmer and Mr. Latimer. Being separated from them, he was placed in the house of one Irish, where he remained until the day of his martyrdom, from 1554, until October 16, 1555.\n\nIt will easily be supposed that the conversations of these chiefs of the martyrs were elaborate, learned, and instructive. Such indeed they were, and equally beneficial to all their spiritual comforts. Bishop Ridley's letters to various Christian brethren in bonds in all parts, and his disputations with the mitred enemies of Christ, alike proved the clearness of his head and the integrity of his heart. In a letter to Mr. Grindal, (afterward archbishop of Canterbury,) he mentions with affection those who had preceded him in dying for the faith, and those who were expected to suffer; he regrets that popery is re-established in its full abomination, which he attributes to the wrath of God, made manifest in return for the lukewarmness of the clergy and the people in justly appreciating the blessed light of the Reformation.\n\nThis old practiced soldier of Christ, Master Hugh Latimer, was the son of one Hugh Latimer, of Thurkesson in the county of Leicester, a husbandman, of a good and wealthy estimation; where also he was born and brought up until he was four years of age, or thereabout: at which time his parents, having him as then left for their only son, with six daughters, seeing his ready, prompt, and sharp wit, purposed to train him up in erudition, and knowledge of good literature; wherein he so profited in his youth at the common schools of his own country, that at the age of fourteen years, he was sent to the University of Cambridge; where he entered into the study of the school divinity of that day, and was from principle a zealous observer of the Romish superstitions of the time. In his oration when he commenced bachelor of divinity, he inveighed against the reformer Melancthon, and openly declaimed against good Mr. Stafford, divinity lecturer in Cambridge.\n\nMr. Thomas Bilney, moved by a brotherly pity towards Mr. Latimer, begged to wait upon him in his study, and to explain to him the groundwork of his (Mr. Bilney's) faith. This blessed interview effected his conversion: the persecutor of Christ became his zealous advocate, and before Dr. Stafford died he became reconciled to him.\n\nOnce converted, he became eager for the conversion of others, and commenced to be public preacher, and private instructor in the university. His sermons were so pointed against the absurdity of praying in the Latin tongue, and withholding the oracles of salvation from the people who were to be saved by belief in them, that he drew upon himself the pulpit animadversions of several of the resident friars and heads of houses, whom he subsequently silenced by his severe criticisms and eloquent arguments. This was at Christmas, 1529. At length Dr. West preached against Mr. Latimer at Barwell Abbey, and prohibited him from preaching again in the churches of the university, notwithstanding which, he continued during three years to advocate openly the cause of Christ, and even his enemies confessed the power of those talents he possessed. Mr. Bilney remained here some time with Mr. Latimer, and thus the place where they frequently walked together obtained the name of Heretics' Hill.\n\nMr. Latimer at this time traced out the innocence of a poor woman, accused by her husband of the murder of her child. Having preached before King Henry VIII at Windsor, he obtained the unfortunate mother's pardon. This, with many other benevolent acts, served only to excite the spleen of his adversaries. He was summoned before Cardinal Wolsey for heresy, but being a strenuous supporter of the king's supremacy, in opposition to the pope's, by favor of Lord Cromwell and Dr. Buts, (the king's physician,) he obtained the living of West Kingston, in Wiltshire. For his sermons here against purgatory, the immaculacy of the Virgin, and the worship of images, he was cited to appear before Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, and John, bishop of London. He was required to subscribe certain articles, expressive of his conformity to the accustamed usages; and there is reason to think, after repeated weekly examinations, that he did subscribe, as they did not seem to involve any important article of belief.\n\nGuided by Providence, he escaped the subtle nets of his persecutors, and at length, through the powerful friends before mentioned, became bishop of Worcester, in which function he qualified or explained away most of the papal ceremonies he was for form's sake under the necessity of complying with. He continued in this active and dignified employment some years.\n\nBeginning afresh to set forth his plow he labored in the Lord's harvest most fruitfully, discharging his talent as well in divers places of this realm, as before the king at the court. In the same place of the inward garden, which was before applied to lascivious and courtly pastimes, there he dispensed the fruitful Word of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ, preaching there before the king and his whole court, to the edification of many.\n\nHe remained a prisoner in the Tower until the coronation of Edward VI, when he was again called to the Lord's harvest in Stamford, and many other places: he also preached at London in the convocation house, and before the young king; indeed he lectured twice every Sunday, regardless of his great age (then above sixty-seven years,) and his weakness through a bruise received from the fall of a tree. Indefatigable in his private studies, he rose to them in winter and in summer at two o'clock in the morning.\n\nBy the strength of his own mind, or of some inward light from above, he had a prophetic view of what was to happen to the Church in Mary's reign, asserting that he was doomed to suffer for the truth, and that Winchester, then in the Tower, was preserved for that purpose. Soon after Queen Mary was proclaimed, a messenger was sent to summon Mr. Latimer to town, and there is reason to believe it was wished that he should make his escape.\n\nThus Master Latimer coming up to London, through Smithfield (where merrily he said that Smithfield had long groaned for him), was brought before the Council, where he patiently bore all the mocks and taunts given him by the scornful papists. He was cast into the Tower, where he, being assisted with the heavenly grace of Christ, sustained imprisonment a long time, notwithstanding the cruel and unmerciful handling of the lordly papists, which thought then their kingdom would never fall; he showed himself not only patient, but also cheerful in and above all that which they could or would work against him. Yea, such a valiant spirit the Lord gave him, that he was able not only to despise the terribleness of prisons and torments, but also to laugh to scorn the doings of his enemies.\n\nMr. Latimer, after remaining a long time in the Tower, was transported to Oxford, with Cranmer and Ridley, the disputations at which place have been already mentioned in a former part of this work. He remained imprisoned until October, and the principal objects of all his prayers were three-that he might stand faithful to the doctrine he had professed, that God would restore his Gospel to England once again, and preserve the Lady Elizabeth to be queen; all of which happened. When he stood at the stake without the Bocardo gate, Oxford, with Dr. Ridley, and fire was putting to the pile of fagots, he raised his eyes benignantly towards heaven, and said, \"God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able.\" His body was forcibly penetrated by the fire, and the blood flowed abundantly from the heart; as if to verify his constant desire that his heart's blood might be shed in defence of the Gospel. His polemical and friendly letters are lasting monuments of his integrity and talents. It has been before said, that public disputation took place in April, 1554, new examinations took place in October, 1555, previous to the degradation and condemnation of Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer. We now draw to the conclusion of the lives of the two last.\n\nDr. Ridley, the night before execution, was very facetious, had himself shaved, and called his supper a marriage feast; he remarked upon seeing Mrs. Irish (the keeper's wife) weep, \"Though my breakfast will be somewhat sharp, my supper will be more pleasant and sweet.\"\n\nThe place of death was on the northside of the town, opposite Baliol College. Dr. Ridley was dressed in a black gown furred, and Mr. Latimer had a long shroud on, hanging down to his feet. Dr. Ridley, as he passed Bocardo, looked up to see Dr. Cranmer, but the latter was then engaged in disputation with a friar. When they came to the stake, Mr. Ridley embraced Latimer fervently, and bid him: \"Be of good heart, brother, for God will either assuage the fury of the flame, or else strengthen us to abide it.\" He then knelt by the stake, and after earnestly praying together, they had a short private conversation. Dr. Smith then preached a short sermon against the martyrs, who would have answered him, but were prevented by Dr. Marshal, the vice-chancellor. Dr. Ridley then took off his gown and tippet, and gave them to his brother-in-law, Mr. Shipside. He gave away also many trifles to his weeping friends, and the populace were anxious to get even a fragment of his garments. Mr. Latimer gave nothing, and from the poverty of his garb, was soon stripped to his shroud, and stood venerable and erect, fearless of death.\n\nDr. Ridley being unclothed to his shirt, the smith placed an iron chain about their waists, and Dr. Ridley bid him fasten it securely; his brother having tied a bag of gunpowder about his neck, gave some also to Mr. Latimer.\n\nDr. Ridley then requested of Lord Williams, of Fame, to advocate with the queen the cause of some poor men to whom he had, when bishop, granted leases, but which the present bishop refused to confirm. A lighted fagot was now laid at Dr. Ridley's feet, which caused Mr. Latimer to say: \"Be of good cheer, Ridley; and play the man. We shall this day, by God's grace, light up such a candle in England, as I trust, will never be put out.\"\n\nWhen Dr. Ridley saw the fire flaming up towards him, he cried with a wonderful loud voice, \"Lord, Lord, receive my spirit.\" Master Latimer, crying as vehemently on the other side, \"O Father of heaven, receive my soul!\" received the flame as it were embracing of it. After that he had stroked his face with his hands, and as it were, bathed them a little in the fire, he soon died (as it appeareth) with very little pain or none.\n\nWell! dead they are, and the reward of this world they have already. What reward remaineth for them in heaven, the day of the Lord's glory, when he cometh with His saints, shall declare.\n\nIn the following month died Stephen Gardiner, bishop of Winchester and lord chancellor of England. This papistical monster was born at Bury, in Suffolk, and partly educated at Cambridge. Ambitious, cruel, and bigoted, he served any cause; he first espoused the king's part in the affair of Anne Boleyn: upon the establishment of the Reformation he declared the supremacy of the pope an execrable tenet; and when Queen Mary came to the crown, he entered into all her papistical bigoted views, and became a second time bishop of Winchester. It is conjectured it was his intention to have moved the sacrifice of Lady Elizabeth, but when he arrived at this point, it pleased God to remove him.\n\nIt was on the afternoon of the day when those faithful soldiers of Christ, Ridley and Latimer, perished, that Gardiner sat down with a joyful heart to dinner. Scarcely had he taken a few mouthfuls, when he was seized with illness, and carried to his bed, where he lingered fifteen days in great torment, unable in any wise to evacuate, and burnt with a devouring fever, that terminated in death. Execrated by all good Christians, we pray the Father of mercies, that he may receive that mercy above he never imparted below.Mr. John PhilpotThis martyr was the son of a knight, born in Hampshire, and brought up at New College, Oxford, where for several years he studied the civil law, and became eminent in the Hebrew tongue. He was a scholar and a gentleman, zealous in religion, fearless in disposition, and a detester of flattery. After visiting Italy, he returned to England, affairs in King Edward's days wearing a more promising aspect. During this reign he continued to be archdeacon of Winchester under Dr. Poinet, who succeeded Gardiner. Upon the accession of Mary, a convocation was summoned, in which Mr. Philpot defended the Reformation against his ordinary, Gardiner, again made bishop of Winchester, and soon was conducted to Bonner and other commissioners for examination, October 2, 1555, after being eighteen months' imprisoned. Upon his demanding to see the commission, Dr. Story cruelly observed, \"I will spend both my gown and my coat, but I will burn thee! Let him be in Lollard's tower, (a wretched prison,) for I will sweep the king's Bench and all other prisons of these heretics!\"\n\nUpon Mr. Philpot's second examination, it was intimated to him that Dr. Story had said that the lord chancellor had commanded that he should be made away with. It is easy to foretell the result of this inquiry. He was committed to Bonner's coal house, where he joined company with a zealous minister of Essex, who had been induced to sign a bill of recantation; but afterward, stung by his conscience, he asked the bishop to let him see the instrument again, when he tore it to pieces; which induced Bonner in a fury to strike him repeatedly, and tear away part of his beard. Mr. Philpot had a private interview with Bonner the same night, and was then remanded to his bed of straw like other prisoners, in the coal house. After seven examinations, Bonner ordered him to be set in the stocks, and on the following Sunday separated him from his fellow-prisoners as a sower of heresy, and ordered him up to a room near the battlements of St. Paul's, eight feet by thirteen, on the other side of Lollard's tower, and which could be overlooked by any one in the bishop's outer gallery. Here Mr. Philpot was searched, but happily he was successful in secreting some letters containing his examinations.\n\nIn the eleventh investigation before various bishops, and Mr. Morgan, of Oxford, the latter was so driven into a corner by the close pressure of Mr. Philpot's arguments, that he said to him, \"Instead of the spirit of the Gospel which you boast to possess, I think it is the spirit of the buttery, which your fellows have had, who were drunk before their death, and went, I believe, drunken to it.\" To this unfounded and brutish remark, Mr. Philpot indignantly replied, \"It appeareth by your communication that you are better acquainted with that spirit than the Spirit of God; wherefore I tell thee, thou painted wall and hypocrite, in the name of the living God, whose truth I have told thee, that God shall rain fire and brimstone upon such blasphemers as thou art!\" He was then remanded by Bonner, with an order not to allow him his Bible nor candlelight.\n\nOn December 4, Mr. Philpot had his next hearing, and this was followed by two more, making in all, fourteen conferences, previous to the final examination in which he was condemned; such were the perseverance and anxiety of the Catholics, aided by rthe argumentative abilities of the most distinguished of the papal bishops, to bring him into the pale of their Church. Those examinations, which were very long and learned, were all written down by Mr. Philpot, and a stronger proof of the imbecility of the Catholic doctors, cannot, to an unbiased mind, be exhibited.\n\nOn December 16, in the consistory of St. Paul's Bishop Bonner, after laying some trifling accusations to his charge, such as secreting powder to make ink, writing some private letters, etc., proceeded to pass the awful sentence upon him, after he and the other bishops had urged him by every inducement to recant. He was afterward conducted to Newgate, where the avaricious Catholic keeper loaded him with heavy irons, which by the humanity of Mr. Macham were ordered to be taken off. On December 17, Mr. Philpot received intimation that he was to die next day, and the next morning about eight o'clock, he joyfully met the sheriffs, who were to attend him to the place of execution.\n\nUpon entering Smithfield, the ground was so muddy that two officers offered to carry him to the stake, but he replied:\n\n\"Would you make me a pope? I am content to finish my journey on foot.\" Arriving at the stake, he said, \"Shall I disdain to suffer at the stake, when my Redeemer did not refuse to suffer the most vile death upon the cross for me?\" He then meekly recited the One hundred and seventh and One hundred and eighth Psalms, and when he had finished his prayers, was bound to the post, and fire applied to the pile. On December 18, 1555, perished this illustrious martyr, reverenced by man, and glorified in heaven!John Lomas, Agnes Snoth, Anne Wright, Joan Sole, and Joan CatmerThese five martyrs suffered together, January 31, 1556. John Lomas was a young man of Tenterden. He was cited to appear at Catnerbury, and was examined January 17. His answers being adverse to the idolatrous doctrine of the papacy, he was condemned on the following day, and suffered January 31.\n\nAgnes Snoth, widow, of Smarden Parish, was several times summoned before the Catholic Pharisees, and rejecting absolution, indulgences, transubstantiation, and auricular confession, she was adjudged worthy to suffer death, and endured martyrdom, January 31, with Anne Wright and Joan Sole, who were placed in similar circumstances, and perished at the same time, with equal resignation. Joan Catmer, the last of this heavenly company, of the parish Hithe, was the wife of the martyr George Catmer.\n\nSeldom in any country, for political controversy, have four women been led to execution, whose lives were irreproachable, and whom the pity of savages would have spared. We cannot but remark here that, when the Protestant power first gained the ascendency over the Catholic superstition, and some degree of force in the laws was necessary to enforce uniformity, whence some bigoted people suffered privation in their person or goods, we read of few burnings, savage cruelties, or poor women brought to the stake, but it is the nature of error to resort to force instead of argument, and to silence truth by taking away existence, of which the Redeemer himself is an instance.\n\nThe above five persons were burnt at two stakes in one fire, singing hosannahs to the glorified Savior, until the breath of life was extinct. Sir John Norton, who was present, wept bitterly at their unmerited sufferings.Archbishop CranmerDr. Thomas Cranmer was descended from an ancient family, and was born at the village of Arselacton, in the county of Northampton. After the usual school education he was sent to Cambridge, and was chosen fellow Jesus College. Here he married a gentleman's daughter, by which he forfeited his fellowship, and became a reader in Buckingham College, placing his wife at the Dolphin Inn, the landlady of which was a relation of hers, whence arose the idle report that he was an ostler. His lady shortly after dying in childbed; to his credit he was re-chosen a fellow of the college before mentioned. In a few years after, he was promoted to be Divinity Lecturer, and appointed one of the examiners over those who were ripe to become Bachelors or Doctors in Divinity. It was his principle to judge of their qualifications by the knowledge they possessed of the Scriptures, rather than of the ancient fathers, and hence many popish priests were rejected, and others rendered much improved.\n\nHe was strongly solicited by Dr. Capon to be one of the fellows on the foundation of Cardinal Wolsey's college, Oxford, of which he hazarded the refusal. While he continued in Cambridge, the question of Henry VIII's divorce with Catharine was agitated. At that time, on account of the plague, Dr. Cranmer removed to the house of a Mr. Cressy, at Waltham Abbey, whose two sons were then educating under him. The affair of divorce, contrary to the king's approbation, had remained undecided above two or three years, from the intrigues of the canonists and civilians, and though the cardinals Campeius and Wolsey were commissioned from Rome to decide the question, they purposely protracted the sentence.\n\nIt happened that Dr. Gardiner (secretary) and Dr. Fox, defenders of the king in the above suit, came to the house of Mr. Cressy to lodge, while the king removed to Greenwich. At supper, a conversation ensued with Dr. Cranmer, who suggested that the question whether a man may marry his brother's wife or not, could be easily and speedily decided by the Word of God, and this as well in the English courts as in those of any foreign nation. The king, uneasy at the delay, sent for Dr. Gardiner and Dr. Fox to consult them, regretting that a new commission must be sent to Rome, and the suit be endlessly protracted. Upon relating to the king the conversation which had passed on the previous evening with Dr. Cranmer, his majesty sent for him, and opened the tenderness of conscience upon the near affinity of the queen. Dr. Cranmer advised that the matter should be referred to the most learned divines of Cambridge and Oxford, as he was unwilling to meddle in an affair of such weight; but the king enjoined him to deliver his sentiments in writing, and to repair for that purpose to the earl of Wiltshire's, who would accommodate him with books,a nd everything requisite for the occasion.\n\nThis Dr. Cranmer immediately did, and in his declaration not only quoted the authority of the Scriptures, of general councils, and the ancient writers, but maintained that the bishop of Rome had no authority whatever to dispense with the Word of God. The king asked him if he would stand by this bold declaration, to which replying in the affirmative, he was deputed ambassador to Rome, in conjunction with the earl of Wiltshire, Dr. Stokesley, Dr. Carne, Dr. Bennet, and others, previous to which, the marriage was discussed in most of the universities of Christendom and at home.\n\nWhen the pope presented his toe to be kissed, as customary, the earl of Wiltshire and his party refused. Indeed, it is affirmed that a spaniel of the earl's attracted by the littler of the pope's toe, made a snap at it, whence his holiness drew in his sacred foot, and kicked at the offender with the other.\n\nUpon the pope demanding the cause of their embassy, the earl presented Dr. Cranmer's book, declaring that his learned friends had come to defend it. The pope treated the embassy honorably, and appointed a day for the discussion, which he delayed, as if afraid of the issue of the investigation. The earl returned, and Dr. Cranmer, by the king's desire, visited the emperor, and was successful in bringing him over to his opinion. Upon the doctor's return to England, Dr. Warham, archbishop of Canterbury, having quitted this transitory life, Dr. Cranmer was deservedly, and by Dr. Warham's desire, elevated to that eminent station.\n\nIn this function, it may be said that he followed closely the charge of St. Paul. Diligent in duty, he rose at five in the morning, and continued in study and prayer until nine: between then and dinner, he devoted to temporal affairs. After dinner, if any suitors wanted hearing, he would determine their business with such an affability that even the defaulters were scarcely displeased. Then he would play at chess for an hour, or see others play, and at five o'clock he heard the Common Prayer read, and from this until supper he took the recreation of walking. At supper his conversation was lively and entertaining; again he walked or amused himself until nine o'clock, and then entered his study.\n\nHe ranked high in favor with King Henry, and even had the purity and the interest of the English Church deeply at heart. His mild and forgiving disposition is recorded in the following instance. An ignorant priest, in the country, had called Cranmer an ostler, and spoken very derogatory of his learning. Lord Cromwell receiving information of it, the man was sent to the Fleet, and his case was told to the archbishop by a Mr. Chertsey, a grocer, and a relation of the priest's. His grace, having sent for the offender, reasoned with him, and solicited the priest to question him on any learned subject. This the man, overcome by the bishop's good nature, and knowing his own glaring incapacity, declined, and entreated his forgiveness, which was immediately granted, with a charge to employ his time better when he returned to his parish. Cromwell was much vexed at the lenity displayed, but the bishop was ever more ready to receive injury than to retaliate in any other manner than by good advice and good offices.\n\nAt the time that Cranmer was raised to be archbishop, he was king's chaplain, and archdeacon of Taunton; he was also constituted by the pope the penitentiary general of England. It was considered by the king that Cranmer would be obsequious; hence the latter married the king to Anne Boleyn, performed her coronation, stood godfather to Elizabeth, the first child, and divorced the king from Catharine. Though Cranmer received a confirmation of his dignity from the pope, he always protested against acknowledging any other authority than the king's, and he persisted in the same independent sentiments when before Mary's commissioners in 1555.\n\nOne of the first steps after the divorce was to prevent preaching throughout his diocese, but this narrow measure had rather a political view than a religious one, as there were many who inveighed against the king's conduct. In his new dignity Cranmer agitated the question of supremacy, and by his powerful and just arguments induced the parliament to \"render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's.\" During Cranmer's residence in Germany, 1531, he became acquainted with Ossiander, at Nuremberg, and married his niece, but left her with him while on his return to England. After a season he sent for her privately, and she remained with him until the year 1539, when the Six Articles compelled him to return her to her friends for a time.\n\nIt should be remembered that Ossiander, having obtained the approbation of his friend Cranmer, published the laborious work of the Harmony of the Gospels in 1537. In 1534 the archbishop completed the dearest wish of his heart, the removal of every obstacle to the perfection of the Reformation, by the subscription of the nobles and bishops to the king's sole supremacy. Only Bishop Fisher and Sir Thomas More made objection; and their agreement not to oppose the succession Cranmer was willing to consider at sufficient, but the monarch would have no other than an entire concession.\n\nNot long after, Gardiner, in a privat einterview with the king, spoke inimically of Cranmer, (whom he maliciously hated) for assumiong the title of primate of all England, as derogatory to the supremacy of the king. This created much jealousy against Cranmer, and his translation of the Bible was strongly opposed by Stokesley, bishop of London. It is said, upon the demise of Queen Catharine, that her successor Anne Boleyn rejoiced-a lesson this to show how shallow is the human judgment! since her own execution took place in the spring of the following year, and the king, on the day following the beheading of this sacrificed lady, married the beautiful Jane Seymour, a maid of honor to the late queen. Cranmer was ever the friend of Anne Boleyn, but it was dangerous to oppose the will of the carnal tyrannical monarch.\n\nIn 1538, the Holy Scriptures were openly exposed to sale; and the places of worship overflowed everywhere to hear its holy doctrines expounded. Upon the king's passing into a law the famous Six Articles, which went nearly again to establish the essential tenets of the Romish creed, Cranmer shone forth with all the luster of a Christian patiot, in resisting the doctrines they contained, and in which he was supported by the bishops of Sarum, Worcester, Ely, and Rochester, the two former of whom resigned their bishoprics. The king, though now in opposition to Cranmer, still revered the sincerity that marked his conduct. The death of Lord Cromwell in the Tower, in 1540, the good friend of Cranmer, was a severe blow to the wavering Protestant cause, but even now Cranmer, when he saw the tide directly adverse to the truth, boldly waited on the king in person, and by his manly and heartfelt pleading, caused the Book of Articles to be passed on his side, to the great confusion of his enemies, who had contemplated his fall as inevitable.\n\nCranmer now lived in as secluded a manner as possible, until the rancor of Winchester preferred some articles against him, relative to the dangerous opinion he taught in his family, joined to other treasonable charges. These the king himself delivered to Cranmer, and believing firmly the fidelity and assertions of innocence of the accused prelate, he caused the matter to be deeply investigated, and Winchester and Dr. Lenden, with Thornton and Barber, of the bishop's household, were found by the papers to be the real conspirators. The mild, forgiving Cranmer would have interceded for all remission of publishment, had not Henry, pleased with the subsidy voted by parliament, let them be discharged. These nefarious men, however, again renewing their plots against Cranmer, fell victims to Henry's resentment, and Gardiner forever lost his confidence. Sir G. Gostwick soon after laid charges against the archbishop, which Henry quashed, and the primate was willing to forgive.\n\nIn 1544, the archbishop's palace at Canterbury was burnt, and his brother-in-law with others perished in it. These various afflictions may serve to reconcile us to a humble state; for of what happiness could this great and good man boast, since his life was constantly harassed either by political, religious, or natural crosses? Again the inveterate Gardfiner laid high charges against the meek archbishop and would have sent him to the Tower; but the king was his friend, gave him his signet that he might defend him, and in the Council not only declared the bishop one of the best affected men in his realm, but sharpoly rebuked his accusers for their calumny.\n\nA peace having been made, Henry, and the French king, Henry the Great, were unanimous to have the Mass abolished in their kingdom, and Cranmer set about this great work; but the death of the English monarch, in 1546, suspended the precedure, and King Edwarrd his successor continued Cranmer in the same functions, upon whose coronation he delivered a charge that will ever honor his memory, for its purity, freedom, and truth. During this reign he prosecuted the glorious Reformation with unabated zeal, even in the year 1552, when he was seized with a severe ague, from which it pleased God to restore him that he might testify by his death the truth of that seed he had diligently sown.\n\nThe death of Edward, in 1553, exposed Cranmer to all the rage of his enemies. Though the archbishop was among those who supported Mary's accession, he was attainted at the meeting of parliament, and in November adjudged guilty of high treason at Guildhall, and degraded from his dignities. He sent a humble letter to Mary, explaining the cause of his signing the will in favor of Edward, and in 1554 he wrote to the Council, whom he pressed to obtain a pardon from the queen, by a letter delivered to Dr. Weston, but which the letter opened, and on seeing its contents, basely returned.\n\nTreason was a charge quite inapplicable to Cranmer, who supported the queen's right; while others, who had favored Lady Jane were dismissed upon paying a small fine. A calumny was now spread against Cranmer that he complied with some of the popish ceremonies to ingratiate himself with the queen, which he dared publicly to disavow, and justified his articles of faith. The active part which the prelate had taken in the divorce of Mary's mother had ever rankled deeply in the heart of the queen, and revenge formed a prominent feature in the death of Cranmer.\n\nWe have in this work noticed the public disputations at Oxford, in which the talents of Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer shone so conspicuously, and tended to their condemnation. The first sentence was illegal, inasmuch as the usurped power of the pope had not yet been re-established by law.\n\nBeing kept in prison until this was effected, a commission was despatched from Rome, appointing Dr. Brooks to sit as the representative of his holiness, and Drs. Story and Martin as those of the queen. Cranmer was willing to bow to the authority of Drs. Story and Martin, but against that of Dr. Brooks he protested. Such were the remarks and replies of Cranmer, after a long examination, that Dr. Broks observed, \"We come to examine you, and methinks you examine us.\"\n\nBeing sent back to confinement, he received a citation to appear at Rome within eighteen days, but this was impracticable, as he was imprisoned in England; and as he stated, even had he been at liberty, he was too poor to employ an advocate. Absurd as it must appear, Cranmer was condemned at Rome, and on February 14, 1556, a new commission was appointed, by which, Thirlby, bishop of Ely, and Bonner, of London, were deputed to sit in judgment at Christ-church, Oxford. By virtue of this instrument, Cranmer was gradually degraded, by putting mere rags on him to represent the dress of an archbishop; then stripping him of his attire, they took off his own gown, and put an old worn one upon him instead. This he bore unmoved, and his enemies, finding that severity only rendered him more determined, tried the opposite course, and placed him in the house of the dean of Christ-church, where he was treated with every indulgence.\n\nThis presented such a contrast to the three years' hard imprisonment he had received, that it threw him off his guard. His open, generous nature was more easily to be seduced by a liberal conduct than by threats and fetters. When Satan finds the Christian proof against one mode of attack, he tries another; and what form is so seductive as smiles, rewards, and power, after a long, painful imprisonment? Thus it was with Cranmer: his enemies promised him his former greatness if he would but recant, as well as the queen's favor, and this at the very time they knew that his death was determined in council. To soften the path to apostasy, the first paper brought for his signature was conceived in general terms; this once signed, five others were obtained as explanatory of the first, until finally he put his hand to the following detestable instrument:\n\n\"I, Thomas Cranmer, late archbishop of Canterbury, do renounce, abhor, and detest all manner of heresies and errors of Luther and Zuinglius, and all other teachings which are contrary to sound and true doctrine. And I believe most constantly in my heart, and with my mouth I confess one holy and Catholic Church visible, without which there is no salvation; and therefore I acknowledge the Bishop of Rome to be supreme head on earth, whom I acknowledge to be the highest bishop and pope, and Christ's vicar, unto whom all Christian people ought to be subject.\n\n\"And as concerning the sacraments, I believe and worship int he sacrament of the altar the body and blood of Christ, being contained most truly under the forms of bread and wine; the bread, through the mighty power of God being turned into the body of our Savior Jesus Christ, and the wine into his blood.\n\n\"And in the other six sacraments, also, (alike as in this) I believe and hold as the universal Church holdeth, and the Church of Rome judgeth and determineth.\n\n\"Furthermore, I believe that there is a place of purgatory, where souls departed be punished for a time, for whom the Church doth godily and wholesomely pray, like as it doth honor saints and make prayers to them.\n\n\"Finally, in all things I profess, that I do not otherwise believe than the Catholic Church and the Church of Rome holdeth and teacheth. I am sorry that I ever held or thought otherwise. And I beseech Almighty God, that of His mercy He will vouchsafe to forgive me whatsoever I have offended against God or His Church, and also I desire and beseech all Christian people to pray for me.\n\n\"And all such as have been deceived either by mine example or doctrine, I require them by the blood of Jesus Christ that they will return to the unity of the Church, that we may be all of one mind, without schism or division.\n\n\"And to conclude, as I submit myself to the Catholic Church of Christ, and to the supreme head thereof, so I submit myself unto the most excellent majesties of Philip and Mary, king and queen of this realm of England, etc., and to all other their laws and ordinances, being ready always as a faithful subject ever to obey them. And God is my witness, that I have not done this for favor or fear of any person, but willingly and of mine own conscience, as to the instruction of others.\"\n\n\"Let him that standeth take heed lest he fall!\" said the apostle, and here was a falling off indeed! The papists now triumphed in their turn: they had acquired all they wanted short of his life. His recantation was immediately printed and dispersed, that it might have its due effect upon the astonished Protestants. But God counter worked all the designs of the Catholics by the extent to which they carried the implacable persecution of their prey. Doubtless, the love of life induced Cranmer to sign the above declaration: yet death may be said to have been preferable to life to him who lay under the stings of a goaded conscience and the contempt of every Gospel Christian; this principle he strongly felt in all its force and anguish.\n\nThe queen's revenge was only to be satiated by Cranmer's blood, and therefore she wrote an order to Dr. Pole, to prepare a sermon to be preached March 21, directly before his martyrdom, at St. Mary's, Oxford. Dr. Pole visited him the day previous, and was induced to believe that he would publicly deliver his sentiments in confirmation of the articles to which he had subscribed. About nine in the morning of the day of sacrifice, the queen's commissioners, attended by the magistrates, conducted the amiable unfortunate to St. Mary's Church. His torn, dirty garb, the same in which they habited him upon his degradation, excited the commiseration of the people. In the church he found a low mean stage, erected opposite to the pulpit, on which being placed, he turned his face, and fervently prayed to God.\n\nThe church was crowded with persons of both persuasions, expecting to hear the justification of the late apostasy: the Catholics rejoicing, and the Protestants deeply wounded in spirit at the deceit of the human heart. Dr. Pole, in his sermon, represented Cranmer as having been guilty of the most atrocious crimes; encouraged the deluded sufferer not to fear death, not to doubt the support of God in his torments, nor that Masses would be said in all the churches of Oxford for the repose of his soul. The doctor then noticed his conversion, and which he ascribed to the evident working of Almighty power and in order that the people might be convinced of its reality, asked the prisoner to give them a sign. This Cranmer did, and begged the congregation to pray for him, for he had committed many and grievous sins; but, of all, there was one which awfully lay upon his mind, of which he would speak shortly.\n\nDuring the sermon Cranmer wept bitter tears: lifting up his hands and eyes to heaven, and letting them fall, as if unworthy to live: his grief now found vent in words: before his confession he fell upon his knees, and, in the following words unveiled the deep contrition and agitation which harrowed up his soul.\n\n\"O Father of heaven! O Son of God, Redeemer of the world! O Holy Ghost, three persons all one God! have mercy on me, most wretched caitiff and miserable sinner. I have offended both against heaven and earth, more than my tongue can express. Whither then may I go, or whither may I flee? To heaven I may be ashamed to lift up mine eyes and in earth I find no place of refuge or succor. To Thee, therefore, O Lord, do I run; to Thee do I humble myself, saying, O Lord, my God, my sins be great, but yet have mercy upon me for Thy great mercy. The great mystery that God became man, was not wrought for little or few offences. Thou didst not give Thy Son, O Heavenly Father, unto death for small sins only, but for all the greatest sins of the world, so that the sinner return to Thee with his whole heart, as I do at present. Wherefore, have mercy on me, O God, whose property is always to have mercy, have mercy upon me, O Lord, for Thy great mercy. I crave nothing for my own merits, but for Thy name's sake, that it may be hallowed thereby, and for Thy dear Son, Jesus Christ's sake. And now therefore, O Father of Heaven, hallowed be Thy name,\" etc.\n\nThen rising, he said he was desirous before his death to give them some pious exhortations by which God might be glorified and themselves edified. He then descanted upon the danger of a love for the world, the duty of obedience to their majesties, of love to one another and the necessity of the rich administering to the wants of the poor. He quoted the three verses of the fifth chapter of James, and then proceeded, \"Let them that be rich ponder well these three sentences: for if they ever had occasion to show their charity, they have it now at this present, the poor people being so many, and victual so dear.\n\n\"And now forasmuch as I am come to the last end of my life, whereupon hangeth all my life past, and all my life to come, either to live with my master Christ for ever in joy, or else to be in pain for ever with the wicked in hell, and I see before mine eyes presently, either heaven ready to receive me, or else hell ready to swallow me up; I shall therefore declare unto you my very faith how I believe, without any color of dissimulation: for now is no time to dissemble, whatsoever I have said or written in times past.\n\n\"First, I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, etc. And I believe every article of the Catholic faith, every word and sentence taught by our Savior Jesus Christ, His apostles and prophets, in the New and Old Testament.\n\n\"And now I come to the great thing which so much troubleth my conscience, more than any thing that ever I did or said in my whole life, and that is the setting abroad of a writing contrary to the truth, which now here I renounce and refuse, as things written with my hand contrary to the truth which I thought in my heart, and written for fear of death, and to save my life, if it might be; and that is, all such bills or papers which I have written or signed with my hand since my degradation, wherein I have written many things untrue. And forasmuch as my hand hath offended, writing contrary to my heart, therefore my hand shall first be punished; for when I come to the fire it shall first be burned.\n\n\"And as for the pope, I refuse him as Christ's enemy, and Antichrist, with all his false doctrine.\"\n\nUpon the conclusion of this unexpected declaration, amazement and indignation were conspicuous in every part of the church. The Catholics were completely foiled, their object being frustrated, Cranmer, like Samson, having completed a greater ruin upon his enemies in the hour of death, than he did in his life.\n\nCranmer would have proceeded in the exposure of the popish doctrines, but the murmurs of the idolaters drowned his voice, and the preacher gave an order to \"lead the heretic away!\" The savage command was directly obeyed, and the lamb about to suffer was torn from his stand to the place of slaughter, insulted all the way by the revilings and taunts of the pestilent monks and friars.\n\nWith thoughts intent upon a far higher object than the empty threats of man, he reached the spot dyed with the blood of Ridley and Latimer. There he knelt for a short time in earnest devotion, and then arose, that he might undress and prepare for the fire. Two friars who had been parties in prevailing upon him to abjure, now endeavored to draw him off again from the truth, but he was steadfast and immovable in what he had just professed, and publicly taught. A chain was provided to bind him to the stake, and after it had tightly encircled him, fire was put to the fuel, and the flames began soon to ascend.\n\nThen were the glorious sentiments of the martyr made manifest; then it was, that stretching out his right hand, he held it unshrinkingly in the fire until it was burnt to a cinder, even before his body wa sinjured, frequently exclaiming, \"This unworthy right hand.\"\n\nHis body did abide the burning with such steadfastness that he seemed to have no more than the stake to which he was bound; his eyes were lifted up to heaven, and he repeated \"this unworthy right hand,\" as long as his voice would suffer him; and using often the words of Stephen, \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,\" in the greatness of the flame, he gave up the ghost.The Vision of Three LaddersWhen Robert Samuel was brought forth to be burned, certain there were that heard him declare what strange things had happened unto him during the time of his imprisonment; to wit, that after he had famished or pined with hunger two or three days together, he then fell into a sleep, as it were one half in a slumber, at which time one clad all in white seemed to stand before him, who ministered comfort unto him by these words:\n\n\"Samuel, Samuel, be of good cheer, and take a good heart unto thee: for after this day shalt thou never be either hungry or thirsty.\"\n\nNo less memorable it is, and worthy to be noted, concerning the three ladders which he told to divers he saw in his sleep, set up toward heaven; of the which there was one somewhat longer than the rest, but yet at length they became one, joining (as it were) all three together.\n\nAs this godly martyr was going to the fire, there came a certain maid to him, which took him about the neck, and kissed him, who, being marked by them that were present, was sought for the next day after, to be had to prison and burned, as the very party herself informed me: howbeit, as God of His goodness would have it, she escaped their fiery hands, keeping herself secret in the town a good while after.\n\nBut as this maid, called Rose Nottingham, was marvellously preserved by the providence of God, so there were other two honest women who did fall into the rage and fury of that time. The one was a brewer's wife, the other was a shoemaker's wife, but both together now espoused to a new husband, Christ.\n\nWith these two was this maid aforesaid very familiar and well acquainted, who, on a time giving counsel to the one of them, that she should convey herself away while she had time and space, had this answer at her hand again: \"I know well,\" saith she, \"that it is lawful enough to fly away; which remedy you may use, if you list. But my case standeth otherwise. I am tied to a husband, and have besides young children at home; therefore I am minded, for the love of Christ and His truth, to stand to the extremity of the matter.\"\n\nAnd so the next day after Samuel suffered, these two godly wives, the one called Anne Potten, the other called Joan Trunchfield, the wife of Michael Trunchfield, shoemaker, of Ipswich, were apprehended, and had both into one prison together. As they were both by sex and nature somewhat tender, so were they at first less able to endure the straitness of the prison; and especially the brewer's wife was cast into marvellous great agonies and troubles of mind thereby. But Christ, beholding the weak infirmity of His servant, did not fail to help her when she was in this necessity; so at the length they both suffered after Samuel, in 1556, February 19. And these, no dobut, were those two ladders, which, being joined with the third, Samuel saw stretched up into heaven. This blessed Samuel, the servant of Christ, suffered the thirty-first of August, 1555.\n\nThe report goeth among some that were there present, and saw him burn, that his body in burning did shine in the eyes of them that stood by, as bright and white as new-tried silver.\n\nWhen Agnes Bongeor saw herself separated from her prison-fellows, what piteous moan that good woman made, how bitterly she wept, what strange thoughts came into her mind, how naked and desolate she esteemed herself, and into what plunge of despair and care her poor soul was brought, it was piteous and wonderful to see; which all came because she went not with them to give her life in the defence of her Christ; for of all things in the world, life was least looked for at her hands.\n\nFor that morning in which she was kept back from burning, had she put on a smock, that she had prepared only for that purpose. And also having a child, a little young infant sucking on her, whom she kept with her tenderly all the time that she was in prison, against that day likewise did she send away to another nurse, and prepared herself presently to give herself for the testimony of the glorious Gospel of Jesus Christ. So little did she look for life, and so greatly did God's gifts work in her above nature, that death seemed a great deal better welcome than life. After which, she began a little to stay herself, and gave her whole exercise to reading and prayer, wherein she found no little comfort.\n\nIn a short time came a writ from London for the burning, which according to the effect thereof, was executed.Hugh Laverick and John ApriceHere we perceive that neither the impotence of age nor the affliction of blindness, could turn aside the murdering fangs of these Babylonish monsters. The first of these unfortunates was of the parish of Barking, aged sixty-eight, a painter and a cripple. The other was blind, dark indeed in his visual faculties, but intellectually illuminated with the radiance of the everlasting Gospel of truth. Inoffensive objects like these were informed against by some of the sons of bigotry, and dragged before the prelatical shark of London, where they underwent examination, and replied to the articles propounded to them, as other Christian martyrs had done before. On the ninth day of May, in the consistory of St. Paul's, they were entreated to recant, and upon refusal, were sent to Fulham, where Bonner, by way of a dessert after dinner, condemned them to the agonies of the fire. Being consigned to the secular officers, May 15, 1556, they were taken in a cart from Newgate to Stratford-le-Bow, where they were fastened to the stake. When Hugh Laverick was secured by the chain, having no further occasion for his crutch, he threw it away saying to his fellow-martyr, while consoling him, \"Be of good cheer my brother; for my lord of London is our good physician; he will heal us both shortly-thee of thy blindness, and me of my lameness.\" They sank down in the fire, to rise to immortality!\n\nThe day after the above martyrdoms, Catharine Hut, of Bocking, widow; Joan Horns, spinster, of Billerica; Elizabeth Thackwel, spinster, of Great Burstead, suffered death in Smithfield.\n\nThomas Dowry. We have again to record an act of unpitying cruelty, exercised on this lad, whom Bishop Hooper, had confirmed in the Lord and the knowledge of his Word.\n\nHow long this poor sufferer remained in prison is uncertain.\n\nBy the testimony of one John Paylor, register of Gloucester, we learn that when Dowry was brought before Dr. Williams, then chancellor of Gloucester, the usual articles were presented him for subscription. From these he dissented; and, upon the doctor's demanding of whom and where he had learned his heresies, the youth replied, \"Indeed, Mr. Chancellor, I learned from you in that very pulpit. On such a day (naming the day) you said, in preaching upon the Sacrament, that it was to be exercised spiritually by faith, and not carnally and really, as taught by the papists.\" Dr. Williams then bid him recant, as he had done; but Dowry had not so learned his duty. \"Though you,\" said he, \"can so easily mock God, the world, and your own conscience, yet will I not do so.\"Preservation of George Crow and His TestamentThis poor man, of Malden, May 26, 1556, put to sea, to lade in Lent with fuller's earth, but the boat, being driven on land, filled with water, and everything was washed out of her; Crow, however, saved his Testament, and coveted nothing else. With Crow was a man and a boy, whose awful situation became every minute more alarming, as the boat was useless, and they were ten miles from land, expecting the tide should in a few hours set in upon them. After prayer to God, they got upon the mast, and hung there for the space of ten hours, when the poor boy, overcome by cold and exhaustion, fell off, and was drowned. The tide having abated, Crow proposed to take down the masts, and float upon them, which they did; and at ten o'clock at night they were borne away at the mercy of the waves. On Wednesday, in the night, Crow's companion died through the fatigue and hunger, and he was left alone, calling upon God for succor. At length he was picked up by a Captain Morse, bound to Antwerp, who had nearly steered away, taking him for some fisherman's buoy floating in the sea. As soon as Crow was got on board, he put his hand in his bosom, and drew out his Testament, which indeed was wet, but not otherwise injured. At Antwerp he was well received, and the money he had lost was more than made good to him.Executions at Stratford-le-BowAt this sacrifice, which we are about to detail no less than thirteen were doomed to the fire.\n\nEach one refusing to subscribe contrary to conscience, they were condemned, and the twenty-seventh of June, 1556, was appointed for their execution at Stratford-le-Bow. Their constancy and faith glorified their Redeemer, equally in life and in death.Rev. Julius PalmerThis gentleman's life presents a singular instance of error and conversion. In the time of Edward, he was a rigid and obstinate papist, so adverse to godly and sincere preaching, that he was even despised by his own party; that this frame of mind should be changed, and he suffer persecution and death in Queen Mary's reign, are among those events of omnipotence at which we wonder and admire.\n\nMr. Palmer was born at Coventry, where his father had been mayor. Being afterward removed to Oxford, he became, under Mr. Harley, of Magdalen College, an elegant Latin and Greek scholar. He was fond of useful disputation, possessed of a lively wit, and a strong memory. Indefatigable in private study, he rose at four in the morning, and by this practice qualified himself to become reader in logic in Magralen College. The times of Edward, however, favoring the Reformation, Mr. Palmer became frequently punished for his contempt of prayer and orderly behavior, and was at length expelled the house.\n\nHe afterwards embraced the doctrines of the Reformation, which occasioned his arrest and final condemnation.\n\nA certain nobleman offered him his life if he would recant.\n\n\"If so,\" said he, \"thou wilt dwell with me. And if thou wilt set thy mind to marriage, I will procure thee a wife and a farm, and help to stuff and fit thy farm for thee. How sayst thou?\"\n\nPalmer thanked him very courteously, but very modestly and reverently concluded that as he had already in two places renounced his living for Christ's sake, so he would with God's grace be ready to surrender and yield up his life also for the same, when God should send time.\n\nWhen Sir Richard perceived that he would by no means relent:\n\n\"Well, Palmer,\" saith he, \"then I perceive one of us twain shall be damned: for we be of two faiths, and certain I am there is but one faith that leadeth to life and salvation.\"\n\nPalmer: \"O sir, I hope that we both shall be saved.\"Sir Richard: \"How may that be?\"Palmer: \"Right well, sir. For as it hath pleased our merciful Savior, according to the Gospel's parable, to call me at the third hour of the day, even in my flowers, at the age of four and twenty years, even so I trust He hath called, and will call you, at the eleventh hour of this your old age, and give you everlasting life for your portion.\"\n\nSir Richard: \"Sayest thou so? Well, Palmer, well, I would I might have thee but one month in my house: I doubt not but I would convert thee, or thou shouldst convert me.\"\n\nThen said Master Winchcomb, \"Take pity on thy golden years, and pleasant flowers of lusty youth, before it be too late.\"\n\nPalmer: \"Sir, I long for those springing flowers that shall never fade away.\"\n\nHe was tried on the fifteenth of July, 1556, together with one Thomas Askin, fellow prisoner. Askin and one John Guin had been sentenced the day before, and Mr. Palmer, on the fifteenth, was brought up for final judgment. Execution was ordered to follow the sentence, and at five o'clock in the same afternoon, at a place called the Sand-pits, these three martyrs were fastened to a stake. After devoutly praying together, they sung the Thirty-first Psalm.\n\nWhen the fire was kindled, and it had seized their bodies, without an appearance of enduring pain, they continued to cry, \"Lord Jesus, strengthen us! Lord Jesus receive our souls!\" until animation was suspended and human suffering was past. It is remarkable, that, when their heads had fallen together in a mass as it were by the force of the flames, and the spectators thought Palmer as lifeless, his tongue and lips again moved, and were heard to pronounce the name of Jesus, to whom be glory and honor forever!Joan Waste and OthersThis poor, honest woman, blind from her birth, and unmarried, aged twenty-two, was of the parish of Allhallows, Derby. Her father was a barber, and also made ropes for a living: in which she assisted him, and also learned to knit several articles of apparel. Refusing to communicate with those who maintained doctrines contrary to those she had learned in the days of the pious Edward, she was called before Dr. Draicot, the chancellor of Bishop Blaine, and Peter Finch, official of Derby.\n\nWith sophisitcal arguments and threats they endeavored to confound the poor girl; but she proffered to yield to the bishop's doctrine, if he would answer for her at the Day of Judgment, (as pious Dr. Taylor had done in his sermons) that his belief of the real presence of the Sacrament was true. The bishop at first answered that he would; but Dr. Draicot reminding him that he might not in any way answer for a heretic, he withdrew his confirmation of his own tenets; and she replied that if their consciences would not permit them to answer at God's bar for that truth they wished her to subscribe to, she would answer no more questions. Sentence was then adjudged, and Dr. Draicot appointed to preach her condemned sermon, which took place August 1, 1556, the day of her martyrdom. His fulminating discourse being finished, the poor, sightless object was taken to a place called Windmill Pit, near the town, where she for a time held her brother by the hand, and then prepared herself for the fire, calling upon the pitying multitude to pray with her, and upon Christ to have mercy upon her, until the glorious light of the everlasting Sun of righteousness beamed upon her departed spirit.\n\nIn November, fifteen martyrs were imprisoned in Canterbury castle, of whom all were either burnt or famished. Among the latter were J. Clark, D. Chittenden, W. Foster of Stonc, Alice Potkins, and J. Archer, of Cranbrooke, weaver. The two first of these had not received condemnation, but the others were sentenced to the fire. Foster, at his examination, observed upon the utility of carrying lighted candles about on Candlemas-day, that he might as well carry a pitchfork; and that a gibbet would have as good an effect as the cross.\n\nWe have now brought to a close the sanguinary proscriptions of the merciless Mary, in the year 1556, the number of which amounted to above EIGHTY-FOUR!\n\nThe beginning of the year 1557, was remarkable for the visit of Cardinal Pole to the University of Cambridge, which seemed to stand in need of much cleansing from heretical preachers and reformed doctrines. One object was also to play the popish farce of trying Martin Bucer and Paulus Phagius, who had been buried about three or four years; for which purpose the churches of St. Mary and St. Michael, where they lay, were interdicted as vile and unholy places, unfit to worship God in, until they were perfumed and washed with the pope's holy water, etc., etc. The trumpery act of citing these dead reformers to appear, not having had the least effect upon them, on January 26, sentence of condemnation was passed, part of which ran in this manner, and may serve as a specimen of proceedings of this nature: \"We therefore pronounce the said Martin Bucer and Paulus Phagius excommunicated and anathematized, as well by the common law, as by letters of process; and that their memory be condemned, we also condemn their bodies and bones (which in that wicked time of schism, and other heresies flourishing in this kingdom, were rashly buried in holy ground) to be dug up, and cast far from the bodies and bones of the faithful, according to the holy canons, and we command that they and their writings, if any be there found, be publicly burnt; and we interdict all persons whatsoever of this university, town, or places adjacent, who shall read or conceal their heretical book, as well by the common law, as by our letters of process!\"\n\nAfter the sentence thus read, the bishop commanded their bodies to be dug out of their graves, and being degraded from holy orders, delivered them into the hands of the secular power; for it was not lawful for such innocent persons as they were, abhorring all bloodshed, and detesting all desire of murder, to put any man to death.\n\nFebruary 6, the bodies, enclosed as they were in chests, were carried into the midst of the market place at Cambrdige, accompanied by a vast concourse of people. A great post was set fast in the ground, to which the chests were affixed with a large iron chain, and bound round their centers, in the same manner as if the dead bodies had been alive. When the fire began to ascend, and caught the coffins, a number of condemned books were also launched into the flames, and burnt. Justice, however, was done to the memories of these pious and learned men in Queen Elizabeth's reign, when Mr. Ackworth, orator of the university, and Mr. J. Pilkington, pronounced orations in honor of their memory, and in reprobation of their Catholic persecutors.\n\nCardinal Pole also inflicted his harmless rage upon the dead body of Peter Martyr's wife, who, by his command, was dug out of her grave, and buried on a distant dunghill, partly because her bones lay near St. Fridewide's relics, held once in great esteem in that college, and partly because he wished to purify Oxford of heretical remains as well as Cambridge. In the succeeding reign, however, her remains were restored to their former cemetery, and even intermingled with those of the Catholic saint, to the utter astonishment and mortification of the disciples of his holiness the pope.\n\nCardinal Pole published a list of fifty-four articles, containing instructions to the clergy of his diocese of Canterbury, some of which are too ludicrous and puerile to excite any other sentiment than laughter in these days.Persecutions in the Diocese of CanterburyIn the month of February, the following persons were committed to prison: R. Coleman, of Waldon, laborer; Joan Winseley, of Horsley Magna, spinster; S. Glover, of Rayley; R. Clerk, of Much Holland, mariner; W. Munt, of Much Bentley, sawyer; Marg. Field, of Ramsey, spinster; R. Bongeor, currier; R. Jolley, mariner;\n\nAllen Simpson, Helen Ewire, C. Pepper, widow; Alice Walley (who recanted), W. Bongeor, glazier, all of Colchester; R. Atkin, of Halstead, weaver; R. Barcock, of Wilton, carpenter; R. George, of Westbarhonlt, laborer; R. Debnam of Debenham, weaver; C. Warren, of Cocksall, spinster; Agnes Whitlock, of Dover-court, spinster;\n\nRose Allen, spinster; and T. Feresannes, minor; both of Colchester.\n\nThese persons were brought before Bonner, who would have immediately sent them to execution, but Cardinal Pole was for more merciful measures, and Bonner, in a letter of his to the cardinal, seems to be sensible that he had displeased him, for he has this expression: \"I thought to have them all hither to Fulham, and to have given sentence against them; nevertheless, perceiving by my last doing that your grace was offended, I thought it my duty, before I proceeded further, to inform your grace.\" This circumstance verifies the account that the cardinal was a humane man; and though a zealous Catholic, we, as Protestants, are willing to render him that honor which his merciful character deserves. Some of the bitter persecutors denounced him to the pope as a favorer of heretics, and he was summoned to Rome, but Queen Mary, by particular entreaty, procured his stay. However, before his latter end, and a little before his last journey from Rome to England, he was strongly suspected of favoring the doctrine of Luther.\n\nAs in the last sacrifice four women did honor to the truth, so in the following auto da fe we have the like number of females and males, who suffered June 30, 1557, at Canterbury, and were J. Fishcock, F. White, N. Pardue, Barbary Final, widow, Bardbridge's widow, Wilson's wife, and Benden's wife.\n\nOf this group we shall more particularly notice Alice Benden, wife of Edward Bender, of Staplehurst, Kent. She had been taken up in October, 1556, for non-attendance, and released upon a strong injunction to mind her conduct. Her husband was a bigoted Catholic, and publicly speaking of his wife's contumacy, she was conveyed to Canterbury Castle, where knowing, when she should be removed to the bishop's prison, she should be almost starved upon three farthings a day, she endeavored to prepare herself for this suffering by living upon twopence halfpenny per day.\n\nOn January 22, 1557, her husband wrote to the bishop that if his wife's brother, Roger Hall, were to be kept from consoling and relieving her, she might turn; on this account, she was moved to a prison called Monday's Hole. Her brother sought diligently for her, and at the end of five weeks providentially heard her voice in the dungeon, but could not otherwise relieve her, than by putting soe money in a loaf, and sticking it on a long pole. Dreadful must have been the situation of this poor victim, lying on straw, between stone walls, without a change of apparel, or the meanest requisites of cleanliness, during a period of nine weeks!\n\nOn March 25 she was summoned before the bishop, who, with rewards, offered her liberty if she would go home and be comfortable; but Mrs. Benden had been inured to suffering, and, showing him her contracted limbs and emaciated appearance, refused to swerve from the truth. She was however removed from this black hole to the West Gate, whence, about the end of April, she was taken out to be condemned, and then committed to the castle prison until the nineteenth of June, the day of her burning. At the stake, she gave her handkerchief to one John Banks, as a memorial; and from her waist she drew a white lace, desiring him to give it to her brother, and tell him that it was the last band that had bound her, except the chain; and to her father she returned a shilling he had sent her.\n\nThe whole of these seven martyrs undressed themselves with alacrity, and, being prepared, knelt down, and prayed with an earnestness and Christian spirit that even the enemies of the cross were affected. After invocation made together, they were secured to the stake, and, being encompassed with the unsparing flames, they yielded their souls into the hands of the living Lord.\n\nMatthew Plaise, weaver, a sincere and shrewd Christian, of Stone, Kent, was brought before Thomas, bishop of Dover, and other inquisitors, whom he ingeniously teased by his indirect answers, of which the following is a specimen.\n\nDr. Harpsfield. Christ called the bread His body; what dost thou say it is?\nPlaise. I do believe it was that which He gave them.\nDr. H. What as that?\nP. That which He brake.\nDr. H. What did He brake?\nP. That which He took.\nDr. H. What did He take?\nP. I say, what He gave them, that did they eat indeed.\nDr. H. Well, then, thou sayest it was but bread which the disciples did eat.\nP. I say, what He gave them, that did they eat indeed.\n\nA very long disputation followed, in which Plaise was desired to humble himself to the bishop; but this he refused. Whether this zealous person died in prison, was executed, or delivered, history does not mention.Rev. John HullierRev. John Hullier was brought up at Eton College, and in process of time became curate of Babram, three miles from Cambridge, and went afterward to Lynn; where, opposing the superstition of the papists, he was carried before Dr. Thirlby, bishop of Ely, and sent to Cambridge castle: here he lay for a time, and was then sent to Tolbooth prison, where, after three months, he was brought to St. Mary's Church, and condemned by Dr. Fuller. On Maunday Thursday he was brought to the stake: while undressing, he told the people to bear witness that he was about to suffer in a just cause, and exhorted them to believe that there was no other rock than Jesus Christ to build upon. A priest named Boyes, then desired the mayor to silence him. After praying, he went meekly to the stake, and being bound with a chain, and placed in a pitch barrel, fire was applied to the reeds and wood; but the wind drove the fire directly to his back, which caused him under the severe agony to pray the more fervently. His friends directed the executioner to fire the pile to windward of his face, which was immediately done.\n\nA quantity of books were now thrown into the fire, one of which (the Communion Service) he caught, opened it, and joyfully continued to read it, until the fire and smoke deprived him of sight; then even, in earnest prayer, he pressed the book to his heart, thanking God for bestowing on him in his last moments this precious gift.\n\nThe day being hot, the fire burnt fiercely; and at a time when the spectators supposed he was no more, he suddenly exclaimed, \"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit,\" and meekly resigned his life. He was burnt on Jesus Green, not far from Jesus College. He had gunpowder given him, but he was dead before it became ignited. This pious sufferer afforded a singular spectacle; for his flesh was so burnt from the bones, which continued erect, that he presented the idea of a skeleton figure chained to the stake. His remains were eagerly seized by the multitude, and venerated by all who admired his piety or detested inhuman bigotry.Simon Miller and Elizabeth CooperIn the following month of July, received the crown of martyrdom. Miller dwelt at Lynn, and came to Norwich, where, planting himself at the door of one of the churches, as the people came out, he requested to know of them where he could go to receive the Communion. For this a priest brought him before Dr. Dunning, who committed him to ward; but he was suffered to go home, and arrange his affairs; after which he returned to the bishop's house, and to his prison, where he remained until the thirteenth of July, the day of his burning.\n\nElizabeth Coope, wife of a pewterer, of St. Andrews, Norwich, had recanted; but tortured for what she had done by the worm which dieth not, she shortly after voluntarily entered her parish church during the time of the popish service, and standing up, audibly proclaimed that she revoked her former recantation, and cautioned the people to avoid her unworthy example. She was taken from her own house by Mr. Sutton the sheriff, who very reluctantly complied with the letter of the law, as they had been servants and in friendship together. At the stake, the poor sufferer, feeling the fire, uttered the cry of \"Oh!\" upon which Mr. Miller, putting his hand behind him towards her, desired her to be of a good courage, \"for (said he) good sister, we shall have a joyful and a sweet supper.\" Encouraged by this example and exhortation, she stood the fiery ordeal without flinching, and, with him, proved the power of faith over the flesh.Executions at ColchesterIt was before mentioned that twenty-two persons had been sent up from Colchester, who upon a slight submission, were afterward released. Of these, William Munt, of Much Bentley, husbandman, with Alice, his wife, and Rose Allin, her daughter, upon their return home, abstained from church, which induced the bigoted priest secretly to write to Bonner. For a short time they absconded, but returniong again, March 7, one Edmund Tyrrel, (a relation of the Tyrrel who murdered King Edward V and his brother) with the officers, entered the house while Munt and his wife were in bed, and informed them that they must go to Colchester Castle. Mrs. Munt at that time being very ill, requested her daughter to get her some drink; leave being permitted, Rose took a candle and a mug; and in returning through the house was met by Tyrrel, who cautioned her to advise her parents to become good Catholics. Rose briefly informed him that they had the Holy Ghost for their adviser; and that she was ready to lay down her own life for the same cause. Turning to his company, he remarked that she was willing to burn; and one of them told him to prove her, and see what she would do by and by. The unfeeling wretch immediately executed this project; and, seizing the young woman by the wrist, he held the lighted candle under her hand, burning it crosswise on the back, until the tendons divided from the flesh, during which he loaded her with many opprobrious epithets. She endured his rage unmoved, and then, when he had ceased the torture, she asked him to begin at her feet or head, for he need not fear that his employer would one day repay him. After this she took the drink to her mother.\n\nThis cruel act of torture does not stand alone on record.\n\nBonner had served a poor blind harper in nearly the same manner, who had steadily maintained a hope that if every joint of him were to be burnt, he should not fly from the faith. Bonner, upon this, privately made a signal to his men, to bring a burning coal, which they placed in the poor man's hand, and then by force held it closed, until it burnt into the flesh deeply.\n\nGeorge Eagles, tailor, was indicted for having prayed that 'God would turn Queen Mary's heart, or take her away'; the ostensible cause of his death was his religion, for treason could hardly be imagined in praying for the reformation of such an execrable soul as that of Mary. Being condemned for this crime, he was drawn to the place of execution upon a sledge, with two robbers, who were executed with him. After Eagles had mounted the ladder, and been turned off a short time, he was cut down before he was at all insensible; a bailiff, named William Swallow, then dragged him to the sledge, and with a common blunt cleaver, hacked off the head; in a manner equally clumsy and cruel, he opened his body and tore out the heart.\n\nIn all this suffering the poor martyr repined not, but to the last called upon his Savior. The fury of these bigots did not end here; the intestines were burnt, and the body was quartered, the four parts being sent to Colchester, Harwich, Chelmsford, and St. Rouse's. Chelmsford had the honor of retaining his head, which was affixed to a long pole in the market place. In time it was blown down, and lay several days in the street, until it was buried at night in the churchyard. God's judgment not long after fell upon Swallow, who in his old age became a beggar, and who was affected with a leprosy that made him obnoxious even to the animal creation; nor did Richard Potts, who troubled Eagles in his dying moments, escape the visiting hand of God.Mrs. Joyce LewesThis lady was the wife of Mr. T. Lewes, of Manchester. She had received the Romish religion as true, until the burning of that pious martyr, Mr. Saunders, at Coventry. Understanding that his death arose from a refusal to receive the Mass, she began to inquire into the ground of his refusal, and her conscience, as it began to be enlightened, became restless and alarmed. In this inquietude, she resorted to Mr. John Glover, who lived near, and requested that he would unfold those rich sources of Gospel knowledge he possessed, particularly upon the subject of transubstantiation. He easily succeeded in convincing her that the mummery of popery and the Mass were at variance with God's most holy Word, and honestly reproved her for following too much the vanities of a wicked world. It was to her indeed a word in season, for she soon became weary of her former sinful life and resolved to abandon the Mass and dilatrous worship. Though compelled by her husband's violence to go to church, her contempt of the holy water and other ceremonies was so manifest, that she was accused before the bishop for despising the sacramentals.\n\nA citation, addressed to her, immediately followed, which was given to Mr. Lewes, who, in a fit of passion, held a dagger to the throat of the officer, and made him eat it, after which he caused him to drink it down, and then sent him away. But for this the bishop summoned Mr. Lewest before him as well as his wife; the former readily submitted, but the latter resolutely affirmed, that, in refusing holy water, she neither offended God, nor any part of his laws. She was sent home for a month, her husband being bound for her appearance, during which time Mr. Glover impressed upon her the necessity of doing what she did, not from self-vanity, but for the honor and glory of God.\n\nMr. Glover and others earnestly exhorted Lewest to forfeit the money he was bound in, rather than subject his wife to certain death; but he was deaf to the voice of humanity, and delivered her over to the bishop, who soon found sufficient cause to consign her to a loathsome prison, whence she was several times brought for examination. At the last time the bishop reasoned with her upon the fitness of her coming to Mass, and receiving as sacred the Sacrament and sacramentals of the Holy Ghost. \"If these things were in the Word of God,\" said Mrs. Lewes, \"I would with all my heart receive, believe, and esteem them.\" The bishop, with the most ignorant and impious effrontery, replied, \"If thou wilt believe no more than what is warranted by Scriptures, thou art in a state of damnation!\" Astonished at such a declaration, this worthy sufferer ably rejoined that his words were as impure as they were profane.\n\nAfter condemnation, she lay a twelvemonth in prison, the sheriff not being willing to put her to death in his time, though he had been but just chosen. When her death warrant came from London, she sent for some friends, whom she consulted in what manner her death might be more glorious to the name of God, and injurious to the cause of God's enemies. Smilingly, she said: \"As for death, I think but lightly of. When I know that I shall behold the amiable countenance of Christ my dear Savior, the ugly face of death does not much trouble me.\" The evening before she suffered, two priests were anxious to visit her, but she refused both their confession and absolution, when she could hold a better communication with the High Priest of souls. About three o'clock in the morning, Satan began to shoot his fiery darts, by putting into her mind to doubt whether she was chosen to eternal life, and Christ died for her. Her friends readily pointed out to her those consolatory passages of Scripture which comfort the fainting heart, and treat of the Redeemer who taketh away the sins of the world.\n\nAbout eight o'clock the sheriff announced to her that she had but an hour to live; she was at first cast down, but this soon passed away, and she thanked God that her life was about to be devoted to His service. The sheriff granted permission for two friends to accompany her to the stake-an indulgence for which he was afterward severely handled. Mr. Reniger and Mr. Bernher led her to the place of execution; in going to which, from its distance, her great weakness, and the press of the people, she had nearly fainted. Three times she prayed fervently that God would deliver the land from popery and the idolatrous Mass; and the people for the most part, as well as the sheriff, said Amen.\n\nWhen she had prayed, she took the cup, (which had been filled with water to refresh her,) and said, \"I drink to all them that unfeignedly love the Gospel of Christ, and wish for the abolition of popery.\" Her friends, and a great many women of the place, drank with her, for which most of them afterward were enjoined penance.\n\nWhen chained to the stake, her countenance was cheerful, and the roses of her cheeks were not abated. Her hands were extended towards heaven until the fire rendered them powerless, when her soul was received int o the arms of the Creator. The duration of her agony was but short, as the under-sheriff, at the request of her friends, had prepared such excellent fuel that she was in a few minutes overwhelmed with smoke and flame. The case of this lady drew a tear of pity from everyone who had a heart not callous to humanity.Executions at IslingtonAbout the seventeenth of September, suffered at Islington the following four professors of Christ: Ralph Allerton, James Austoo, Margery Austoo, and Richard Roth.\n\nJames Austoo and his wife, of St. Allhallows, Barking, London, were sentenced for not believing in the presence. Richard Roth rejected the seven Sacraments, and was accused of comforting the heretics by the following letter written in his own blood, and intended to have been sent to his friends at Colchester:\n\n\"O dear Brethren and Sisters,\n\"How much reason have you to rejoice in God, that He hath given you such faith to overcome this bloodthirsty tyrant thus far! And no doubt He that hath begun that good work in you, will fulfill it unto the end. O dear hearts in Christ, what a crown of glory shall ye receive with Christ in the kingdom of God! O that it had been the good will of God that I had been ready to have gone with you; for I lie in my lord's Little-ease by day, and in the night I lie in the Coalhouse, apart from Ralph Allerton, or any other; and we look every day when we shall be condemned; for he said that I should be burned within ten days before Easter; but I lie still at the pool's brink, and every man goeth in before me; but we abide patiently the Lord's leisure, with many bonds, in fetters and stocks, by which we have received great joy of God. And now fare you well, dear brethren and sisters, in this world, but I trust to see you in the heavens face to face.\n\"O brother Munt, with your wife and my sister Rose, how blessed are you in the Lord, that God hath found you worthy to suffer for His sake! with all the rest of my dear brethren and sisters known and unknown. O be joyful even unto death. Fear it not, saith Christ, for I have overcome death. O dear heart, seeing that Jesus Christ will be our help, O tarry you the Lord's leisure. Be strong, let your hearts be of good comfort, and wait you still for the Lord. He is at hand. Yea, the angel of the Lord pitcheth his tent round about them that fear him, and delivereth them which way he seeth best. For our lives are in the Lord's hands; and they can do nothing unto us before God suffer them. Therefore give all thanks to God.\n\"O dear hearts, you shall be clothed in long white garments upon the mount of Sion, with the multitude of saints, and with Jesus Christ our Savior, who will never forsake us. O blessed virgins, ye have played the wise virgins' part, in that ye have taken oil in your lamps that ye may go in with the Bridegroom, when he cometh, into the everlasting joy with Him. But as for the foolish, they shall be shut out, because they made not themselves ready to suffer with Christ, neither go about to take up His cross. O dear hearts, how precious shall your death be in the sight of the Lord! for dear is the death of His saints. O fare you well, and pray. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen, Amen. Pray, pray, pray!\n\"Written by me, with my own blood,\"RICHARD ROTH.\"This letter, so justly denominating Bonner the \"bloodthirsty tyrant,\" was not likely to excite his compassion. Roth accused him of bringing them to secret examination by night, because he was afraid of the people by day. Resisting every temptation to recant, he was condemned, and on September 17, 1557, these four martyrs perished at Islington, for the testimony of the Lamb, who was slain that they might be of the redeemed of God.\n\nJohn Noyes, a shoemaker, of Laxfield, Suffolk, was taken to Eye, and at midnight, September 21, 1557, he was brought from Eye to Laxfield to be burned. On the following morning he was led to the stake, prepared for the horrid sacrifice. Mr. Noyes, on coming to the fatal spot, knelt down, prayed, and rehearsed the Fiftieth Psalm. When the chain enveloped him, he said, \"Fear not them that kill the body, but fear him that can kill both body and soul, and cast it into everlasting fire!\" As one Cadman placed a fagot against him, he blessed the hour in which he was born to die for the truth; and while trusting only upon the all-sufficient merits of the Redeemer, fire was set to the pile, and the blazing fagots in a short time stifled his last words, \"Lord, have mercy on me! Christ, have mercy upon me!\" The ashes of the body were buried in a pit, and with them one of his feet, whole to the ankle, with the stocking on.Mrs. Cicely OrmesThis young martyr, aged twenty-two, was the wife of Mr. Edmund Ormes, worsted weaver of St. Lawrence, Norwich. At the death of Miller and Elizabeth Cooper, before mentioned, she had said that she would pledge them of the same cup they drank of. For these words she was brought to the chanellor, who would have discharged her upon promising to go to church, and to keep her belief to herself. As she would not consent to this, the chancellor urged that he had shown more lenity to her than any other person, and was unwilling to condemn her, because she was an ignorant foolish woman; to this she replied, (perhaps with more shrewdness than he expected,) that however great his desire might be to spare her sinful flesh, it could not equal her inclination to surrender it up in so great a quarrel. The chancellor then pronounced the fiery sentence, and September 23, 1557, she was brought to the stake, at eight o'clock in the morning.\n\nAfter declaring her faith to the people, she laid her hand on the stake, and said, \"Welcome, thou cross of Christ.\" Her hand was sooted in doing this, (for it was the same stake at which Miller and Cooper were burnt,) and she at first wiped it; but directly after again welcomed and embraced it as the \"sweet cross of Christ.\" After the tormentors had kindled the fire, she said, \"My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit doth rejoice in God my Savior.\" Then crossing her hands upon her breast, and looking upwards with the utmost serenity, she stood the fiery furnace. Her hands continued gradually to rise until the sinews were dried, and then they fell. She uttered no sigh of pain, but yielded her life, an emblem of that celestial paradise in which is the presence of God, blessed forever.\n\nIt might be contended that this martyr voluntarily sought her own death, as the chancellor scarcely exacted any other penance of her than to keep her belief to herself; yet it should seem in this instance as if God had chosen her to be a shining light, for a twelve-month before she was taken, she had recanted; but she was wretched until the chancellor was informed, by letter, that she repented of her recantation from the bottom of her heart. As if to compensate for her former apostasy, and to convince the Catholics that she meant to more to compromise for her personal security, she boldly refused his friendly offer of permitting her to temporize. Her courage in such a cause deserves commendation-the cause of Him who has said, \"Whoever is ashamed of me on earth, of such will I be ashamed in heaven.\"Rev. John RoughThis pious martyr was a Scotchman. At the age of seventeen, he entered himself as one of the order of Black Friars, at Stirling, in Scotland. He had been kept out of an inheritance by his friends, and he took this step in revenge for their conduct to him. After being there sixteen years, Lord Hamilton, earl of Arran, taking a liking to him, the archbishop of St. Andrew's induced the provincial of the house to dispense with his habit and order; and he thus became the earl's chaplain. He remained in this spiritual employment a year, and in that time God wrought in him a saving knowledge of the truth; for which reason the earl sent him to preach in the freedom of Ayr, where he remained four years; but finding danger there from the religious complexion of the times, and learning that there was much Gospel freedom in England, he travelled up to the duke of Somerset, then Lord Protector of England, who gave him a yearly salary of twenty pounds, and authorized him, to preach at Carlisle, Berwick, and Newcastle, where he married. He was afterward removed to a benefice at Hull, in which he remained until the death of Edward VI.\n\nIn consequence of the tide of persecution then setting in, he fled with his wife to Friesland, and at Nordon they followed the occupation of knitting hose, caps, etc., for subsistence. Impeded in his business by the want of yarn, he came over to England to procure a quantity, and on November 10, arrived in London, where he soon heard of a secret society of the faithful, to whom he joined himself, and was in a short time elected their minister, in which occupation he strengthened them in every good resolution.\n\nOn December 12, through the information of one Taylor, a member of the society, Mr. Rough, with Cuthbert Symson and others, was taken up in the Saracen's Head, Islington, where, under the pretext of coming to see a play, their religious exercises were holden. The queen's vice-chamberlain conducted Rough and Symson before the Council, in whose presence they were charged with meeting to celebrate the Communion. The Council wrote to Bonner and he lost no time in this affair of blood. In three days he had him up, and on the next (the twentieth) resolved to condemn him. The charges laid against him were, that he, being a priest, was married, and that he had rejected the service in the Latin tongue. Rough wanted not arguments to reply to these flimsy tenets. In short, he was degraded and condemned.\n\n\n\nMr. Rough, it should be noticed, when in the north, in Edward VI's reign, had saved Dr. Watson's life, who afterward sat with Bishop Bonner on the bench. This ungrateful prelate, in return for the kind act he had received, boldly accused Mr. Rough of being the most pernicious heretic in the country. The godly minister reproved him for his malicious spirit; he affirmed that, during the thirty years he had lived, he had never bowed the knee to Baal; and that twice at Rome he had seen the pope born about on men's shoulders with the false-named Sacrament carried before him, presenting a true picture of the very Antichrist; yet was more reverence shown to him than to the wafer, which they accounted to be their God. \"Ah?\" said Bonner, rising, and making towards him, as if he would have torn his garment, \"Hast thou been at Rome, and seen our holy father the pope, and dost thou blaspheme him after this sort?\" This said, he fell upon him, tore off a piece of his beard, and that the day might begin to his own satisfaction, he ordered the object of his rage to be burnt by half-past five the following morning.Cuthbert SymsonFew professors of Christ possessed more activity and zeal than this excellent person. He not only labored to preserve his friends from the contagion of popery, but he labored to guard them against the terrors of persecution. He was deacon of the little congregation over which Mr. Rough presided as minister.\n\nMr. Symson has written an account of his own sufferings, which he cannot detail better than in his own words:\n\n\"On the thirteenth of December, 1557, I was committed by the Council to the Tower of London. On the following Thursday, I was called into the ward-room, before the constable of the Tower, and the recorder of London, Mr. Cholmly, who commanded me to inform them of the names of those who came to the English service. I answered that I would declare nothing; in consequence of my refusal, I was set upon a rack of iron, as I judge for the space of three hours!\n\"They then asked me if I would confess: I answered as before.\nAfter being unbound, I was carried back to my lodging. The Sunday after I was brought to the same place again, before the lieutenant and recorder of London, and they examined me. As I had answered before, so I answered now. Then the lieutenant swore by God I should tell; after which my two forefingers were bound together, and a small arrow placed between them, they drew it through so fast that the blood followed, and the arrow brake.\n\"After enduring the rack twice again, I was retaken to my lodging, and ten days after the lieutenant asked me if I would not now confess that which they had before asked of me. I answered, that I had already said as much as I would. Three weeks after I was sent to the priest, where I was greatly assaulted, and at whose hand I received the pope's curse, for bearing witness of the resurrection of Christ. And thus I commend you to God, and to the Word of His grace, with all those who unfeignedly call upon the name of Jesus; desiring God of His endless mercy, through the merits of His dear Son Jesus Christ, to bring us all to His everlasting Kingdom, Amen. I praise God for His great mercy shown upon us. Sing Hosanna to the Highest with me, Cuthbert Symson. God forgive my sins! I ask forgiveness of all the world, and I forgive all the world, and thus I leave the world, in the hope of a joyful resurrection!\"\n\nIf this account be duly considered, what a picture of repeated tortures does it present! But even the cruelty of the narration is exceeded by the patient meekness with which it was endured. Here are no expressions of malice, no invocations even of God's retributive justice, not a complaint of suffering wrongfully! On the contrary, praise to God, forgiveness of sin, and a forgiving all the world, concludes this unaffected interesting narrative.\n\nBonner's admiration was excited by the steadfast coolness of this martyr. Speaking of Mr. Symson in the consistory, he said, \"You see what a personable man he is, and then of his patience, I affirm, that, if he were not a heretic, he is a man of the greatest patience that ever came before me. Thrice in one day has he been racked in the Tower; in my house also he has felt sorrow, and yet never have I seen his patience broken.\"\n\nThe day before this pious deacon was to be condemned, while in the stocks in the bishop's coal-house, he had the vision of a glorified form, which much encouraged him. This he certainly attested to his wife, to Mr. Austen, and others, before his death.\n\nWith this ornament of the Christian Reformation were apprehended Mr. Hugh Foxe and John Devinish; the three were brought before Bonner, March 19, 1558, and the papistical articles tendered. They rejected them, and were all condemned. As they worshipped together in the same society, at Islington, so they suffered together in Smithfield, March 28; in whose death the God of Grace was glorified, and true believers confirmed!Thomas Hudson, Thomas Carman, and William SeamenWere condemned by a bigoted vicar of Aylesbury, named Berry.\n\nThe spot of execution was called Lollard's Pit, without Bishipsgate, at Norwich. After joining together in humble petition to the throne of grace, they rose, went to the stake, and were encircled with their chains. To the great surprise of the spectators, Hudson slipped from under his chains, and came forward. A great opinion prevailed that he was about to recant; others thought that he wanted further time. In the meantime, his companions at the stake urged every promise and exhortation to support him. The hopes of the enemies of the cross, however, were disappointed: the good man, far from fearing the smallest personal terror at the approaching pangs of death, was only alarmed thathis Savior's face seemed to be hidden from him. Falling upon his knees, his spirit wrestled with God, and God verified the words of His Son, \"Ask, and it shall be given.\" The martyr rose in an ecstasy of joy, and exclaimed, \"Now, I thank God, I am strong! and care not what man can do to me!\" With an unruffled countenance he replaced himself under the chain, joined his fellow-sufferers, and with them suffered death, to the comfort of the godly, and the confusion of Antichrist.\n\nBerry, unsatiated with this demoniacal act, summoned up two hundred persons in the town of Aylesham, whom he compelled to kneel to the cross at Pentecost, and inflicted other punishments. He struck a poor man for a trifling word, with a flail, which proved fatal to the unoffending object. He also gave a woman named Alice Oxes, so heavy a blow with his fist, as she met him entering the hall when he was in an ill-humor, that she died with the violence. This priest was rich, and possessed great authority; he was a reprobate, and, like the priesthood, he abstained from marriage, to enjoy the more a debauched and licentious life. The Sunday after the death of Queen Mary, he was revelling with one of his concubines, before vespers; he then went to church, administered baptism, and in his return to his lascivious pastime, he was smitten by the hand of God. Without a moment given for repentance, he fell to the ground, and a groan was the only articulation permitted him. In him we may behold the difference between the end of a martyr and a persecutor.The Story of Roger HollandIn a retired close near a field, in Islington, a company of decent persons had assembled, to the number of forty. While they were religiously engaged in praying and expounding the Scripture, twenty-seven of them were carried before Sir Roger Cholmly. Some of the women made their escape, twenty-two were committed to Newgate, who continued in prison seven weeks. Previous to their examination, they were informed by the keeper, Alexander, that nothing more was requisite to procure their discharge, than to hear Mass. Easy as this condition may seem, these martyrs valued their purity of conscience more than loss of life or property; hence, thirteen were burnt, seven in Smithfield, and six at Brentford; two died in prison, and the other seven were providentially preserved. The names of the seven who suffered were, H. Pond, R. Estland, R. Southain, M. Ricarby, J. Floyd, J. Holiday, and Roger Holland. They were sent to Newgate, June 16, 1558, and executed on the twenty-seventh.\n\nThis Roger Holland, a merchant-tailor of London, was first an apprentice with one Master Kemption, at the Black Boy in Watling Street, giving himself to dancing, fencing, gaming, banqueting, and wanton company. He had received for his master certain money, to the sum of thirty pounds; and lost every groat at dice. Therefore he purposed to convey himself away beyond the seas, either into France or into Flanders.\n\nWith this resolution, he called early in the morning on a discreet servant in the house, named Elizabeth, who professed the Gospel, and lived a life that did honor to her profession. To her he revealed the loss his folly had occasioned, regretted that he had not followed her advice, and begged her to give his master a note of hand from him acknowledging the debt, which he would repay if ever it were in his power; he also entreated his disgraceful conduct might be kept secret, lest it would bring the gray hairs to his father with sorrow to a premature grave.\n\nThe maid, with a generosity and Christian principle rarely surpassed, conscious that his imprudence might be his ruin, brought him the thirty pounds, which was part of a sum of money recently left her by legacy. \"Here,\" said she, \"is the sum requisite: you shall take the money, and I will keep the note; but expressly on this condition, that you abandon all lewd and vicious company; that you neither swear nor talk immodestly, and game no more; for, should I learn that you do, I will immediately show this note to your master. I also require, that you shall promise me to attend the daily lecture at Allhallows, and the sermon at St. Paul's every Sunday; that you cast away all your books of popery, and in their place substitute the Testament and the Book of Service, and that you read the Scriptures with reverence and fear, calling upon God for his grace to direct you in his truth. Pray also fervently to God, to pardon your former offences, and not to remember the sins of your youth, and would you obtain his favor ever dread to break his laws or offend his majesty. So shall God have you in His keeping, and grant you your heart's desire.\" We must honor the memory of this excellent domestic, whose pious endeavors were equally directed to benefit the thoughtless youth in this life and that which is to come. God did not suffer the wish of this excellent domestic to be thrown upon a barren soil; within half a year after the licentious Holland became a zealous professor of the Gospel, and was an instrument of conversion to his father and others whom he visited in Lancashire, to their spiritual comfort and reformation from popery.\n\nHis father, pleased with his change of conduct, gave him forty pounds to commence business with in London.\n\nThen Roger repaired to London again, and came to the maid that lent him the money to pay his master withal, and said unto her, \"Elizabeth, here is thy money I borrowed of thee; and for the friendship, good will, and the good counsel I have received at thy hands, to recompense thee I am not able, otherwise than to make thee my wife.\" And soon after they were married, which was in the first year of Queen Mary.\n\nAfter this he remained in the congregations of the faithful, until, the last year of Queen Mary, he, with the six others aforesaid, were taken.\n\nAnd after Roger Holland there was none suffered in Smithfield for the testimony of the Gospel, God be thanked.Flagellations by BonnerWhen this Catholic hyena found that neither persuasions, threats, nor imprisonment, could produce any alteration in the mind of a youth named Thomas Hinshaw, he sent him to Fulham, and during the first night set him in the stocks, with no other allowance than bread and water. The following morning he came to see if this punishment had worked any change in his mind, and finding none, he sent Dr. Harpsfield, his archdeacon, to converse with him. The doctor was soon out f humor at his replies, called him peevish boy, and asked him if he thought he went about to damn his soul? \"I am persuaded,\" said Thomas, \"that you labor to promote the dark kingdom of the devil, not for the love of the truth.\" These words the doctor conveyed to the bishop, who, in a passion that almost prevented articulation, came to Thomas, and said, \"Dost thou answer my archdeacon thus, thou naughty boy? But I'll soon handle thee well enough for it, be assured!\" Two willow twigs were then brought him, and causing the unresisting youth to kneel against a long bench, in an arbor in his garden, he scourged him until he was compelled to cease for want of breath and fatigue. One of the rods was worn quite away.\n\nMany other conflicts did Hinsaw undergo from the bishop; who, at length, to remove him effectually, procured false witnesses to lay articles against him, all of which the young man denied, and, in short, refused to answer any interrogatories administered to him. A fortnight after this, the young man was attacked by a burning ague, and at the request of his master. Mr. Pugson, of St. Paul's church-yard, he was removed, the bishop not doubting that he had given him his death in the natural way; he however remained ill above a year, and in the mean time Queen Mary died, by which act of providence he escaped Bonner's rage.\n\nJohn Willes was another faithful person, on whom the scourging hand of Bonner fell. He was the brother of Richard Willes, before mentioned, burnt at Brentford. Hinshaw and Willes were confined in Bonner's coal house together, and afterward removed to Fulham, where he and Hinshaw remained during eight or ten days, in the stocks. Bonner's persecuting spirit betrayed itself in his treatment of Willes during his examinations, often striking him on the head with a stick, seizing him by the ears, and filliping him under the chin, saying he held down his head like a thief. This producing no signs of recantation, he took him into his orchard, and in a small arbor there he flogged him first with a willow rod, and then with birch, until he was exhausted. This cruel ferocity arose from the answer of the poor sufferer, who, upon being asked how long it was since he had crept to the cross, replied, 'Not since he had come to years of discretion, nor would he, though he should be torn to pieces by wild horses.' Bonner then bade him make the sign of the cross on his forehead, which he refused to do, and thus was led to the orchard.\n\nOne day, when in the stocks, Bonner asked him how he liked his lodging and fare. \"Well enough,\" said Willes, \"might I have a little straw to sit or lie upon.\" Just at this time came in Willes' wife, then largely pregnant, and entreated the bishop for her husband, boldly declaring that she would be delivered in the house, if he were not suffered to go with her. To get rid of the good wife's importunity, and the trouble of a lying-in woman in his palace, he bade Willes make the sign of the cross, and say, In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti, Amen. Willes omitted the sign, and repeated the words, \"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, Amen.\" Bonner would have the words repeated in Latin, to which Willes made no objection, knowing the meaning of the words. He was then permitted to go home with his wife, his kinsman Robert Rouze being charged to bring him to St. Paul's the next day, whither he himself went, and subscribing to a Latin instrument of little importance, was liberated. This is the last of the twenty-two taken at Islington.Rev. Richard YeomanThis devout aged person was curate to Dr. Taylor, at Hadley, and eminently qualified for his sacred function. Dr. Taylor left him the curacy at his departure, but no sooner had Mr. Newall gotten the benefice, than he removed Mr. Yeoman, and substituted a Romish priest. After this he wandered from place to place, exhorting all men to stand faithfully to God's Word, earnestly to give themselves unto prayer, with patience to bear the cross now laid upon them for their trial, with boldness to confess the truth before their adversaries, and with an undoubted hope to wait for the crown and reward of eternal felicity. But when he perceived his adversaries lay wait for him, he went into Kent, and with a little packet of laces, pins, points, etc., he travelled from village to village, selling such things, and in this manner subsisted himself, his wife, and children.\n\nAt last Justice Moile, of Kent, took Mr. Yeoman, and set him in the stocks a day and a night; but, having no evident matter to charge him with, he let him go again. Coming secretly again to Hadley, he tarried with his poor wife, who kept him privately, in a chamber of the town house, commonly called the Guildhall, more than a year. During this time the good old father abode in a chamber locked up all the day, spending his time in devout prayer, in reading the Scriptures, and in carding the wool which his wife spun. His wife also begged bread for herself and her children, by which precarious means they supported themselves. Thus the saints of God sustained hunger and misery, while the prophets of Baal lived in festivity, and were costily pampered at Jezebel's table.\n\nInformation being at length given to Newall, that Yeoman was secreted by his wife, he came, attended by the constables, and broke into the room where the object of his search lay in bed with his wife. He reproached the poor woman with being a whore, and would have indecently pulled the clothes off, but Yeoman resisted both this act of violence and the attack upon his wife's character, adding that he defied the pope and popery. He was then taken out, and set in stocks until day.\n\nIn the cage also with him was an old man, named John Dale, who had sat there three or four days, for exhorting the people during the time service was performing by Newall and his curate. His words were, \"O miserable and blind guides, will ye ever be blind leaders of the blind? Will ye never amend? Will ye never see the truth of God's Word? Will neither God's threats nor promises enter into your hearts? Will the blood of the martyrs nothing mollify your stony stomachs? O obdurate, hard-hearted, perverse, and crooked generation! to whom nothing can do good.\"\n\nThese words he spake in fervency of spirit agains tthe superstitious religion of Rome; wherefore Newall caused him forthwith to be attached, and set in the stocks in a cage, where he was kept until Sir Henry Doile, a justice, came to Hadley.\n\nWhen Yeoman was taken, the parson called earnestly upon Sir Henry Doile to send them both to prison. Sir Henry Doile as earnestly entreated the parson to consider the age of the men, and their mean condition; they were neither persons of note nor preachers; wherefore he proposed to let them be punished a day or two and to dismiss them, at least John Dale, who was no priest, and therefore, as he had so long sat in the cage, he thought it punishment enough for this time. When the parson heard this, he was exceedingly mad, and in a great rage called them pestilent heretics, unfit to live in the commonwealth of Christians.\n\nSir Henry, fearing to appear too merciful, Yeoman and Dale were pinioned, bound like thieves with their legs under the horses' bellies, and carried to Bury jail, where they were laid in irons; and because they continually rebuked popery, they were carried into the lowest dungeon, where John Dale, through the jail-sickness and evil-keeping, died soon after: his body was thrown out, and buried in the fields. He was a man of sixty-six years of age, a weaver by occupation, well learned in the holy Scriptures, steadfast in his confession of the true doctrines of Christ as set forth in King Edward's time; for which he joyfully suffered prison and chains, and from this worldly dungeon he departed in Christ to eternal glory, and the blessed paradise of everlasting felicity.\n\nAfter Dale's death, Yeoman was removed to Norwich prison, where, after strait and evil keeping, he was examined upon his faith and religion, and required to submit himself to his holy father the pope. \"I defy him, (quoth he), and all his detestable abomination: I will in no wise have to do with him.\" The chief articles objected to him, were his marriage and the Mass sacrifice. Finding he continued steadfast in the truth, he was condemned, degraded, and not only burnt, but most cruelly tormented in the fire. Thus he ended this poor and miserable life, and entered into that blessed bosom of Abraham, enjoying with Lazarus that rest which God has prepared for His elect.Thomas BenbridgeMr. Benbridge was a single gentleman, in the diocese of Winchester. He might have lived a gentleman's life, in the wealthy possessions of this world; but he chose rather to enter through the strait gate of persecution to the heavenly possession of life in the Lord's Kingdom, than to enjoy present pleasure with disquietude of conscience. Manfully standing against the papists for the defence of the sincere doctrine of Christ's Gospel, he was apprehended as an adversary to the Romish religion, and led for examination before the bishop of Winchester, where he underwent several conflicts for the truth against the bishop and his colleague; for which he was condemned, and some time after brought to the place of martyrdom by Sir Richard Pecksal, sheriff.\n\nWhen standing at the stake he began to untie his points, and to prepare himself; then he gave his gown to the keeper, by way of fee. His jerkin was trimmed with gold lace, which he gave to Sir Richard Pecksal, the high sheriff. His cap of velvet he took from his head, and threw away. Then, lifting his mind to the Lord, he engaged in prayer.\n\nWhen fastened to the stake, Dr. Seaton begged him to recant, and he should have his pardon; but when he saw that nothing availed, he told the people not to pray for him unless he would recant, no more than they would pray for a dog.\n\nMr. Benbridge, standing at the stake with his hands together in suchj a manner as the priest holds his hands in his Memento, Dr. Seaton came to him again, and exhorted him to recant, to whom he said, \"Away, Babylon, away!\" One that stood by said, \"Sir, cut his tongue out\"; another, a temporal man, railed at him worse than Dr. Seaton had done.\n\nWhen they saw he would not yield, they bade the tormentors to light the pile, before he was in any way covered with fagots. The fire first took away a piece of his beard, at which he did not shrink. Then it came on the other side and took his legs, and the nether stockings of his hose being leather, they made the fire pierce the sharper, so that the intolerable heat made him exclaim, \"I recant!\" and suddenly he trust the fire from him. Two or three of his friends being by, wished to save him; they stepped to the fire to help remove it, for which kindness they were sent to jail. The sheriff also of his own authority took him from the stake, and remitted him to prison, for which he was sent to the Fleet, and lay there sometime. Before, however, he was taken from the stake, Dr. Seaton wrote articles for him to subscribe to. To these Mr. Benbridge made so many objections that Dr. Seaton ordered them to set fire again to the pile. Then with much pain and grief of heart he subscribed to them upon a man's back.\n\nThis done, his gown was given him again, and he was led to prison. While there, he wrote a letter to Dr. Seaton, recanting those words he had spoken at the stake, and the articles which he had subscribed, for he was grieved that he had ever signed them. The same day se'night he was again brought to the stake, where the vile tormentors rather broiled than burnt him. The Lord give his enemies repentance!Mrs. PrestFrom the number condemned in this fanatical reign, it is almost impossible to obtain the name of every martyr, or to embellish the history of all with anecdotes and exemplifications of Christian conduct. Thanks be to Providence, our cruel task begins to draw towards a conclusion, with the end of the reign of papal terror and bloodshed. Monarchs, who sit upon thrones possessed by hereditary right, should, of all others, consider that the laws of nature are the laws of God, and hence that the first law of nature is the preservation of their subjects. Maxims of persecutions, of torture, and of death, they should leave to those who have effected sovereignty by fraud or by sword; but where, except among a few miscreant emperors of Rome, and the Roman pontiffs, shall we find one whose memory is so \"damned to everlasting fame\" as that of Queen Mary? Nations bewail the hour which separates them forever from a beloved governor, but, with respect to that of Mary, it was the most blessed time of her whole reign. Heaven has ordained three great scourges for national sins-plague, pestilence, and famine. It was the will of God in Mary's reign to bring a fourth upon this kingdom, under the form of papistical persecution. It was sharp, but glorious; the fire which consumed the martyrs has undermined the popedom; and the Catholic states, at present the most bigoted and unenlightened, are those which are sunk lowest in the scale of moral dignity and political consequence. May they remain so, until the pure light of the Gospel shall dissipate the darkness of fanaticism and superstition! But to return.\n\nMrs. Prest for some time lived about Cornwall, where she had a husband and children, whose bigotry compelled her to frequent the abominations of the Church of Rome. Resolving to act as her conscience dictated, she quitted them, and made a living by spinning. After some time, returning home, she was accused by her neighbors, and brought to Exeter, to be examined before Dr. Troubleville, and his chancellor Blackston. As this martyr was accounted of inferior intellect, we shall put her in competition with the bishop, and let the reader judge which had the most of that knowledge conducive to everlasting life. The bishop bringing the question to issue, respecting the bread and wine being flesh and blood, Mrs. Prest said, \"I will demand of you whether you can deny your creed, which says, that Christ doth perpetually sit at the right hand of His Father, both body and soul, until He come again; or whether He be there in heaven our Advocate, and to make prayer for us unto God His Father? If He be so, He is not here on earth in a piece of bread. If He be not here, and if He do not dwell in temples made with hands, but in heaven, what! shall we seek Him here? If He did not offer His body once for all, why make you a new offering? If with one offering He made all perfect, why do you with a false offering make all imperfect? If He be to be worshipped in spirit and in truth, why do you worship a piece of bread? If He be eaten and drunken in faith and truth, if His flesh be not profitable to be among us, why do you say you make His flesh and blood, and say it is profitable for body and soul? Alas! I am a poor woman, but rather than to do as you do, I would live no longer. I have said, Sir.\"\n\nBishop. I promise you, you are a jolly Protestant. I pray you in what school have you been brought up?\nMrs. Prest. I have upon the Sundays visited the sermons, and there have I learned such things as are so fixed in my breast, that death shall not separate them.\nB. O foolish woman, who will waste his breath upon thee, or such as thou art? But how chanceth it that thou wentest away from thy husband? If thou wert an honest woman, thou wouldst not have left thy husband and children, and run about the country like a fugitive.\nMrs. P. Sir, I labored for my livingl; and as my Master Christ counselleth me, when I was persecuted in one city, I fled into another.\nB. Who persecuted thee?\nMrs. P. My husband and my children. For when I would have them to leave idolatry, and to worship God in heaven, he would not hear me, but he with his children rebuked me, and troubled me. I fled not for whoredom, nor for theft, but because I would be no partaker with him and his of that foul idol the Mass; and wheresoever I was, as oft as I could, upon Sundays and holydays. I made excuses not to go to the popish Church.\nB. Belike then you are a good housewife, to fly from your husband the Church.\nMrs. P. My housewifery is but small; but God gave me grace to go to the true Church.\nB. The true Church, what dost thou mean?\nMrs. P. Not your popish Church, full of idols and abominations, but where two or three are gathered together in the name of God, to that Church will I go as long as I live.\nB. Belike then you have a church of your own. Well, let this mad woman be put down to prison until we send for her husband.\nMrs. P. No, I have but one husband, who is here already in this city, and in prison with me, from whom I will never depart.\n\nSome persons present endeavoring to convince the bishop she was not in her right senses, she was permitted to depart. The keeper of the bishop's prisons took her into his house, where she either spun worked as a servant, or walked about the city, discoursing upon the Sacrament of the altar. Her husband was sent for to take her home, but this she refused while the cause of religion could be served. She was too active to be idle, and her conversation, simple as they affected to think her, excited the attention of several Catholic priests and friars. They teased her with questions, until she answered them angrily, and this excited a laugh at her warmth.\n\n\"Nay,\" said she, \"you have more need to weep than to laugh, and to be sorry that ever you were born, to be the chaplains of that whore of Babylon. I defy him and all his falsehood; and get you away from me, you do but trouble my conscience. You would have me follow your doings; I will first lose my life. I pray you depart.\"\n\n\"Why, thou foolish woman,\" said they, \"we come to thee for thy profit and soul's health.\" To which she replied, \"What profit ariseth by you, that teach nothing but lies for truth? how save you souls, when you preach nothing but lies, and destroy souls?\"\n\n\"How provest thou that?\" said they.\n\n\"Do you not destroy your souls, when you teach the people to worship idols, stocks, and stones, the works of men's hands? and to worship a false God of your own making of a piece of bread, and teach that the pope is God's vicar, and hath power to forgive sins? and that there is a purgatory, when God's Son hath by His passion purged all? and say you make God and sacrifice Him, when Christ's body was a sacrifice once for all? Do you not teach the people to number their sins in your ears, and say they will be damned if they confess not all; when God's Word saith, Who can number his sins? Do you not promise them trentals and dirges and Masses for souls, and sell your prayers for money, and make them buy pardons, and trust to such foolish inventions of your imaginations? Do you not altogether act against God? Do you not teach us to pray upon beads, and to pray unto saints, and say they can pray for us? Do you not make holy water and holy bread to fray devils? Do you not do a thousand more abominations? And yet you say, you come for my profit, and to save my soul. No, no, one hath saved me. Farewell, you with your salvation.\"\n\nDuring the liberty granted her by the bishop, before-mentioned, she went into St. Peter's Church, and there found a skilful Dutchman, who was affixing new noses to certain fine images which had been disfigured in King Edward's time; to whom she said, \"What a madman art thou, to make them new noses, which within a few days shall all lose their heads?\" The Dutchman accused her and laid it hard to her charge. And she said unto him, \"Thou art accursed, and so are thy images.\" He called her a whore. \"Nay,\" said she, \"thy images are whores, and thou art a whore-hunter; for doth not God say, 'You go a whoring after strange gods, figures of your own making? and thou art one of them.'\" After this she was ordered to be confined, and had no more liberty.\n\nDuring the time of her imprisonment, many visited her, some sent by the bishop, and some of their own will, among these was one Daniel, a great preacher of the Gospel, in the days of King Edward, about Cornwall and Devonshire, but who, through the grievous persecution he had sustained, had fallen off. Earnestly did she exhort him to repent with Peter, and to be more constant in his profession.\n\nMrs. Walter Rauley and Mr. William and John Kede, persons of great respectability, bore ample testimony of her godly conversation, declaring, that unless God were with her, it were impossible she could have so ably defended the cause of Christ. Indeed, to sum up the character of this poor woman, she united the serpent and the dove, abounding in the highest wisdom joined to the greatest simplicity. She endured imprisonment, threatenings, taunts, and the vilest epithets, but nothing could induce her to swerve; her heart was fixed; she had cast anchor; nor could all the wounds of persecution remove her from the rock on which her hopes of felicity were built.\n\nSuch was her memory, that, without learning, she could tell in what chapter any text of Scripture was contained: on account of this singular property, one Gregory Basset, a rank papist, said she was deranged, and talked as a parrot, wild without meaning. At length, having tried every manner without effect to make her nominally a Catholic, they condemned her. After this, one exhorted her to leave her opinions, and go home to her family, as she was poor and illiterate. \"True, (said she) though I am not learned, I am content to be a witness of Christ's death, and I pray you make no longer delay with me; for my heart is fixed, and I will never say otherwise, nor turn to your superstitious doing.\"\n\nTo the disgrace of Mr. Blackston, treasurer of the church, he would often send for this poor martyr from prison, to make sport for him and a woman whom he kept; putting religious questions to her, and turning her answers into ridicule. This done, he sent her back to her wretched dungeon, while he battened upon the good things of this world.\n\nThere was perhaps something simply ludicrous in the form of Mrs. Prest, as she was of a very short stature, thick set, and about fifty-four years of age; but her countenance was cheerful and lively, as if prepared for the day of her marriage with the Lamb. To mock at her form was an indirect accusation of her Creator, who framed her after the fashion He liked best, and gave her a mind that far excelled the transient endowments of perishable flesh. When she was offered money, she rejected it, \"because (said she) I am going to a city where money bears no mastery, and while I am here God has promised to feed me.\"\n\nWhen sentence was read, condemning her to the flames, she lifted up her voice and praised God, adding, \"This day have I found that which I have long sought.\" When they tempted her to recant, \"That will I not, (said she) God forbid that I should lose the life eternal, for this carnal and short life. I will never turn from my heavenly husband to my earthly husband; from the fellowship of angels to mortal children; and if my husband and children be faithful, then am I theirs. God is my father, God is my mother, God is my sister, my brother, my kinsman; God is my friend, most faithful.\"\n\nBeing delivered to the sheriff, she was led by the officer to the place of execution, without the walls of Exeter, called Sothenhey, where again the superstitious priests assaulted her. While they were tying her to the stake, she continued earnestly to exclaim \"God be merciful to me, a sinner!\" Patiently enduring the devouring conflagration, she was consumed to ashes, and thus ended a life which in unshaken fidelity to the cause of Christ, was not surpassed by that of any preceding martyr.Richard Sharpe, Thomas Banion, and Thomas HaleMr. Sharpe, weaver, of Bristol, was brought the ninth day of March, 1556, before Dr. Dalby, chancellor of the city of Bristol, and after examination concerning the Sacrament of the altar, was persuaded to recant; and on the twenty-ninth, he was enjoined to make his recantation in the parish church. But, scarcely had he publicly avowed his backsliding, before he felt in his conscience such a tormenting fiend, that he was unable to work at his occupation; hence, shortly after, one Sunday, he came into the parish church, called Temple, and after high Mass, stood up in the choir door, and said with a loud voice, \"Neighbors, bear me record that yonder idol (pointing to the altar) is the greatest and most abominable that ever was; and I am sorry that ever I denied my Lord God!\" Notwithstanding the constables were ordered to apprehend him, he was suffered to go out of the church; but at night he was apprehended and carried to Newgate. Shortly after, before the chancellor, denying the Sacrament of the altar to be the body and blood of Christ, he was condemned to be burned by Mr. Dalby. He was burnt the seventh of May, 1558, and died godly, patiently, and constantly, confessing the Protestant articles of faith.With him suffered Thomas Hale, shoemaker, of Bristol, who was condemned by Chcnallor Dalby. These martyrs were bound back to back.\n\nThomas Banion, a weaver, was burnt on August 27, of the same year, and died for the sake of the evangelical cause of his Savior.J. Corneford, of Wortham; C. Browne, of Maidstone; J. Herst, of Ashford; Alice Snoth, and Catharine Knight, an Aged WomanWith pleasure we have to record that these five martyrs were the last who suffered in the reign of Mary for the sake of the Protestant cause; but the malice of the papists was conspicuous in hastening their martyrdom, which might have been delayed until the event of the queen's illness was decided. It is reported that the archdeacon of Canterbury, judging that the sudden death of the queen would suspend the execution, travelled post from London, to have the satisfaction of adding another page to the black list of papistical sacrifices.\n\nThe articles against them were, as usual, the Sacramental elements and the idolatry of bending to images. They quoted St. John's words, \"Beware of images!\" and respecting the real presence, they urged according to St. Paul, \"the things which are seen are temporal.\" When sentence was about to be read against them, and excommunication to take place in the regular form, John Corneford, illuminated by the Holy Spirit, awfully turned the latter proceeding against themselves, and in a solemn impressive manner, recriminated their excommunication in the following words: \"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the most mighty God, and by the power of His Holy Spirit, and the authority of His holy Catholic and apostolic Church, we do here give into the hands of Satan to be destroyed, the bodies of all those blasphemers and heretics that maintain any error against His most holy Word, or do condemn His most holy truth for heresy, to the maintenance of any false church or foreign religion, so that by this Thy just judgment, O most mighty God, against Thy adversaries, Thy true religion may be known to Thy great glory and our comfort and to the edifying of all our nation. Good Lord, so be it. Amen.\"\n\nThis sentence was openly pronounced and registered, and, as if Providence had awarded that it should not be delivered in vain, within six days after, Queen Mary died, detested by all good men and accursed of God!\n\nThough acquainted with these circumstances, the archdeacon's implacability exceeded that of his great exemplary, Bonner, who, though he had several persons at that time under his fiery grasp, did not urge their deaths hastily, by which delay he certainly afforded them an opportunity of escape. At the queen's decease, many were in bonds: some just taken, some examined, and others condemned. The writs indeed were issued for several burnings, but by the death of the three instigators of Protestant murder-the chancellor, the bishop, and the queen, who fell nearly together, the condemned sheep were liberated, and lived many years to praise God for their happy deliverance.\n\nThese five martyrs, when at the stake, earnestly prayed that their blood might be the last shed, nor did they pray in vain. They died gloriously, and perfected the number God had selected to bear witness of the truth in this dreadful reign, whose names are recorded in the Book of Life; though last, not least among the saints made meet for immortality through the redeeming blood of the Lamb!\n\nCatharine Finlay, alias Knight, was first converted by her son's expounding the Scriptures to her, which wrought in her a perfect work that terminated in martyrdom. Alice Snoth at the stake sent for her grandmother and godfather, and rehearsed to them the articles of her faith, and the Commandments of God, thereby convincing the world that she knew her duty. She died calling upon the spectators to bear witness that she was a Christian woman, and suffered joyfully for the testimony of Christ's Gospel.\n\nAmong the numberless enormities committed by the merciless and uhnfeeling Bonner, the murder of this innocent and unoffending child may be ranged as the most horrid. His father, John Fetty, of the parish of Clerkenwell, by trade a tailor, and only twenty-four years of age, had made blessed election; he was fixed secure in eternal hope, and depended on Him who so builds His Church that the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. But alas! the very wife of his bosom, whose heart was hardened against the truth, and whose mind was influenced by the teachers of false doctrine, became his accuser. Brokenbery, a creature of the pope, and parson of the parish, received the information of this wedded Delilah, in consequence of which the poor man was apprehended. But here the awful judgment of an ever-righteous God, who is \"of purer eyes than to behold evil,\" fell upon this stone-hearted and perfidious woman; for no sooner was the injured husband captured by her wicked contriving, than she also was suddenly seized with madness, and exhibited an awful and awakening instance of God's power to punish the evil-doer. This dreadful circumstance had some effect upon the hearts of the ungodly hunters who had eagerly grasped their prey; but, in a relenting moment, they suffered him to remain with his unworthy wife, to return her good for evil, and to comfort two children, who, on his being sent to prison, would have been left without a protector, or have become a burden to the parish. As bad men act from little motives, we may place the indulgence shown him to the latter account.\n\nWe have noticed in the former part of our narratives of the martyrs, some whose affection would have led them even to sacrifice their own lives, to preserve their husbands; but here, agreeable to Scripture language, a mother proves, indeed, a monster in nature! Neither conjugal nor maternal affection could impress the heart of this disgraceful woman.\n\nAlthough our afflicted Christian had experienced so much cruelty and falsehood from the woman who was bound to him by every tie both human and divine, yet, with a mild and forbearing spirit, he overlooked her misdeeds, during her calamity endeavoring all he could to procure relief for her malady, and soothing her by every possible expression of tenderness: thus she became in a few weeks nearly restored to her senses. But, alas! she returned again to her sin, \"as a dog returneth to his vomit.\" Malice against the saints of the Most High was seated in her heart too firmly to be removed; and as her strength returned, her inclination to work wickedness returned with it. Her heart was hardened by the prince of darkness; and to her may be applied these afflicting and soul-harrowing words, \"Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil.\" Weighing this text duly with another, \"I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy,\" how shall we presume to refine away the sovereignty of God by arrainging Jehovah at the bar of human reason, which, in religious matters, is too often opposed by infinite wisdom? \"Broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat. Narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.\" The ways of heaven are indeed inscrutable, and it is our bounden duty to walk ever dependent on God, looking up to Him with humble confidence, and hope in His goodness, and ever confess His justice; and where we \"cannot unravel, there learn to trust.\" This wretched woman, pursuing the horrid dictates of a heart hardened and depraved, was scarcely confirmed in her recovery, when, stifling the dictates of honor, gratitude, and every natural affection, she again accused her husband, who was once more apprehended, and taken before Sir John Mordant, knight, and one of Queen Mary's commissioners.\n\nUpon examination, his judge finding him fixed in opinions which militated against those nursed by superstition and maintained by cruelty, he was sentenced to confinement and torture in Lollard's Tower. Here he was put into the painful stocks, and had a dish of water set by him, with a stone put into it, to what purpose God knoweth,e xcept it were to show that he should look for little other subsistence: which is credible enough, if we consider their like practices upon divers before mentioned in this history; as, among others, upon Richard Smith, who died through their cruel imprisonment touching whom, when a godly woman came to Dr. Story to have leave she might bury him, he asked her if he had any straw or blood in his mouth; but what he means thereby, I leave to the judgment of the wise.\n\nOn the first day of the third week of our martyr's sufferings, an object presented itself to his view, which made him indeed feel his tortures with all their force, and to execrate, with bitterness only short of cursing, the author of his misery. To mark and punish the proceedings of his tormentors, remained with the Most High, who noteth even the fall of a sparrow, and in whose sacred Word it is written, \"Vengeance is mine; I will repay.\" This object was his own son, a child of the tender age of eight years. For fifteen days, had its hapless father been suspended by his tormentor by the right arm and left leg, and sometimes by both, shifting his positions for the purpose of giving him strength to bear and to lengthen the date of his sufferings. When the unoffending innocent, desirous of seeing and speaking to its parent, applied to Bonner for permission to do so, the poor child being asked by the bishop's chaplain the purport of his errand, he replied he wished to see his father. \"Who is thy father?\" said the chaplain. \"John Fetty,\" returned the boy, at the same time pointing to the place where he was confined. The interrogating miscreant on this said, \"Why, thy father is a heretic!\" The little champion again rejoined, with energy sufficient to raise admiration in any breast, except that of this unprincipled and unfeeling wretch-this miscreant, eager to execute the behests of a remoseless queen-\"My father is no heretic: for you have Balaam's mark.\"\n\nIrritated by reproach so aptly applied, the indignant and mortified priest concealed his resentment for a moment, and took the undaunted boy into the house, where having him secure, he presented him to others, whose baseness and cruelty being equal to his own, they stripped him to the skin, and applied their scourges to so violent a degree, that, fainting beneath the stripes inflicted on his tender frame, and covered with the blood that flowed from them, the victim of their ungodly wrath was ready to expire under his heavy and unmerited punishment.\n\nIn this bleeding and helpless state was the suffering infant, covered only with his shirt, taken to his father by one of the actors in the horrid tragedy, who, while he exhibited the heart-rending spectacle, made use of the vilest taunts, and exulted in what he had done. The dutiful child, as if recovering strength at the sight of his father, on his knees implored his blessing. \"Alas! Will,\" said the afflicted parent, in trembling amazement, \"who hath done this to thee!\" the artless innocent related the circumstances that led to the merciless correction which had been so basely inflicted on him; but when he repeated the reproof bestowed on the chaplain, and which was prompted by an undaunted spirit, he was torn from his weeping parent, and conveyed again to the house, where he remained a close prisoner.\n\nBonner, somewhat fearful that what had been done could not be justified even among the bloodhounds of his own voracious pack, concluded in his dark and wicked mind, to release John Fetty, for a time at least, from the severities he was enduring in the glorious cause of everlasting truth! whose bright rewards are fixed beyond the boundaries of time, within the confines of eternity; where the arrow of the wicked cannot wound, even \"where there shall be no more sorrowing for the blessed, who, in the mansion of eternal bliss shall glorify the Lamb forever and ever.\" He was accordingly by order of Bonner, (how disgraceful to all dignity, to say bishop!) liberated from the painful bonds, and led from Lollard's Tower, to the chamber of that ungodly and infamous butcher, where he found the bishop bathing himself before a great fire; and at his first entering the chamber, Fetty said, \"God be here and peace!\" \"God be here and peace, (said Bonner,) that is neither God speed nor good morrow!\" \"If ye kick against this peace, (said Fetty), then this is not the place that I seek for.\"\n\nA chaplain of the bishop, standing by, turned the poor man about, and thinking to abash him, said, in mocking wise, \"What have we here-a player!\" While Fetty was thus standing in the bishop's chamber, he espied, hanging about the bishop's bed, a pair of great black beads, whereupon he said, \"My Lord, I think the hangman is not far off: for the halter (pointing to the beads) is here already!\" At which words the bishop was in a marvellous rage. Then he immediately after espied also, standing in the bishop's chamber, in the window, a little crucifix. Then he asked the bishop what it was, and he answered, that it was Christ. \"Was He handled as cruelly as He is here pictured!\" said Fetty. \"Yea, that He was,\" said the bishop. \"And even so cruelly will you handle such as come before you; for you are unto God's people as Caiaphas was unto Christ!\" The bishop, being in a great fury, said, \"Thou art a vile heretic, and I will burn thee, or else I will spend all I have, unto my gown.\" \"Nay, my Lord, (said Fetty) you were better to give it to some poor body, that he may pray for you.\" Bonner, notwithstanding his passion, which was raised to the utmost by the calm and pointed remarks of this observing Christian, thought it most prudent to dismiss the father, on account of the nearly murdered child. His coward soul trembled for the consequences which might ensue; fear is inseparable from little minds; and this dastardly pampered priest experienced its effects so far as to induce him to assume the appearance of that he was an utter stranger to, namely, MERCY.\n\nThe father, on being dismissed, by the tyrant Bonner, went home with a heavy heart, with his dying child, who did not survive many days the cruelties which had been inflicted on him.\n\nHow contrary to the will of our great King and Prophet, who mildly taught His followers, was the conduct of this sanguinary and false teacher, this vile apostate from his God to Satan! But the archfiend had taken entire possession of his heart, and guided every action of the sinner he had hardened; who, given up to terrible destruction, was running the race of the wicked, marking his footsteps with the blood of the saints, as if eager to arrive at the goal of eternal death.Deliverance of Dr. SandsThis eminent prelate, vice-chancellor of Cambridge, at the request of the duke of Northumberland, when he came down to Cambridge in support of Lady Jane Grey's claim to the throne, undertook at a few hours' notice, to preach before the duke and the university. The text he took was such as presented itself in opening the Bible, and a more appropriate one he could not have chosen, namely, the three last verses of Joshua. As God gave him the text, so He gave him also such order and utterance that it excited the most lively emotions in his numerous auditors. The sermon was about to be sent to London to be printed, when news arrived that the duke had returned and Queen Mary was proclaimed.\n\nThe duke was immediately arrested, and Dr. Sands was compelled by the university to give up his office. He was arrested by the queen's order, and when Mr. Mildmay wondered that so learned a man could wilfully incur danger, and speak against so good a princess as Mary, the doctor replied, \"If I would do as Mr. Mildmay has done, I need not fear bonds. He came down armed against Queen Mary; before a trator-now a great friend. I cannot with one mouth blow hot and cold in this manner.\" A general plunder of Dr. Sands' property ensued, and he was brought to London upon a wretched horse. Various insults he met on the way from the bigoted Catholics, and as he passed through Bishopsgate-street, a stone struck him to the ground. He was the first prisoner that entered the Tower, in that day, on a religious account; his man was admitted with his Bible, but his shirts and other articles were taken from him.\n\nOn Mary's coronation day the doors of the dungeon were so laxly guarded that it was easy to escape. A Mr. Mitchell, like a true friend, came to him, afforded him his own clothes as a disguise, and was willing to abide the consequence of being found in his place. This was a rare friendship: but he refused the offer; saying, \"I know no cause why I should be in prison. To do thus were to make myself guilty. I will expect God's good will, yet do I think myself much obliged to you\"; and so Mr. Mitchell departed.\n\nWith Doctor Sands was imprisoned Mr. Bradford; they were kept close in prison twenty-nine weeks. John Fowler, their keeper, was a perverse papist, yet, by often persuading him, at length he began to favor the Gospel, and was so persuaded in the true religion, that on a Sunday, when they had Mass in the chapel, Dr. Sands administered the Communion to Bradford and to Fowler. Thus Fowler was their son begotten in bonds. To make room for Wyat and his accomplices, Dr. Sands and nine other preachers were sent to the Marshalsea.\n\nThe keeper of the Marshalsea appointed to every preacher a man to lead him in the street; he caused them to go on before, and he and Dr. Sands followed conversing together. By this time popery began to be unsavory. After they had passed the bridge, the keeper said to Dr. Sands: \"I perceive the vain people would set you forward to the fire. You are as vain as they, if you, being a young man, will stand in your own conceit, and prefer your own judgment before that of so many worthy prelates, ancient, learned, and grave men as be in this realm. If you do so, you shall find me a severe keeper, and one that utterly dislikes your religion.\" Dr. Sands answered, \"I know my years to be young, and my learning but small; it is enough to know Christ crucified, and he hath learned nothing who seeth not the great blasphemy that is in popery. I will yield unto God, and not unto man; I have read in the Scriptures of many godly and couretous keepers: may God make you one! if not, I trust He will give me strength and patience to bear your hard usage.\" Then said the keeper, \"Are you resolved to stand to your religion?\" \"Yes,\" quoth the doctor, \"by God's grace!\" \"Truly,\" said the keeper, \"I love you the better for it; I did but tempt you: what favor I can show you, you shall be assured of; and I shall think myself happy if I might die at the stake with you.\"\n\nHe was as good as his word, for he trusted the doctor to walk in the fields alone, where he met with Mr. Bradford, who was also a prisoner in the King's Bench, and had found the same favor from his keeper. At his request, he put Mr. Saunders in along with him, to be his bedfellow, and the Communion was administered to a great number of communicants.\n\nWhen Wyat with his army came to Southwark, he offered to liberate all the imprisoned Protestants, but Dr. Sands and the rest of the preachers refused to accept freedom on such terms.\n\nAfter Dr. Sands had been nine weeks prisoner in the Marshalsea, by the mediation of Sir Thomas Holcroft, knight marshal, he was set at liberty. Though Mr. Holcroft had the queen's warrant, the bishop commanded him not to set Dr. Sands at liberty, until he had taken sureties of two gentlemen with him, each one bound in \u0153500, that Dr. Sands should not depart out of the realm without license. Mr. Holcroft immediately after met with two gentlemen of the north, friends and cousins to Dr. Sands, who offered to be bound for him.\n\nAfter dinner, the same day, Sir Thomas Holcroft sent for Dr.\n\nSands to his lodgings at Westminster, to communicate to him all he had done. Dr. Sands answered: \"I give God thanks, who hath moved your heart to mind me so well, that I think myself most bound unto you. God shall requite you, nor shall I ever be found unthankful. But as you have dealt friendly with me, I will also deal plainly with you. I came a freeman into prison; I will not go forth a bondman. As I cannot benefit my friends, so will I not hurt them. And if I be set at liberty, I will not tarry six days in this realm, if I may get out. If therefore I may not get free forth, send me to the Marshalsea again, and there you shall be sure of me.\"\n\nThis answer Mr. Holcroft much disapproved of; but like a true friend he replied: \"Seeing you cannot be altered, I will change my purpose, and yield unto you. Come of it what will, I will set you at liberty; and seeing you have a mind to go over sea, get you gone as quick as you can. One thing I require of you, that, while you are there, you write nothing to me hither, for this may undo me.\"\n\nDr. Sands having taken an affectionate farewell of him and his other friends in bonds, departed. He went by Winchester house, and there took boat, and came to a friend's house in London, called William Banks, and tarried there one night. The next night he went to another friend's house, and there he heard that strict search was making for him, by Gardiner's express order.\n\nDr. Sands now conveyed himself by night to one Mr. Berty's house, a stranger who was in the Marshalsea prison with him a while; he was a good Protestant and dwelt in Mark-lane. There he was six days, and then removed to one of his acquaintances in Cornhill; he caused his man Quinton to provide two geldings for him, resolved on the morrow to ride into Essex, to Mr. Sands, his father-in-law, where his wife was, which, after a narrow escape, he effected. He had not been theretwo hours, before Mr. Sands was told that two of the guards would that night apprehend Dr. Sands.\n\nThat night Dr. Sands was guided to an honest farmer's near the sea, where he tarried two days and two nights in a chamber without company. After that he removed to one James Mower's, a shipmaster, who dwelt at Milton-Shore, where he waited for a wind to Flanders. While he was there, James Mower brought to him forty or fifty mariners, to whom he gave an exhortation; they liked him so well that they promised to die rather than he should be apprehended.\n\nThe sixth of May, Sunday, the wind served. In taking leave of his hostess, who had been married eight years without having a child, he gave her a fine handkerchief and an old royal of gold, and said, \"Be of good comfort; before that one whole year be past, God shall give you a child, a boy.\" This came to pass, for, that day twelve-month, wanting one day, God gave her a son.\n\nScarcely had he arrived at Antwerp, when he learned that King Philip had sent to apprehend him. He next flew to Augsburg, in Cleveland, where Dr. Sands tarried fourteen days, and then travelled towards Strassburg, where, after he had lived one year, his wife came to him. He was sick of a flux nine months, and had a child which died of the plague. His amiable wife at length fell into a consumption, and died in his arms. When his wife was dead, he went to Zurich, and there was in Peter Martyr's house for the space of five weeks.\n\nAs they sat at dinner one day, word was suddenly brought that Queen Mary was dead, and Dr. Sands was sent for by his friends at Strassburg, where he preached. Mr. Grindal and he came over to England, and arrived in London the same day that Queen Elizabeth was crowned. This faithful servant of Christ, under Queen Elizabeth, rose to the highest distinction in the Church, being successively bishop of Worcester, bishop of London, and archbishop of York.Queen Mary's Treatment of Her Sister, the Princess ElizabethThe preservation of Princess Elizabeth may be reckoned a remarkable instance of the watchful eye which Christ had over His Church. The bigotry of Mary regarded not the ties of consanguinity, of natural affection, of national succession. Her mind, physically morose, was under the dominion of men who possessed not the milk of human kindness, and whose principles werre sanctioned and enjoined by the idolatrous tenets of the Romish pontiff. Could they have foreseen the short date of Mary's reign, they would have imbrued their hands in the Protestant blood of Elizabeth, and, as a sine qua non of the queen's salvation, have compelled her to bequeath the kingdom to some Catholic prince. The contest might have been attended with the horrors incidental to a religious civil war, and calamities might have been felt in England similar to those under Henry the Great in France, whom Queen Elizabeth assisted in opposing his priest-ridden Catholic subjects. As if Providence had the perpetual establishment of the Protestant faith in view, the difference of the duration of the two reigns is worthy of notice. Mary might have reigned many years in the course of nature, but the course of grace willed it otherwise. Five years and four months was the time of persecution alloted to this weak, disgraceful reign, while that of Elizabeth reckoned a number of years among the highest of those who have sat on the English throne, almost nine times that of her merciless sister!\n\nBefore Mary attained the crown, she treated Elizabeth with a sisterly kindness, but from that period her conduct was altered, and the most imperious distance substituted. Though Elizabeth had no concern in the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyat, yet she was apprehended, and treated as a culprit in that commotion. The manner too of her arrest was similar to the mind that dictated it: the three cabinet members, whom she deputed to see the arrest executed, rudely entered the chamber at ten o'clock at night, and, though she was extremely ill, they could scarcely be induced to let her remain until the following morning. Her enfeebled state permitted her to be moved only by short stages in a journey of such length to London; but the princess, though afflicted in person, had a consolation in mind which her sister never could purchase: the people, through whom she passed on her way pitied her, and put up their prayers for her preservation.\n\nArrived at court, she was made a close prisoner for a fortnight, without knowing who was her accuser, or seeing anyone who could console or advise her. The charge, however, was at length unmasked by Gardiner, who, with nineteen of the Council, accused her of abetting Wyat's conspiracy, which she religiously affirmed to be false. Failing in this, they placed against her the transactions of Sir Peter Carew in the west, in which they were as unsuccessful as in the former. The queen now signified that it was her pleasure she should be committed to the Tower, a step which overwhelmed the princess with the greatest alarm and uneasiness. In vain she hoped the queen's majesty would not commit her to such a place; but there was no lenity to be expected; her attendants were limited, and a hundred northern soldiers appointed to guard her day and night.\n\nOn Palm Sunday she was conducted to the Tower. When she came to the palace garden, she cast her eyes towards the windows, eagerly anxious to meet those of the queen, but she was disappointed. A strict order was given in London that every one should go to church, and carry palms, that she might be conveyed without clamor or commiseration to her prison.\n\nAt the time of passing under London Bridge the fall of the tide made it very dangerous, and the barge some time stuck fast against the starlings. To mortify her the more, she was landed at Traitors' Stairs. As it rained fast, and she was obliged to step in the water to land, she hesitated; but this excited no complaisance in the lord in waiting. When she set her foot on the steps, she exclaimed, \"Here lands as true a subject, being prisoner, as ever landed at these stairs; and before Thee, O God, I speak it, having no friend but Thee alone!\"\n\nA large number of the wardens and servants of the Tower were arranged in order between whom the princess had to pass. Upon inquiring the use of this parade, she was informed it was customary to do so. \"If,\" said she, \"it is on account of me, I beseech you that they may be dismissed.\" On this the poor men knelt down, and prayed that God would preserve her grace, for which they were the next day turned out of their employments. The tragic scene must have been deeply interesting, to see an amiable and irreproachable princess sent like a lamb to languish in expectation of cruelty and death; against whom there was no other charge than her superiority in Christian virtues and acquired endowments. Her attendants openly wept as she proceeded with a dignified step to the frowning battlements of her destination. \"Alas!\" said Elizabeth, \"what do you mean? I took you to comfort, not to dismay me; for my truth is such that no one shall have cause to weep for me.\"\n\nThe next step of her enemies was to procure evidence by means which, in the present day, are accounted detestable. Many poor prisoners were racked, to extract, if possible, any matters of accusation which might affect her life, and thereby gratify Gardiner's sanguinary disposition. He himself came to examine her, respecting her removal from her house at Ashbridge to Dunnington castle a long while before. The princess had quite forgotten this trivial circumstance, and Lord Arundel, after the investigation, kneeling down, apologized for having troubled her in such a frivolous matter. \"You sift me narrowly,\" replied the princess, \"but of this I am assured, that God has appointed a limit to your proceedings; and so God forgive you all.\"\n\nHer own gentlemen, who ought to have been her purveyors, and served her provision, were compelled to give place to the common soldiers, at the command of the constable of the Tower, who was in every respect a servile tool of Gardiner; her grace's friends, however, procured an order of Council which regulated this petty tyranny more to her satisfaction.\n\nAfter having been a whole month in close confinement, she sent for the lord chamberlain and Lord Chandois, to whom she represented the ill state of her health from a want of proper air and exercise. Application being made to the Council, Elizabeth was with some difficulty admitted to walk in the queen's lodgings, and afterwards in the garden, at which time the prisoners on that side were attended by their keepers, and not suffered to look down upon her. Their jealousy was excited by a child of four years, who daily brought flowers to the princess. The child was threatened with a whipping, and the father ordered to keep him from the princess's chambers.\n\nOn the fifth of May the constable was discharged from his office, and Sir Henry Benifield appointed in his room, accompanied by a hundred ruffian-looking soldiers in blue. This measure created considerable alarm in the mind of the princess, who imagined it was preparatory to her undergoing the same fate as Lady Jane Grey, upon the same block. Assured that this project was not in agitation, she entertained an idea that the new keeper of the Tower was commissioned to make away with her privately, as his equivocal character was in conformity with the ferocious inclination of those by whom he was appointed.\n\nA report now obtained that her Grace was to be taken away by the new constable and his soldiers, which in the sequel proved to be true. An order of Council was made for her removal to the manor Woodstock, which took place on Trinity Sunday, May 13, under the authority of Sir Henry Benifield and Lord Tame. The ostensible cause of her removal was to make room for other prisoners. Richmond was the first place they stopped at, and here the princess slept, not however without much alarm at first, as her own servants were superseded by the soldiers, who were placed as guards at her chamber door. Upon representation, Lord Tame overruled this indecent stretch of power, and granted her perfect safety while under his custody.\n\nIn passing through Windsor, she saw several of her poor dejected servants waiting to see her. \"Go to them,\" said she, to one of her attendants, \"and say these words from me, tanquim ovis, that is, like a sheep to the slaughter.\"\n\nThe next night her Grace lodged at the house of a Mr. Dormer, in her way to which the people manifested such tokens of loyal affection that Sir Henry was indignant, and bestowed on them very liberally the names of rebels and traitors. In some villages they rang the bells for joy, imagining the princess's arrival among them was from a very different cause; but this harmless demonstration of gladness was sufficient with the persecuting Benifield to order his soldiers to seize and set these humble persons in the stocks.\n\nThe day following, her Grace arrived at Lord Tame's house, where she stayed all night, and was most nobly entertained. This excited Sir Henry's indignation, and made him caution Lord Tame to look well to his proceedings; but the humanity of Lord Tame was not to be frightened, and he returned a suitable reply. At another time, this official prodigal, to show his consequence and disregard of good manners, went up into a chamber, where was appointed for her Grace a chair, two cushions, and a foot carpet, wherein he presumptuously sat and called his man to pull off his boots. As soon as it was known to the ladies and gentlemen they laughed him to scorn. When supper was done, he called to his lordship, and directed that all gentlemen and ladies should withdraw home, marvelling much that he would permit such a large company, considering the great charge he had committed to him. \"Sir Henry,\" said his lordship, \"content yourself; all shall be avoided, your men and all.\" \"Nay, but my soldiers,\" replied Sir Henry, \"shall watch all night.\" Lord Tame answered, \"There is no need.\" \"Well,\" said he, \"need or need not, they shall so do.\"\n\nThe next day her Grace took her journey from thence to Woodstock, where she was enclosed, as before in the Tower of London, the soldiers keeping guard within and without the walls, every day, to the number of sixty; and in the night, without the walls were forty during all the time of her imprisonment.\n\nAt length she was permitted to walk in the gardens, but under the most severe restrictions, Sir Henry keeping the keys himself, and placing her always under many bolts and locks, whence she was induced to call him her jailer, at which he felt offended, and begged her to substitute the word officer. After much earnest entreaty to the Council, she obtained permission to write to the queen; but the jailer who brought her pen, ink, and paper stood by her while she wrote, and, when she left off, he carried the things away until they were wanted again. He also insisted upon carrying it himself to the queen, but Elizabeth would not suffer him to be the bearer, and it was presented by one of her gentlemen.\n\nAfter the letter, Doctors Owen and Wendy went to the princess, as the state of her health rendered medical assistance necessary. They stayed with her five or six days, in which time she grew much better; they then returned to the queen, and spoke flatteringly of the princess' submission and humility, at which the queen seemed moved; but the bishops wanted a concession that she had offended her majesty. Elizabeth spurned this indirect mode of acknowledging herself guilty. \"If I have offended,\" said she, \"and am guilty, I crave no mercy but the law, which I am certain I should have had ere this, if anything could have been proved against me. I wish I were as clear from the peril of my enemies; then should I not be thus bolted and locked up within walls and doors.\"\n\nMuch question arose at this time respecting the propriety of uniting the princess to some foreigner, that she might quit the realm with a suitable portion. One of the Council had the brutality to urge the necessity of beheading her, if the king (Philip) meant to keep the realm in peace; but the Spaniards, detesting such a base thought, replied, \"God forbid that oiur king and master should consent to such an infamous proceeding!\" Stimulated by a noble principle, the Spaniards from this time repeatedly urged to the king that it would do him the highest honor to liberate the Lady Elizabeth, nor was the king impervious to their solicitation. He took her out of prison, and shortly after she was sent for to Hampton court. It may be remarked in this place, that the fallacy of human reasoning is shown in every moment. The barbarian who suggested the policy of beheading Elizabeth little contemplated the change of condition which his speech would bring about. In her journey from Woodstock, Benifield treated her with the same severity as before; removing her on a stormy day, and not suffering her old servant, who had come to Colnbrook, where she slept, to speak to her.\n\nShe remained a fortnight strictly guarded and watched, before anyone dared to speak with her; at length the vile Gardiner with three more of the Council, came with great submission. Elizabeth saluted them, remarked that she had been for a long time kept in solitary confinement, and begged they would intercede with the king and queen to deliver her from prison. Gardiner's visit was to draw from the princess a confession of her guilt; but she was guarded against his subtlety, adding, that, rather than admit she had done wrong, she would lie in prison all the rest of her life. The next day Gardiner came again, and kneeling down, declared that the queen was astonished she would persist in affirming that she was blameless-whence it would be inferred that the queen had unjustly imprisoned her grace. Gardiner further informed her that the queen had declared that she must tell another tale, before she could be set at liberty. \"Then,\" replied the high-minded Elizabeth, \"I had rather be in prison with honesty and truth, than have my liberty, and be suspected by her majesty. What I have said, I will stand to; nor will I ever speak falsehood!\" The bishop and his friends then departed, leaving her locked up as before.\n\nSeven days after the queen sent for Elizabeth at ten o'clock at night; two years had elapsed since they had seen each other. It created terror in the mind of the princess, who, at setting out, desired her gentlemen and ladies to pray for her, as her return to them again was uncertain.\n\nBeing conducted to the queen's bedchamber, upon entering it the princess knelt down, and having begged of God to preserve her majesty, she humbly assured her that her majesty had not a more loyal subject in the realm, whatever reports might be circulated to the contrary. With a haughty ungraciousness, the imperious queen replied: \"You will not confess your offence, but stand stoutly to your truth. I pray God it may so fall out.\"\n\n\"If it do not,\" said Elizabeth, \"I request neither favor nor pardon at your majesty's hands.\" \"Well,\" said the queen, \"you stiffly still persevere in your truth. Besides, you will not confess that you have not been wrongfully punished.\"\n\n\"I must not say so, if it please your majesty, to you.\"\n\n\"Why, then,\" said the queen, \"belike you will to others.\"\n\n\"No, if it please your majesty: I have borne the burden, and must bear it. I humbly beseech your majesty to have a good opinion of me and to think me to be your subject, not only from the beginning hitherto, but for ever, as long as life lasteth.\" They departed without any heartfelt satisfaction on either side; nor can we think the conduct of Elizabeth displayed that independence and fortitude which accompanies perfect innocence. Elizabeth's admitting that she would not say, neither to the queen nor to others, that she had been unjustly punished, was in direct contradiction to what she had told Gardiner, and must have arisen from some motive at this time inexplicable. King Philip is supposed to have been secretly concealed during the interview, and to have been friendly to the princess.\n\nIn seven days from the time of her return to imprisonment, her severe jailer and his men were discharged, and she was set at liberty, under the constraint of being always attended and watched by some of the queen's Council. Four of her gentlemen were sent to the Tower without any other charge against them than being zealous servants of their mistress. This event was soon after followed by the happy news of Gardiner's death, for which all good and merciful men glorified God, inasmuch as it had taken the chief tiger from the den, and rendered the life of the Protestant successor of Mary more secure.\n\nThis miscreant, while the princess was in the Tower, sent a secret writ, signed by a few of the Council, for her private execution, and, had Mr. Bridges, lieutenant of the Tower, been as little scrupulous of dark assassination as this pious prelate was, she must have perished. The warrant not having the queen's signature, Mr. Bridges hastened to her majesty to give her information of it, and to know her mind. This was a plot of Winchester's, who, to convict her of treasonable practices, caused several prisoners to be racked; particularly Mr. Edmund Tremaine and Smithwicke were offered considerable bribes to accuse the guiltless princess.\n\nHer life was several times in danger. While at Woodstock, fire was apparently put between the boards and ceiling under which she lay. It was also reported strongly that one Paul Penny, the keeper of Woodstock, a notorious ruffian, was appointed to assassinate her, but, however this might be, God counteracted in this point the nefarious designs of the enemies of the Reformation. James Basset was another appointed to perform the same deed: he was a peculiar favorite of Gardiner, and had come within a mile of Woodstock, intending to speak with Benifield on the subject. The goodness of God however so ordered it that while Basset was travelling to Woodstock, Benifield, by an order of Council, was going to London: in consequence of which, he left a positive order with his brother, that no man should be admitted to the princess during his absence, not even with a note from the queen; his brother met the murderer, but the latter's intention was frustrated, as no admission could be obtained.\n\nWhen Elizabeth quitted Woodstock, she left the following lines written with her diamond on the window:\n\nMuch suspected by me,\nNothing proved can be. Quoth Elizabeth, prisoner.\n\nWith the life of Winchester ceased the extreme danger of the princess, as many of her other secret enemies soon after followed him, and, last of all, her cruel sister, who outlived Gardiner but three years.\n\nThe death of Mary was ascribed to several causes. The Council endeavored to console her in her last moments, imagining it was the absence of her husband that lay heavy at her heart, but though his treatment had some weight, the loss of Calais, the last fortress possessed by the English in France, was the true source of her sorrow. \"Open my heart,\" said Mary, \"when I am dead, and you shall find Calais written there.\" Religion caused her no alarm; the priests had lulled to rest every misgiving of conscience, which might have obtruded, on account of the accusing spirits of the murdered martyrs. Not the blood she had spilled, but the loss of a town excited her emotions in dying, and this last stroke seemed to be awarded, that her fanatical persecution might be paralleled by her political imbecility.\n\nWe earnestly pray that the annals of no country, Catholic or pagan, may ever be stained with such a repetition of human sacrifices to papal power, and that the detestation in which the character of Mary is holden, may be a beacon to succeeding monarchs to avoid the rocks of fanaticism!God's Punishment upon Some of the Persecutors of His People in Mary's ReignAfter that arch-persecutor, Gardiner, was dead, others followed, of whom Dr. Morgan, bishop of St. David's, who succeeded Bishop Farrar, is to be noticed. Not long after he was installed in his bishoipric, he was stricken by the visitation of God; his food passed through the throat, but rose again with great violence. In this manner, almost literally starved to death, he terminated his existence.\n\nBishop Thornton, suffragan of Dover, was an indefatigable persecutor of the true Church. One day after he had exercised his cruel tyranny upon a number of pious persons at Canterbury, he came from the chapter-house to Borne, where as he stood on a Sunday looking at his men playing at bowls, he fell down in a fit of the palsy, and did not long survive.\n\nAfter the latter, succeeded another bishop or suffragen, ordained by Gardiner, who not long after he had been raised to the see of Dover, fell down a pair of stairs in the cardinal's chamber at Greenwich, and broke his neck. He had just received the cardinal's blessing-he could receive nothing worse.\n\nJohn Cooper, of Watsam, Suffolk, suffered by perjury; he was from private pique persecuted by one Fenning, who suborned two others to swear that they heard Cooper say, 'If God did not take away Queen Mary, the devil would.' Cooper denied all such words, but Cooper was a Proestant and a heretic, and therefore he was hung, drawn and quartered, his property confiscated, and his wife and nine children reduced to beggary. The following harvest, however, Grimwood of Hitcham, one of the witnesses before mentioned, was visited for his villainy: while at work, stacking up corn, his bowels suddenly burst out, and before relief could be obtained, her died. Thus was deliberate perjury rewarded by sudden death!\n\nIn the case of the martyr Mr. Bradford, the severity of Mr.\n\nSheriff Woodroffe has been noticed-he rejoiced at the death of the saints, and at Mr. Rogers' execution, he broke the carman's head, because he stopped the cart to let the martyr's children take a last farewell of him. Scarcely had Mr. Woodroffe's sheriffalty expired a week, when he was struck with a paralytic affection, and languished a few days in the most pitable and helpless condition, presenting a striking contrast to his former activity in the cause of blood.\n\nRalph Lardyn, who betrayed the martyr George Eagles, is believed to have been afterward arraigned and hanged in consequence of accusing himself. At the bar, he denounced himself in these words: \"This has most justly fallen upon me, for betraying the innocent blood of that just and good man George Eagles, who was here condemned in the time of Queen Mary by my procurement, when I sold his blood for a little money.\"\n\nAs James Abbes was going to execution, and exhorting the pitying bystanders to adhere steadfastly to the truth, and like him to seal the cause of Christ with their blood, a servant of the sheriff's interrupted him, and blasphemously called his religion heresy, and the good man a lunatic. Scarcely however had the flames reached the martyr, before the fearful stroke of God fell upn the hardened wretch, in the presence of him he had so cruelly ridiculed. The man was suddenly seized with lunacy, cast off his clothes and shoes before the people, (as Abbes had done just before, to distribute among some poor persons,) at the same time exclaiming, \"Thus did James Abbes, the true servant of God, who is saved by I am damned.\" Repeating this often, the sheriff had him secured, and made him put his clothes on, but no sooner was he alone, than he tore them off, and exclaimed as before. Being tied in a cart, he was conveyed to his master's house, and in about half a year he died; just before which a priest came to attend him, with the crucifix, etc., but the wretched man bade him take away such trumpery, and said that he and other priests had been the cause of his damnation, but that Abbes was saved.\n\nOne Clark, an avowed enemy of the Protestants in King Edward's reign, hung himself in the Tower of London.\n\nFroling, a priest of much celebrity, fell down in the street and died on the spot.\n\nDale, an indefatigable informer, was consumed by vermin, and died a miserable spectacle.\n\nAlexander, the severe keeper of Newgate, died miserably, swelling to a prodigious size, and became so inwardly putrid, that none could come near him. This cruel minister of the law would go to Bonner, Story, and others, requesting them to rid his prison, he was so much pestered with heretics! The son of this keeper, in three years after his father's death, dissipated his great property, and died suddenly in Newgate market. \"The sins of the father,\" says the decalogue, \"shall be visited on the children.\" John Peter, son-in-law of Alexander, a horrid blasphemer and persecutor, died wretchedly. When he affirmed anything, he would say, \"If it be not true, I pray I may rot ere I die.\" This awful state visited him in all its loathsomeness.\n\nSir Ralph Ellerker was eagerly desirous to see the heart taken out of Adam Damlip, who was wrongfully put to death. Shortly after Sir Ralph was slain by the French, who mangled him dreadfully, cut off his limbs, and tore his heart out.\n\nWhen Gardiner heard of the miserable end of Judge Hales, he called the profession of the Gospel a doctrine of desperation; but he forgot that the judge's despondency arose after he had consented to the papistry. But with more reason may this be said of the Catholic tenets, if we consider the miserable end of Dr. Pendleton, Gardiner, and most of the leading persecutors. Gardiner, upon his death bed, was reminded by a bishop of Peter denying his master, \"Ah,\" said Gardiner, \"I have denied with Peter, but never repented with Peter.\"\n\nAfter the accession of Elizabeth, most of the Catholic prelates were imprisoned in the Tower or the Fleet; Bonner was put into the Marshalsea.\n\nOf the revilers of God's Word, we detail, among many others, the following occurrence. One William Maldon, living at Greenwich in servitude, was instructing himself profitably in reading an English primer one winter's evening. A serving man, named John Powell, sat by, and ridiculed all that Maldon said, who cautioned him not to make a jest of the Word of God. Powell nevertheless continued, until Maldon came to certain English Prayers, and read aloud, \"Lord, have mercy upon us, Christ have mercy upon us,\" etc. Suddenly the reviler started, and exclaimed, \"Lord, have mercy upon us!\" He was struck with the utmost terror of mind, said the evil spirit could not abide that Christ should have any mercy upon him, and sunk into madness. He was remitted to Bedlam, and became an awful warning that God will not always be insulted with impunity.\n\nHenry Smith, a student in the law, had a pious Protesant father, of Camben, in Gloucestershire, by whom he was virtuously educated. While studying law in the middle temple, he was induced to profess Catholicism, and, going to Louvain, in France, he returned with pardons, crucifixes, and a great freight of popish toys. Not content with these things, he openly reviled the Gospel religion he had been brought up in; but conscience one night reproached him so dreadfully, that in a fit of despair he hung himself in his garters. He was buried in a lane, without the Christian service being read over him.\n\nDr. Story, whose name has been so often mtnioned in the preceding pages, was reserved to be cut off by public execution, a practice in which he had taken great delight when in power. He is supposed to have had a hand in most of the conflagrations in Mary's time, and was even ingenious in his invention of new modes of inflicting torture. When Elizabeth came to the throne, he was committed to prison, but unaccountably effected his escape to the continent, to carry fire and sword there among the Protestant brethren. From the duke of Alva, at Antwerp, he received a special commission to search all ships for contraband goods, and particularly for English heretical books.\n\nDr. Story gloried in a commission that was ordered by Providence to be his ruin, and to preserve the faithful from his sanguinary cruelty. It was contrived that one Parker, a merchant, should sail to Antwerp and information should be given to Dr. Story that he had a quantity of heretical books on board. The latter no sooner heard this, than he hastened to the vessel, sought everywhere above, and then went under the hatches, which were fastened down upon him. A prosperous gale brought the ship to England, and this traitorous, persecuting rebel was committed to prison, where he remained a considerable time, obstinately objecting to recant his Anti-christian spirit, or admit of Queen Elizabeth's supremacy. He alleged, though by birth and education an Englishman, that he was a sworn subject of the king of Spain, in whose service the famous duke of Alva was. The doctor being condemned, was laid upon a hurdle, and drawn from the Tower to Tyburn, where after being suspended about half an hour, he was cut down, stripped, and the executioner displayed the heart of a traitor.\n\nThus ended the existence of this Nimrod of England.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 55, "api_path": "/songs/525071", "artist_names": "Douglas Wolk", "full_title": "James Brown's \"Live at the Apollo\" (33 1/3 excerpt) by\u00a0Douglas\u00a0Wolk", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/2691769630d8c122f3fcfab3b847c891.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/2691769630d8c122f3fcfab3b847c891.400x400x1.jpg", "id": 525071, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 113876, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1411856945, "path": "/Douglas-wolk-james-browns-live-at-the-apollo-33-1-3-excerpt-annotated", "pyongs_count": 4, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Douglas-wolk-james-browns-live-at-the-apollo-33-1-3-excerpt-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/2691769630d8c122f3fcfab3b847c891.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/2691769630d8c122f3fcfab3b847c891.400x400x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "James Brown\u2019s \u201cLive at the Apollo\u201d (33 1/3 excerpt)", "title_with_featured": "James Brown's \"Live at the Apollo\" (33 1/3 excerpt)", "updated_by_human_at": 1412844697, "url": "https://genius.com/Douglas-wolk-james-browns-live-at-the-apollo-33-1-3-excerpt-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/231642", "header_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/medium/d96097a5c7e0a72b52719fa648595f86", "id": 231642, "image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/avatars/medium/d96097a5c7e0a72b52719fa648595f86", "index_character": "d", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Douglas Wolk", "slug": "Douglas-wolk", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Douglas-wolk", "iq": 5678}, "artist": "Douglas Wolk", "lyrics": "James Brown\u2019s \u201cLive at the Apollo\u201d (33 1/3 excerpt) LyricsTHE CATALOGUE OF HITSFats Gonder ramps up his delivery from a salesmanlike incantation to rabid enthusiasm.

It loves you because you love it because it's a Hit!\" \"You come to see my show,\" Brown sang. \"That's why James Brown loves you  so.\" \"This is a hit!,\" he  declared as the  tape rolled  for \"Papa's Got a Brand  New  Bag\"; he cut it out of the released  record, but persuaded some  of the other artists  whose  records he produced around that  time  to yell  the  same  thing, so  it  might work  its  magic  for them  too.\n\nLook  at his singles  discography, and  ignore the  instrumentals, the duets,  the reissues,  the  throwaways on King's subsidiary label  Bethlehem, the  Christmas and novelty records-just concentrate on the songs he threw his weight  behind. A pattern emerges, or rather an unbroken block:  between \"Money Won't  Change You\u201d in July  1966  and  \"Hot (I Need  To Be Loved, Loved, Loved,  Loved)\" nine years later, James Brown had over sixty consecutive chart  hits. On  his own terms, he was an unstoppable champion, and  those  terms  were  people paying  to hear  him sing, and being  reassured that  what they  were  paying  for  was popular.\n\nThat's why he wanted  to make Live at the Apollo so badly:  he  could  demonstrate that  being  James Brown was itself a hit.  All he had  to do was get it on  tape.THE CATALOGUE OF  HITSBack at  the  Apollo,  Gonder's speech  has  been  setting up a couple  of subliminal effects. Starting with \"You've Got  the  Power,\"  and  running  through  \"Bewildered,\u201d there's  a steady 6/8 rhythm to the words he accents and the band's stabs \u2013 a tick-tock swing that's at pretty much the  same  tempo  as  Brown's  ballads.  There's also a hidden message in those emphases-Crazy-Me- You-Think-Want-Mind-Be-WILL-Lost-Night-Shimmy! This  is a night  for  total  abandon,  the suggestion goes; for thoughts  to become desires and then to simple be, through  sheer will; a night to be lost to shimmying.\n\n(A young man named Danny Ray was waiting in the wings. He'd  just been hired, that week, as James Brown's valet; a few years later,  he'd  take over the emcee  job, which he still holds today, and his introductions to the James  Brown show  have been  patterned  on  Gonder's ever since.)\n\nGonder's still going. \"Mr.  Dynamite\"-Mr. Dynamite  had been the title of two movies, one from 1935, adapted from Dashiell Hammett's story \"On the Make,\u201d and  the  other   from  1941,  starring   Lloyd  Nolan   as Tommy N. Thornton (nice initials)-\"the amazing Mr. Please, Please himself, the star of the show\"-as if there could be any doubt, as Gonder is almost erupting with conviction-\"JAMES BROWN AND  the  FAMOUS FLAMES!\"THE SCRATCHThe horns buck--one, two, three, four, five, all on a G chord that's climbed  up an octave since Gonder started his litany.  It's  the  beginning of a fanfare  to announce the  Hardest Working Man  In Show  Business's  arrival: three  choruses of a perky  little  blues  riff. Brown  glides onto  stage  during the  third, and  probably does  some high-powered   footwork,  judging    by   the    screams. Twenty-nine years old and as flexible as a piece of yarn, he  can  dance  faster  and  harder than  anyone, rippling his body,  floating over  a wooden floor  as if it's  water-slicked  ice.\nThe perky  little  blues  riff has  a name,  although it was never  credited on  any  edition of Live at the Apollo until 2004: it's  \"The  Scratch.\" Brown   and  his  band (including Les Buie on guitar  and Hubert Perry on bass, still with  the  band  at the  Apollo) had  recorded it as an instrumental on October 4, 1960. (\"The Scratch\" is also a close cousin of Henry Mancini's \"Peter Gunn\" theme, which  had  been  a hit for  Ray Anthony in 1959;  Duane Eddy's version  charted for  the  first  time  on  October 10,  1960.)  Brown's version  appeared as the  B-side  of \"Hold It\"  in January 1961,  and  the  band  played  it  as his entrance music  at least  through mid-1963.\n\nAs the band bats down the last note again and again, you can almost see James Brown's feet slide frictionlessly into position behind the microphone.I'LL GO CRAZYJames Brown steps up to the front  of the Apollo stage, gazes out over 1500 thoroughly warmed-up faces, and assesses matters  with a huge  holler.  He  feels all right, and he wants to make sure everybody knows it. The third time he announces  it, he gives the \"all\" an enormous melismatic rush, swooping around  at least twelve notes just to prove he can; then, as he takes a breath, guitarist Les Buie whacks sharply at his strings,  and we're into \"I'll  Go  Crazy.\"THE MISSING SONGExcept we're  not: there's  almost certainly  at least one song missing from the set on Live at the Apollo. In those days, JB usually opened  his shows with his latest hit. In October  1962,  that  was \"Shout  and Shimmy,\"  which had made No. 16 on the R&B chart (No. 61 pop) back in August. Recorded  February  9, 1961 (the same day as \"Lost  Someone\"  and \"Night Train\"), it starts with the I-feel-all-right routine, and then proceeds to a truly shameless ripoff of the Isley Brothers' 1959 hit \"Shout.\u201d\n\n(Really,  truly  shameless. The \"I feel all right\" business  is derived  from  the  beginning of the  second half of the Isleys' record, and the rest of the record is basically the  fast  parts  of \"Shout,\" with  the  gospel  inflections removed and  the  word  \"shimmy\" added.  It wasn't  the last  time JB  would  appropriate the  Isleys'  work  as his own, either: \"It's My Thing,\" his protegee Marva Whitney's  1969  single,  credited to J. Brown/M. Whitney, could  be charitably described as an answer  song  to the Isleys'  \"It's Your  Thing.\" It  could   be  less  charitably described as a cover  that  changes the  pronouns.)\n\n...4Embed"},

She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But,\nyou can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.\nCLARENCE\nIn \"Jailhouse Rock\" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is\nrockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck\nabout anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and\nleaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big\nhe's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and\nhe's singing, \"Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care\". Now, they got\nhim dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this\nhorrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him\nwearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party,\nbig house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd\nwatch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm\nno fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most\nwomen. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too cause my\nlife depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.\n\nLucy takes a drag from her cigarette.\n\nLUCY\nI'd fuck Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nReally?\n\nLUCY\nWhen he was alive.

DINGY HOTEL ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nThe sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots\nand violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained\nblack.\n\nOn the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of\ncocaine. Shotguns and pistols have been dropped carelessly around the\nsuitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. \"Bewitched\" is\nplaying.\n\nAt the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and\nFLOYD DIXON sit around. Cocaine is on the table as well as little plastic\nbags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't\nknow it listen to him.\n\nDREXL\nNigger, get outta my face with that bullshit.\n\nFLOYD\nNaw man, I don't be eatin' that shit.\n\nDREXL\nThat's bullshit.\n\nBIG DON WATTS, a stout, mean-looking black man who's older than Drexl\nand Floyd.

But I wanna ask you a question.\nYou with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch \u221a you're with\nJayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say \"Bitch, suck my\ndick!\" and then Jayne Kennedy says, \"First things first, nigger, I ain't\nsuckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!\" Now, what\ndo you say?\n\nFLOYD\nI tell Jayne Kennedy, \"Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!\"\n\nBIG D\nNigger, get real.

Now what would you do.\n\nFLOYD\nI'd say fuck it!\n\nDrexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd\nsitting all alone.\n\nBig D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching \"Bewitched\".\n\nFLOYD\n(yelling after them)\nAin't no man have to eat pussy!\n\nBIG D\n(not even looking)\nTake that shit somewhere else.\n\nDRXL\n(marching back)\nYou tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?\n\nFLOYD\nIf it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.\n\nDREXL\nWith that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy,\nkiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger,\nyou'd aim to please.\n\nBIG D\n(glued on TV)\nI'm hip.\n\nDREXL\nIn fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D,\ntoss me that shotgun.\n\nWithout turning away from \"Bewitched\" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to\nDrexl.\n\nDREXL\n(to Floyd)\nAll right, check this out.\n(referring to shotgun)\nNow, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.\n\nThen, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.\n\nBig D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.\n\nDrexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.\n\nThe blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.\n\nDrexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.\n\nBig D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops.\n\nDrexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front\ndoor he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out.\n\nEXT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR \u221a MORNING\n\nA big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a\nbackdrop. The song \"Little Bitty Tear\" is heard a capella.\n\nINT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR \u221a MORNING\n\nCLIFF WORLEY is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently\nto the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In\nbetween singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a\nsecurity guard uniform.\n\nEXT. TRAILER PARK \u221a MORNING\n\nCliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning.

Clarence sticks his face\nthrough the driver's side window.\n\nCLARENCE\nGood Morning, Daddy. Long time no see.\n\nINT. TRAILER HOME \u221a MORNING\n\nAll three enter the trailer home.\n\nCLIFF\nExcuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if\nI'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected\nto see this morning.\n\nClarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room.\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin'\non thirst, you got anything to drink?\n\nHe moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator.\n\nCLIFF\nI think there's a Seven-Up in there.\n\nCLARENCE\n(rumaging around the fridge)\nAnything stronger?\n(pause)\nOh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?\n\nCLIFF\nI can, but I don't.\n\nCLARENCE\n(closing the fridge)\nThat's about all I ever eat.\n\nCliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him.\n\nCLIFF\n(to Girl)\nI'm sorry... I'm his father.\n\nYOUNG GIRL\n(sticking her hand out)\nThat's OK, I'm his wife.\n(shaking his hand vigorously)\nAlabama Worley, pleased to meetcha.\n\nShe is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's\nwhere the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.\n\nClarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit\nmagnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama.\n\nCLARENCE\nOh yeah, we got married.\n(referring to the magnets)\nYou still have these.\n(to Alabama)\nThis isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one.\nI never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a\nsport and go get us some beer. I want some beer.\n(to Cliff)\nDo you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here.\n\nHe hands her some money and his car keys.\n\nCLARENCE\nGo to the liquor store \u221a\n(to Cliff)\nWhere is there a liquor store around here?\n\nCLIFF\nUh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nGet a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get\ncause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if\nnot, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look,\nsince you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a\nfoot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-\nDongs.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.\n(to Cliff)\nWhat do you think would taste good?\n\nCLIFF\nI'm really not very \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a\nwhile. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer,\ndefinitly, absolutely, without a doubt.\n(to Cliff)\nWhere's a good chicken place around here?\n\nCLIFF\nI really don't know.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't know the chicken places around where you live?\n(to Alabama)\nAsk the guy at the place where a chicken place is.\n\nHe gives her some more money.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.\n\nALABAMA\nOkee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.\n\nShe opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts.\n\nCLARENCE\nIsn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is\nshe a four alarm fire, or what?\n\nCLIFF\nShe seems very nice.\n\nCLARENCE\nDaddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only\nword for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in\nlove with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's\nwritten all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we\ngotta talk \u221a\n\nCLIFF\nClarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how\nmuch like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and\nthrough. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a\nsudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn\nbulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down.\nNow, when did you get married?\n\nCLARENCE\nDaddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.\n\nBLACK TITLE CARD: \"HOLLYWOOD\"\n\nINT. OUTSIDE OF CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICER \u221a DAY\n\nFOUR YOUNG ACTORS are sitting on a couch with sheets of paper in their\nhands silently mouthing lines. One of the actors is DICK RITCHIE. The casting\ndirector, MARY LOUISE RAVENCROFT, steps into the waiting room, clip\nboard in hand.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nDick Ritchie?\n\nDick pops up from the pack.\n\nDICK\nI'm me... I mean, that's me.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nStep inside.\n\nINT. CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE \u221a DAY\n\nShe sits behind a large desk. Her name-plate rests on the desktop. Several\nposters advertising \"The Return of T.J. Hooker\" hang on the wall.\n\nDick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nWell, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and\nMarty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for\nthe part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's\nhanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off.\n(she picks a up a copy of the script)\nWhenever you're ready.\n\nDICK\n(reading and miming driving)\nWhere'd you come from?\n\nRAVENCROFT\n(reading from the script lifelessly)\nI don't know. He just appeared as magic.\n\nDICK\n(reading from script)\nWell, don't just sit there, shoot him.\n\nShe puts her script down, and smiles at him.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nThat was very good.\n\nDICK\nThank you.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nIf we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?\n\nDICK\nSure. No problem.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nCould we try it now?\n\nDICK\nAbsolutely.\n\nDick picks up the script and begins, but this time with a Brooklyn accent.\n\nDICK\nWhere'd he come from?\n\nRAVENCROFT\n(monotone, as before)\nI don't know. He just appeared as magic.\n\nDICK\nWell, don't just sit there, shoot him.\n\nRavencroft puts her script down.\n\nRAVENCROFT\nWell, Mr. Ritchie, I'm impressed. You're a very fine actor.\n\nDick smiles.\n\nINT. TRAILER HOME \u221a DAY\n\nCliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to come to grips with what\nClarence has told him.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel\nfree.\n\nCLIFF\nYou're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes.\nMaking jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a\njoke about this \u221a\n(raising his voice)\n\u221a I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!\n\nCliff pauses and collects himself.\n\nCLIFF\nWhat do you want from me?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nCLIFF\nStop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in\nsome way. What do you need from me? You need money?\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you still have friends on the force?\n\nCLIFF\nYes, I still have friends on the force.\n\nCLARENCE\nCould you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit\nabout us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for\nsure what's goin' on.\n(pause)\nDaddy?\n\nCLIFF\nWhat makes you think I could do that?\n\nCLARENCE\nYou were a cop.\n\nCLIFF\nWhat makes you think I would do that?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm your son.\n\nCLIFF\nYou got it all worked out, don't you?\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to\nmake your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced\nyou, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a\nyear at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always \"OK\",\n\"No problem\", \"You're a busy guy, I understand\". The whole time you\nwere a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No!\nEverybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad\nparent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm\nbasically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask.\nAnd if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.\n\nAlabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag.\n\nALABAMA\nThe forager's back.\n\nCLARENCE\nThank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.\n\nALABAMA\nI didn't get any chicken.\n\nCLARENCE\nHow come?\n\nALABAMA\nIt's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.\n\nINT. TRAILER HOME \u221a BEDROOM \u221a DAY\n\nCliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks. The living room od\nthe trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are\nhorsing around. They giggle and cut up throughout the scene. As Cliff talks, all\nthe noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line. He's\ntalking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force.\n\nWe see both inside the conversation.\n\nCLIFF\nIt's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.\n\nWILSON\nWhat about him?\n\nCLIFF\nWell, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it\nmight be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible\nfor that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.\n\nWILSON\nAre you still working security for Foster & Langley?\n\nCLIFF\nYeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in\nfor the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while\nI have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?\n\nWILSON\nMcTeague.\n\nCLIFF\nI don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?\n\nWILSON\nI don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?\n\nCLIFF\nYou and Robin moved?\n\nWILSON\nShit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got\nmyself a new place \u221a mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the\nbed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place.\nI'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. TRAILER HOME \u221a DAY\n\nClarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang. Alabama's amusing\nherself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background.\n\nCLIFF\nThey have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo tell. Why drug related?\n\nCLIFF\nApparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo shit?\n\nCLIFF\nYeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name\nmean anything to you?\n\nCLARENCE\nNope.\n\nCLIFF\nIf you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.\n\nCLARENCE\nWho is he?\n\nCLIFF\nGangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look,\nClarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did\nthe right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops\naren't looking for me?\n\nCLIFF\nNaw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou\nhad a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.\n\nClarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.\n\nCLARENCE\nThanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.\n\nCLIFF\nI got some money I can give you \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nKeep it.\n\nCLIFF\nWell, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and\nAlabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.\n\nCLARENCE\nWe do make a cute couple, don't we?\n\nCLIFF\nYeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about.\nQuit fuckin' around.\n(pause)\nI love you son.\n\nThey hug each other,\n\nClarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but\nyou can get a hold of me through him.\n\nClarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her.\n\nCLARENCE\nBama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye,\n\nAlabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff\nand gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's\nbubbling like a Fresca.\n\nALABAMA\nBye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.\n\nCLARENCE\n(mock anger)\nWhat kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?\n\nALABAMA\nOh, hush up.\n\nThe two get into the Mustang.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Cliff)\nWe'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood.\n\nClarence starts the engine. The convertible roof opens as they talk.\n\nCLIFF\nBama, you take care of that one for me. Keep him out of trouble.\n\nALABAMA\nDon't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin' this fella on a short leash.\n\nClarence, slowly, starts driving away.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Cliff)\nAs the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends\nwe've made... and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time\nwhen we will all be together again.\n\nClarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air.\n\nAs the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips.\n\nCLIFF\nThe-son-of-a-bitch was right... she does taste like a peach.\n\nINT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a DAY\n\nDick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat\nand clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf. A framed picture of a ballet\ndancer's feet hangs on the wall.\n\nThe phone rings, Dick answers.\n\nDICK\nHi, Dick here.\n\nINT. HOTEL SUITE \u221a LAS VEGAS \u221a SUNSET\n\nTop floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge picture window\noverlooking the neon-filled strip and the flaming red and orange sunset sky.\n\nClarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand.\n\nCLARENCE\n(big bopper voice)\nHeeeellllloooo baaaabbbbbyyyy!!!\n\nNote: We intercut both sides of the conversation.\n\nDICK\n(unsure)\nClarence?\n\nCLARENCE\nYou got it.\n\nDICK\nIt's great to hear from you.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.\n\nDICK\nYou comin' to L.A.? When?\n\nCLARENCE\nTomorrow.\n\nDICK\nWhat's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?\n\nClarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama, wearing only a long T-\nshirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way,\nI won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.\n\nDICK\nGet the fuck outta here!\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm married man.\n\nDICK\nGet the fuck outta here!\n\nCLARENCE\nBelieve it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm\nnot quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it.\nWanna say hi to my better half?\n\nBefore Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone.\n\nALABAMA\nHi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.\n\nDICK\nHello, Alabama.\n\nALABAMA\nI can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were\nhis best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.\n\nClarence start dictating to her what to say.\n\nCLARENCE\nTell him we gotta go.\n\nALABAMA\nClarence says we gotta be hittin' it.\n\nDICK\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nTell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.\n\nALABAMA\nHe said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.\n\nDICK\nWait a minute \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nTell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.\n\nALABAMA\nDon't eat anything.\n\nDICK\nAlabama, could you tell Clar \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nAsk him if he got the letter.\n\nALABAMA\nDid you get the letter?\n\nDICK\nWhat letter?\n\nALABAMA\n(to Clarence)\nWhat letter?\n\nCLARENCE\nThe letter I sent.\n\nALABAMA\n(to Dick)\nThe letter he sent.\n\nDICK\nClarence sent a letter?\n\nCLARENCE\nHas he gotten his mail today?\n\nALABAMA\nGotten your mail yet?\n\nDICK\nYeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.\n\nALABAMA\n(to Clarence)\nYes.\n\nCLARENCE\nHas he looked through it yet?\n\nALABAMA\n(to Dick)\nYa looked through it?\n\nDICK\nNot yet.\n\nALABAMA\n(to Clarence)\nNope.\n\nCLARENCE\nTell him to look through it.\n\nALABAMA\n(to Dick)\nGet it.\n\nDICK\nLet me speak to Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\n(to Clarence)\nHe wants to speak with you.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo time.

We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter\nexplains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to\nknow that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.\n\nDICK\nMoney problems?\n\nCLARENCE\nNow tell him goodbye.\n\nALABAMA\nBye-bye.\n\nCLARENCE\nNow hang up.\n\nShe hangs up the phone.\n\nINT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a DAY\n\nDick hears the click on the other end.\n\nDICK\nHello, hello, Clarence? Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama... hello?\n\nExtremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone. He goes over to the TV and picks\nup the day's mail. He goes through it.\n\nBILL: Southern California Gas Company.\n\nBILL: Group W.\n\nBILL: Fossenkemp Photography.\n\nBILL: Columbia Record and Tape Club.\n\nLETTER: It's obviously from Clarence. Addressed to Dick. Dick opens it.\n\nEXT. TRAILER \u221a DAY\n\nA lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in\nfront of it in the shape of a planet.\n\nA big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly\nless kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a\nfast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.\n\nINT. TRAILER \u221a DAY\n\nHe steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to\nhis temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.\n\nGUN CARRIER (DARIO)\nWelcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.\n\nCliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men,\nstanding: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy),\nand TOOTH-PICK VIC (a fireplug pitbull type).\n\nSitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid\nmob leader Blue Lou Boyle.\n\nCliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario\nand Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(to Frankie)\nTell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.\n\nIn Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.\n\nCliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff.\nFrankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his\nhand, but he has yet to touch a drop.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nDo you know who I am, Mr. Worley?\n\nCLIFF\nI give up. Who are you?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell\nthe angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly\npersonified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is\nVincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man\nyour son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard\nof us before. Am I correct?\n\nCLIFF\nI've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question\nyou've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and,\nat the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.\n(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)\nWant a Chesterfield?\n\nCLIFF\nNo.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(as he lights up)\nI have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful\nthis must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his\nbrought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road\nwith 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a\nchoice.\n\nCLIFF\nLook, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence \u221a\n\nBefore Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with\nhis fist.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSmarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that\npain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any\nkind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna\nget, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors.\nThey saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in\nfront of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son?\n\nCliff's defeated.\n\nCLIFF\nI've seen him.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nNow I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance\nyou're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore\nyour boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't\njust mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity.\nWell, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do\nsome business, cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room\nblastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.\n\nCLIFF\nWhat are you talkin' about?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it\noutta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is,\nleft his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the\ncommode filled in all the blanks.\n\nCLIFF\nI don't believe you.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nThat's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that\nI believe you. Where did they go?\n\nCLIFF\nOn their honeymoon.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they\ngo?\n\nCLIFF\nThey didn't tell me.\n\nCoccotti looks at him.\n\nCLIFF\nNow, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years.\nYesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me\nhe needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could\nborrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a\ncheck. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me\nGod. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never\nthought to ask.\n\nCoccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil,\nquick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then\nwhips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal\non the wound. Cliff screams.\n\nCoccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.\n\nTooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in\nthe car.\n\nVirgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm\nin agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old\nman was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from\ngrowin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen\ndifferent things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has\nseventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen.\nAnd if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to\nhell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna\nshow me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know\nwhere they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away\nfrom.\n\nThe awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart.\nHe looks deep into Coccotti's eyes.\n\nCLIFF\nCould I have one of those Chesterfields now?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nSure.\n\nCoccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.\n\nCLIFF\nGot a match?\n\nCliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.\n\nCLIFF\nOh, don't bother. I got one.\n(he lights the cigarette)\nSo you're a Sicilian, huh?\n\nCOCCOTTI\n(intensly)\nUh-huh.\n\nCLIFF\nYou know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find\nthat shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians\nwere spawned by niggers.\n\nAll the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic\nVic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what\nhe's hearing.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nCome again?\n\nCLIFF\nIt's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you\ndon't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago\nthe Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then,\nSicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But,\nonce the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did\nso much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for\never, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it\nabsolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later,\nSicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's\nwritten. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-\ngrandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a\nfact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?\n\nCoccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic,\ngrabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets\nthrough Cliff's head.\n\nHe pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his\nfeelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon,\nand turns to his men.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nI haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity\nin fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this\ncomedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me\nwhere that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this\nfucked-up family for good.\n\nTooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was\nall about.\n\nLenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer.\nWhen he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic\nbanana magnet that says: \"Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and\naddress)\".\n\nLENNY\nBoss, get ready to get happy.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A.\"\n\nINT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a MORNING\n\nDick's asleep in a recliner. He's wearing his clothes from the night before. His\nroom-mate FLOYD is lying on the sofa watching TV.\n\nThe sound of our hands knocking on his door wakes Dick up. He shakes the\nbats out of his belfry, opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles\nstanding in his doorway.\n\nClarence and Alabama immediately start singing \"Hello My Baby\" like the frog\nin the old Chuck Jones cartoon.\n\nCLARENCE/ALABAMA\nHello my baby,\nHello my honey,\nHello my ragtime gal \u221a\n\nDICK\nHi guys.\n\nAlabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a quick kiss. After she\nbreaks, Clarence does the same. Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick\nand into his apartment.\n\nCLARENCE\nWow. Neat place.\n\nINT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND \u221a DAY\n\nThe Pink's employees work like skilled Benihana chefs as they assemble the\nultimate masterpiece hot-dog.\n\nEXT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND \u221a PATIO \u221a DAY\n\nClarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor table chowing down on\nchili dogs. Alabama is in the middle of a story.\n\nALABAMA\n... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid\nbefore, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished,\ncrowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and\nmy dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow\nzonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus\nappears, and the bus-driver says, \"Get her in here.\". He forgot all about his\nroute and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice\nguy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well,\nhis name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da\nbeen a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was\nfrom. And, so there you go.\n\nCLARENCE\nAnd here we are.\n\nDICK\nThat's a pretty amazing story.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?\n\nDICK\nJust like in Detroit, only skinnier.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou goin' out?\n\nDICK\nWell, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my\nacting class.\n\nCLARENCE\nGood for you.\n\nDICK\nWhat's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head\nbunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional\ninstability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a\nreally good reading for \"T.J. Hooker\" the other day.\n\nALABAMA\nYou're gonna be on \"T.J. Hooker\"?\n\nDICK\nKnock wood.\n\nHe knocks the table and then looks at it.\n\nDICK\n... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid you meet Captain Kirk?\n\nDICK\nYou don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.\n\nALABAMA\n(finishing her hot-dog)\nThat was so good I am gonna have another.\n\nDICK\nYou can't have just one.\n\nAlabama leaves to get another hot-dog. Clarence never takes his eyes off her.\n\nDICK\nHow much of that letter was on the up and up?\n\nCLARENCE\nEvery word of it.\n\nDick sees where Clarence's attention is.\n\nDICK\nYou're really in love, aren't you?\n\nCLARENCE\nFor the very first time in my life.\n(pause)\nDo you know what that's like?\n\nClarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer.\n\nDICK\n(regretfully)\nNo, I don't\n(he looks at Alabama)\nHow did you two meet?\n\nClarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his Hebrew cream soda.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you remember The Lyric?\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nSonny Chiba, as \"Streetfighter\" Terry Surki, drives into a group of guys, fists\nand feet flying and whips ass on the silver screen.\n\nClarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of him, nibbling on\npopcorn, eyes big as sourcers, and a big smile on his face.\n\nEXT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nA cab pulls up to the outside of The Lyric. The marquee carries the names of the\ntriple feature: \"The Streetfighter\", \"Return of the Streetfighter\" and \"Sister\nStreetfighter\". Alabama steps out of the taxi cab and walks up to the box office.\n\nA BOX OFFICE GIRL reading comic looks at her.\n\nALABAMA\nOne please.\n\nBOX OFFICE GIRL\nNinety-nine cents.\n\nALABAMA\nWhich one is on now?\n\nBOX OFFICE GIRL\n\"Return of the Streetfighter\". It's been on about forty-five minutes.\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a LOBBY \u221a NIGHT\n\nAlabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the concession stand. A\nYOUNG USHER takes care of her.\n\nALABAMA\nCan I have a medium popcorn? A super-large Mr. Pibb, and a box of\nGoobers.\n\nINT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-\ncomers.\n\nAlabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food. She makes a quick\nscan of the theater. Not many people are there. She makes a beeline for the\nfront whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks the row of seats\njust behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it.\n\nClarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him. He\nturns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious.\n\nWhen Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine\nbottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nOh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm the clumsiest person in the world.\n\nCLARENCE\n(picking popcorn out of his hair)\nIt's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.\n\nALABAMA\n(picking popcorn out of his hair)\nWhat a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You\ncould have been a real dick.\n\nAlabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie.\n\nClarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into\nthe movie.\n\nThey both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama leans forward and\ntaps Clarence on the shoulder.\n\nALABAMA\nExcuse me... I hate to bother you again. Would you mind too terribly filling\nme in on what I missed?\n\nJumping on this opportunity.\n\nCLARENCE\nNot at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.\n\nALABAMA\nThe oriental.\n\nCLARENCE\nThe oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired\nto kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into\nthe police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while\nkeepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a\nnumber on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the\nwindow. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.\n\nALABAMA\nWant some Goobers?\n\nCLARENCE\nThanks a lot.\n\nALABAMA\nI thought Sonny was the good guy.\n\nCLARENCE\nHe ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be\nbullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.\n\nThey both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses.\n\nTIME CUT:\n\nOn the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies lie all around him.\nTHE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen.\n\nThe theater light go up. Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence.\nThey're both applauding.\n\nALABAMA\nGreat movie. Action-packed!\n\nCLARENCE\nDoes Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?\n\nALABAMA\nSonny kicks ass.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the \"Streetfighter\". It\nwas the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the\nR.\n\nALABAMA\nIf that was the R, I'd love to see the X.\n\nCLARENCE\nMy name is Clarence, and what is yours?\n\nALABAMA\nAlabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs that your real name? Really?\n\nALABAMA\nThat's my real name, really. I got proof. See.\n\nShe shows Clarence her driver's license.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, cut my legs off and call me Shorty. That's a pretty original moniker\nthere, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie.\n(announcer voice)\nShe's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She\ncarried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,\nand the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!\nPray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!\n\nEXT. THE LYRIC THEATER \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence and Alabama are outside the theater. With the marquee lit up in the\nbackground they both perform unskilled martial arts moves. Clarence and\nAlabama break up laughing.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhere's your car? I'll walk you to it.\n\nALABAMA\nI took a cab.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou took a cab to see three kung fu movies?\n\nALABAMA\nSure. Why not?\n\nCLARENCE\nNothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat time is it?\n\nCLARENCE\n'Bout twelve.\n\nALABAMA\nI suppose you gotta get up early, huh?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo. Not particularly.\n(pause)\nHow come?\n\nALABAMA\nWell, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get\nsome pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after\nyou've seen a good movie?\n\nCLARENCE\nI love to get pie after a movie.\n\nALABAMA\nWould you like to get some pie?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'd love some pie.\n\nINT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's. It's about\n12:40 a.m. Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke.\nAlabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, enough about the King. How about you?\n\nALABAMA\nHow 'bout me what?\n\nCLARENCE\nTell me about yourself.\n\nALABAMA\nThere's nothing to tell.\n\nCLARENCE\nC'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?\n\nALABAMA\nWhat do you want to know?\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your\nfavorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you\nlike? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's\nthe story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?\nAnd, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?\n\nAlabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nAsk me them again. One by one.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat do you do?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't remember.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhere are you from.\n\nALABAMA\nMight be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's your favorite color?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's your favorite movie star?\n\nALABAMA\nBurt Reynolds.\n\nCLARENCE\nWould you like a bite of my pie?\n\nALABAMA\nYes, I would.\n\nClarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike it?\n\nALABAMA\nVery much. Now, where were we?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat kinda music do you like?\n\nALABAMA\nPhil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like \"He's a Rebel\".\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat are your turn-ons?\n\nALABAMA\nMickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like\nElvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.\n\nCLARENCE\nTurn-offs?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only\nthing that comes to mind are Persians.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you have a fella?\n\nShe looks at Clarence and smiles.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of\ntown alone?\n\nALABAMA\nApparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a\nform of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or\nwhere I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even\nknow my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a\nTallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they\ntold me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on\nme, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For\nsome reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told\nhim to stop and I got out.\n\nCLARENCE\nAnd in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?\n\nALABAMA\nBecause you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure\ncouldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.\n\nClarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until\nit makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul.\n\nA smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.\n\nALABAMA\nAren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy?\n(eats her last piece of pie)\nWhere to next?\n\nINT. COMIC BOOK STORE \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a\ncomic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-\ncool.\n\nALABAMA\nWow. What a swell place to work.\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books,\nplay music.\n\nALABAMA\nHow long have you worked here?\n\nCLARENCE\nAlmost four years.\n\nALABAMA\nThat's a long time.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what\nI'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most\nof the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.\n\nALABAMA\nDo you get paid a lot?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow\nsome money if you need it. Wanna see what \"Spiderman\" number one\nlooks like?\n\nALABAMA\nYou bet. How much is that worth?\n\nClarence gets a box off the shelf.\n\nCLARENCE\nFour hundred bucks.\n\nALABAMA\nI didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. \"Man from U.N.C.L.E.\" Lunch\nboxes. \"Green Hornet\" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are\nmain business. There's a lot of collectors around here.\n\nShe holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat's that?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's a \"Rookies\" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls.\nThey're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors\nin \"The Black Hole\"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid\nplayin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.\n\nHe pulls a plastic-cased \"Spiderman\" comic form the box.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Spiderman\", number one. The one that started it all.\n\nClarence shows the comic book to Alabama.\n\nALABAMA\nGod, Spiderman looks different.\n\nCLARENCE\nHe was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr.\nGene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just\ndisguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold\non, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.\n\nHe pulls out another comic.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\". One of the coolest series known\nto man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about\nfour bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.\n(he opens one up)\nJust look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look at\nthis one.\n\nWe see the \"Sgt. Fury\" panels.\n\nCLARENCE\nNick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on\na chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a\nship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain\nand the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. Isn't\nthat cool?\n\nShe's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze.\n\nCLARENCE\nAlabama, I'd like you to have this.\n\nClarence hands her the \"Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos\" comic book\nthat he loves so much.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis,\nanything you can imagine. The two walk through the door.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat a cool room!\n\nShe runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed.\n\nLater. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album.\nClarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders.\n\nALABAMA\nOooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you\nthen?\n\nCLARENCE\nFive.\n\nShe turns the page.\n\nALABAMA\nOh, you look so cute as little Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nI finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.\n\nLATER \u221a LIVING ROOM\n\nClarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's\n\"Piece of My Heart\".\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know when you sat behind me?\n\nALABAMA\nAt the movies?\n\nCLARENCE\nUh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she\ndoesn't want me bothering her.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat would make you think that?\n\nCLARENCE\nI dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.\n\nALABAMA\nYou're not stupid. Just wrong.\n\nThey move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the\nsong.\n\nALABAMA\nI love Janis.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.\n\nALABAMA\nShe OD'd, didn't she?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too\nmuch. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what\nshe took.\n\nALABAMA\nYou mean she got a bad batch?\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the\nhappiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't\ntrust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her\nto marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she\ncouldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money.\nSo, she said no. And the guy says, \"Look, I really love you, and I wanna\nprove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what\nhappens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it.\" So she did,\nand he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her\na secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.\n\nALABAMA\nSo he really loved her?\n\nCLARENCE\nUh-huh.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a DAY\n\nIt's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks\naround, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a\nrobe and investigates.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a LIVING ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair\ncrying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?\n\nALABAMA\nYou didn't do nothing.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid you hurt yourself?\n(he takes her foot)\nWhatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?\n\nALABAMA\nClarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the\ntheater. I was paid to be there.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls.\nMake sure they're not rippin' the place off.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.\n\nPause.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou're a whore?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.\n(pause)\nI don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that\ncomic book place.\n\nCLARENCE\n\"Heroes For Sale\"?\n\nALABAMA\nYeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.\n\nCLARENCE\nWho?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into\nyou, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was\ngonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I\nwas leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich\nmillionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat dazzling imagination.\n\nALABAMA\nIt's over on the TV. All it says is: \"Dear Clarence.\" I couldn't write\nanymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to\never see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that\nmuch fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, \"Alabama, come clean, Let him\nknow what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to\nDrexl and fuck yourself.\"\n\nCLARENCE\nWho and what is a Drexl?\n\nALABAMA\nMy pimp.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou have a pimp?\n\nALABAMA\nUh-huh.\n\nCLARENCE\nA real live pimp?\n\nALABAMA\nUh-huh.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he black?\n\nALABAMA\nHe thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he nice?\n\nALABAMA\nWell, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty\ndecent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with\nArlene the other day.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat did he do to Arlene?\n\nALABAMA\nSlapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.\n\nCLARENCE\nThis motherfucker sounds charming!\n\nClarence is on his feet, furious.\n\nCLARENCE\nGoddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much\nlonger before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How\nthe fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first\nplace?\n\nALABAMA\nAt the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an\nagency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They\nhave a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-\ncollar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five\nhundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry\nbeepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in \"Dressed to Kill\". And when I was\nready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says\nhe makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's\ngonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or\nwind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the\nropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last\nnight. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it\nwas a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a\nsecond date.\n\nCLARENCE\nThank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again.\nBama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went\ntogether all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it,\nyou wanna marry me?\n\nALABAMA\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nWill you be my wife?\n\nWhen Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.\n\nALABAMA\nYes.\n\nCLARENCE\n(a little surprised)\nYou will?\n\nALABAMA\nYou better not be fucking teasing me.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou better not be fuckin' teasin' me.\n\nThey seal it with a kiss.\n\nLATER \u221a THAT NIGHT\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Alabama's wedding ring.\n\nThe newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV. The movie\nthey're watching is \"The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the\nFlying Guillotine\". Alabama watches the screen, but every so often she looks\ndown to admre the ring on her hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nDid ya ever see \"The Chinese Professionals\"?\n\nALABAMA\nI don't believe so.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the\nIncredible One-Armed Boxer.\n\nWe hear, off screen, the TV Announcer say:\n\nTV ANNOUNCER\n(off)\nWe'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in... \"The Incredible One-Armed Boxer\nvs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine\", tonight's eight o'clock movie, after\nthese important messages...\n\nClarence looks at the TV. He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his.\nWe see commercials playing.\n\nHe turns in her direction. She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring.\n\nHe smiles and turns back to the TV.\n\nMore commercials.\n\nDolly close on Clarence's face\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nAlabama, right after he proposed.\n\nALABAMA\nYou better not be fucking teasing me.\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nIn a cute, all-night wedding chapel.

Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you\nseen your lovely wife today?\n\nCLARENCE\nOh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.\n\nALABAMA\nOf course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?\n\nMoving on top of her.\n\nCLARENCE\nNot for me.\n\nHe starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat. She resists.\n\nALABAMA\n(playfully)\nNo no no no no no no no no...\n\nCLARENCE\n(playfully)\nYes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...\n\nFLASH ON:\n\nA big mean-looking BLACK MAN in pimp's clothes.\n\nPIMP\nBitch, you better git yo ass back on the street an' git me my money.\n\nPimp on street corner with his arm around Alabama, giving her a sales pitch to\na potential customer.\n\nPIMP\nI'm tellin' you, my man, this bitch is fine.

There's definitely something different about his eyes.\n\nClarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom. Alabama's startled\nby his sudden movement.\n\nALABAMA\n(yelling after him)\nWhere you goin', honey?\n\nCLARENCE\n(off)\nI just gotta get somethin'.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BATHROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep\npolluting his mind. Then, he hears a familiar voice.\n\nFAMILIAR VOICE\n(off)\nWell? Can you live with it?\n\nClarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley. Clarence isn't surprised to see him.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nELVIS\nCan you live with it?\n\nCLARENCE\nLive with what?\n\nELVIS\nWith that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you?\nAnd gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah.\n\nELVIS\nYou wanna get unhaunted?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah.\n\nELVIS\nThen shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.\n\nCLARENCE\nI can't believe what you're tellin' me.\n\nELVIS\nI ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou'd really do that?\n\nELVIS\nHe don't got no right to live.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to\nkill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.\n\nELVIS\nI don't blame you.\n\nCLARENCE\nIf I thought I could get away with it \u221a\n\nELVIS\nKillin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya\nthink the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find\nwho done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole\nwide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught\nat the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.\n\nClarence looks at Elvis.\n\nELVIS\nClarence, I like ya. Always have, always will.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a BEDROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a A snub-nosed .38, which Clarence loads and sticks down his\nheavy athletic sock.\n\nINT. CALRENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a LIVING ROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nClarence returns.\n\nCLARENCE\nSweetheart, write down your former address.\n\nALABAMA\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nWrite down Drexl's address.\n\nALABAMA\nWhy?\n\nCLARENCE\nSo I can go over there and pick up your things.\n\nALABAMA\n(really scared)\nNo, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.\n\nHe kneels down before her and holds her hand.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker.\nHe can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses\nabsolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it\nwould be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?\n\nALABAMA\nYou don't know him \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I\nneed for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down\nthe address.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"CASS QUARTER, HEART OF DETROIT\"\n\nEXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET \u221a NIGHT\n\nIt's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his red Mustang. He's right smack\ndab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime. He checks the pulse on his\nneck; it's beating like a race horse. To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis\nPresley gyration.\n\nCLARENCE\n(in Elvis voice)\nYeah... Yeah...\n\nHe makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building.\n\nINT. DARK BUILDING \u221a NIGHT\n\nHe's inside. His heart's really racing now. He has the TV guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand. He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey. Clarence knock on the door.\n\nA YOUNG BLACK MAN, about twenty years old, answers the door. He has\nreally big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey.\n\nYOUNG BLACK MAN\nYou want somethin'?\n\nCLARENCE\nDrexl?\n\nYOUNG BLACK MAN\nNaw, man, I'm Marty. Watcha want?\n\nCLARENCE\nI gotta talk to Drexl.\n\nMARTY\nWell, what the fuck you wanna tell him?\n\nCLARENCE\nIt's about Alabama.\n\nA figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett T-shirt. It's our\nfriend, Drexl Spivey.\n\nDREXL\nWhere the fuck is that bitch?\n\nCLARENCE\nShe's with me.\n\nDREXL\nWho the fuck are you?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm her husband.\n\nDREXL\nWell. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.\n\nINT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM \u221a NIGHT\n\nDrexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation\nthey were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway. This is not the\nconfrontation Clarence expected. He trails in behind Drexl and Marty.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nWhat was I sayin'?\n\nMARTY\nRock whores.\n\nDREXL\nYou ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They\ngot that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you.\nThey give you hips, lips, and fingertips.\n\nDrexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nYou know what I'm talkin' about.\n\nDrexl gestures to one of the THREE STONED HOOKERS lounging about the\napartment.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nThese bitches over here ain't shit. You stomp them bitches to death to get\nthe kind of pussy I'm talkin' about.\n\nDrexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-\nout boxes of Chinese food. A black exploitation movie is playing on TV.\n\nDREXL\nLooky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with\nCherry Seven-Up.\n\nMARTY\nPussy love pink rocks.\n\nThis is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he\nexpected Drexl to be like. He positions himself in front of the food table,\ndemanding Drexl's attention.\n\nDREXL\n(eating with chopsticks, to Clarence)\nGrab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We\ngot everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo thanks.\n\nDREXL\nNo thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down\nhere? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to\nbe eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've\nalready given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly\nwhere your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some\ndinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to\nmyself, \"This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the\nworld. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad\nmotherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my\nChinese, watch my TV.\" See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV\nthere, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out,\nand you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I\nknow I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.\n\nClarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not eatin' cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' cause I'm not stayin'.\nI'm not lookin' at the movie cause I saw it seven years ago. It's \"The\nMack\" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by\nBobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama\nReleasing Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In\nthat envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener\npastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter. I don't like to dicker.\nI never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's in that\nenvelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much.\nNot one penny more, not one penny more.\n\nYou could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full\nalert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl.\nDrexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.\n\nDREXL\nIt's empty.\n\nClarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, \"That's right, asshole.\"\n\nSilence.\n\nDREXL\nOooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we\ngot here? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be?\nMr. Majestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't\ngot no hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand \u221a\n\nBefore Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at\nClarence, catching him of guard.\n\nMarty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting\nhim in a tight choke hold.\n\nClarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus.\nWe'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl\ntakes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.\n\nAll of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold\nrecords, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.\n\nMarty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.\n\nSince Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.\n\nClarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about\nit.\n\nDREXL\nYa wanna fuck with me?\n(hits Clarence)\nYa wanna fuck with me?\n(hits Clarence)\nI'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!\n\nHe hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.\n\nClarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs\nhis nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and\nstarts twisting.\n\nMarty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip\naroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of\nhis head.\n\nDrexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's\nthumb.\n\nClarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and\nbusting his nose.\n\nMarty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets\nup on his knees.\n\nDrexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are\ngoing at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping\nthem coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other\nbecause of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.\n\nMarty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of\nLPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to\nhis feet.\n\nDrexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.\n\nMarty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up\ninto a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.\n\nDrexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.\n\nMarty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nYou OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?\n\nMARTY\nNaw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.\n\nDrexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nYou see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk\nin my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin'\nsmack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be\ncrazy.\n(to Marty)\nI don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.\n(laughing)\nHe must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?\n\nMARTY\n(laughing)\nNaw, man, it ain't white boy day.\n\nDREXL\n(to Clarence)\nShit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a\nnigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.\n\nCLARENCE\n(hurting)\nWannabee nigger...\n\nDREXl\nFuck you! My mother was Apache.\n\nDrexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up.\n\nDrexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.\n\nClarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down.\n\nDrexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license.\n\nDREXL\nWell, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost\nlike a nigger name.\n(to Clarence)\nHey, dummy.\n\nHe puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up.\n\nDREXL\nBefore you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I\njust chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're\nsome macho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you\nare, Clarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th street,\napartment 48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same\naddress. Marty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here.\n\nHe hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket.\n\nDREXL\n(to Marty)\nI'll keep lover boy here entertained.\n(to Clarence)\nYou know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her\nsuck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's\ndone it before. But I want you as a audience.\n(hollering to Marty)\nMarty, what the fuck are you doin'?\n\nMARTY\n(off)\nI'm tryin' to find my jacket.\n\nDREXL\nLook in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there\nlately.\n\nWhile Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock\nand pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's\nstanding over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger\nand blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.\n\nDrexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground.\n\nMARTY\n(off)\nWhat's happening?\n\nMarty steps into the room.\n\nClarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest.\n\nTwo of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other\nHooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to\nbe terrified.\n\nDrexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his\nballs and his dick.\n\nClarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker.\n\nCLARENCE\nGet a bag and put Alabama's thing in it!\n\nShe doesn't move.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it!\n\nThe Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the\nbed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence.\n\nClarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like\na pillbug.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand.\n\nClarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Drexl)\nOpen you eyes, laughing boy.\n\nHe doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick.\n\nCLARENCE\nOpen you eyes!\n\nHe does. It's now Drexl's POV from the floor.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?\n\nHe fires.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us. When\nit reaches us, the screen goes awash in red.\n\nINT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT \u221a NIGHT\n\nThe front swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama jumps off the couch and\nruns toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out:\n\nCLARENCE\nI killed him.\n\nShe stops short.\n\nCLARENCE\nI've got some food in the car, I'll be right back.\n\nClarence leaves. Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet. Alabama sits on\nthe couch.\n\nClarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food. He\nheaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down.\n\nCLARENCE\nHelp yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one of\neverythin'.\n\nHe stops and looks at here.\n\nCLARENCE\nI am so hungry.\n\nHe starts eating french fries and hamburgers.\n\nALABAMA\n(in a daze)\nWas it him or you?\n\nCLARENCE\nYeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there\nI said to myself, \"If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it.\" I could.\nSo I did.\n\nALABAMA\nIs this a joke?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious,\nI've never had a hamburger taste this good.\n\nAlabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring her.\n\nCLARENCE\nCome on, Bama, eat something. You'll feel better.\n\nShe continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her. Finally he spins on\nher, yelling:\n\nCLARENCE\nWhy are you crying? He's not worth one of your tears. Would you rather it\nhad been me? Do you love him?\n(no answer)\nDo you love him?\n(no answer)\nDo you love him?\n\nShe looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out.\n\nALABAMA\nI think what you did was...\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nALABAMA\nI think what you did...\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat?\n\nALABAMA\n... was so romantic.\n\nClarence is completely taken back. They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss.\nTheir kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal.\n\nCLARENCE\nI gotta get outta these clothes.\n\nHe picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them.\n\nALABAMA\n(comically)\nClean clothes. There is a god,\n\nClarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop.\n\nALABAMA\nClarence. Those aren't my clothes.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nWe see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign. Pan to the parking lot where\nClarence's empty red Mustang is parked.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CALRENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Dick's jaw drops. His hand reaches out of shot.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is full of\ncocaine!\n\nClarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine.\n\nAlabama's watching the cable TV.\n\nDICK\nHoly Mary, Mother of God.\n\nALABAMA\nThis is great, we got cable.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nBama, you got your blade?\n\nKeeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife\nwith a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the\ncorkscrew and opens the wine.\n\nHe pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a\nlittle one for himself. He hands it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks.\n\nDICK\nThis shit can't be real.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt'll get ya high.\n\nHe tosses the knife.\n\nCLARENCE\nDo you want some wine, sweetheart?\n\nALABAMA\nNope. I'm not really a wine gal.\n\nUsing the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He jumps back.\n\nDICK\nIt's fuckin' real!\n(to Clarence)\nIt's fuckin' real!\n\nCLARENCE\nI certainly hope so.\n\nDICK\nYou've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!\n\nCLARENCE\nI know.\n\nDICK\nDo you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?\n\nCLARENCE\nTell me.\n\nDICK\nI don't know! A fuckin' lot!\n\nHe downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass.\n\nDICK\nThis is Drexl's coke?\n\nCLARENCE\nDrexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he\nwants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama\nare gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So,\nyou got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?\n\nDICK\nLook, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.\n\nDick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills up.\n\nCLARENCE\nBut you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the\nset.\n\nDICK\nYeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know\nthose guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot\nto piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit\nat a time \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nNo way! The whole enchilada in one shot.\n\nDICK\nDo you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred\nthousand. How difficult can that be?\n\nDICK\nIt's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat\ncats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two\nhundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And,\nmore important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could\npossibly help you.\n\nCLARENCE\nIs he big league?\n\nDICK\nHe's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very\npowerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could\nbe interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat'd'ya tell 'em?\n\nDICK\nHardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and\nwhat wasn't.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's this acting class guy's name?\n\nDICK\nElliot.\n\nCLARENCE\nElliot what?\n\nDICK\nElliot Blitzer.\n\nCLARENCE\nOK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the\ngetting to know you stuff.\n\nDICK\nWhere?\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Alabama)\nThe zoo.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Dick)\nThe zoo.\n(pause)\nWhat are you waiting for?\n\nDICK\nWould you just shut up a minute and let me think?\n\nCLARENCE\nWhat's to think about?\n\nDICK\nShut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're\nmarried. You killed a guy.\n\nCLARENCE\nTwo guys.\n\nDICK\nTwo guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck,\nClarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean\nshit.\n\nCLARENCE\nDon't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a\nfuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he\ndeserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit\nbadge or somethin'.\n\nDick rests his head in his hands.\n\nCLARENCE\nLook, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need\nyou to rise to the occasion. So, drink some more wine. Get used to the idea,\nand get your friend to the phone.\n\nEXT.

As they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal crackers and\nAlabama is blowing soap bubbles.\n\nELLIOT\nSo you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're\nunloading \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nWant an animal cracker?\n\nELLIOT\nYeah, OK.\n\nHe takes one.\n\nCLARENCE\nLeave the gorillas.\n\nELLIOT\n\u221a that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nUnloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.\n\nDICK\n(trying to chill him out)\nClarence...\n\nELLIOT\nWhere did you get it?\n\nCLARENCE\nI grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high\nenough so you can't see it from the street.\n\nELLIOT\n(forcing a laugh)\nHa ha ha. No really, where does it come from?\n\nCLARENCE\nCoco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind\nof a paste \u221a\n\nELLIOT\n(turning to Dick)\nLook, Dick, I don't \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\n(laughing)\nNo problem, Elliot.

What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob\nquestions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the\nevidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with\na wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he\ncould trust.\n\nELLIOT\nHe trusts you?\n\nCLARENCE\nWe were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So,\nI'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get\nfucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you\ndidn't hear nothin'.\n\nELLIOT\nSure. I didn't hear anything.\n\nElliot is more than satisfied. Clarence makes a comical face at Dick when\nElliot's not looking. Dick is wearing I-don't-believe-this-guy expresion.\nAlabama is forever blowing bubbles.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO \u221a SNACK BAR \u221a DAY\n\nWe're in the snack bar area of the zoo. Alabama, Dick, and Elliot are sitting\naround a plastic outdoor table. Clarence is pacing around the table as he talks.\nAlabama is still blowing bubbles.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Elliot)\nDo I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like\nFrench vanilla ice-cream?\n\nElliot hasn't the slightest idea what that is supposed to mean.\n\nELLIOT\nWhat?\n\nCLARENCE\nDo I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like\nFrench vanilla ice-cream?\n\nELLIOT\n(with conviction)\nNo. No, you don't.\n\nCLARENCE\nThen why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?\n\nDICK\nClarence...\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Dick)\nLet me handle this.\n\nELLIOT\nGet it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys,\nand he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're\ndependable. And, they're safe.\n\nCLARENCE\nRiddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what\nthe fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your\ntime than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's\ninterested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe\nfuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he\ncan play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's\nbest friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not\nputtin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But,\ndon't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some\nguts.\n\nElliot has been silenced. He nods his head in agreement.\n\nINT. PORSCHE \u221a MOVING \u221a MULHOLLAND DRIVE \u221a DAY\n\nMovie producer, LEE DONOWITZ, is driving his Porsche through the winding\nHollywood hills, just enjoying being rich and powerful. His cellular car phone\nrings, he answers.\n\nLEE\nHello.\n(pause)\nElliot, it's Sunday. Why am I talkin' to you on Sunday? I don't see enough\nof you during the week I gotta talk to you on Sunday? Why is it you always\ncall me when I'm on the windiest street in L.A.?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELLIOT\n\nElliot is on the zoo payphone. Clarence is next to him. Dick is next to Clarence.\nAlabama is next to Dick, blowing bubbles.\n\nELLIOT\n(on phone)\nI'm with that party you wanted me to get together with. Do you know what\nI'm talking about, Lee?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nStore-fronts whiz by in the background.\n\nLEE\nWhy the hell are you calling my phone to talk about that?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELLIOT\n\nELLIOT\nWell, he'd here right now, and he insists on talking to you.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nIn the 7th street tunnel. Lee'svoice echoes.\n\nLEE\nAre you outta your fuckin' mind?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELLIOT\n\nELLIOT\nYou said if I didn't get you on the \u221a\n\nClarence takes the receiverout of Elliot's hand.\n\nCLARENCE\n(into phone)\nHello, Lee, it's Clarence. At last we meet.\n\nEXT. DICK'S APARTMENT \u221a DAY\n\nVirgil's knocking on Dick's door. Floyd (Dick's room-mate) answers.\n\nVIRGIL\nHello, is Dick Ritchie here?\n\nFLOYD\nNaw, he ain't home right now.\n\nVIRGIL\nDo you live here?\n\nFLOYD\nYeah, I live here.\n\nVIRGIL\nSorta room-mates?\n\nFLOYD\nExactly room-mates.\n\nVIRGIL\nMaybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours\nfrom Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be\ntravelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they\nstayin' here?\n\nFLOYD\nNaw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're\nstayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.\n\nVIRGIL\nHow do you know? You been there?\n\nFLOYD\nNo, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda\neasy to remember.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou're right. It is.\n\nEXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO \u221a PAYPHONE \u221a DAY\n\nClarence is still on the phone with Lee.\n\nCLARENCE\nLee, the reason I'm talkin' with you is I want to open \"Doctor Zhivago\" in\nL.A. And I want you to distribute it.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nStopped in the traffic on Sunset Boulevard.\n\nLEE\nI don't know, Clarence, \"Doctor Zhivago\" is a pretty big movie.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nThe biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a\nlot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a\nmovie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nHe's still on Sunset Boulevard, the traffic's moving better now.\n\nLEE\nI'm not sayin' I'm not interested. But being a distributer's not what I'm all\nabout. I'm a film producer, I'm on this world to make good movies.\nNothing more. Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end\nhelps me on many levels.\n\nTraffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The background whizzes past him.\n\nLEE\n(continuing)\nBut the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of\ndistributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna\naccomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nNow that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a\nrisk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks,\nthen go straight to cable. This is \"Doctor Zhivago\". This'll be packin' 'em\nin for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to\nwork with anybody's movie but mine.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE\n\nSpeeding down a benchside road.\n\nLEE\nWell, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to \"Doctor Zhivago\" are\nin arbitration?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCLARENCE\n\nCLARENCE\nI wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a\ncourtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on\nthe cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're\nin bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have\nto come to terms with your Fear and Desire.\n\nPause. Clarence hands the phone to Elliot.\n\nCLARENCE\n(to Elliot)\nHe wants to talk ya.\n\nELLIOT\n(into phone)\nMr. Donowitz?\n(pause)\nI told you, through Dick.\n(pause)\nHe's in my acting class.\n(pause)\nAbout a year.\n(pause)\nYeah, he's good.\n(pause)\nThey grew up together.\n(pause)\nSure thing.\n\nElliot hangs up the phone.\n\nELLIOT\nHe says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants\neverybody there.\n(pointing to Clarence)\nHe'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do\nbusiness. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a\nsample bag.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo problems on both counts.\n\nHe offers Elliot the animal crackers.\n\nCLARENCE\nHave a cookie.\n\nElliot takes one.\n\nELLIOT\nThanks.\n\nHe puts it in the mouth.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat wasn't a gorilla, was it?\n\nEXT. HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nThe red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the hotel. Alabama\nhops out. Clarence stays in.\n\nALABAMA\nYou did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do\nmy part OK?\n\nCLARENCE\nBabalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.\n\nALABAMA\nI felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head.\nI'm gonna go grab dinner.\n\nALABAMA\nI'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm\ngonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated\nmovies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nCLARENCE\nWe now return to \"Bullit\" already in progress.\n\nHe slams the Mustang in reverse and peels out of the hotel. Alabama walks her\nlittle walk from the parking lot to the pool area. Somebody whistles at her, she\nturns to them.\n\nALABAMA\nThank you.\n\nShe gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens the door.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CALRENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nShe steps in only to find Virgil sitting on a chair placed in front of the door with\na sawed-off shotgun aimed right at her.\n\nVIRGIL\n(calmly)\nStep inside and shut the door.\n\nShe doesn't move, she's frozen. Virgil leans forward.\n\nVIRGIL\n(calmly)\nLady. I'm gonna shoot you in the face.\n\nShe does exactly as he says. Virgil rises, still aiming the sawed-off.\n\nVIRGIL\nStep away from the door, move into the bathroom.\n\nShe does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then steps closer to her.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, Alabama, where's our coke, where's Clarence, and when's he coming\nback.\n\nALABAMA\nI think you got the wrong room, my name is Sadie. I don't have any Coke,\nbut there's a Pepsi machine downstairs. I don't know any Clarence, but\nmaybe my husband does. You might have heard of him, he play football. Al\nLylezado. He'll be home any minute, you can ask him.\n\nVirgil can't help but smile.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou're cute.\n\nVirgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which catches Alabama square\nin the face, lifting her off the ground and dropping her flat on her back.\n\nINT. MOVING RED MUSTANG \u221a DAY\n\nClarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat, singing to himself.\n\nCLARENCE\n(singing)\n\"Land of stardust, land of glamour,\nVistavision and Cinema,\nEverything about it is a must,\nTo get to Hollywood, or bust...\"\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste\nof the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil\nstanding there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again\nto the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life.\n\nVIRGIL\nHurts, don't it? It better. Took me a long time to kick like that. I'm third-\ndegree blackbelt, you know? At home I got trophies. Tournaments I was in.\nKicked all kinds of ass. I got great technique. You ain't hurt that bad. Get\non your feet, Fruitloop.\n\nAlabama wobbily complies.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhere's our coke? Where's Clarence? And when he's comin' back?\n\nAlabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to\ndie, because this man is going to kill her.\n\nALABAMA\nGo take a flying fuck and a rolling donut.\n\nVirgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach.\nThe air is sucked out of her lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours\ngasping for air that's just not there.\n\nVirgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one up with a Zippo lighter.\nHe takes a long, deep drag.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get used to it.\n\nINT. HAMBURGER STAND \u221a DAY\n\nClarence walks through the door of some mom and pop fast-food restaurant.\n\nCLARENCE\nWoah! Smells like hamburgers in here! What's the biggest, fattest\nhamburger you guys got?\n\nThe IRANIAN GUY at the counter says:\n\nIRANIAN GUY\nThat would be Steve's double chili cheeseburger.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, I want two of them bad boys. Two large orders of chili fries. Two\nlarge Diet Cokes.\n(looking at a menu at the wall)\nAnd I'll tell you what, why don't you give me a combination burrito as well.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room. She braces herself\nagainst the wall. She is very punchy. Virgil steps in front of her.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you?\nDream on, cunt. You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool. And your pretty face is\ngonna turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my\nfuckin' coke?\n\nShe doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her\nhead slams into the left side of the wall.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhere's Clarence?!\n\nNothing. He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side.\nHer legs start to give way. He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her\nlightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhen's Clarence getting back?\n\nShe can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the\nmiddle finger. Virgil can't help but smile.\n\nVIRGIL\nYou gotta lot of heart, kid.\n\nHe gives her a spinning roadhouse kick to the head that sends her to the floor.\n\nINT. HAMBURGER STAND \u221a DAY\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Burgers sizzling on a griddle, Chili and cheese is put on them.\n\nClarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER reading a copy of\n\"Newsweek\" with Elvis on the cover.\n\nCLARENCE\nThat's a great issue.\n\nThe Customer lowers his magazine a little bit.\n\nCUSTOMER\nYeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.\n\nCLARENCE\nHave you read the story on Elvis?\n\nCUSTOMER\nNo. Not yet.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I\nlook at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I\nended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever\nwrong.\n\nCUSTOMER\nThat good, huh?\n\nHe takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the\nElvis article.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the\nwhole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew\nup with him, the artists he inspired \u221a Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and\nthe fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the\ncreeps.\n\nCUSTOMER\nI can see what you mean.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every\nbranch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.\n\nClarence and the Customer laugh.\n\nINT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a CLARENCE'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's\ncrawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the\ncocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary.\n\nVIRGIL\nNow the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're the\nBoston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles\nWhitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you\ngreen money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the\nbitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to ho. Now, the\nsecond one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to ho.\nYou still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around. Then you\ncompletely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's gotten to the\npoint now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change.\n\nHe's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the\nbed, and the black suitcase is right there.\n\nAlabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the\nblack case and almost goes snow blind.\n\nVIRGIL\nWell, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great.\nOne less thing I gotta worry about.\n\nVirgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.\n\nShe pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth \u221a\n\nAlabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands. Mr. Karate-\nman smiles.\n\nVIRGIL\nKid, you got a lotta heart.\n\nHe moves toward her.\n\nAlabama's hands are shaking.\n\nVIRGIL\nTell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a free swing. Now, I only\ndo that for people I like.\n\nHe moves close.\n\nAlabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open.\nButtons fly everywhere.\n\nVIRGIL\nGo ahead, girl, take a stab at it.\n(giggling)\nYou don't have anything to lose.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose.\nVirgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women\nthat comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many\nwomen all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt\nonly a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into \"I'll\ntake this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do\" seething hatred.\n\nLetting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then\ndrops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.\n\nCLOSEUP \u221a VIRGIL'S FACE\n\nTalk about bloodcurling yells.\n\nVirgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running\ndown his face.\n\nWhile Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter\nthat Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster,\nso it doesn't kill him.\n\nVirgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.\n\nVIRGIL\nOK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.\n\nAlabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it\nand, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the\nnose, breaking it.\n\nHer eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to\nit, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back,\nsending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.\n\nVirgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama.\nAlabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but\nnot one of them has ever laughed before he did it.\n\nVIRGIL\nWhat's so fuckin' funny?!!\n\nALABAMA\n(laughing)\nYou look so ridiculous.\n\nShe laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off\nthe ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.\n\nVIRGIL\nLaugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you\nlaughing now?\n\nAlabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and\nsqueezes it out in her hand.\n\nVirgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.\n\nAlabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his\neyes.\n\nVIRGIL\nOh Jesus!\n\nShe grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.\n\nVIRGIL\nOh Mary, help me!\n\nThe battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's\nclutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a\nTasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming\ntoward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks\nher into the toilet.\n\nAhe recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the\ntoilet tank.\n\nVirgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama\nbrings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet\nlid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires\nanyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.\n\nThe toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.\n\nAlabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net\nhairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his\ngun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame,\nwhich results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.\n\nHe fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending\nwater spraying.\n\nUpon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama\ndown, and runs out of the bathroom.\n\nVirgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off\nlaying on the ground. He crawls toward it.\n\nAlabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45\nautomatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.\n\nHe reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.\n\nAlabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-\nrunning-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.\n\nHe arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and\nsending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.\n\nAlabama snatches the shotgun.\n\nArched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.\n\nThe first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second\nhits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.\n\nAlabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.\n\nEver since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been\nfunctioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of\nSaint Francis of Assisi.\n\nALABAMA\nLord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;\nwhere there is hatred, let me sow love;\nwhere there is injury, pardon;\nwhere there is doubt, faith;\nwhere there is despair, hope;\nwhere there is darkness, light;\nand where there is sadness, joy.\nO Divine Master, grant that I may not\nso much seek to be consoled as to console;\nto be understood as to understand;\nto be loved as to love;\nfor it is in giving that we receive,\nit is pardoning that we are pardoned,\nand it is in dying that we are born\nto eternal life.\n\nClarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn,\nonly to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun.\n\nCLARENCE\nHoney?\n\nShe continues. He puts his gun away.\n\nCLARENCE\nSweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute,\n\nShe continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She\nlies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms.\n\nClarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his\nshoulder.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN \u221a DAY\n\nEverybody is outside their rooms wathcing as Clarence walks through the pool\narea with his bundle. Sirens can be heard.\n\nEXT. MOVING RED MUSTANG \u221a DAY\n\nClarence is driving like mad. Alabama's passed out in the passenger seat. She's\nmuttering to herself. Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the other\nstrokes Alabama's hair.\n\nCLARENCE\nSleep baby. Don't dream. Don't worry. Just sleep. You deserve better than\nthis. I'm so sorry. Sleep my angel. Sleep peacefully.\n\nEXT. MOTEL 6 \u221a NIGHT\n\nA new motel. Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside.\n\nINT.

NOWHERE\n\nClarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly to the camera. He's in a\nheadshot.\n\nCLARENCE\nI feel so horrible about what she went through. That fucker really beat the\nshit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt that\nthe way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that\nmuch. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'.\nBut, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured\nwith words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to \u221a\nthat's a test of oneself. That's a true romance. I swear to God, I'll cut off my\nhands and gouge out my eyes before I'll every let anything happen to that\nlady again.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nEXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS \u221a NIGHT\n\nA wonderful, gracefully flowing shot of the Hollywood Hills. Off in the distance\nwe hear the roar of a car engine.\n\nEXT.

MOVING PORSCHE \u221a NIGHT\n\nElliot Blitzer is the driver, standing on it. A blond, glitzy COKE WHORE is\nsitting next to him. They're having a ball. Then they're seeing a red and blue\nlight flashing in the rear-view window. It's the cops.\n\nELLIOT\nFuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined,\ndriving like this!\n(he pulls over)\nKandi, you gotta help me.\n\nKANDI\nWhat can I do?\n\nHe pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence gave him earlier.\n\nELLIOT\nYou gotta hold this for me.\n\nKANDI\nYou must be high. Uh-huh. No way.\n\nELLIOT\n(frantically)\nJust put it in your purse.\n\nKANDI\nI'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.\n\nELLIOT\nThey won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.\n\nKANDI\nNo way, Jose.\n\nELLIOT\nPlease, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.\n\nKANDI\nI'm not wearing a bra.\n\nELLIOT\n(pleading)\nPut it in your pants.\n\nKANDI\nNo.\n\nELLIOT\nYou're the one who wanted to drive fast.\n\nKANDI\nRead my lips.\n\nShe mouths the word \"no\".\n\nELLIOT\nAfter all I've done for you, you fuckin' whore!!\n\nShe goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine instead. It rips open. Cocaine\ncompletely covers his blue suit. At that moment Elliot turns to face a flashing\nbeam. Tears fill his eyes.\n\nINT. POLICE STATION \u221a INTERROGATION ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nElliot is sitting in a chair at the table. Two young, good-looking, casually\ndressed, Starsky and Hutch-type POLICE DETECTIVES are questioning him.\nThey're known in the department as Nicholson and Dimes. The dark-haired one\nis Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky Dimes.\n\nNICHOLSON\nLook, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine \u221a\n\nDIMES\nNot a tiny little vial \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nBut a fuckin' baggie.\n\nDIMES\nNo don't sit here and feed us some shit.\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now\nwe gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time \u221a\n\nDIMES\nYou're no longer an extra \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nOr a bit player \u221a\n\nDIMES\nOr a supporting actor \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man\nshow nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience \u221a\n\nDIMES\nBut there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy\nwho gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll\nhave so much experience to draw on \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nAnd just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get\nmarried, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because\nyou'll know what it's like to be a woman.\n\nDIMES\n'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right\nanymore \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nThat is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.\n\nElliot starts crying. Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks and smile. Mission\naccomplished.\n\nINT.

Het in here!\n\nThe two casually dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in, both shouting at once.\n\nNICHOLSON\nKrinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin'\ninto somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him\nfrom the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form\nthe right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts cryin', and then it\nwas all over \u221a\n\nDIMES\nKrinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and\nif I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole\ndepartment. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta\ncome in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion \u221a\n\nKRINKLE\nBoth you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened,\nwhat's going on, and what are you talking about?\n\nDIMES\nOkee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for\nspeeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they\nbring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.\n\nNICHOLSON\nNicholson and I.\n\nDIMES\nNicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in\nDenmark, cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're\nsweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.\n\nNICHOLSON\nWhich wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.\n\nDIMES\nSo we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you\nain't gonna fuckin' believe it.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. RESTAURANT \u221a DAY\n\nDetroit. Very fancy restaurant. FOUR WISE-GUY HOODS, one older, the\nother three, youngsters, are seated at the table with Mr. Coccotti.\n\nCOCCOTTI\n\u221a And so, tomorrow morning comes, and no Virgil. I check with Nick\nCardella, who Virgil was supposed to leave my narcotics with, he never\nshows. Now, children, somebody is stickin' a red-hot poker up my asshole\nand what I don't know is whose hand's on the handle.\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #1 (FRANKIE)\nYou think Virgil started gettin' big ideas?\n\nCOCCOTTI\nIt's possible. Anybody can be carried away with delusions of grandeur. But\nafter that incident in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil.\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #2 (DARIO)\nWhat happened?\n\nOLD WISE-GUY(LENNY)\nVirgil got picked up in a warehouse shakedown. He got five years, he\nserved three.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nAnybody who clams up and does hid time, I don't care how I feel about him\npersonally, he's OK.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nKRINKLE'S OFFICE\n\nNICHOLSON\nIt seems a cop from some department, we don't know where, stole a half a\nmillion dollars of coke from the property cage and he's been sittin' on it for\na year and a half. Now the cops got this weirdo \u221a\n\nDIMES\nSuspect's words \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nTo front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his\nboss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.\n\nDIMES\nHe produced \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\".\n\nKRINKLE\nThat Vietnam movie?\n\nNICHOLSON\nUh-huh.\n\nKRINKLE\nThat was a good fuckin' movie.\n\nDIMES\nSure was.\n\nKRINKLE\nDo you believe him?\n\nNICHOLSON\nI believe he believes him.\n\nDIMES\nHe's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny\ngranny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.\n\nNICHOLSON\nThis rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.\n\nKRINKLE\nHe'll wear a wire?\n\nDIMES\nWe talked him into it.\n\nKRINKLE\nDirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.\n\nNICHOLSON\nLook, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire\ndepartment, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the\ntwelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.\n\nDIMES\nCocaine. Dirty cops. Hollywood. This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way.\nAnd we found it, so we want the fuckin' collar.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nINT. RESTAURANT \u221a DAY\n\nYOUNG WISE-GUY #3 (MARVIN)\nMaybe Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's. Cardella turns Virgil's switch\noff, and Cardella decides to open up his own fruit stand.\n\nLENNY\nExcuse me, Mr. Coccotti.\n(to Marvin)\nDo you know Nick Cardella?\n\nMARVIN\nNo.\n\nLENNY\nThen where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?\n\nMARVIN\nI didn't mean \u221a\n\nLENNY\nShut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth\nbefore you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you\ncan throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.\n\nCOCCOTTI\nChildren, we're digressing. Another possibility is that rat-fuck whore and\nher wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil. Knowing Virgil, I find\nthat hard to believe. But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot.\nSo you see, children, I got a lot of questions and no answers. Find out who\nthis wing-and-a-prayer artist is and take him off at the neck.\n\nTITLE CARD: \"THE BIG DAY\"\n\nEXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY \u221a SUNRISE\n\nClarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just off of Imperial Highway.\nAs luck would have it, somebody has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of\nthe road.

I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in\nother countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off\nto, my little turtledove?\n\nALABAMA\nCancoon.\n\nCLARENCE\nWhy Cancoon?\n\nALABAMA\nIt's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. \"Clarence and Alabama Go\nto Cancoon\". Don't 'cha think?\n\nCLARENCE\nBut in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.\n\nThey kiss.\n\nCLARENCE\nDon't you worry 'bout anything. It's all gonna work out for us. We deserve\nit.\n\nINT.

I don't know, what do you want me to say?\n\nDICK\nLook, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp \u221a\n\nCLARENCE\nI know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week\nhas taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a\ngun and not to have it.\n\nPause. Clarence stops walking.\n\nCLARENCE\nHold it, guys. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty scared.\nWhat say we forget the whole thing.\n\nDick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved.\n\nDICK\nDo you really mean it?\n\nCLARENCE\nNo, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think\nabout it. How 'bout you, Bama?\n\nALABAMA\nI thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.\n\nCLARENCE\nIt is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't\nwant you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up\nthere. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's\nwaiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the\ndownside.\n\nDICK\nNow's a helluva time to play \"what if\".\n\nCLARENCE\nThis is our last chance to play \"what if\". I want to do it.

As petrified as I am, I just can't walk away.\nI'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life if I don't go in\nthere. Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop,\nhe's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high. And I'm just the man\nwho can get him there. So what say we throw caution to the wind and let\nthe chips fall where they may.\n\nClarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel. Dick and\nAlabama exchange looks and follow.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a LOBBY \u221a DAY\n\nElliot's walking around the lobby.

The .38 is still pressed against his forehead.\n\nCLARENCE\nLike Nick Carter used to say: I I'm wrong, I'll apologize. I want you to tell\nme what's waiting for us up there. Something's amiss. I can feel it. If\nanything out of the ordinary goes down, believe this, you're gonna be the\nfirst one shot. Trust me, I am AIDS, you fuck with me, you die. Now quit\nmaking me mad and tell me why I'm so fucking nervous.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nHe's bluffin', I knew it. He doesn't know shit.\n\nDIMES\nDon't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou're am actor, so act, motherfucker.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nElliot still hasn't answered.\n\nCLARENCE\nOK.\n\nWith the .38 up against Elliot's head Clarence puts his palm over the top of the\ngun to shield himself from the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what\nhe's gonna do.\n\nElliot, tears running down, starts talking for the benefit of the people at the\nother end of the wire. He sounds like a little boy.\n\nELLIOT\nI don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. I wish somebody would just come\nand get me cause I don't like this. This is not what I thought it would be.\nAnd I wish somebody would just take me away. Just take me away Come\nand get me. Cause I don't like this anymore. I can't take this.

But, Lee, I'm fairly confident\nthat you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll\nput the gun on the table.\n\nLEE\nI don't think that'll be necessary.

All those assholes make are\nunwatchable movies from unreadable books.\n\nBoris starts placing clear-glass coffee cups in front of everybody and fills\neverybody's cup from a fancy coffee pot that he handles like an expert.\n\nLEE\nClarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more\nthan I do, but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nClarence is on a roll and he knows it.\n\nCLARENCE\nThey ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films.\nAnd do you know what films are? They're for people who don't like\nmovies. \"Mad Max\", that's a movie. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\",\nthat's a movie. \"Rio Bravo\", that's a movie. \"Rumble Fish\", that's a\nfuckin' movie. And, \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\", that's a movie. It was\nthe first movie with balls to win a lot of Oscars since the \"The Deer\nHunter\".\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThey're all listening to this.\n\nDIMES\nWhat's this guy doin'? Makin' a drug deal or gettin' a job on the \"New\nYorker\"?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nCLARENCE\nMy uncle Roger and uncle Cliff, both of which were in Nam, saw \"Coming\nHome in a Body Bag\" and thought it was the most accurate Vietnam film\nthey'd ever seen.\n\nLEE\nYou know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit wars says that, it\nmakes the whole project worthwhile. Clarence, my friend, and I call you\nmy friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you\nhave for me.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nThank God.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nClarence puts the suitcase on the table.\n\nCLARENCE\nLee, when you see this you're gonna shit.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLOBBY\n\nThe four Wise-guys are at the desk.\n\nLENNY\n(quietly to the others)\nWhat was the Jew-boy's name?\n\nMARVIN\nDonowitz, he said.\n\nFRONT-DESK GUY\nHow can I help you, Gentlemen?\n\nLENNY\nYeah, we're from Warner Bros. What room is Mr. Donowitz in?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nLee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it.\n\nCLARENCE\nNow, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot\nmore.\n\nLEE\nDon't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.\n\nCLARENCE\nMe too, Boris.\n\nBoris fills both of their cups. They both, calm as a lake, take cream and sugar.\nAll eyes are on them. Lee uses light cream and sugar, he begins stirring this\ncup. Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar.\n\nLEE\n(stirring loudly)\nYou like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.\n\nBoth are cool as cucumbers.\n\nLEE\nI have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage, this is quality. Can Boris\nmake anybody a sandwich? I got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canters in\nthere.\n\nALABAMA\nNo thank you.\n\nDICK\nNo. But thanks.\n\nCLARENCE\nNo thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that\nmade me a little sick.\n\nLEE\nWhere'd you go?\n\nCLARENCE\nA Norms in Van Nuys.\n\nLEE\nBastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.\n\nLee continues looking at the merchandise.\n\nAlabama writes something in her napkin with a pencil. She slides the napkin\nover to Clarence. It says: \"You're so cool\" with a tiny heart drawn on the\nbottom of it. Clarence takes the pencil and draws an arrow through the heart.\nShe takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket.\n\nLee looks up.\n\nLEE\nOK, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect. But, whenever I'm offered a deal\nthat's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie. Convince me you're on the\nlevel.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNICHOLSON\nIf he don't bite, we ain't got shit except posession.\n\nDIMES\nConvince him.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I\ndon't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with\nprofessionals. I'm not a professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take that,\nand I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a\nhelluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug\ndealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all\nof the time. Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and\nyou're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker. I like\nyou, and I'm still scared. I'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street,\nonly to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a million dollars, but I\ncan't get the million dollars for it. But, you can. So, I'll sell it to you for a\ncouple a hundred thousand. You go to make a million. It's all found money\nto me anyway. Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred\nthousand is the world.\n\nLEE\nElliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.\n\nCLARENCE\nWell, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.\n(to Elliot)\nThanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on\nyou. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.\n(to Lee)\nHe's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.\n\nLEE\nWhy does he trust you?\n\nCLARENCE\nWe grew up together.\n\nLEE\nIf you don't know shit, ehy does he think you can sell it?\n\nCLARENCE\nI bullshitted him.\n\nLee starts laughing.\n\nLEE\nThat's wild. This fucking guy's a madman. I love it. Monty, go in the other\nroom and get the money.\n\nClarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nNicholson and Dimes exchange looks.\n\nDIMES & NICHOLSON\nBingo!\n\nBACK TO:\n\nELEVATOR\n\nThe four Wise-guys are coming up.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nLEE\n(pointing to Alabama)\nWhat's your part in this?\n\nALABAMA\nI'm his wife.\n\nLEE\n(referring to Dick)\nHow 'bout you?\n\nDICK\nI know Elliot.\n\nLEE\nAnd Elliot knows me. Tell me, Clarence, what department does you friend\nwork in?\n\nDick and Alabama panic.\n\nCLARENCE\n(without missing a beat)\nCarson County Sheriffs.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThe internal affairs officers high five.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nMonty brings in a briefcase of money and puts it down on the table.\n\nLEE\nWanna count your money?\n\nCLARENCE\nActually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nCOPS' ROOM\n\nThey all stand.\n\nDIMES\nOK, boys. Let's go get 'em.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a LEE'S HOTEL ROOM \u221a BATHROOM \u221a\nDAY\n\nClarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door. As soon as it's shut he\nstarts doing the twist. He can't believe he's pulled it off. He goes to the toilet\nand starts taking a piss. He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink.\n\nELVIS\nClarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.\n\nCLARENCE\nI was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.\n\nELVIS\nAll anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.\n\nCLARENCE\nCan you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.\n\nELVIS\nOh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: \"I'll take that gun\", \"You'll\nhave to\".\n\nCLARENCE\nThat was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came\nfrom. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought,\nthat's a cool line, I gotta remember that.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nEverything's just as it was.\n\nSudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with\nguns drawn.\n\nDIMES & NICHOLSON\nPolice! Freeze, you're all under arrest!\n\nEverybody at the table stands up. Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis.\n\nNICHOLSON\nYou two! Put the guns on the floor and back away.\n\nMONTY\nFuck you! All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away.\n\nLEE\nMonty, what are you talking about? So what they say.\n\nDIMES\nThis is your last warning! Drop those fuckin' guns!\n\nBORIS\nThis is your last warning! We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it!\nNow get on the floor!\n\nDICK\nWhat the fuck am I doing here?\n\nLEE\nBoris! Everybody's gonna get killed! They're cops!\n\nMONTY\nSo they're cops. Who gives a shit?\n\nBORIS\nLee, something I never told you about me. I don't like cops.\n\nDIMES\nOK, let's everybody calm down and get nice. Nobody has to die. We don't\nwant it, and you don't want it.\n\nLEE\nWe don't want it.\n\nThe four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie,\nwho has two .45 automatics, one in each hand.\n\nHalf of the cops spin around.\n\nWURLITZER\nFreeze!\n\nLENNY\nWho are you guys?\n\nWURLITZER\nPolice.\n\nDARIO\n(to Lenny)\nDo we get any extra if we have to kill cops?\n\nBACK TO:\n\nBATHROOM\n\nClarence and Elvis.\n\nCLARENCE\nHow do you think I'm doin' with Lee?\n\nELVIS\nAre you kiddin'? He loves you.\n\nCLARENCE\nYou don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?\n\nELVIS\nYou're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as\nkissin' his ass.\n\nCLARENCE\nI'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved \"Coming Home in a Body Bag\".\n\nELVIS\nThat's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and\nhe can see that.\n\nElvis fixes Clarence's collar.\n\nELVIS\nI like ya, Clarence. Always have.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nThis is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one. Gangsters on one end with\nshotguns. Bodyguards with machine guns on the other. And cops with handguns\nin the middle.\n\nDick's ready to pass out.\n\nAlabama's so scared she pees on herself.\n\nFor Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it.\n\nELLIOT\nOfficer Dimes? Officer Dimes.\n\nDimes looks at Elliot.\n\nELLIOT\nThis has nothing to do with me anymore. Can I just leave and you guys just\nsettle it by yourselves?\n\nDIMES\nElliot, shut the fuck up and stay put!\n\nLEE\n(to Elliot)\nHow did you know his name? How the fuck did he know your name? Why,\nyou fuckin' little piece of shit!\n\nELLIOT\nLee, understand, I didn't want to \u221a\n\nNICHOLSON\nShut the fuck up!\n\nLEE\nWell, I hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty\nyears cause your career is over as of now! You might as weel burn you\nSAG card! To think I treated you as a son! And you stabbed me in the\nheart!\n\nLee can't control his anger any more. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and\nflings hot coffee into Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees,\n\nInstinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice.\n\nAlabama screams.\n\nBoris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets.\n\nDIMES\n(screaming)\nCody!!!\n\nNicholson flies backwards.\n\nMarvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks\nback and forth then on the floor.\n\nClarence opens the bathroom door.\n\nDimes hits the ground firing.\n\nA shot catches Clarence in the forehead.\n\nAlabama screams.\n\nDario fires his sawed-off. It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the\nbathroom sink, smashing the mirror.\n\nIt might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either\nhits the ground or runs for cover.\n\nDimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground.\n\nBoris dives into the kitchen area.\n\nMonty tips the table over.\n\nMarvin dives behind the sofa.\n\nDario runs out of the door and down the hall.\n\nWith bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything. Two IA\nOfficers are shot right away.\n\nFrankie takes an Uzi hit. He goes down firing both automatics.\n\nElliot gets it from both sides.\n\nAlabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the\nbathroom.\n\nClarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching. He moves and falls off.\n\nAlabama continues crawling.\n\nMarvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires. The shotgun blast\nhits the glass table and Monty. Monty stands up screaming.\n\nThe Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty.\n\nAs Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over\nthe apartment.\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a DAY\n\nCop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nGUNFIGHT\n\nAlabama crawling.\n\nThe suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick. Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air.\nMarvin comes from behind the sofa and fires. The suitcase is hit in mid-air.\nWhite powder goes everywhere. The room is enveloped in cocaine.\n\nDick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door.\n\nAn IA Officer goes after him.\n\nLenny makes a break for it.\n\nWurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin.\n\nAlabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence.\n\nALABAMA\nSweety?\n\nClarence's face is awash with blood.\n\nCLARENCE\nI... I can't see you... I've got blood in my eyes...\n\nHe dies.\n\nAlabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a HALLWAY \u221a DAY\n\nDario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police.\n\nHe fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a ANOTHER HALLWAY\n\nThe hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast. Dick comes\naround the corner, running as if on fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the\nsame corner.\n\nIA OFFICER\n(aiming gun)\nFreeze!\n\nDick does.\n\nDICK\nI'm unarmed!\n\nIA OFFICER\nPut your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch!\n\nHe does. Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer,\nsending him to the wall.\n\nDICK\nOh shit.\n\nHe starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the\ncorner and runs down the hall.\n\nDick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box.\n\nLenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aimes his sawed-off.\n\nDICK\nLook, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm\nsorry.\n\nTwo elevator doors on either side of them open.\n\nLenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says:\n\nLENNY\nLotsa luck.\n\nLenny dives into one elevator car. Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors\nclose.\n\nBACK TO:\n\nHOTEL ROOM\n\nThe Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each\nother down.\n\nWurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned\ndown in the kitchen.\n\nIn the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get\nhis heart started. It's not working. She slaps him hard in the face a couple of\ntimes.\n\nALABAMA\nWake up, goddamn it!\n\nDimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the\ngrip of a dead Wise-guy.\n\nBoris peeks around the wall to fire.\n\nDimes lets loose with a blast. A scream is heard.\n\nBORIS\n(off)\nI'm shot! Stop!\n\nDIMES\nThrow out your gun, asshole!\n\nThe Uzi's tossed out.\n\nDimes goes to where Wurlitzer is.\n\nDIMES\n(to Marvin)\nOK, black jacket! It's two against one now! Toss the gun and lie face down\non the floor or die like all you friends.\n\nThe shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa.\n\nINT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a ELEVATOR \u221a DAY\n\nDick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this. The doors open on the\nfourth floor. He runs out into the hallway.\n\nHALLWAY\n\nHe starts trying the room doors for an open one.\n\nDICK\nOh, God, if you just get me outta this I swear to God I'll never fuck up\nagain. Please, just let me get to \"T.J. Hooker\" on Monday.\n\nSTEWARDESS'S ROOM \u221a DAY\n\nDick steps in. THREE GORGEOUS GIRLS are doing a killer aerobics workout\nto a video on TV. The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't\nhear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed.\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nBoris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live. He's lying on the kitchen\nfloor. Dimes stands over him. He has the sawed-off in his hand.\n\nDIMES\nDon't even give me an excuse, motherfucker.\n\nDimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none.\n\nWurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch.\n\nDimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying\nover him.\n\nDimes walks over to Wurlitzer.\n\nDIMES\nEverything's under control here.\n\nWURLITZER\nSorry about Nicholson.\n\nDIMES\nMe too.\n\nWURLITZER\nI'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside.\n\nDIMES\nYou do that.\n\nWurlitzer exits. Dimes grabs the phone.\n\nLOBBY\n\nShotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby.\n\nA COP yells out.\n\nCOP\nYou! Stop!\n\nLenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it. OTHER COPS rush\nforward. Lenny grabs a woman standing by.\n\nLENNY\nGet back or I'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come!\n\nLEE'S ROOM\n\nDimes on the phone talking with the department. Boris is still moving on the\nfloor. Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back.\nAlabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket. She\nreaches in and pulls out his .38. She wipes her eyes. She holds the gun in her\nhand and remembers Clarence saying:\n\nCLARENCE\n(off)\nShe's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She\ncarried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,\nand the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!\nPray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!\n\nAlabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand.\n\nMarvin turns his head toward her. She shoots him twice.\n\nDimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun. She\nfires. He's hit in the head and flung to the floor.\n\nShe sees Boris on the kitchen floor.\n\nALABAMA\nBye-bye, Boris. Good luck.\n\nBORIS\nYou too, cutie.\n\nShe starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money. She takes it and\nwalks out the door.\n\nHALLWAY\n\nThe elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out.\n\nAlabama comes around the corner.\n\nWURLITZER\nHey, you!\n\nAlabama shoots him three times in the belly. She steps into the elevator, the\ndoors close.\n\nLOBBY\n\nAlabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out. In the background, COPS\nare all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage.\n\nLENNY\nI wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to\ntake me to Kilimanjaro and... and a million bucks!\n(pause)\nSmall bills!\n\nEXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE \u221a PARKING LOT \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama puts the briefcase in the trunk. She gets into the Mustang and drives\naway.\n\nINT. MUSTANG \u221a MOVING \u221a DAY\n\nAlabama's driving fast down the freeway. The DJ on the radio is trying to be\nfunny. She's muttering to herself.\n\nALABAMA\nI could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked\naway. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred\npercent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad. I\nshould laugh cause you don't deserve any better. I could get another guy\nlike that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. Asshole. You're\na asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted it all, didn't ya?\nDidn't ya? Well watcha got now? You ain't got the money. You ain't got\nme. You ain't even got your body anymore. You got nothin'. Nada. Zip.\nGoose egg. Nil. Donut.\n\nThe song \"Little Arrows\" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks\ndown and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues.\nShe wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on\nthe dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth.\n\nShe pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view\nmirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens\non the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads\nit: \"You're so cool\".\n\nShe tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She\nlooks around for, and finally finds, the \"Sgt. Fury\" comic book Clarence bought\nher.\n\nAnd with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away\nfrom the Mustang forever.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nTHE END2Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

Marriages, and Deaths\n\nWhatever Becky's private plan might be by which Dobbin's true love was to be crowned with success, the little woman thought that the secret might keep, and indeed, being by no means so much interested about anybody's welfare as about her own, she had a great number of things pertaining to herself to consider, and which concerned her a great deal more than Major Dobbin's happiness in this life.\n\nShe found herself suddenly and unexpectedly in snug comfortable quarters, surrounded by friends, kindness, and good-natured simple people such as she had not met with for many a long day; and, wanderer as she was by force and inclination, there were moments when rest was pleasant to her. As the most hardened Arab that ever careered across the desert over the hump of a dromedary likes to repose sometimes under the date-trees by the water, or to come into the cities, walk into the bazaars, refresh himself in the baths, and say his prayers in the mosques, before he goes out again marauding, so Jos's tents and pilau were pleasant to this little Ishmaelite. She picketed her steed, hung up her weapons, and warmed herself comfortably by his fire. The halt in that roving, restless life was inexpressibly soothing and pleasant to her.\n\nSo, pleased herself, she tried with all her might to please everybody; and we know that she was eminent and successful as a practitioner in the art of giving pleasure. As for Jos, even in that little interview in the garret at the Elephant Inn, she had found means to win back a great deal of his good-will. In the course of a week, the civilian was her sworn slave and frantic admirer. He didn't go to sleep after dinner, as his custom was in the much less lively society of Amelia. He drove out with Becky in his open carriage. He asked little parties and invented festivities to do her honour.\n\nTapeworm, the Charge d'Affaires, who had abused her so cruelly, came to dine with Jos, and then came every day to pay his respects to Becky. Poor Emmy, who was never very talkative, and more glum and silent than ever after Dobbin's departure, was quite forgotten when this superior genius made her appearance. The French Minister was as much charmed with her as his English rival. The German ladies, never particularly squeamish as regards morals, especially in English people, were delighted with the cleverness and wit of Mrs. Osborne's charming friend, and though she did not ask to go to Court, yet the most august and Transparent Personages there heard of her fascinations and were quite curious to know her. When it became known that she was noble, of an ancient English family, that her husband was a Colonel of the Guard, Excellenz and Governor of an island, only separated from his lady by one of those trifling differences which are of little account in a country where Werther is still read and the Wahlverwandtschaften of Goethe is considered an edifying moral book, nobody thought of refusing to receive her in the very highest society of the little Duchy; and the ladies were even more ready to call her du and to swear eternal friendship for her than they had been to bestow the same inestimable benefits upon Amelia. Love and Liberty are interpreted by those simple Germans in a way which honest folks in Yorkshire and Somersetshire little understand, and a lady might, in some philosophic and civilized towns, be divorced ever so many times from her respective husbands and keep her character in society. Jos's house never was so pleasant since he had a house of his own as Rebecca caused it to be. She sang, she played, she laughed, she talked in two or three languages, she brought everybody to the house, and she made Jos believe that it was his own great social talents and wit which gathered the society of the place round about him.\n\nAs for Emmy, who found herself not in the least mistress of her own house, except when the bills were to be paid, Becky soon discovered the way to soothe and please her. She talked to her perpetually about Major Dobbin sent about his business, and made no scruple of declaring her admiration for that excellent, high-minded gentleman, and of telling Emmy that she had behaved most cruelly regarding him. Emmy defended her conduct and showed that it was dictated only by the purest religious principles; that a woman once, &c., and to such an angel as him whom she had had the good fortune to marry, was married forever; but she had no objection to hear the Major praised as much as ever Becky chose to praise him, and indeed, brought the conversation round to the Dobbin subject a score of times every day.\nMeans were easily found to win the favour of Georgy and the servants. Amelia's maid, it has been said, was heart and soul in favour of the generous Major. Having at first disliked Becky for being the means of dismissing him from the presence of her mistress, she was reconciled to Mrs. Crawley subsequently, because the latter became William's most ardent admirer and champion. And in those nightly conclaves in which the two ladies indulged after their parties, and while Miss Payne was \"brushing their 'airs,\" as she called the yellow locks of the one and the soft brown tresses of the other, this girl always put in her word for that dear good gentleman Major Dobbin. Her advocacy did not make Amelia angry any more than Rebecca's admiration of him. She made George write to him constantly and persisted in sending Mamma's kind love in a postscript. And as she looked at her husband's portrait of nights, it no longer reproached her\u2014perhaps she reproached it, now William was gone.\n\nEmmy was not very happy after her heroic sacrifice. She was very distraite, nervous, silent, and ill to please. The family had never known her so peevish. She grew pale and ill. She used to try to sing certain songs (\"Einsam bin ich nicht alleine,\" was one of them, that tender love-song of Weber's which in old-fashioned days, young ladies, and when you were scarcely born, showed that those who lived before you knew too how to love and to sing) certain songs, I say, to which the Major was partial; and as she warbled them in the twilight in the drawing-room, she would break off in the midst of the song, and walk into her neighbouring apartment, and there, no doubt, take refuge in the miniature of her husband.\n\nSome books still subsisted, after Dobbin's departure, with his name written in them; a German dictionary, for instance, with \"William Dobbin, \u2014th Reg.,\" in the fly-leaf; a guide-book with his initials; and one or two other volumes which belonged to the Major. Emmy cleared these away and put them on the drawers, where she placed her work-box, her desk, her Bible, and prayer-book, under the pictures of the two Georges. And the Major, on going away, having left his gloves behind him, it is a fact that Georgy, rummaging his mother's desk some time afterwards, found the gloves neatly folded up and put away in what they call the secret-drawers of the desk.\n\nNot caring for society, and moping there a great deal, Emmy's chief pleasure in the summer evenings was to take long walks with Georgy (during which Rebecca was left to the society of Mr. Joseph), and then the mother and son used to talk about the Major in a way which even made the boy smile. She told him that she thought Major William was the best man in all the world\u2014the gentlest and the kindest, the bravest and the humblest. Over and over again she told him how they owed everything which they possessed in the world to that kind friend's benevolent care of them; how he had befriended them all through their poverty and misfortunes; watched over them when nobody cared for them; how all his comrades admired him though he never spoke of his own gallant actions; how Georgy's father trusted him beyond all other men, and had been constantly befriended by the good William. \"Why, when your papa was a little boy,\" she said, \"he often told me that it was William who defended him against a tyrant at the school where they were; and their friendship never ceased from that day until the last, when your dear father fell.\"\n\n\"Did Dobbin kill the man who killed Papa?\" Georgy said. \"I'm sure he did, or he would if he could have caught him, wouldn't he, Mother? When I'm in the Army, won't I hate the French?\u2014that's all.\"\n\nIn such colloquies the mother and the child passed a great deal of their time together. The artless woman had made a confidant of the boy. He was as much William's friend as everybody else who knew him well.\n\nBy the way, Mrs. Becky, not to be behind hand in sentiment, had got a miniature too hanging up in her room, to the surprise and amusement of most people, and the delight of the original, who was no other than our friend Jos. On her first coming to favour the Sedleys with a visit, the little woman, who had arrived with a remarkably small shabby kit, was perhaps ashamed of the meanness of her trunks and bandboxes, and often spoke with great respect about her baggage left behind at Leipzig, which she must have from that city. When a traveller talks to you perpetually about the splendour of his luggage, which he does not happen to have with him, my son, beware of that traveller! He is, ten to one, an impostor.\n\nNeither Jos nor Emmy knew this important maxim. It seemed to them of no consequence whether Becky had a quantity of very fine clothes in invisible trunks; but as her present supply was exceedingly shabby, Emmy supplied her out of her own stores, or took her to the best milliner in the town and there fitted her out. It was no more torn collars now, I promise you, and faded silks trailing off at the shoulder. Becky changed her habits with her situation in life\u2014the rouge-pot was suspended\u2014another excitement to which she had accustomed herself was also put aside, or at least only indulged in in privacy, as when she was prevailed on by Jos of a summer evening, Emmy and the boy being absent on their walks, to take a little spirit-and-water. But if she did not indulge\u2014the courier did: that rascal Kirsch could not be kept from the bottle, nor could he tell how much he took when he applied to it. He was sometimes surprised himself at the way in which Mr. Sedley's Cognac diminished. Well, well, this is a painful subject. Becky did not very likely indulge so much as she used before she entered a decorous family.\n\nAt last the much-bragged-about boxes arrived from Leipzig; three of them not by any means large or splendid; nor did Becky appear to take out any sort of dresses or ornaments from the boxes when they did arrive. But out of one, which contained a mass of her papers (it was that very box which Rawdon Crawley had ransacked in his furious hunt for Becky's concealed money), she took a picture with great glee, which she pinned up in her room, and to which she introduced Jos. It was the portrait of a gentleman in pencil, his face having the advantage of being painted up in pink. He was riding on an elephant away from some cocoa-nut trees and a pagoda: it was an Eastern scene.\n\n\"God bless my soul, it is my portrait,\" Jos cried out. It was he indeed, blooming in youth and beauty, in a nankeen jacket of the cut of 1804. It was the old picture that used to hang up in Russell Square.\n\n\"I bought it,\" said Becky in a voice trembling with emotion; \"I went to see if I could be of any use to my kind friends. I have never parted with that picture\u2014I never will.\"\n\n\"Won't you?\" Jos cried with a look of unutterable rapture and satisfaction. \"Did you really now value it for my sake?\"\n\n\"You know I did, well enough,\" said Becky; \"but why speak\u2014why think\u2014why look back! It is too late now!\"\nThat evening's conversation was delicious for Jos. Emmy only came in to go to bed very tired and unwell. Jos and his fair guest had a charming tete-a-tete, and his sister could hear, as she lay awake in her adjoining chamber, Rebecca singing over to Jos the old songs of 1815. He did not sleep, for a wonder, that night, any more than Amelia.\n\nIt was June, and, by consequence, high season in London; Jos, who read the incomparable Galignani (the exile's best friend) through every day, used to favour the ladies with extracts from his paper during their breakfast. Every week in this paper there is a full account of military movements, in which Jos, as a man who had seen service, was especially interested. On one occasion he read out\u2014\"Arrival of the \u2014th regiment. Gravesend, June 20.\u2014The Ramchunder, East Indiaman, came into the river this morning, having on board 14 officers, and 132 rank and file of this gallant corps. They have been absent from England fourteen years, having been embarked the year after Waterloo, in which glorious conflict they took an active part, and having subsequently distinguished themselves in the Burmese war. The veteran colonel, Sir Michael O'Dowd, K.C.B., with his lady and sister, landed here yesterday, with Captains Posky, Stubble, Macraw, Malony; Lieutenants Smith, Jones, Thompson, F. Thomson; Ensigns Hicks and Grady; the band on the pier playing the national anthem, and the crowd loudly cheering the gallant veterans as they went into Wayte's hotel, where a sumptuous banquet was provided for the defenders of Old England. During the repast, which we need not say was served up in Wayte's best style, the cheering continued so enthusiastically that Lady O'Dowd and the Colonel came forward to the balcony and drank the healths of their fellow-countrymen in a bumper of Wayte's best claret.\"\n\nOn a second occasion Jos read a brief announcement\u2014Major Dobbin had joined the \u2014th regiment at Chatham; and subsequently he promulgated accounts of the presentations at the Drawing-room of Colonel Sir Michael O'Dowd, K.C.B., Lady O'Dowd (by Mrs. Malloy Malony of Ballymalony), and Miss Glorvina O'Dowd (by Lady O'Dowd). Almost directly after this, Dobbin's name appeared among the Lieutenant-Colonels: for old Marshal Tiptoff had died during the passage of the \u2014th from Madras, and the Sovereign was pleased to advance Colonel Sir Michael O'Dowd to the rank of Major-General on his return to England, with an intimation that he should be Colonel of the distinguished regiment which he had so long commanded.\n\nAmelia had been made aware of some of these movements. The correspondence between George and his guardian had not ceased by any means: William had even written once or twice to her since his departure, but in a manner so unconstrainedly cold that the poor woman felt now in her turn that she had lost her power over him and that, as he had said, he was free. He had left her, and she was wretched. The memory of his almost countless services, and lofty and affectionate regard, now presented itself to her and rebuked her day and night. She brooded over those recollections according to her won't, saw the purity and beauty of the affection with which she had trifled, and reproached herself for having flung away such a treasure.\n\nIt was gone indeed. William had spent it all out. He loved her no more, he thought, as he had loved her. He never could again. That sort of regard, which he had proffered to her for so many faithful years, can't be flung down and shattered and mended so as to show no scars. The little heedless tyrant had so destroyed it. No, William thought again and again, \"It was myself I deluded and persisted in cajoling; had she been worthy of the love I gave her, she would have returned it long ago. It was a fond mistake. Isn't the whole course of life made up of such? And suppose I had won her, should I not have been disenchanted the day after my victory? Why pine, or be ashamed of my defeat?\" The more he thought of this long passage of his life, the more clearly he saw his deception. \"I'll go into harness again,\" he said, \"and do my duty in that state of life in which it has pleased Heaven to place me. I will see that the buttons of the recruits are properly bright and that the sergeants make no mistakes in their accounts. I will dine at mess and listen to the Scotch surgeon telling his stories. When I am old and broken, I will go on half-pay, and my old sisters shall scold me. I have geliebt und gelebet, as the girl in 'Wallenstein' says. I am done. Pay the bills and get me a cigar: find out what there is at the play to-night, Francis; to-morrow we cross by the Batavier.\" He made the above speech, whereof Francis only heard the last two lines, pacing up and down the Boompjes at Rotterdam. The Batavier was lying in the basin. He could see the place on the quarter-deck where he and Emmy had sat on the happy voyage out. What had that little Mrs. Crawley to say to him? Psha; to-morrow we will put to sea, and return to England, home, and duty!\n\nAfter June all the little Court Society of Pumpernickel used to separate, according to the German plan, and make for a hundred watering-places, where they drank at the wells, rode upon donkeys, gambled at the redoutes if they had money and a mind, rushed with hundreds of their kind to gourmandise at the tables d'hote, and idled away the summer. The English diplomatists went off to Teoplitz and Kissingen, their French rivals shut up their chancellerie and whisked away to their darling Boulevard de Gand. The Transparent reigning family took too to the waters, or retired to their hunting lodges. Everybody went away having any pretensions to politeness, and of course, with them, Doctor von Glauber, the Court Doctor, and his Baroness. The seasons for the baths were the most productive periods of the Doctor's practice\u2014he united business with pleasure, and his chief place of resort was Ostend, which is much frequented by Germans, and where the Doctor treated himself and his spouse to what he called a \"dib\" in the sea.\n\nHis interesting patient, Jos, was a regular milch-cow to the Doctor, and he easily persuaded the civilian, both for his own health's sake and that of his charming sister, which was really very much shattered, to pass the summer at that hideous seaport town. Emmy did not care where she went much. Georgy jumped at the idea of a move. As for Becky, she came as a matter of course in the fourth place inside of the fine barouche Mr. Jos had bought, the two domestics being on the box in front. She might have some misgivings about the friends whom she should meet at Ostend, and who might be likely to tell ugly stories\u2014but bah! she was strong enough to hold her own. She had cast such an anchor in Jos now as would require a strong storm to shake. That incident of the picture had finished him. Becky took down her elephant and put it into the little box which she had had from Amelia ever so many years ago. Emmy also came off with her Lares\u2014her two pictures\u2014and the party, finally, were, lodged in an exceedingly dear and uncomfortable house at Ostend.\n\nThere Amelia began to take baths and get what good she could from them, and though scores of people of Becky's acquaintance passed her and cut her, yet Mrs. Osborne, who walked about with her, and who knew nobody, was not aware of the treatment experienced by the friend whom she had chosen so judiciously as a companion; indeed, Becky never thought fit to tell her what was passing under her innocent eyes.\n\nSome of Mrs. Rawdon Crawley's acquaintances, however, acknowledged her readily enough,\u2014perhaps more readily than she would have desired. Among those were Major Loder (unattached), and Captain Rook (late of the Rifles), who might be seen any day on the Dike, smoking and staring at the women, and who speedily got an introduction to the hospitable board and select circle of Mr. Joseph Sedley. In fact they would take no denial; they burst into the house whether Becky was at home or not, walked into Mrs. Osborne's drawing-room, which they perfumed with their coats and mustachios, called Jos \"Old buck,\" and invaded his dinner-table, and laughed and drank for long hours there.\n\n\"What can they mean?\" asked Georgy, who did not like these gentlemen. \"I heard the Major say to Mrs. Crawley yesterday, 'No, no, Becky, you shan't keep the old buck to yourself. We must have the bones in, or, dammy, I'll split.' What could the Major mean, Mamma?\"\n\n\"Major! don't call him Major!\" Emmy said. \"I'm sure I can't tell what he meant.\" His presence and that of his friend inspired the little lady with intolerable terror and aversion. They paid her tipsy compliments; they leered at her over the dinner-table. And the Captain made her advances that filled her with sickening dismay, nor would she ever see him unless she had George by her side.\n\nRebecca, to do her justice, never would let either of these men remain alone with Amelia; the Major was disengaged too, and swore he would be the winner of her. A couple of ruffians were fighting for this innocent creature, gambling for her at her own table, and though she was not aware of the rascals' designs upon her, yet she felt a horror and uneasiness in their presence and longed to fly.\n\nShe besought, she entreated Jos to go. Not he. He was slow of movement, tied to his Doctor, and perhaps to some other leading-strings. At least Becky was not anxious to go to England.\nAt last she took a great resolution\u2014made the great plunge. She wrote off a letter to a friend whom she had on the other side of the water, a letter about which she did not speak a word to anybody, which she carried herself to the post under her shawl; nor was any remark made about it, only that she looked very much flushed and agitated when Georgy met her, and she kissed him, and hung over him a great deal that night. She did not come out of her room after her return from her walk. Becky thought it was Major Loder and the Captain who frightened her.\n\n\"She mustn't stop here,\" Becky reasoned with herself. \"She must go away, the silly little fool. She is still whimpering after that gaby of a husband\u2014dead (and served right!) these fifteen years. She shan't marry either of these men. It's too bad of Loder. No; she shall marry the bamboo cane, I'll settle it this very night.\"\n\nSo Becky took a cup of tea to Amelia in her private apartment and found that lady in the company of her miniatures, and in a most melancholy and nervous condition. She laid down the cup of tea.\n\n\"Thank you,\" said Amelia.\n\n\"Listen to me, Amelia,\" said Becky, marching up and down the room before the other and surveying her with a sort of contemptuous kindness. \"I want to talk to you. You must go away from here and from the impertinences of these men. I won't have you harassed by them: and they will insult you if you stay. I tell you they are rascals: men fit to send to the hulks. Never mind how I know them. I know everybody. Jos can't protect you; he is too weak and wants a protector himself. You are no more fit to live in the world than a baby in arms. You must marry, or you and your precious boy will go to ruin. You must have a husband, you fool; and one of the best gentlemen I ever saw has offered you a hundred times, and you have rejected him, you silly, heartless, ungrateful little creature!\"\n\n\"I tried\u2014I tried my best, indeed I did, Rebecca,\" said Amelia deprecatingly, \"but I couldn't forget\u2014\"; and she finished the sentence by looking up at the portrait.\n\n\"Couldn't forget HIM!\" cried out Becky, \"that selfish humbug, that low-bred cockney dandy, that padded booby, who had neither wit, nor manners, nor heart, and was no more to be compared to your friend with the bamboo cane than you are to Queen Elizabeth. Why, the man was weary of you, and would have jilted you, but that Dobbin forced him to keep his word. He owned it to me. He never cared for you. He used to sneer about you to me, time after time, and made love to me the week after he married you.\"\n\n\"It's false! It's false! Rebecca,\" cried out Amelia, starting up.\n\n\"Look there, you fool,\" Becky said, still with provoking good humour, and taking a little paper out of her belt, she opened it and flung it into Emmy's lap. \"You know his handwriting. He wrote that to me\u2014wanted me to run away with him\u2014gave it me under your nose, the day before he was shot\u2014and served him right!\" Becky repeated.\n\nEmmy did not hear her; she was looking at the letter. It was that which George had put into the bouquet and given to Becky on the night of the Duchess of Richmond's ball. It was as she said: the foolish young man had asked her to fly.\n\nEmmy's head sank down, and for almost the last time in which she shall be called upon to weep in this history, she commenced that work. Her head fell to her bosom, and her hands went up to her eyes; and there for a while, she gave way to her emotions, as Becky stood on and regarded her. Who shall analyse those tears and say whether they were sweet or bitter? Was she most grieved because the idol of her life was tumbled down and shivered at her feet, or indignant that her love had been so despised, or glad because the barrier was removed which modesty had placed between her and a new, a real affection? \"There is nothing to forbid me now,\" she thought. \"I may love him with all my heart now. Oh, I will, I will, if he will but let me and forgive me.\" I believe it was this feeling rushed over all the others which agitated that gentle little bosom.\n\nIndeed, she did not cry so much as Becky expected\u2014the other soothed and kissed her\u2014a rare mark of sympathy with Mrs. Becky. She treated Emmy like a child and patted her head. \"And now let us get pen and ink and write to him to come this minute,\" she said.\n\n\"I\u2014I wrote to him this morning,\" Emmy said, blushing exceedingly. Becky screamed with laughter\u2014\"Un biglietto,\" she sang out with Rosina, \"eccolo qua!\"\u2014the whole house echoed with her shrill singing.\n\nTwo mornings after this little scene, although the day was rainy and gusty, and Amelia had had an exceedingly wakeful night, listening to the wind roaring, and pitying all travellers by land and by water, yet she got up early and insisted upon taking a walk on the Dike with Georgy; and there she paced as the rain beat into her face, and she looked out westward across the dark sea line and over the swollen billows which came tumbling and frothing to the shore. Neither spoke much, except now and then, when the boy said a few words to his timid companion, indicative of sympathy and protection.\n\n\"I hope he won't cross in such weather,\" Emmy said.\n\n\"I bet ten to one he does,\" the boy answered. \"Look, Mother, there's the smoke of the steamer.\" It was that signal, sure enough.\n\nBut though the steamer was under way, he might not be on board; he might not have got the letter; he might not choose to come. A hundred fears poured one over the other into the little heart, as fast as the waves on to the Dike.\n\nThe boat followed the smoke into sight. Georgy had a dandy telescope and got the vessel under view in the most skilful manner. And he made appropriate nautical comments upon the manner of the approach of the steamer as she came nearer and nearer, dipping and rising in the water. The signal of an English steamer in sight went fluttering up to the mast on the pier. I daresay Mrs. Amelia's heart was in a similar flutter.\n\nEmmy tried to look through the telescope over George's shoulder, but she could make nothing of it. She only saw a black eclipse bobbing up and down before her eyes.\n\nGeorge took the glass again and raked the vessel. \"How she does pitch!\" he said. \"There goes a wave slap over her bows. There's only two people on deck besides the steersman. There's a man lying down, and a\u2014chap in a\u2014cloak with a\u2014Hooray!\u2014it's Dob, by Jingo!\" He clapped to the telescope and flung his arms round his mother. As for that lady, let us say what she did in the words of a favourite poet\u2014\"Dakruoen gelasasa.\" She was sure it was William. It could be no other. What she had said about hoping that he would not come was all hypocrisy. Of course he would come; what could he do else but come? She knew he would come.\n\nThe ship came swiftly nearer and nearer. As they went in to meet her at the landing-place at the quay, Emmy's knees trembled so that she scarcely could run. She would have liked to kneel down and say her prayers of thanks there. Oh, she thought, she would be all her life saying them!\n\nIt was such a bad day that as the vessel came alongside of the quay there were no idlers abroad, scarcely even a commissioner on the look out for the few passengers in the steamer. That young scapegrace George had fled too, and as the gentleman in the old cloak lined with red stuff stepped on to the shore, there was scarcely any one present to see what took place, which was briefly this:\n\nA lady in a dripping white bonnet and shawl, with her two little hands out before her, went up to him, and in the next minute she had altogether disappeared under the folds of the old cloak, and was kissing one of his hands with all her might; whilst the other, I suppose, was engaged in holding her to his heart (which her head just about reached) and in preventing her from tumbling down. She was murmuring something about\u2014forgive\u2014dear William\u2014dear, dear, dearest friend\u2014kiss, kiss, kiss, and so forth\u2014and in fact went on under the cloak in an absurd manner.\n\nWhen Emmy emerged from it, she still kept tight hold of one of William's hands, and looked up in his face. It was full of sadness and tender love and pity. She understood its reproach and hung down her head.\n\n\"It was time you sent for me, dear Amelia,\" he said.\n\n\"You will never go again, William?\"\n\n\"No, never,\" he answered, and pressed the dear little soul once more to his heart.\n\nAs they issued out of the custom-house precincts, Georgy broke out on them, with his telescope up to his eye, and a loud laugh of welcome; he danced round the couple and performed many facetious antics as he led them up to the house. Jos wasn't up yet; Becky not visible (though she looked at them through the blinds). Georgy ran off to see about breakfast. Emmy, whose shawl and bonnet were off in the passage in the hands of Mrs. Payne, now went to undo the clasp of William's cloak, and\u2014we will, if you please, go with George, and look after breakfast for the Colonel. The vessel is in port. He has got the prize he has been trying for all his life. The bird has come in at last. There it is with its head on his shoulder, billing and cooing close up to his heart, with soft outstretched fluttering wings. This is what he has asked for every day and hour for eighteen years. This is what he pined after. Here it is\u2014the summit, the end\u2014the last page of the third volume. Good-bye, Colonel\u2014God bless you, honest William!\u2014Farewell, dear Amelia\u2014Grow green again, tender little parasite, round the rugged old oak to which you cling!\n\nPerhaps it was compunction towards the kind and simple creature, who had been the first in life to defend her, perhaps it was a dislike to all such sentimental scenes\u2014but Rebecca, satisfied with her part in the transaction, never presented herself before Colonel Dobbin and the lady whom he married. \"Particular business,\" she said, took her to Bruges, whither she went, and only Georgy and his uncle were present at the marriage ceremony. When it was over, and Georgy had rejoined his parents, Mrs. Becky returned (just for a few days) to comfort the solitary bachelor, Joseph Sedley. He preferred a continental life, he said, and declined to join in housekeeping with his sister and her husband.\n\nEmmy was very glad in her heart to think that she had written to her husband before she read or knew of that letter of George's. \"I knew it all along,\" William said; \"but could I use that weapon against the poor fellow's memory? It was that which made me suffer so when you\u2014\"\n\n\"Never speak of that day again,\" Emmy cried out, so contrite and humble that William turned off the conversation by his account of Glorvina and dear old Peggy O'Dowd, with whom he was sitting when the letter of recall reached him. \"If you hadn't sent for me,\" he added with a laugh, \"who knows what Glorvina's name might be now?\"\n\nAt present it is Glorvina Posky (now Mrs. Major Posky); she took him on the death of his first wife, having resolved never to marry out of the regiment. Lady O'Dowd is also so attached to it that, she says, if anything were to happen to Mick, bedad she'd come back and marry some of 'em. But the Major-General is quite well and lives in great splendour at O'Dowdstown, with a pack of beagles, and (with the exception of perhaps their neighbour, Hoggarty of Castle Hoggarty) he is the first man of his county. Her Ladyship still dances jigs, and insisted on standing up with the Master of the Horse at the Lord Lieutenant's last ball. Both she and Glorvina declared that Dobbin had used the latter SHEAMFULLY, but Posky falling in, Glorvina was consoled, and a beautiful turban from Paris appeased the wrath of Lady O'Dowd.\n\nWhen Colonel Dobbin quitted the service, which he did immediately after his marriage, he rented a pretty little country place in Hampshire, not far from Queen's Crawley, where, after the passing of the Reform Bill, Sir Pitt and his family constantly resided now. All idea of a Peerage was out of the question, the Baronet's two seats in Parliament being lost. He was both out of pocket and out of spirits by that catastrophe, failed in his health, and prophesied the speedy ruin of the Empire.\n\nLady Jane and Mrs. Dobbin became great friends\u2014there was a perpetual crossing of pony-chaises between the Hall and the Evergreens, the Colonel's place (rented of his friend Major Ponto, who was abroad with his family). Her Ladyship was godmother to Mrs. Dobbin's child, which bore her name, and was christened by the Rev. James Crawley, who succeeded his father in the living: and a pretty close friendship subsisted between the two lads, George and Rawdon, who hunted and shot together in the vacations, were both entered of the same college at Cambridge, and quarrelled with each other about Lady Jane's daughter, with whom they were both, of course, in love. A match between George and that young lady was long a favourite scheme of both the matrons, though I have heard that Miss Crawley herself inclined towards her cousin.\n\nMrs. Rawdon Crawley's name was never mentioned by either family. There were reasons why all should be silent regarding her. For wherever Mr. Joseph Sedley went, she travelled likewise, and that infatuated man seemed to be entirely her slave. The Colonel's lawyers informed him that his brother-in-law had effected a heavy insurance upon his life, whence it was probable that he had been raising money to discharge debts. He procured prolonged leave of absence from the East India House, and indeed, his infirmities were daily increasing.\n\nOn hearing the news about the insurance, Amelia, in a good deal of alarm, entreated her husband to go to Brussels, where Jos then was, and inquire into the state of his affairs. The Colonel quitted home with reluctance (for he was deeply immersed in his History of the Punjaub which still occupies him, and much alarmed about his little daughter, whom he idolizes, and who was just recovering from the chicken-pox) and went to Brussels and found Jos living at one of the enormous hotels in that city. Mrs. Crawley, who had her carriage, gave entertainments, and lived in a very genteel manner, occupied another suite of apartments in the same hotel.\n\nThe Colonel, of course, did not desire to see that lady, or even think proper to notify his arrival at Brussels, except privately to Jos by a message through his valet. Jos begged the Colonel to come and see him that night, when Mrs. Crawley would be at a soiree, and when they could meet alone. He found his brother-in-law in a condition of pitiable infirmity\u2014and dreadfully afraid of Rebecca, though eager in his praises of her. She tended him through a series of unheard-of illnesses with a fidelity most admirable. She had been a daughter to him. \"But\u2014but\u2014oh, for God's sake, do come and live near me, and\u2014and\u2014see me sometimes,\" whimpered out the unfortunate man.\n\nThe Colonel's brow darkened at this. \"We can't, Jos,\" he said. \"Considering the circumstances, Amelia can't visit you.\"\n\n\"I swear to you\u2014I swear to you on the Bible,\" gasped out Joseph, wanting to kiss the book, \"that she is as innocent as a child, as spotless as your own wife.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" said the Colonel gloomily, \"but Emmy can't come to you. Be a man, Jos: break off this disreputable connection. Come home to your family. We hear your affairs are involved.\"\n\n\"Involved!\" cried Jos. \"Who has told such calumnies? All my money is placed out most advantageously. Mrs. Crawley\u2014that is\u2014I mean\u2014it is laid out to the best interest.\"\n\n\"You are not in debt, then? Why did you insure your life?\"\n\n\"I thought\u2014a little present to her\u2014in case anything happened; and you know my health is so delicate\u2014common gratitude you know\u2014and I intend to leave all my money to you\u2014and I can spare it out of my income, indeed I can,\" cried out William's weak brother-in-law.\n\nThe Colonel besought Jos to fly at once\u2014to go back to India, whither Mrs. Crawley could not follow him; to do anything to break off a connection which might have the most fatal consequences to him.\n\nJos clasped his hands and cried, \"He would go back to India. He would do anything, only he must have time: they mustn't say anything to Mrs. Crawley\u2014she'd\u2014she'd kill me if she knew it. You don't know what a terrible woman she is,\" the poor wretch said.\n\n\"Then, why not come away with me?\" said Dobbin in reply; but Jos had not the courage. \"He would see Dobbin again in the morning; he must on no account say that he had been there. He must go now. Becky might come in.\" And Dobbin quitted him, full of forebodings.\n\nHe never saw Jos more. Three months afterwards Joseph Sedley died at Aix-la-Chapelle. It was found that all his property had been muddled away in speculations, and was represented by valueless shares in different bubble companies. All his available assets were the two thousand pounds for which his life was insured, and which were left equally between his beloved \"sister Amelia, wife of, &c., and his friend and invaluable attendant during sickness, Rebecca, wife of Lieutenant-Colonel Rawdon Crawley, C.B.,\" who was appointed administratrix.\n\nThe solicitor of the insurance company swore it was the blackest case that ever had come before him, talked of sending a commission to Aix to examine into the death, and the Company refused payment of the policy. But Mrs., or Lady Crawley, as she styled herself, came to town at once (attended with her solicitors, Messrs. Burke, Thurtell, and Hayes, of Thavies Inn) and dared the Company to refuse the payment. They invited examination, they declared that she was the object of an infamous conspiracy, which had been pursuing her all through life, and triumphed finally. The money was paid, and her character established, but Colonel Dobbin sent back his share of the legacy to the insurance office and rigidly declined to hold any communication with Rebecca.\n\nShe never was Lady Crawley, though she continued so to call herself. His Excellency Colonel Rawdon Crawley died of yellow fever at Coventry Island, most deeply beloved and deplored, and six weeks before the demise of his brother, Sir Pitt. The estate consequently devolved upon the present Sir Rawdon Crawley, Bart.\n\nHe, too, has declined to see his mother, to whom he makes a liberal allowance, and who, besides, appears to be very wealthy. The Baronet lives entirely at Queen's Crawley, with Lady Jane and her daughter, whilst Rebecca, Lady Crawley, chiefly hangs about Bath and Cheltenham, where a very strong party of excellent people consider her to be a most injured woman. She has her enemies. Who has not? Her life is her answer to them. She busies herself in works of piety. She goes to church, and never without a footman. Her name is in all the Charity Lists. The destitute orange-girl, the neglected washerwoman, the distressed muffin-man find in her a fast and generous friend. She is always having stalls at Fancy Fairs for the benefit of these hapless beings. Emmy, her children, and the Colonel, coming to London some time back, found themselves suddenly before her at one of these fairs. She cast down her eyes demurely and smiled as they started away from her; Emmy scurrying off on the arm of George (now grown a dashing young gentleman) and the Colonel seizing up his little Janey, of whom he is fonder than of anything in the world\u2014fonder even than of his History of the Punjaub.\n\n\"Fonder than he is of me,\" Emmy thinks with a sigh. But he never said a word to Amelia that was not kind and gentle, or thought of a want of hers that he did not try to gratify.\n\nAh! Vanitas Vanitatum! which of us is happy in this world? Which of us has his desire? or, having it, is satisfied?\u2014come, children, let us shut up the box and the puppets, for our play is played out.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2114161", "artist_names": "Bobby \"Blue\" Bland", "full_title": "Who will the next fool be? - single version (stereo) by\u00a0Bobby\u00a0\"Blue\" Bland", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fb29ffc2c378ec0772e527f36c5cbaf1.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fb29ffc2c378ec0772e527f36c5cbaf1.963x963x1.png", "id": 2114161, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1434138312, "path": "/Bobby-blue-bland-who-will-the-next-fool-be-single-version-stereo-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Bobby-blue-bland-who-will-the-next-fool-be-single-version-stereo-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/fb29ffc2c378ec0772e527f36c5cbaf1.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fb29ffc2c378ec0772e527f36c5cbaf1.963x963x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Who will the next fool be? - single version (stereo)", "title_with_featured": "Who will the next fool be? - single version (stereo)", "updated_by_human_at": 1446849241, "url": "https://genius.com/Bobby-blue-bland-who-will-the-next-fool-be-single-version-stereo-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/7036", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fb29ffc2c378ec0772e527f36c5cbaf1.963x963x1.png", "id": 7036, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fb29ffc2c378ec0772e527f36c5cbaf1.963x963x1.png", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland", "slug": "Bobby-blue-bland", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Bobby-blue-bland"}, "artist": "Bobby \u201cBlue\u201d Bland", "lyrics": "Who will the next fool be? - single version (stereo) LyricsAfter you get rid of me\nTell me who will the next fool be\n\nI know, I know, I know\nThere's things about you\nThey'd like to know\n\nAfter all is said and done\nYou won't be satisfied with anyone\nSo after you get rid of me, baby\nTell me who will the next fool be\nWill he believe all of those lies\nEnd up like me with\nTears all in his eyes\n\nI know, I know, I know\nAnd I'd like to be\nThe one to tell him so\n\nAfter all is said and done\nYou won't be satisfied with anyone\nSo now after you get rid of me, baby\nWoah, who will the next fool be\n\nOne more, one more time\nAfter you get rid of me, baby\nLord, who will the next fool beYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 258, "api_path": "/songs/101375", "artist_names": "James Joyce", "full_title": "Ulysses (Chap. 10 - Wandering Rocks) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "id": 101375, "instrumental": false, "language": null, "lyrics_owner_id": 159066, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1633777960, "path": "/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-10-wandering-rocks-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-10-wandering-rocks-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1922, "month": 2, "day": 2}, "release_date_for_display": "February 2, 1922", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 2, 1922", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.300x385x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5b69ce2d06f41d04c6204dc86af833b3.585x750x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 181, "hot": false, "pageviews": 8583}, "title": "Ulysses (Chap. 10 - Wandering Rocks)", "title_with_featured": "Ulysses (Chap. 10 - Wandering Rocks)", "updated_by_human_at": 1633777960, "url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-ulysses-chap-10-wandering-rocks-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22971", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/98f10611fc0aa6a525b9fbcab2ffa297.1000x600x1.jpg", "id": 22971, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9997f2e769ef85b9f941405cac99d1af.570x570x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Joyce", "slug": "James-joyce", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-joyce"}, "artist": "James Joyce", "lyrics": "Ulysses (Chap. 10 - Wandering Rocks) LyricsThe superior, the very reverend John Conmee S.J. reset his smooth watch in his interior pocket as he came down the presbytery steps. Five to three. Just nice time to walk to Artane. What was that boy's name again? Dignam. Yes. Vere dignum et iustum est. Brother Swan was the person to see. Mr Cunningham's letter. Yes. Oblige him, if possible. Good practical catholic: useful at mission time.\n\nA onelegged sailor, swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches, growled some notes. He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S. J. Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held, he knew, one silver crown.\n\nFather Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square. He thought, but not for long, of soldiers and sailors, whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs, ending their days in some pauper ward, and of cardinal Wolsey's words: If I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days. He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves: and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P.\n\n\u2014Very well, indeed, father. And you, father?\n\nFather Conmee was wonderfully well indeed. He would go to Buxton probably for the waters. And her boys, were they getting on well at Belvedere? Was that so? Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that. And Mr Sheehy himself? Still in London. The house was still sitting, to be sure it was. Beautiful weather it was, delightful indeed. Yes, it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach. O, yes: a very great success. A wonderful man really.\n\nFather Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M.P. Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M.P. Yes, he would certainly call.\n\u2014Good afternoon, Mrs Sheehy.\n\nFather Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled, as he took leave, at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun. And smiled yet again, in going. He had cleaned his teeth, he knew, with arecanut paste.\n\nFather Conmee walked and, walking, smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan's droll eyes and cockney voice.\n\n\u2014Pilate! Wy don't you old back that owlin mob?\n\nA zealous man, however. Really he was. And really did great good in his way. Beyond a doubt. He loved Ireland, he said, and he loved the Irish. Of good family too would one think it? Welsh, were they not?\n\nO, lest he forget. That letter to father provincial.\n\nFather Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square. Yes: they were from Belvedere. The little house. Aha. And were they good boys at school? O. That was very good now. And what was his name? Jack Sohan. And his name? Ger. Gallaher. And the other little man? His name was Brunny Lynam. O, that was a very nice name to have.\n\nFather Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street.\n\n\u2014But mind you don't post yourself into the box, little man, he said.\n\nThe boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed:\n\n\u2014O, sir.\n\n\u2014Well, let me see if you can post a letter, Father Conmee said.\n\nMaster Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee's letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox. Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east.\nMr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, in silk hat, slate frockcoat with silk facings, white kerchief tie, tight lavender trousers, canary gloves and pointed patent boots, walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam's court.\n\nWas that not Mrs M'Guinness?\n\nMrs M'Guinness, stately, silverhaired, bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed. And Father Conmee smiled and saluted. How did she do?\n\nA fine carriage she had. Like Mary, queen of Scots, something. And to think that she was a pawnbroker! Well, now! Such a... what should he say?... such a queenly mien.\n\nFather Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left. The reverend T. R. Greene B.A. will (D.V.) speak. The incumbent they called him. He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words. But one should be charitable. Invincible ignorance. They acted according to their lights.\n\nFather Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road. It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare. Surely, there ought to be.\n\nA band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street. All raised untidy caps. Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly. Christian brother boys.\n\nFather Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked. Saint Joseph's church, Portland row. For aged and virtuous females. Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament. Virtuous: but occasionally they were also badtempered.\n\nNear Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman. And now it was an office or something.\n\nFather Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop. Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter. He passed Grogan's the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York. In America those things were continually happening. Unfortunate people to die like that, unprepared. Still, an act of perfect contrition.\n\nFather Conmee went by Daniel Bergin's publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged. They saluted him and were saluted.\n\nFather Conmee passed H. J. O'Neill's funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay. A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable. In Youkstetter's, the porkbutcher's, Father Conmee observed pig's puddings, white and black and red, lie neatly curled in tubes.\n\nMoored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge, a towhorse with pendent head, a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships, smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him. It was idyllic: and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people.\nOn Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S.J. of saint Francis Xavier's church, upper Gardiner street, stepped on to an outward bound tram.\n\nOff an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C. C. of saint Agatha's church, north William street, on to Newcomen bridge.\n\nAt Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island.\n\nFather Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar, a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove, while four shillings, a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse. Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket. The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap. Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum.\n\nIt was a peaceful day. The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down. His wife, Father Conmee supposed. A tiny yawn opened the mouth of the wife of the gentleman with the glasses. She raised her small gloved fist, yawned ever so gently, tiptapping her small gloved fist on her opening mouth and smiled tinily, sweetly.\n\nFather Conmee perceived her perfume in the car. He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat.\n\nFather Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head.\n\nAt Annesley bridge the tram halted and, when it was about to go, an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight. The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her. She passed out with her basket and a marketnet: and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down: and Father Conmee thought that, as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare, she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice bless you, my child, that they have been absolved, pray for me. But they had so many worries in life, so many cares, poor creatures.\n\nFrom the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee.\n\nFather Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S.J. and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night. That book by the Belgian jesuit, Le Nombre des \u00c9lus, seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea. Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not (D.V.) been brought. But they were God's souls, created by God. It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost, a waste, if one might say.\n\nAt the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted, was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn.\n\nThe Malahide road was quiet. It pleased Father Conmee, road and name. The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide. Lord Talbot de Malahide, immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining. Then came the call to arms and she was maid, wife and widow in one day. Those were old worldish days, loyal times in joyous townlands, old times in the barony.\n\nFather Conmee, walking, thought of his little book Old Times in the Barony and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort, daughter of lord Molesworth, first countess of Belvedere.\n\nA listless lady, no more young, walked alone the shore of lough Ennel, Mary, first countess of Belvedere, listlessly walking in the evening, not startled when an otter plunged. Who could know the truth? Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully, eiaculatio seminis inter vas naturale mulieris, with her husband's brother? She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did. Only God knew and she and he, her husband's brother.\n\nFather Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence, needed however for man's race on earth, and of the ways of God which were not our ways.\n\nDon John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore. He was humane and honoured there. He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom, ceiled with full fruit clusters. And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom, noble to noble, were impalmed by Don John Conmee.\n\nIt was a charming day.\n\nThe lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages, curtseying to him with ample underleaves. The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind. Moutonner, the French said. A just and homely word.\n\nFather Conmee, reading his office, watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey. His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field. He walked there, reading in the evening, and heard the cries of the boys' lines at their play, young cries in the quiet evening. He was their rector: his reign was mild.\n\nFather Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out. An ivory bookmark told him the page.\n\nNones. He should have read that before lunch. But lady Maxwell had come.\n\nFather Conmee read in secret Pater and Ave and crossed his breast. Deus in adiutorium.\n\nHe walked calmly and read mutely the nones, walking and reading till he came to Res in Beati immaculati: Principium verborum tuorum veritas: in eternum omnia indicia iustitiae tuae.\n\nA flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand. The young man raised his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\n\nFather Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary. Sin: Principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum.\n\nCorny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. He pulled himself erect, went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass furnishings. Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway. There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.\n\nFather John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge.\n\nCorny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed, his hat downtilted, chewing his blade of hay.\n\nConstable 57C, on his beat, stood to pass the time of day.\n\n\u2014That's a fine day, Mr Kelleher.\n\n\u2014Ay, Corny Kelleher said.\n\n\u2014It's very close, the constable said.\n\nCorny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin.\n\n\u2014What's the best news? he asked.\n\n\u2014I seen that particular party last evening, the constable said with bated breath.\n\nA onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell's corner, skirting Rabaiotti's icecream car, and jerked himself up Eccles street. Towards Larry O'Rourke, in shirtsleeves in his doorway, he growled unamiably:\n\n\u2014For England...\n\nHe swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus, halted and growled:\n\n\u2014home and beauty.\n\nJ. J. O'Molloy's white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor.\n\nA stout lady stopped, took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her. The sailor grumbled thanks, glanced sourly at the unheeding windows, sank his head and swung himself forward four strides.\n\nHe halted and growled angrily:\n\n\u2014For England...\n\nTwo barefoot urchins, sucking long liquorice laces, halted near him, gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths.\n\nHe swung himself forward in vigorous jerks, halted, lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply:\n\n\u2014home and beauty.\n\nThe gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two, ceased. The blind of the window was drawn aside. A card Unfurnished Apartments slipped from the sash and fell. A plump bare generous arm shone, was seen, held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps. A woman's hand flung forth a coin over the area railings. It fell on the path.\nOne of the urchins ran to it, picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel's cap, saying:\n\n\u2014There, sir.\n\nKatey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen.\n\n\u2014Did you put in the books? Boody asked.\n\nMaggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow.\n\n\u2014They wouldn't give anything on them, she said.\n\nFather Conmee walked through Clongowes fields, his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble.\n\n\u2014Where did you try? Boody asked.\n\n\u2014M'Guinness's.\n\nBoody stamped her foot and threw her satchel on the table.\n\n\u2014Bad cess to her big face! she cried.\n\nKatey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes.\n\n\u2014What's in the pot? she asked.\n\n\u2014Shirts, Maggy said.\n\nBoody cried angrily:\n\n\u2014Crickey, is there nothing for us to eat?\n\nKatey, lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt, asked:\n\n\u2014And what's in this?\n\nA heavy fume gushed in answer.\n\n\u2014Peasoup, Maggy said.\n\n\u2014Where did you get it? Katey asked.\n\n\u2014Sister Mary Patrick, Maggy said.\n\nThe lacquey rang his bell.\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\nBoody sat down at the table and said hungrily:\n\n\u2014Give us it here.\n\nMaggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl. Katey, sitting opposite Boody, said quietly, as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs:\n\n\u2014A good job we have that much. Where's Dilly?\n\n\u2014Gone to meet father, Maggy said.\n\nBoody, breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup, added:\n\n\u2014Our father who art not in heaven.\n\nMaggy, pouring yellow soup in Katey's bowl, exclaimed:\n\n\u2014Boody! For shame!\n\nA skiff, a crumpled throwaway, Elijah is coming, rode lightly down the Liffey, under Loopline bridge, shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers, sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains, between the Customhouse old dock and George's quay.\n\nThe blond girl in Thornton's bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre. Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar.\n\n\u2014Put these in first, will you? he said.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, the blond girl said. And the fruit on top.\n\n\u2014That'll do, game ball, Blazes Boylan said.\n\nShe bestowed fat pears neatly, head by tail, and among them ripe shamefaced peaches.\n\nBlazes Boylan walked here and there in new tan shoes about the fruitsmelling shop, lifting fruits, young juicy crinkled and plump red tomatoes, sniffing smells.\n\nH. E. L. Y.'S filed before him, tallwhitehatted, past Tangier lane, plodding towards their goal.\n\nHe turned suddenly from a chip of strawberries, drew a gold watch from his fob and held it at its chain's length.\n\n\u2014Can you send them by tram? Now?\n\nA darkbacked figure under Merchants' arch scanned books on the hawker's cart.\n\n\u2014Certainly, sir. Is it in the city?\n\n\u2014O, yes, Blazes Boylan said. Ten minutes.\n\nThe blond girl handed him a docket and pencil.\n\n\u2014Will you write the address, sir?\n\nBlazes Boylan at the counter wrote and pushed the docket to her.\n\n\u2014Send it at once, will you? he said. It's for an invalid.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir. I will, sir.\n\nBlazes Boylan rattled merry money in his trousers' pocket.\n\n\u2014What's the damage? he asked.\n\nThe blond girl's slim fingers reckoned the fruits.\n\nBlazes Boylan looked into the cut of her blouse. A young pullet. He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass.\n\n\u2014This for me? he asked gallantly.\n\nThe blond girl glanced sideways at him, got up regardless, with his tie a bit crooked, blushing.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, she said.\n\nBending archly she reckoned again fat pears and blushing peaches.\n\nBlazes Boylan looked in her blouse with more favour, the stalk of the red flower between his smiling teeth.\n\n\u2014May I say a word to your telephone, missy? he asked roguishly.\n\n\u2014Ma! Almidano Artifoni said.\nHe gazed over Stephen's shoulder at Goldsmith's knobby poll.\n\nTwo carfuls of tourists passed slowly, their women sitting fore, gripping the handrests. Palefaces. Men's arms frankly round their stunted forms. They looked from Trinity to the blind columned porch of the bank of Ireland where pigeons roocoocooed.\n\n\u2014Anch'io ho avuto di queste idee, ALMIDANO ARTIFONI SAID, quand' ero giovine come Lei. Eppoi mi sono convinto che il mondo \u00e8 una bestia. \u00c9 peccato. Perch\u00e8 la sua voce... sarebbe un cespite di rendita, via. Invece, Lei si sacrifica.\n\n\u2014Sacrifizio incruento, Stephen said smiling, swaying his ashplant in slow swingswong from its midpoint, lightly.\n\n\u2014Speriamo, the round mustachioed face said pleasantly. Ma, dia retta a me. Ci rifletta.\nBy the stern stone hand of Grattan, bidding halt, an Inchicore tram unloaded straggling Highland soldiers of a band.\n\n\u2014Ci rifletter\u00f2, Stephen said, glancing down the solid trouserleg.\n\n\u2014Ma, sul serio, eh? Almidano Artifoni said.\n\nHis heavy hand took Stephen's firmly. Human eyes. They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram.\n\n\u2014Eccolo, Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste. Venga a trovarmi e ci pensi. Addio, caro.\n\n\u2014Arrivederla, maestro, Stephen said, raising his hat when his hand was freed. E grazie.\n\n\u2014Di che? Almidano Artifoni said. Scusi, eh? Tante belle cose!\n\nAlmidano Artifoni, holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal, trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram. In vain he trotted, signalling in vain among the rout of barekneed gillies smuggling implements of music through Trinity gates.\n\nMiss Dunne hid the Capel street library copy of The Woman in White far back in her drawer and rolled a sheet of gaudy notepaper into her typewriter.\n\nToo much mystery business in it. Is he in love with that one, Marion? Change it and get another by Mary Cecil Haye.\n\nThe disk shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased and ogled them: six.\n\nMiss Dunne clicked on the keyboard:\n\n\u201416 June 1904.\n\nFive tallwhitehatted sandwichmen between Monypeny's corner and the slab where Wolfe Tone's statue was not, eeled themselves turning H. E. L. Y.'S and plodded back as they had come.\n\nThen she stared at the large poster of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, and, listlessly lolling, scribbled on the jotter sixteens and capital esses. Mustard hair and dauby cheeks. She's not nicelooking, is she? The way she's holding up her bit of a skirt. Wonder will that fellow be at the band tonight. If I could get that dressmaker to make a concertina skirt like Susy Nagle's. They kick out grand. Shannon and all the boatclub swells never took his eyes off her. Hope to goodness he won't keep me here till seven.\n\nThe telephone rang rudely by her ear.\n\n\u2014Hello. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five. Only those two, sir, for Belfast and Liverpool. All right, sir. Then I can go after six if you're not back. A quarter after. Yes, sir. Twentyseven and six. I'll tell him. Yes: one, seven, six.\n\nShe scribbled three figures on an envelope.\n\n\u2014Mr Boylan! Hello! That gentleman from SPORT was in looking for you. Mr Lenehan, yes. He said he'll be in the Ormond at four. No, sir. Yes, sir. I'll ring them up after five.\n\nTwo pink faces turned in the flare of the tiny torch.\n\n\u2014Who's that? Ned Lambert asked. Is that Crotty?\n\n\u2014Ringabella and Crosshaven, a voice replied groping for foothold.\n\n\u2014Hello, Jack, is that yourself? Ned Lambert said, raising in salute his pliant lath among the flickering arches. Come on. Mind your steps there.\n\nThe vesta in the clergyman's uplifted hand consumed itself in a long soft flame and was let fall. At their feet its red speck died: and mouldy air closed round them.\n\n\u2014How interesting! a refined accent said in the gloom.\n\n\u2014Yes, sir, Ned Lambert said heartily. We are standing in the historic council chamber of saint Mary's abbey where silken Thomas proclaimed himself a rebel in 1534. This is the most historic spot in all Dublin. O'Madden Burke is going to write something about it one of these days. The old bank of Ireland was over the way till the time of the union and the original jews' temple was here too before they built their synagogue over in Adelaide road. You were never here before, Jack, were you?\n\n\u2014No, Ned.\n\n\u2014He rode down through Dame walk, the refined accent said, if my memory serves me. The mansion of the Kildares was in Thomas court.\n\n\u2014That's right, Ned Lambert said. That's quite right, sir.\n\n\u2014If you will be so kind then, the clergyman said, the next time to allow me perhaps...\n\n\u2014Certainly, Ned Lambert said. Bring the camera whenever you like. I'll get those bags cleared away from the windows. You can take it from here or from here.\n\nIn the still faint light he moved about, tapping with his lath the piled seedbags and points of vantage on the floor.\n\nFrom a long face a beard and gaze hung on a chessboard.\n\n\u2014I'm deeply obliged, Mr Lambert, the clergyman said. I won't trespass on your valuable time...\n\n\u2014You're welcome, sir, Ned Lambert said. Drop in whenever you like. Next week, say. Can you see?\n\n\u2014Yes, yes. Good afternoon, Mr Lambert. Very pleased to have met you.\n\n\u2014Pleasure is mine, sir, Ned Lambert answered.\n\nHe followed his guest to the outlet and then whirled his lath away among the pillars. With J. J. O'Molloy he came forth slowly into Mary's abbey where draymen were loading floats with sacks of carob and palmnut meal, O'Connor, Wexford.\n\nHe stood to read the card in his hand.\n\n\u2014The reverend Hugh C. Love, Rathcoffey. Present address: Saint Michael's, Sallins. Nice young chap he is. He's writing a book about the Fitzgeralds he told me. He's well up in history, faith.\n\nThe young woman with slow care detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.\n\n\u2014I thought you were at a new gunpowder plot, J. J. O'Molloy said.\n\nNed Lambert cracked his fingers in the air.\n\n\u2014God! he cried. I forgot to tell him that one about the earl of Kildare after he set fire to Cashel cathedral. You know that one? I'm bloody sorry I did it, says he, but I declare to God I thought the archbishop was inside. He mightn't like it, though. What? God, I'll tell him anyhow. That was the great earl, the Fitzgerald Mor. Hot members they were all of them, the Geraldines.\n\nThe horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness. He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried:\n\n\u2014Woa, sonny!\n\nHe turned to J. J. O'Molloy and asked:\n\n\u2014Well, Jack. What is it? What's the trouble? Wait awhile. Hold hard.\n\nWith gaping mouth and head far back he stood still and, after an instant, sneezed loudly.\n\n\u2014Chow! he said. Blast you!\n\n\u2014The dust from those sacks, J. J. O'Molloy said politely.\n\n\u2014No, Ned Lambert gasped, I caught a... cold night before... blast your soul... night before last... and there was a hell of a lot of draught...\n\nHe held his handkerchief ready for the coming...\n\n\u2014I was... Glasnevin this morning... poor little... what do you call him... Chow!... Mother of Moses!\n\nTom Rochford took the top disk from the pile he clasped against his claret waistcoat.\n\n\u2014See? he said. Say it's turn six. In here, see. Turn Now On.\n\nHe slid it into the left slot for them. It shot down the groove, wobbled a while, ceased, ogling them: six.\n\nLawyers of the past, haughty, pleading, beheld pass from the consolidated taxing office to Nisi Prius court Richie Goulding carrying the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward and heard rustling from the admiralty division of king's bench to the court of appeal an elderly female with false teeth smiling incredulously and a black silk skirt of great amplitude.\n\n\u2014See? he said. See now the last one I put in is over here: Turns Over. The impact. Leverage, see?\n\nHe showed them the rising column of disks on the right.\n\n\u2014Smart idea, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. So a fellow coming in late can see what turn is on and what turns are over.\n\n\u2014See? Tom Rochford said.\n\nHe slid in a disk for himself: and watched it shoot, wobble, ogle, stop: four. Turn Now On.\n\n\u2014I'll see him now in the Ormond, Lenehan said, and sound him. One good turn deserves another.\n\n\u2014Do, Tom Rochford said. Tell him I'm Boylan with impatience.\n\n\u2014Goodnight, M'Coy said abruptly. When you two begin\n\nNosey Flynn stooped towards the lever, snuffling at it.\n\n\u2014But how does it work here, Tommy? he asked.\n\n\u2014Tooraloo, Lenehan said. See you later.\n\nHe followed M'Coy out across the tiny square of Crampton court.\n\n\u2014He's a hero, he said simply.\n\n\u2014I know, M'Coy said. The drain, you mean.\n\n\u2014Drain? Lenehan said. It was down a manhole.\n\nThey passed Dan Lowry's musichall where Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile.\n\nGoing down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M'Coy how the whole thing was. One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it, half choked with sewer gas. Down went Tom Rochford anyhow, booky's vest and all, with the rope round him. And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up.\n\n\u2014The act of a hero, he said.\n\nAt the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street.\n\n\u2014This way, he said, walking to the right. I want to pop into Lynam's to see Sceptre's starting price. What's the time by your gold watch and chain?\n\nM'Coy peered into Marcus Tertius Moses' sombre office, then at O'Neill's clock.\n\n\u2014After three, he said. Who's riding her?\n\n\u2014O. Madden, Lenehan said. And a game filly she is.\n\nWhile he waited in Temple bar M'Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter. Fellow might damn easy get a nasty fall there coming along tight in the dark.\n\nThe gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade.\n\n\u2014Even money, Lenehan said returning. I knocked against Bantam Lyons in there going to back a bloody horse someone gave him that hasn't an earthly. Through here.\n\nThey went up the steps and under Merchants' arch. A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker's cart.\n\n\u2014There he is, Lenehan said.\n\n\u2014Wonder what he's buying, M'Coy said, glancing behind.\n\n\u2014Leopoldo or the Bloom is on the Rye, Lenehan said.\n\n\u2014He's dead nuts on sales, M'Coy said. I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob. There were fine plates in it worth double the money, the stars and the moon and comets with long tails. Astronomy it was about.\n\nLenehan laughed.\n\n\u2014I'll tell you a damn good one about comets' tails, he said. Come over in the sun.\n\nThey crossed to the metal bridge and went along Wellington quay by the riverwall.\n\nMaster Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks.\n\n\u2014There was a long spread out at Glencree reformatory, Lenehan said eagerly. The annual dinner, you know. Boiled shirt affair. The lord mayor was there, Val Dillon it was, and sir Charles Cameron and Dan Dawson spoke and there was music. Bartell d'Arcy sang and Benjamin Dollard...\n\n\u2014I know, M'Coy broke in. My missus sang there once.\n\n\u2014Did she? Lenehan said.\n\nA card Unfurnished Apartments reappeared on the windowsash of number 7 Eccles street.\n\nHe checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh.\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, he said. Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher. Bloom and the wife were there. Lashings of stuff we put up: port wine and sherry and curacao to which we did ample justice. Fast and furious it was. After liquids came solids. Cold joints galore and mince pies...\n\n\u2014I know, M'Coy said. The year the missus was there...\n\nLenehan linked his arm warmly.\n\n\u2014But wait till I tell you, he said. We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o'clock the morning after the night before. Coming home it was a gorgeous winter's night on the Featherbed Mountain. Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other. We started singing glees and duets: Lo, the early beam of morning. She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt's port under her bellyband. Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me. Hell's delights! She has a fine pair, God bless her. Like that.\n\nHe held his caved hands a cubit from him, frowning:\n\n\u2014I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time. Know what I mean?\n\nHis hands moulded ample curves of air. He shut his eyes tight in delight, his body shrinking, and blew a sweet chirp from his lips.\n\n\u2014The lad stood to attention anyhow, he said with a sigh. She's a gamey mare and no mistake. Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey: the great bear and Hercules and the dragon, and the whole jingbang lot. But, by God, I was lost, so to speak, in the milky way. He knows them all, faith. At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away. And what star is that, Poldy? says she. By God, she had Bloom cornered. That one, is it? says Chris Callinan, sure that's only what you might call a pinprick. By God, he wasn't far wide of the mark.\n\nLenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall, panting with soft laughter.\n\n\u2014I'm weak, he gasped.\n\nM'Coy's white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave. Lenehan walked on again. He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly. He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M'Coy.\n\n\u2014He's a cultured allroundman, Bloom is, he said seriously. He's not one of your common or garden... you know... There's a touch of the artist about old Bloom.\n\nMr Bloom turned over idly pages of The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk, then of Aristotle's Masterpiece. Crooked botched print. Plates: infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows. Lots of them like that at this moment all over the world. All butting with their skulls to get out of it. Child born every minute somewhere. Mrs Purefoy.\n\nHe laid both books aside and glanced at the third: Tales of the Ghetto by Leopold von Sacher Masoch.\n\n\u2014That I had, he said, pushing it by.\n\nThe shopman let two volumes fall on the counter.\n\n\u2014Them are two good ones, he said.\n\nOnions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth. He bent to make a bundle of the other books, hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain.\n\nOn O'Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c.\n\nMr Bloom, alone, looked at the titles. Fair Tyrants by James Lovebirch. Know the kind that is. Had it? Yes.\n\nHe opened it. Thought so.\n\nA woman's voice behind the dingy curtain. Listen: the man.\n\nNo: she wouldn't like that much. Got her it once.\n\nHe read the other title: Sweets of Sin. More in her line. Let us see.\n\nHe read where his finger opened.\n\n\u2014All the dollarbills her husband gave her were spent in the stores on wondrous gowns and costliest frillies. For him! For raoul!\n\nYes. This. Here. Try.\n\n\u2014Her mouth glued on his in a luscious voluptuous kiss while his hands felt for the opulent curves inside her deshabill\u00e9.\n\nYes. Take this. The end.\n\n\u2014You are late, he spoke hoarsely, eying her with a suspicious glare. The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap, displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint. An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly.\n\nMr Bloom read again: The beautiful woman.\n\nWarmth showered gently over him, cowing his flesh. Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes: whites of eyes swooning up. His nostrils arched themselves for prey. Melting breast ointments (for Him! For Raoul!). Armpits' oniony sweat. Fishgluey slime (her heaving embonpoint!). Feel! Press! Crushed! Sulphur dung of lions!\n\nYoung! Young!\n\nAn elderly female, no more young, left the building of the courts of chancery, king's bench, exchequer and common pleas, having heard in the lord chancellor's court the case in lunacy of Potterton, in the admiralty division the summons, exparte motion, of the owners of the Lady Cairns versus the owners of the barque Mona, in the court of appeal reservation of judgment in the case of Harvey versus the Ocean Accident and Guarantee Corporation.\n\nPhlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop, bulging out the dingy curtains. The shopman's uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face, coughing. He raked his throat rudely, puked phlegm on the floor. He put his boot on what he had spat, wiping his sole along it, and bent, showing a rawskinned crown, scantily haired.\n\nMr Bloom beheld it.\n\nMastering his troubled breath, he said:\n\n\u2014I'll take this one.\n\nThe shopman lifted eyes bleared with old rheum.\n\n\u2014Sweets of Sin, he said, tapping on it. That's a good one.\n\nThe lacquey by the door of Dillon's auctionrooms shook his handbell twice again and viewed himself in the chalked mirror of the cabinet.\n\nDilly Dedalus, loitering by the curbstone, heard the beats of the bell, the cries of the auctioneer within. Four and nine. Those lovely curtains. Five shillings. Cosy curtains. Selling new at two guineas. Any advance on five shillings? Going for five shillings.\n\nThe lacquey lifted his handbell and shook it:\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\nBang of the lastlap bell spurred the halfmile wheelmen to their sprint. J. A. Jackson, W. E. Wylie, A. Munro and H. T. Gahan, their stretched necks wagging, negotiated the curve by the College library.\n\nMr Dedalus, tugging a long moustache, came round from Williams's row. He halted near his daughter.\n\n\u2014It's time for you, she said.\n\n\u2014Stand up straight for the love of the lord Jesus, Mr Dedalus said. Are you trying to imitate your uncle John, the cornetplayer, head upon shoulder? Melancholy God!\n\nDilly shrugged her shoulders. Mr Dedalus placed his hands on them and held them back.\n\n\u2014Stand up straight, girl, he said. You'll get curvature of the spine. Do you know what you look like?\n\nHe let his head sink suddenly down and forward, hunching his shoulders and dropping his underjaw.\n\n\u2014Give it up, father, Dilly said. All the people are looking at you.\n\nMr Dedalus drew himself upright and tugged again at his moustache.\n\n\u2014Did you get any money? Dilly asked.\n\n\u2014Where would I get money? Mr Dedalus said. There is no-one in Dublin would lend me fourpence.\n\n\u2014You got some, Dilly said, looking in his eyes.\n\n\u2014How do you know that? Mr Dedalus asked, his tongue in his cheek.\n\nMr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked, walked boldly along James's street.\n\n\u2014I know you did, Dilly answered. Were you in the Scotch house now?\n\n\u2014I was not, then, Mr Dedalus said, smiling. Was it the little nuns taught you to be so saucy? Here.\n\nHe handed her a shilling.\n\n\u2014See if you can do anything with that, he said.\n\n\u2014I suppose you got five, Dilly said. Give me more than that.\n\n\u2014Wait awhile, Mr Dedalus said threateningly. You're like the rest of them, are you? An insolent pack of little bitches since your poor mother died. But wait awhile. You'll all get a short shrift and a long day from me. Low blackguardism! I'm going to get rid of you. Wouldn't care if I was stretched out stiff. He's dead. The man upstairs is dead.\n\nHe left her and walked on. Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat.\n\n\u2014Well, what is it? he said, stopping.\n\nThe lacquey rang his bell behind their backs.\n\n\u2014Barang!\n\n\u2014Curse your bloody blatant soul, Mr Dedalus cried, turning on him.\n\nThe lacquey, aware of comment, shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly:\n\n\u2014Bang!\n\nMr Dedalus stared at him.\n\n\u2014Watch him, he said. It's instructive. I wonder will he allow us to talk.\n\n\u2014You got more than that, father, Dilly said.\n\n\u2014I'm going to show you a little trick, Mr Dedalus said. I'll leave you all where Jesus left the jews. Look, there's all I have. I got two shillings from Jack Power and I spent twopence for a shave for the funeral.\n\nHe drew forth a handful of copper coins, nervously.\n\n\u2014Can't you look for some money somewhere? Dilly said.\n\nMr Dedalus thought and nodded.\n\n\u2014I will, he said gravely. I looked all along the gutter in O'Connell street. I'll try this one now.\n\n\u2014You're very funny, Dilly said, grinning.\n\n\u2014Here, Mr Dedalus said, handing her two pennies. Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something. I'll be home shortly.\n\nHe put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on.\n\nThe viceregal cavalcade passed, greeted by obsequious policemen, out of Parkgate.\n\n\u2014I'm sure you have another shilling, Dilly said.\n\nThe lacquey banged loudly.\n\nMr Dedalus amid the din walked off, murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently:\n\n\u2014The little nuns! Nice little things! O, sure they wouldn't do anything! O, sure they wouldn't really! Is it little sister Monica!\n\nFrom the sundial towards James's gate walked Mr Kernan, pleased with the order he had booked for Pulbrook Robertson, boldly along James's street, past Shackleton's offices. Got round him all right. How do you do, Mr Crimmins? First rate, sir. I was afraid you might be up in your other establishment in Pimlico. How are things going? Just keeping alive. Lovely weather we're having. Yes, indeed. Good for the country. Those farmers are always grumbling. I'll just take a thimbleful of your best gin, Mr Crimmins. A small gin, sir. Yes, sir. Terrible affair that General Slocum explosion. Terrible, terrible! A thousand casualties. And heartrending scenes. Men trampling down women and children. Most brutal thing. What do they say was the cause? Spontaneous combustion. Most scandalous revelation. Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst. What I can't understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that... Now, you're talking straight, Mr Crimmins. You know why? Palm oil. Is that a fact? Without a doubt. Well now, look at that. And America they say is the land of the free. I thought we were bad here.\n\nI smiled at him. America, I said quietly, just like that. What is it? The sweepings of every country including our own. Isn't that true? That's a fact.\n\nGraft, my dear sir. Well, of course, where there's money going there's always someone to pick it up.\n\nSaw him looking at my frockcoat. Dress does it. Nothing like a dressy appearance. Bowls them over.\n\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\n\nMr Kernan halted and preened himself before the sloping mirror of Peter Kennedy, hairdresser. Stylish coat, beyond a doubt. Scott of Dawson street. Well worth the half sovereign I gave Neary for it. Never built under three guineas. Fits me down to the ground. Some Kildare street club toff had it probably. John Mulligan, the manager of the Hibernian bank, gave me a very sharp eye yesterday on Carlisle bridge as if he remembered me.\n\nAham! Must dress the character for those fellows. Knight of the road. Gentleman. And now, Mr Crimmins, may we have the honour of your custom again, sir. The cup that cheers but not inebriates, as the old saying has it.\n\nNorth wall and sir John Rogerson's quay, with hulls and anchorchains, sailing westward, sailed by a skiff, a crumpled throwaway, rocked on the ferrywash, Elijah is coming.\n\nMr Kernan glanced in farewell at his image. High colour, of course. Grizzled moustache. Returned Indian officer. Bravely he bore his stumpy body forward on spatted feet, squaring his shoulders. Is that Ned Lambert's brother over the way, Sam? What? Yes. He's as like it as damn it. No. The windscreen of that motorcar in the sun there. Just a flash like that. Damn like him.\n\nAham! Hot spirit of juniper juice warmed his vitals and his breath. Good drop of gin, that was. His frocktails winked in bright sunshine to his fat strut.\n\nDown there Emmet was hanged, drawn and quartered. Greasy black rope. Dogs licking the blood off the street when the lord lieutenant's wife drove by in her noddy.\n\nBad times those were. Well, well. Over and done with. Great topers too. Fourbottle men.\n\nLet me see. Is he buried in saint Michan's? Or no, there was a midnight burial in Glasnevin. Corpse brought in through a secret door in the wall. Dignam is there now. Went out in a puff. Well, well. Better turn down here. Make a detour.\n\nMr Kernan turned and walked down the slope of Watling street by the corner of Guinness's visitors' waitingroom. Outside the Dublin Distillers Company's stores an outside car without fare or jarvey stood, the reins knotted to the wheel. Damn dangerous thing. Some Tipperary bosthoon endangering the lives of the citizens. Runaway horse.\n\nDenis Breen with his tomes, weary of having waited an hour in John Henry Menton's office, led his wife over O'Connell bridge, bound for the office of Messrs Collis and Ward.\n\nMr Kernan approached Island street.\n\nTimes of the troubles. Must ask Ned Lambert to lend me those reminiscences of sir Jonah Barrington. When you look back on it all now in a kind of retrospective arrangement. Gaming at Daly's. No cardsharping then. One of those fellows got his hand nailed to the table by a dagger. Somewhere here lord Edward Fitzgerald escaped from major Sirr. Stables behind Moira house.\n\nDamn good gin that was.\n\nFine dashing young nobleman. Good stock, of course. That ruffian, that sham squire, with his violet gloves gave him away. Course they were on the wrong side. They rose in dark and evil days. Fine poem that is: Ingram. They were gentlemen. Ben Dollard does sing that ballad touchingly. Masterly rendition.\nAt the siege of Ross did my father fall.\n\nA cavalcade in easy trot along Pembroke quay passed, outriders leaping, leaping in their, in their saddles. Frockcoats. Cream sunshades.\n\nMr Kernan hurried forward, blowing pursily.\n\nHis Excellency! Too bad! Just missed that by a hair. Damn it! What a pity!\n\nStephen Dedalus watched through the webbed window the lapidary's fingers prove a timedulled chain. Dust webbed the window and the showtrays. Dust darkened the toiling fingers with their vulture nails. Dust slept on dull coils of bronze and silver, lozenges of cinnabar, on rubies, leprous and winedark stones.\n\nBorn all in the dark wormy earth, cold specks of fire, evil, lights shining in the darkness. Where fallen archangels flung the stars of their brows. Muddy swinesnouts, hands, root and root, gripe and wrest them.\n\nShe dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from a beaker rum and eyes her. A long and seafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish haunches and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.\n\nOld Russell with a smeared shammy rag burnished again his gem, turned it and held it at the point of his Moses' beard. Grandfather ape gloating on a stolen hoard.\n\nAnd you who wrest old images from the burial earth? The brainsick words of sophists: Antisthenes. A lore of drugs. Orient and immortal wheat standing from everlasting to everlasting.\n\nTwo old women fresh from their whiff of the briny trudged through Irishtown along London bridge road, one with a sanded tired umbrella, one with a midwife's bag in which eleven cockles rolled.\n\nThe whirr of flapping leathern bands and hum of dynamos from the powerhouse urged Stephen to be on. Beingless beings. Stop! Throb always without you and the throb always within. Your heart you sing of. I between them. Where? Between two roaring worlds where they swirl, I. Shatter them, one and both. But stun myself too in the blow. Shatter me you who can. Bawd and butcher were the words. I say! Not yet awhile. A look around.\n\nYes, quite true. Very large and wonderful and keeps famous time. You say right, sir. A Monday morning, 'twas so, indeed.\n\nStephen went down Bedford row, the handle of the ash clacking against his shoulderblade. In Clohissey's window a faded 1860 print of Heenan boxing Sayers held his eye. Staring backers with square hats stood round the roped prizering. The heavyweights in tight loincloths proposed gently each to other his bulbous fists. And they are throbbing: heroes' hearts.\n\nHe turned and halted by the slanted bookcart.\n\n\u2014Twopence each, the huckster said. Four for sixpence.\n\nTattered pages. The Irish Beekeeper. Life and Miracles of the Cur\u00e9 of Ars. Pocket Guide to Killarney.\n\nI might find here one of my pawned schoolprizes. Stephano Dedalo, alumno optimo, palmam ferenti.\n\nFather Conmee, having read his little hours, walked through the hamlet of Donnycarney, murmuring vespers.\n\nBinding too good probably. What is this? Eighth and ninth book of Moses. Secret of all secrets. Seal of King David. Thumbed pages: read and read. Who has passed here before me? How to soften chapped hands. Recipe for white wine vinegar. How to win a woman's love. For me this. Say the following talisman three times with hands folded:\n\n\u2014Se el yilo nebrakada femininum! Amor me solo! Sanktus! Amen.\n\nWho wrote this? Charms and invocations of the most blessed abbot Peter Salanka to all true believers divulged. As good as any other abbot's charms, as mumbling Joachim's. Down, baldynoddle, or we'll wool your wool.\n\n\u2014What are you doing here, Stephen?\n\nDilly's high shoulders and shabby dress.\n\nShut the book quick. Don't let see.\n\n\u2014What are you doing? Stephen said.\n\nA Stuart face of nonesuch Charles, lank locks falling at its sides. It glowed as she crouched feeding the fire with broken boots. I told her of Paris. Late lieabed under a quilt of old overcoats, fingering a pinchbeck bracelet, Dan Kelly's token. Nebrakada femininum.\n\n\u2014What have you there? Stephen asked.\n\n\u2014I bought it from the other cart for a penny, Dilly said, laughing nervously. Is it any good?\n\nMy eyes they say she has. Do others see me so? Quick, far and daring. Shadow of my mind.\n\nHe took the coverless book from her hand. Chardenal's French primer.\n\n\u2014What did you buy that for? he asked. To learn French?\n\nShe nodded, reddening and closing tight her lips.\n\nShow no surprise. Quite natural.\n\n\u2014Here, Stephen said. It's all right. Mind Maggy doesn't pawn it on you. I suppose all my books are gone.\n\n\u2014Some, Dilly said. We had to.\n\nShe is drowning. Agenbite. Save her. Agenbite. All against us. She will drown me with her, eyes and hair. Lank coils of seaweed hair around me, my heart, my soul. Salt green death.\n\nWe.\n\nAgenbite of inwit. Inwit's agenbite.\n\nMisery! Misery!\n\n\u2014Hello, Simon, Father Cowley said. How are things?\n\n\u2014Hello, Bob, old man, Mr Dedalus answered, stopping.\n\nThey clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter's. Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand.\n\n\u2014What's the best news? Mr Dedalus said.\n\n\u2014Why then not much, Father Cowley said. I'm barricaded up, Simon, with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance.\n\n\u2014Jolly, Mr Dedalus said. Who is it?\n\n\u2014O, Father Cowley said. A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance.\n\n\u2014With a broken back, is it? Mr Dedalus asked.\n\n\u2014The same, Simon, Father Cowley answered. Reuben of that ilk. I'm just waiting for Ben Dollard. He's going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off. All I want is a little time.\n\nHe looked with vague hope up and down the quay, a big apple bulging in his neck.\n\n\u2014I know, Mr Dedalus said, nodding. Poor old bockedy Ben! He's always doing a good turn for someone. Hold hard!\n\nHe put on his glasses and gazed towards the metal bridge an instant.\n\n\u2014There he is, by God, he said, arse and pockets.\n\nBen Dollard's loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge. He came towards them at an amble, scratching actively behind his coattails.\n\nAs he came near Mr Dedalus greeted:\n\n\u2014Hold that fellow with the bad trousers.\n\n\u2014Hold him now, Ben Dollard said.\n\nMr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard's figure. Then, turning to Father Cowley with a nod, he muttered sneeringly:\n\n\u2014That's a pretty garment, isn't it, for a summer's day?\n\n\u2014Why, God eternally curse your soul, Ben Dollard growled furiously, I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw.\n\nHe stood beside them beaming, on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff, saying:\n\n\u2014They were made for a man in his health, Ben, anyhow.\n\n\u2014Bad luck to the jewman that made them, Ben Dollard said. Thanks be to God he's not paid yet.\n\n\u2014And how is that basso profondo, Benjamin? Father Cowley asked.\n\nCashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, murmuring, glassyeyed, strode past the Kildare street club.\n\nBen Dollard frowned and, making suddenly a chanter's mouth, gave forth a deep note.\n\n\u2014Aw! he said.\n\n\u2014That's the style, Mr Dedalus said, nodding to its drone.\n\n\u2014What about that? Ben Dollard said. Not too dusty? What?\n\nHe turned to both.\n\n\u2014That'll do, Father Cowley said, nodding also.\n\nThe reverend Hugh C. Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary's abbey past James and Charles Kennedy's, rectifiers, attended by Geraldines tall and personable, towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles.\n\nBen Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward, his joyful fingers in the air.\n\n\u2014Come along with me to the subsheriff's office, he said. I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff. He's a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun. He's well worth seeing, mind you. Come along. I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don't... Wait awhile... We're on the right lay, Bob, believe you me.\n\n\u2014For a few days tell him, Father Cowley said anxiously.\n\nBen Dollard halted and stared, his loud orifice open, a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright.\n\n\u2014What few days? he boomed. Hasn't your landlord distrained for rent?\n\n\u2014He has, Father Cowley said.\n\n\u2014Then our friend's writ is not worth the paper it's printed on, Ben Dollard said. The landlord has the prior claim. I gave him all the particulars. 29 Windsor avenue. Love is the name?\n\n\u2014That's right, Father Cowley said. The reverend Mr Love. He's a minister in the country somewhere. But are you sure of that?\n\n\u2014You can tell Barabbas from me, Ben Dollard said, that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts.\n\nHe led Father Cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.\n\n\u2014Filberts I believe they were, Mr Dedalus said, as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront, following them.\n\n\u2014The youngster will be all right, Martin Cunningham said, as they passed out of the Castleyard gate.\n\nThe policeman touched his forehead.\n\n\u2014God bless you, Martin Cunningham said, cheerily.\n\nHe signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street.\n\nBronze by gold, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head, appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel.\n\n\u2014Yes, Martin Cunningham said, fingering his beard. I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him.\n\n\u2014You could try our friend, Mr Power suggested backward.\n\n\u2014Boyd? Martin Cunningham said shortly. Touch me not.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them quickly down Cork hill.\n\nOn the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti, descending, hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending.\n\nThe castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street.\n\n\u2014Look here, Martin, John Wyse Nolan said, overtaking them at the Mail office. I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings.\n\n\u2014Quite right, Martin Cunningham said, taking the list. And put down the five shillings too.\n\n\u2014Without a second word either, Mr Power said.\n\n\u2014Strange but true, Martin Cunningham added.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes.\n\n\u2014I'll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.\n\nThey went down Parliament street.\n\n\u2014There's Jimmy Henry, Mr Power said, just heading for Kavanagh's.\n\n\u2014Righto, Martin Cunningham said. Here goes.\n\nOutside la Maison Claire Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney's brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.\n\nJohn Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power, while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked uncertainly, with hasty steps past Micky Anderson's watches.\n\n\u2014The assistant town clerk's corns are giving him some trouble, John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power.\n\nThey followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh's winerooms. The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate. Martin Cunningham, speaking always, showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance.\n\n\u2014And long John Fanning is here too, John Wyse Nolan said, as large as life.\n\nThe tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood.\n\n\u2014Good day, Mr Subsheriff, Martin Cunningham said, as all halted and greeted.\n\nLong John Fanning made no way for them. He removed his large Henry Clay decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all their faces.\n\n\u2014Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.\n\nHell open to christians they were having, Jimmy Henry said pettishly, about their damned Irish language. Where was the marshal, he wanted to know, to keep order in the council chamber. And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma, no mace on the table, nothing in order, no quorum even, and Hutchinson, the lord mayor, in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing locum tenens for him. Damned Irish language, language of our forefathers.\n\nLong John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.\n\nMartin Cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while John Wyse Nolan held his peace.\n\n\u2014What Dignam was that? long John Fanning asked.\n\nJimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.\n\n\u2014O, my corns! he said plaintively. Come upstairs for goodness' sake till I sit down somewhere. Uff! Ooo! Mind!\n\nTestily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning's flank and passed in and up the stairs.\n\n\u2014Come on up, Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff. I don't think you knew him or perhaps you did, though.\n\nWith John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in.\n\n\u2014Decent little soul he was, Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror.\n\n\u2014Rather lowsized. Dignam of Menton's office that was, Martin Cunningham said.\n\nLong John Fanning could not remember him.\n\nClatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.\n\n\u2014What's that? Martin Cunningham said.\n\nAll turned where they stood. John Wyse Nolan came down again. From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street, harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. In saddles of the leaders, leaping leaders, rode outriders.\n\n\u2014What was it? Martin Cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.\n\n\u2014The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland, John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot.\n\nAs they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines:\n\n\u2014Parnell's brother. There in the corner.\n\nThey chose a small table near the window, opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard.\n\n\u2014Is that he? Haines asked, twisting round in his seat.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mulligan said. That's John Howard, his brother, our city marshal.\n\nJohn Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested. An instant after, under its screen, his eyes looked quickly, ghostbright, at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner.\n\n\u2014I'll take a m\u00e9lange, Haines said to the waitress.\n\n\u2014Two m\u00e9langes, Buck Mulligan said. And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well.\n\nWhen she had gone he said, laughing:\n\n\u2014We call it D.B.C. because they have damn bad cakes. O, but you missed Dedalus on Hamlet.\n\nHaines opened his newbought book.\n\n\u2014I'm sorry, he said. Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance.\n\nThe onelegged sailor growled at the area of 14 Nelson street:\n\n\u2014England expects...\n\nBuck Mulligan's primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter.\n\n\u2014You should see him, he said, when his body loses its balance. Wandering Aengus I call him.\n\n\u2014I am sure he has an id\u00e9e fixe, Haines said, pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger. Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be. Such persons always have.\n\nBuck Mulligan bent across the table gravely.\n\n\u2014They drove his wits astray, he said, by visions of hell. He will never capture the Attic note. The note of Swinburne, of all poets, the white death and the ruddy birth. That is his tragedy. He can never be a poet. The joy of creation...\n\n\u2014Eternal punishment, Haines said, nodding curtly. I see. I tackled him this morning on belief. There was something on his mind, I saw. It's rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that.\n\nBuck Mulligan's watchful eyes saw the waitress come. He helped her to unload her tray.\n\n\u2014He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth, Haines said, amid the cheerful cups. The moral idea seems lacking, the sense of destiny, of retribution. Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. Does he write anything for your movement?\n\nHe sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream. Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith. He bit off a soft piece hungrily.\n\n\u2014Ten years, he said, chewing and laughing. He is going to write something in ten years.\n\n\u2014Seems a long way off, Haines said, thoughtfully lifting his spoon. Still, I shouldn't wonder if he did after all.\n\nHe tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup.\n\n\u2014This is real Irish cream I take it, he said with forbearance. I don't want to be imposed on.\n\nElijah, skiff, light crumpled throwaway, sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers, amid an archipelago of corks, beyond new Wapping street past Benson's ferry, and by the threemasted schooner Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks.\n\nAlmidano Artifoni walked past Holles street, past Sewell's yard. Behind him Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling, shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith's house and, crossing, walked along Merrion square. Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park.\n\nCashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner's cheerful windows, then turned and strode back along Merrion square, his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling.\n\nAt the corner of Wilde's house he halted, frowned at Elijah's name announced on the Metropolitan hall, frowned at the distant pleasance of duke's lawn. His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun. With ratsteeth bared he muttered:\n\n\u2014Coactus volui.\n\nHe strode on for Clare street, grinding his fierce word.\n\nAs he strode past Mr Bloom's dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards, having buffeted a thewless body. The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form.\n\n\u2014God's curse on you, he said sourly, whoever you are! You're blinder nor I am, you bitch's bastard!\n\nOpposite Ruggy O'Donohoe's Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, pawing the pound and a half of Mangan's, late Fehrenbach's, porksteaks he had been sent for, went along warm Wicklow street dawdling. It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney's. And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake, jawing the whole blooming time and sighing.\n\nAfter Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle, courtdress milliner, stopped him. He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props. From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently. Myler Keogh, Dublin's pet lamb, will meet sergeantmajor Bennett, the Portobello bruiser, for a purse of fifty sovereigns. Gob, that'd be a good pucking match to see. Myler Keogh, that's the chap sparring out to him with the green sash. Two bar entrance, soldiers half price. I could easy do a bunk on ma. Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned. That's me in mourning. When is it? May the twentysecond. Sure, the blooming thing is all over. He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned, his cap awry, his collar sticking up. Buttoning it down, his chin lifted, he saw the image of Marie Kendall, charming soubrette, beside the two puckers. One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out.\n\nMaster Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on. The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons. One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week, man. But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him, dodging and all.\n\nIn Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff's mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time.\n\nNo Sandymount tram.\n\nMaster Dignam walked along Nassau street, shifted the porksteaks to his other hand. His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down. The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt, blooming end to it. He met schoolboys with satchels. I'm not going tomorrow either, stay away till Monday. He met other schoolboys. Do they notice I'm in mourning? Uncle Barney said he'd get it into the paper tonight. Then they'll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa's name.\n\nHis face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye. The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin: and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs.\n\nPa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend. A big coffin it was, and high and heavylooking. How was that? The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney's for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt. Never see him again. Death, that is. Pa is dead. My father is dead. He told me to be a good son to ma. I couldn't hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better. Poor pa. That was Mr Dignam, my father. I hope he's in purgatory now because he went to confession to Father Conroy on Saturday night.\n\nWilliam Humble, earl of Dudley, and lady Dudley, accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine, drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge. In the following carriage were the honourable Mrs Paget, Miss de Courcy and the honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C. in attendance.\n\nThe cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays. The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis. At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar Between Queen's and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley's viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White, B. L., M. A., who stood on Arran quay outside Mrs M. E. White's, the pawnbroker's, at the corner of Arran street west stroking his nose with his forefinger, undecided whether he should arrive at Phibsborough more quickly by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot through Smithfield, Constitution hill and Broadstone terminus. In the porch of Four Courts Richie Goulding with the costbag of Goulding, Collis and Ward saw him with surprise. Past Richmond bridge at the doorstep of the office of Reuben J Dodd, solicitor, agent for the Patriotic Insurance Company, an elderly female about to enter changed her plan and retracing her steps by King's windows smiled credulously on the representative of His Majesty. From its sluice in Wood quay wall under Tom Devan's office Poddle river hung out in fealty a tongue of liquid sewage. Above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel, gold by bronze, Miss Kennedy's head by Miss Douce's head watched and admired. On Ormond quay Mr Simon Dedalus, steering his way from the greenhouse for the subsheriff's office, stood still in midstreet and brought his hat low. His Excellency graciously returned Mr Dedalus' greeting. From Cahill's corner the reverend Hugh C. Love, M.A., made obeisance unperceived, mindful of lords deputies whose hands benignant had held of yore rich advowsons. On Grattan bridge Lenehan and M'Coy, taking leave of each other, watched the carriages go by. Passing by Roger Greene's office and Dollard's big red printinghouse Gerty MacDowell, carrying the Catesby's cork lino letters for her father who was laid up, knew by the style it was the lord and lady lieutenant but she couldn't see what Her Excellency had on because the tram and Spring's big yellow furniture van had to stop in front of her on account of its being the lord lieutenant. Beyond Lundy Foot's from the shaded door of Kavanagh's winerooms John Wyse Nolan smiled with unseen coldness towards the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland. The Right Honourable William Humble, earl of Dudley, G. C. V. O., passed Micky Anderson's all times ticking watches and Henry and James's wax smartsuited freshcheeked models, the gentleman Henry, dernier cri James. Over against Dame gate Tom Rochford and Nosey Flynn watched the approach of the cavalcade. Tom Rochford, seeing the eyes of lady Dudley fixed on him, took his thumbs quickly out of the pockets of his claret waistcoat and doffed his cap to her. A charming soubrette, great Marie Kendall, with dauby cheeks and lifted skirt smiled daubily from her poster upon William Humble, earl of Dudley, and upon lieutenantcolonel H. G. Heseltine, and also upon the honourable Gerald Ward A. D. C. From the window of the D. B. C. Buck Mulligan gaily, and Haines gravely, gazed down on the viceregal equipage over the shoulders of eager guests, whose mass of forms darkened the chessboard whereon John Howard Parnell looked intently. In Fownes's street Dilly Dedalus, straining her sight upward from Chardenal's first French primer, saw sunshades spanned and wheelspokes spinning in the glare. John Henry Menton, filling the doorway of Commercial Buildings, stared from winebig oyster eyes, holding a fat gold hunter watch not looked at in his fat left hand not feeling it. Where the foreleg of King Billy's horse pawed the air Mrs Breen plucked her hastening husband back from under the hoofs of the outriders. She shouted in his ear the tidings. Understanding, he shifted his tomes to his left breast and saluted the second carriage. The honourable Gerald Ward A.D.C., agreeably surprised, made haste to reply. At Ponsonby's corner a jaded white flagon H. halted and four tallhatted white flagons halted behind him, E.L.Y'S, while outriders pranced past and carriages. Opposite Pigott's music warerooms Mr Denis J Maginni, professor of dancing &c, gaily apparelled, gravely walked, outpassed by a viceroy and unobserved. By the provost's wall came jauntily Blazes Boylan, stepping in tan shoes and socks with skyblue clocks to the refrain of My girl's a Yorkshire girl.\n\nBlazes Boylan presented to the leaders' skyblue frontlets and high action a skyblue tie, a widebrimmed straw hat at a rakish angle and a suit of indigo serge. His hands in his jacket pockets forgot to salute but he offered to the three ladies the bold admiration of his eyes and the red flower between his lips. As they drove along Nassau street His Excellency drew the attention of his bowing consort to the programme of music which was being discoursed in College park. Unseen brazen highland laddies blared and drumthumped after the cort\u00e8ge:\n\nBut though she's a factory lass\nAnd wears no fancy clothes.\nBaraabum.\nYet I've a sort of a\nYorkshire relish for\nMy little Yorkshire rose.\nBaraabum.\n\nThither of the wall the quartermile flat handicappers, M. C. Green, H. Shrift, T. M. Patey, C. Scaife, J. B. Jeffs, G. N. Morphy, F. Stevenson, C. Adderly and W. C. Huggard, started in pursuit. Striding past Finn's hotel Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell stared through a fierce eyeglass across the carriages at the head of Mr M. E. Solomons in the window of the Austro-Hungarian viceconsulate. Deep in Leinster street by Trinity's postern a loyal king's man, Hornblower, touched his tallyho cap. As the glossy horses pranced by Merrion square Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam, waiting, saw salutes being given to the gent with the topper and raised also his new black cap with fingers greased by porksteak paper. His collar too sprang up. The viceroy, on his way to inaugurate the Mirus bazaar in aid of funds for Mercer's hospital, drove with his following towards Lower Mount street. He passed a blind stripling opposite Broadbent's. In Lower Mount street a pedestrian in a brown macintosh, eating dry bread, passed swiftly and unscathed across the viceroy's path. At the Royal Canal bridge, from his hoarding, Mr Eugene Stratton, his blub lips agrin, bade all comers welcome to Pembroke township. At Haddington road corner two sanded women halted themselves, an umbrella and a bag in which eleven cockles rolled to view with wonder the lord mayor and lady mayoress without his golden chain. On Northumberland and Lansdowne roads His Excellency acknowledged punctually salutes from rare male walkers, the salute of two small schoolboys at the garden gate of the house said to have been admired by the late queen when visiting the Irish capital with her husband, the prince consort, in 1849 and the salute of Almidano Artifoni's sturdy trousers swallowed by a closing door.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 20, "api_path": "/songs/136214", "artist_names": "Kenneth Grahame", "full_title": "The Wind in the Willows - Chapter 3: The Wild Wood by\u00a0Kenneth\u00a0Grahame", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/14164e6e37b5fb359a6631456d989fb5.300x225x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/14164e6e37b5fb359a6631456d989fb5.640x480x1.jpg", "id": 136214, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 127576, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1424217378, "path": "/Kenneth-grahame-the-wind-in-the-willows-chapter-3-the-wild-wood-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Kenneth-grahame-the-wind-in-the-willows-chapter-3-the-wild-wood-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/14164e6e37b5fb359a6631456d989fb5.300x225x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/14164e6e37b5fb359a6631456d989fb5.640x480x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "The Wind in the Willows - Chapter 3: The Wild Wood", "title_with_featured": "The Wind in the Willows - Chapter 3: The Wild Wood", "updated_by_human_at": 1424217378, "url": "https://genius.com/Kenneth-grahame-the-wind-in-the-willows-chapter-3-the-wild-wood-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/44688", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d621e0615a3e381a9be8a49798a2c783.670x670x1.jpg", "id": 44688, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/d621e0615a3e381a9be8a49798a2c783.670x670x1.jpg", "index_character": "k", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Kenneth Grahame", "slug": "Kenneth-grahame", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Kenneth-grahame"}, "artist": "Kenneth Grahame", "lyrics": "The Wind in the Willows - Chapter 3: The Wild Wood LyricsThe Mole had long wanted to make the acquaintance of the Badger. He seemed, by all accounts, to be such an important personage and, though rarely visible, to make his unseen influence felt by everybody about the place. But whenever the Mole mentioned his wish to the Water Rat he always found himself put off. 'It's all right,' the Rat would say. 'Badger'll turn up some day or other--he's always turning up--and then I'll introduce you. The best of fellows! But you must not only take him AS you find him, but WHEN you find him.'\n\n'Couldn't you ask him here dinner or something?' said the Mole.\n\n'He wouldn't come,' replied the Rat simply. 'Badger hates Society, and invitations, and dinner, and all that sort of thing.'\n\n'Well, then, supposing we go and call on HIM?' suggested the Mole.\n\n'O, I'm sure he wouldn't like that at ALL,' said the Rat, quite alarmed. 'He's so very shy, he'd be sure to be offended. I've never even ventured to call on him at his own home myself, though I know him so well. Besides, we can't. It's quite out of the question, because he lives in the very middle of the Wild Wood.'\n\n'Well, supposing he does,' said the Mole. 'You told me the Wild Wood was all right, you know.'\n'O, I know, I know, so it is,' replied the Rat evasively. 'But I think we won't go there just now. Not JUST yet. It's a long way, and he wouldn't be at home at this time of year anyhow, and he'll be coming along some day, if you'll wait quietly.'\n\nThe Mole had to be content with this. But the Badger never came along, and every day brought its amusements, and it was not till summer was long over, and cold and frost and miry ways kept them much indoors, and the swollen river raced past outside their windows with a speed that mocked at boating of any sort or kind, that he found his thoughts dwelling again with much persistence on the solitary grey Badger, who lived his own life by himself, in his hole in the middle of the Wild Wood.\n\nIn the winter time the Rat slept a great deal, retiring early and rising late. During his short day he sometimes scribbled poetry or did other small domestic jobs about the house; and, of course, there were always animals dropping in for a chat, and consequently there was a good deal of story-telling and comparing notes on the past summer and all its doings.\n\nSuch a rich chapter it had been, when one came to look back on it all! With illustrations so numerous and so very highly coloured! The pageant of the river bank had marched steadily along, unfolding itself in scene-pictures that succeeded each other in stately procession. Purple loosestrife arrived early, shaking luxuriant tangled locks along the edge of the mirror whence its own face laughed back at it. Willow-herb, tender and wistful, like a pink sunset cloud, was not slow to follow. Comfrey, the purple hand-in-hand with the white, crept forth to take its place in the line; and at last one morning the diffident and delaying dog-rose stepped delicately on the stage, and one knew, as if string-music had announced it in stately chords that strayed into a gavotte, that June at last was here. One member of the company was still awaited; the shepherd-boy for the nymphs to woo, the knight for whom the ladies waited at the window, the prince that was to kiss the sleeping summer back to life and love. But when meadow-sweet, debonair and odorous in amber jerkin, moved graciously to his place in the group, then the play was ready to begin.\n\nAnd what a play it had been! Drowsy animals, snug in their holes while wind and rain were battering at their doors, recalled still keen mornings, an hour before sunrise, when the white mist, as yet undispersed, clung closely along the surface of the water; then the shock of the early plunge, the scamper along the bank, and the radiant transformation of earth, air, and water, when suddenly the sun was with them again, and grey was gold and colour was born and sprang out of the earth once more. They recalled the languorous siesta of hot mid-day, deep in green undergrowth, the sun striking through in tiny golden shafts and spots; the boating and bathing of the afternoon, the rambles along dusty lanes and through yellow cornfields; and the long, cool evening at last, when so many threads were gathered up, so many friendships rounded, and so many adventures planned for the morrow. There was plenty to talk about on those short winter days when the animals found themselves round the fire; still, the Mole had a good deal of spare time on his hands, and so one afternoon, when the Rat in his arm-chair before the blaze was alternately dozing and trying over rhymes that wouldn't fit, he formed the resolution to go out by himself and explore the Wild Wood, and perhaps strike up an acquaintance with Mr. Badger.\n\nIt was a cold still afternoon with a hard steely sky overhead, when he slipped out of the warm parlour into the open air. The country lay bare and entirely leafless around him, and he thought that he had never seen so far and so intimately into the insides of things as on that winter day when Nature was deep in her annual slumber and seemed to have kicked the clothes off. Copses, dells, quarries and all hidden places, which had been mysterious mines for exploration in leafy summer, now exposed themselves and their secrets pathetically, and seemed to ask him to overlook their shabby poverty for a while, till they could riot in rich masquerade as before, and trick and entice him with the old deceptions. It was pitiful in a way, and yet cheering--even exhilarating. He was glad that he liked the country undecorated, hard, and stripped of its finery. He had got down to the bare bones of it, and they were fine and strong and simple. He did not want the warm clover and the play of seeding grasses; the screens of quickset, the billowy drapery of beech and elm seemed best away; and with great cheerfulness of spirit he pushed on towards the Wild Wood, which lay before him low and threatening, like a black reef in some still southern sea.\n\nThere was nothing to alarm him at first entry. Twigs crackled under his feet, logs tripped him, funguses on stumps resembled caricatures, and startled him for the moment by their likeness to something familiar and far away; but that was all fun, and exciting. It led him on, and he penetrated to where the light was less, and trees crouched nearer and nearer, and holes made ugly mouths at him on either side.\n\nEverything was very still now. The dusk advanced on him steadily, rapidly, gathering in behind and before; and the light seemed to be draining away like flood-water.\n\nThen the faces began.\n\nIt was over his shoulder, and indistinctly, that he first thought he saw a face; a little evil wedge-shaped face, looking out at him from a hole. When he turned and confronted it, the thing had vanished.\nHe quickened his pace, telling himself cheerfully not to begin imagining things, or there would be simply no end to it. He passed another hole, and another, and another; and then--yes!--no!--yes! certainly a little narrow face, with hard eyes, had flashed up for an instant from a hole, and was gone. He hesitated--braced himself up for an effort and strode on. Then suddenly, and as if it had been so all the time, every hole, far and near, and there were hundreds of them, seemed to possess its face, coming and going rapidly, all fixing on him glances of malice and hatred: all hard-eyed and evil and sharp.\n\nIf he could only get away from the holes in the banks, he thought, there would be no more faces. He swung off the path and plunged into the untrodden places of the wood.\n\nThen the whistling began.\n\nVery faint and shrill it was, and far behind him, when first he heard it; but somehow it made him hurry forward. Then, still very faint and shrill, it sounded far ahead of him, and made him hesitate and want to go back. As he halted in indecision it broke out on either side, and seemed to be caught up and passed on throughout the whole length of the wood to its farthest limit. They were up and alert and ready, evidently, whoever they were! And he--he was alone, and unarmed, and far from any help; and the night was closing in.\nThen the pattering began.\n\nHe thought it was only falling leaves at first, so slight and delicate was the sound of it. Then as it grew it took a regular rhythm, and he knew it for nothing else but the pat-pat-pat of little feet still a very long way off. Was it in front or behind? It seemed to be first one, and then the other, then both. It grew and it multiplied, till from every quarter as he listened anxiously, leaning this way and that, it seemed to be closing in on him. As he stood still to hearken, a rabbit came running hard towards him through the trees. He waited, expecting it to slacken pace, or to swerve from him into a different course. Instead, the animal almost brushed him as it dashed past, his face set and hard, his eyes staring. 'Get out of this, you fool, get out!' the Mole heard him mutter as he swung round a stump and disappeared down a friendly burrow.\n\nThe pattering increased till it sounded like sudden hail on the dry leaf-carpet spread around him. The whole wood seemed running now, running hard, hunting, chasing, closing in round something or--somebody? In panic, he began to run too, aimlessly, he knew not whither. He ran up against things, he fell over things and into things, he darted under things and dodged round things. At last he took refuge in the deep dark hollow of an old beech tree, which offered shelter, concealment--perhaps even safety, but who could tell? Anyhow, he was too tired to run any further, and could only snuggle down into the dry leaves which had drifted into the hollow and hope he was safe for a time. And as he lay there panting and trembling, and listened to the whistlings and the patterings outside, he knew it at last, in all its fullness, that dread thing which other little dwellers in field and hedgerow had encountered here, and known as their darkest moment--that thing which the Rat had vainly tried to shield him from--the Terror of the Wild Wood!\n\nMeantime the Rat, warm and comfortable, dozed by his fireside. His paper of half-finished verses slipped from his knee, his head fell back, his mouth opened, and he wandered by the verdant banks of dream-rivers. Then a coal slipped, the fire crackled and sent up a spurt of flame, and he woke with a start. Remembering what he had been engaged upon, he reached down to the floor for his verses, pored over them for a minute, and then looked round for the Mole to ask him if he knew a good rhyme for something or other.\n\nBut the Mole was not there.\n\nHe listened for a time. The house seemed very quiet.\n\nThen he called 'Moly!' several times, and, receiving no answer, got up and went out into the hall.\n\nThe Mole's cap was missing from its accustomed peg. His goloshes, which always lay by the umbrella-stand, were also gone.\n\nThe Rat left the house, and carefully examined the muddy surface of the ground outside, hoping to find the Mole's tracks. There they were, sure enough. The goloshes were new, just bought for the winter, and the pimples on their soles were fresh and sharp. He could see the imprints of them in the mud, running along straight and purposeful, leading direct to the Wild Wood.\n\nThe Rat looked very grave, and stood in deep thought for a minute or two. Then he re-entered the house, strapped a belt round his waist, shoved a brace of pistols into it, took up a stout cudgel that stood in a corner of the hall, and set off for the Wild Wood at a smart pace.\n\nIt was already getting towards dusk when he reached the first fringe of trees and plunged without hesitation into the wood, looking anxiously on either side for any sign of his friend. Here and there wicked little faces popped out of holes, but vanished immediately at sight of the valorous animal, his pistols, and the great ugly cudgel in his grasp; and the whistling and pattering, which he had heard quite plainly on his first entry, died away and ceased, and all was very still. He made his way manfully through the length of the wood, to its furthest edge; then, forsaking all paths, he set himself to traverse it, laboriously working over the whole ground, and all the time calling out cheerfully, 'Moly, Moly, Moly! Where are you? It's me--it's old Rat!'\n\nHe had patiently hunted through the wood for an hour or more, when at last to his joy he heard a little answering cry. Guiding himself by the sound, he made his way through the gathering darkness to the foot of an old beech tree, with a hole in it, and from out of the hole came a feeble voice, saying 'Ratty! Is that really you?'\n\nThe Rat crept into the hollow, and there he found the Mole, exhausted and still trembling. 'O Rat!' he cried, 'I've been so frightened, you can't think!'\n'O, I quite understand,' said the Rat soothingly. 'You shouldn't really have gone and done it, Mole. I did my best to keep you from it. We river-bankers, we hardly ever come here by ourselves. If we have to come, we come in couples, at least; then we're generally all right. Besides, there are a hundred things one has to know, which we understand all about and you don't, as yet. I mean passwords, and signs, and sayings which have power and effect, and plants you carry in your pocket, and verses you repeat, and dodges and tricks you practise; all simple enough when you know them, but they've got to be known if you're small, or you'll find yourself in trouble. Of course if you were Badger or Otter, it would be quite another matter.'\n\n'Surely the brave Mr. Toad wouldn't mind coming here by himself, would he?' inquired the Mole.\n\n'Old Toad?' said the Rat, laughing heartily. 'He wouldn't show his face here alone, not for a whole hatful of golden guineas, Toad wouldn't.'\n\nThe Mole was greatly cheered by the sound of the Rat's careless laughter, as well as by the sight of his stick and his gleaming pistols, and he stopped shivering and began to feel bolder and more himself again.\n\n'Now then,' said the Rat presently, 'we really must pull ourselves together and make a start for home while there's still a little light left. It will never do to spend the night here, you understand. Too cold, for one thing.'\n\n'Dear Ratty,' said the poor Mole, 'I'm dreadfully sorry, but I'm simply dead beat and that's a solid fact. You MUST let me rest here a while longer, and get my strength back, if I'm to get home at all.'\n\n'O, all right,' said the good-natured Rat, 'rest away. It's pretty nearly pitch dark now, anyhow; and there ought to be a bit of a moon later.'\n\nSo the Mole got well into the dry leaves and stretched himself out, and presently dropped off into sleep, though of a broken and troubled sort; while the Rat covered himself up, too, as best he might, for warmth, and lay patiently waiting, with a pistol in his paw.\n\nWhen at last the Mole woke up, much refreshed and in his usual spirits, the Rat said, 'Now then! I'll just take a look outside and see if everything's quiet, and then we really must be off.'\n\nHe went to the entrance of their retreat and put his head out. Then the Mole heard him saying quietly to himself, 'Hullo! hullo! here--is--a--go!'\n\n'What's up, Ratty?' asked the Mole.\n\n'SNOW is up,' replied the Rat briefly; 'or rather, DOWN. It's snowing hard.'\n\nThe Mole came and crouched beside him, and, looking out, saw the wood that had been so dreadful to him in quite a changed aspect. Holes, hollows, pools, pitfalls, and other black menaces to the wayfarer were vanishing fast, and a gleaming carpet of faery was springing up everywhere, that looked too delicate to be trodden upon by rough feet. A fine powder filled the air and caressed the cheek with a tingle in its touch, and the black boles of the trees showed up in a light that seemed to come from below.\n\n'Well, well, it can't be helped,' said the Rat, after pondering. 'We must make a start, and take our chance, I suppose. The worst of it is, I don't exactly know where we are. And now this snow makes everything look so very different.'\n\nIt did indeed. The Mole would not have known that it was the same wood. However, they set out bravely, and took the line that seemed most promising, holding on to each other and pretending with invincible cheerfulness that they recognized an old friend in every fresh tree that grimly and silently greeted them, or saw openings, gaps, or paths with a familiar turn in them, in the monotony of white space and black tree-trunks that refused to vary.\n\nAn hour or two later--they had lost all count of time--they pulled up, dispirited, weary, and hopelessly at sea, and sat down on a fallen tree-trunk to recover their breath and consider what was to be done. They were aching with fatigue and bruised with tumbles; they had fallen into several holes and got wet through; the snow was getting so deep that they could hardly drag their little legs through it, and the trees were thicker and more like each other than ever. There seemed to be no end to this wood, and no beginning, and no difference in it, and, worst of all, no way out.\n\n'We can't sit here very long,' said the Rat. 'We shall have to make another push for it, and do something or other. The cold is too awful for anything, and the snow will soon be too deep for us to wade through.' He peered about him and considered. 'Look here,' he went on, 'this is what occurs to me. There's a sort of dell down here in front of us, where the ground seems all hilly and humpy and hummocky. We'll make our way down into that, and try and find some sort of shelter, a cave or hole with a dry floor to it, out of the snow and the wind, and there we'll have a good rest before we try again, for we're both of us pretty dead beat. Besides, the snow may leave off, or something may turn up.'\n\nSo once more they got on their feet, and struggled down into the dell, where they hunted about for a cave or some corner that was dry and a protection from the keen wind and the whirling snow. They were investigating one of the hummocky bits the Rat had spoken of, when suddenly the Mole tripped up and fell forward on his face with a squeal.\n\n'O my leg!' he cried. 'O my poor shin!' and he sat up on the snow and nursed his leg in both his front paws.\n\n'Poor old Mole!' said the Rat kindly.\n\n'You don't seem to be having much luck to-day, do you? Let's have a look at the leg. Yes,' he went on, going down on his knees to look, 'you've cut your shin, sure enough. Wait till I get at my handkerchief, and I'll tie it up for you.'\n\n'I must have tripped over a hidden branch or a stump,' said the Mole miserably. 'O, my! O, my!'\n\n'It's a very clean cut,' said the Rat, examining it again attentively. 'That was never done by a branch or a stump. Looks as if it was made by a sharp edge of something in metal. Funny!' He pondered awhile, and examined the humps and slopes that surrounded them.\n\n'Well, never mind what done it,' said the Mole, forgetting his grammar in his pain. 'It hurts just the same, whatever done it.'\n\nBut the Rat, after carefully tying up the leg with his handkerchief, had left him and was busy scraping in the snow. He scratched and shovelled and explored, all four legs working busily, while the Mole waited impatiently, remarking at intervals, 'O, COME on, Rat!'\n\nSuddenly the Rat cried 'Hooray!' and then 'Hooray-oo-ray-oo-ray-oo-ray!' and fell to executing a feeble jig in the snow.\n\n'What HAVE you found, Ratty?' asked the Mole, still nursing his leg.\n\n'Come and see!' said the delighted Rat, as he jigged on.\n\nThe Mole hobbled up to the spot and had a good look.\n\n'Well,' he said at last, slowly, 'I SEE it right enough. Seen the same sort of thing before, lots of times. Familiar object, I call it. A door-scraper! Well, what of it? Why dance jigs around a door-scraper?'\n\n'But don't you see what it MEANS, you--you dull-witted animal?' cried the Rat impatiently.\n\n'Of course I see what it means,' replied the Mole. 'It simply means that some VERY careless and forgetful person has left his door-scraper lying about in the middle of the Wild Wood, JUST where it's SURE to trip EVERYBODY up. Very thoughtless of him, I call it. When I get home I shall go and complain about it to--to somebody or other, see if I don't!'\n\n'O, dear! O, dear!' cried the Rat, in despair at his obtuseness. 'Here, stop arguing and come and scrape!' And he set to work again and made the snow fly in all directions around him.\n\nAfter some further toil his efforts were rewarded, and a very shabby door-mat lay exposed to view.\n\n'There, what did I tell you?' exclaimed the Rat in great triumph.\n\n'Absolutely nothing whatever,' replied the Mole, with perfect truthfulness. 'Well now,' he went on, 'you seem to have found another piece of domestic litter, done for and thrown away, and I suppose you're perfectly happy. Better go ahead and dance your jig round that if you've got to, and get it over, and then perhaps we can go on and not waste any more time over rubbish-heaps. Can we EAT a doormat? or sleep under a door-mat? Or sit on a door-mat and sledge home over the snow on it, you exasperating rodent?'\n\n'Do--you--mean--to--say,' cried the excited Rat, 'that this door-mat doesn't TELL you anything?'\n\n'Really, Rat,' said the Mole, quite pettishly, 'I think we'd had enough of this folly. Who ever heard of a door-mat TELLING anyone anything? They simply don't do it. They are not that sort at all. Door-mats know their place.'\n\n'Now look here, you--you thick-headed beast,' replied the Rat, really angry, 'this must stop. Not another word, but scrape--scrape and scratch and dig and hunt round, especially on the sides of the hummocks, if you want to sleep dry and warm to-night, for it's our last chance!'\n\nThe Rat attacked a snow-bank beside them with ardour, probing with his cudgel everywhere and then digging with fury; and the Mole scraped busily too, more to oblige the Rat than for any other reason, for his opinion was that his friend was getting light-headed.\n\nSome ten minutes' hard work, and the point of the Rat's cudgel struck something that sounded hollow. He worked till he could get a paw through and feel; then called the Mole to come and help him. Hard at it went the two animals, till at last the result of their labours stood full in view of the astonished and hitherto incredulous Mole.\n\nIn the side of what had seemed to be a snow-bank stood a solid-looking little door, painted a dark green. An iron bell-pull hung by the side, and below it, on a small brass plate, neatly engraved in square capital letters, they could read by the aid of moonlight MR. BADGER.\n\nThe Mole fell backwards on the snow from sheer surprise and delight. 'Rat!' he cried in penitence, 'you're a wonder! A real wonder, that's what you are. I see it all now! You argued it out, step by step, in that wise head of yours, from the very moment that I fell and cut my shin, and you looked at the cut, and at once your majestic mind said to itself, \"Door-scraper!\" And then you turned to and found the very door-scraper that done it! Did you stop there? No. Some people would have been quite satisfied; but not you. Your intellect went on working. \"Let me only just find a door-mat,\" says you to yourself, \"and my theory is proved!\" And of course you found your door-mat. You're so clever, I believe you could find anything you liked. \"Now,\" says you, \"that door exists, as plain as if I saw it. There's nothing else remains to be done but to find it!\" Well, I've read about that sort of thing in books, but I've never come across it before in real life. You ought to go where you'll be properly appreciated. You're simply wasted here, among us fellows. If I only had your head, Ratty----'\n\n'But as you haven't,' interrupted the Rat, rather unkindly, 'I suppose you're going to sit on the snow all night and TALK? Get up at once and hang on to that bell-pull you see there, and ring hard, as hard as you can, while I hammer!'\n\nWhile the Rat attacked the door with his stick, the Mole sprang up at the bell-pull,

The Brook LyricsI told the brook that runs down through the valley\nA secret my best friend never knew\nThe brook told the trees and the trees told the breeze\nThat I was in love with you\n\nThe trees told the flowers hiding there by the hilltop\nThe clouds told the moon that shone above\nSo angry, yet blue, when they found out that you\nAnd your heart had another love\n\nThe brook became angry and changed to a river\nRushing so madly along\nThe soft summer breeze that played tag with the trees\nBecame so wild and so strong\nThe bashful, white flowers hiding there by the hilltop\nGrew dark when the rain came pouring down\nTheir hearts couldn't hide all the tears that were cried\nAnd had carpeted on the ground\n\nThe storm passed, gone over, there's sunshine again\nThe chains that held me are now gone\nThe trees wave, hello, as I stand here below\nAnd the brook sings the sweetest song\n\nThe bashful, white flowers are again by the hilltop\nThe sun and the moon are still my friends\nI promise there'll be no more heartaches for me\nTill I fall in love againYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/462323", "artist_names": "Marcel

CHAPTER ONE\n\nNAMES OF PEOPLE: THE DUCHESSE DE GUERMANTES \u2014 SAINT-LOUP AT DONCI\u00c8RES \u2014 MME. DE VILLEPARISIS AT HOME \u2014 MY GRANDMOTHER\u2019S ILLNESS \u2014 BERGOTTE\u2019S ILLNESS \u2014 THE DUKE AND THE DOCTOR \u2014 DECLINE AND DEATH OF MY GRANDMOTHER\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The twittering of the birds at daybreak sounded insipid to Fran\u00e7oise. Every word uttered by the maids upstairs made her jump; disturbed by all their running about, she kept asking herself what they could be doing. In other words, we had moved. Certainly the servants had made no less noise in the attics of our old home; but she knew them, she had made of their comings and goings familiar events. Now she faced even silence with a strained attention. And as our new neighbourhood appeared to be as quiet as the boulevard on to which we had hitherto looked had been noisy, the song (distinct at a distance, when it was still quite faint, like an orchestralmotif) of a passer-by brought tears to the eyes of a Fran\u00e7oise in exile. And so if I had been tempted to laugh at her in her misery at having to leave a house in which she was \u2018so well respected on all sides\u2019 and had packed her trunks with tears, according to the Use of Combray, declaring superior to all possible houses that which had been ours, on the other hand I, who found it as hard to assimilate new as I found it easy to abandon old conditions, I felt myself drawn towards our old servant when I saw that this installation of herself in a building where she had not received from the hall-porter, who did not yet know us, the marks of respect necessary to her moral wellbeing, had brought her positively to the verge of dissolution. She alone could understand what I was feeling; certainly her young footman was not the person to do so; for him, who was as unlike the Combray type as it was possible to conceive, packing up, moving, living in another district, were all like taking a holiday in which the novelty of one\u2019s surroundings gave one the same sense of refreshment as if one had actually travelled; he thought he was in the country; and a cold in the head afforded him, as though he had been sitting in a draughty railway carriage, the delicious sensation of having seen the world; at each fresh sneeze he rejoiced that he had found so smart a place, having always longed to be with people who travelled a lot. And so, without giving him a thought, I went straight to Fran\u00e7oise, who, in return for my having laughed at her tears over a removal which had left me cold, now shewed an icy indifference to my sorrow, but because she shared it. The \u2018sensibility\u2019 claimed by neurotic people is matched by their egotism; they cannot abide the flaunting by others of the sufferings to which they pay an ever increasing attention in themselves. Fran\u00e7oise, who would not allow the least of her own ailments to pass unnoticed, if I were in pain would turn her head from me so that I should not have the satisfaction of seeing my sufferings pitied, or so much as observed. It was the same as soon as I tried to speak to her about our new house. Moreover, having been obliged, a day or two later, to return to the house we had just left, to retrieve some clothes which had been overlooked in our removal, while I, as a result of it, had still a \u2018temperature,\u2019 and like a boa constrictor that has just swallowed an ox felt myself painfully distended by the sight of a long trunk which my eyes had still to digest, Fran\u00e7oise, with true feminine inconstancy, came back saying that she had really thought she would stifle on our old boulevard, it was so stuffy, that she had found it quite a day\u2019s journey to get there, that never had she seen such stairs, that she would not go back to live there for a king\u2019s ransom, not if you were to offer her millions \u2014 a pure hypothesis \u2014 and that everything (everything, that is to say, to do with the kitchen and \u2018usual offices\u2019) was much better fitted up in the new house. Which, it is high time now that the reader should be told \u2014 and told also that we had moved into it because my grandmother, not having been at all well (though we took care to keep this reason from her), was in need of better air \u2014 was a flat forming part of the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the age when a Name, offering us an image of the unknowable which we have poured into its mould, while at the same moment it connotes for us also an existing place, forces us accordingly to identify one with the other to such a point that we set out to seek in a city for a soul which it cannot embody but which we have no longer the power to expel from the sound of its name, it is not only to towns and rivers that names give an individuality, as do allegorical paintings, it is not only the physical universe which they pattern with differences, people with marvels, there is the social universe also; and so every historic house, in town or country, has its lady or its fairy, as every forest has its spirit, as there is a nymph for every stream. Sometimes, hidden in the heart of its name, the fairy is transformed to suit the life of our imagination by which she lives; thus it was that the atmosphere in which Mme. de Guermantes existed in me, after having been for years no more than the shadow cast by a magic lantern slide or the light falling through a painted window, began to let its colours fade when quite other dreams impregnated it with the bubbling coolness of her flowing streams\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet the fairy must perish if we come in contact with the real person to whom her name corresponds, for that person the name then begins to reflect, and she has in her nothing of the fairy; the fairy may revive if we remove ourself from the person, but if we remain in her presence the fairy definitely dies and with her the name, as happened to the family of Lusignan, which was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy M\u00e9lusine should disappear. Then the Name, beneath our successive \u2018restorations\u2019 of which we may end by finding, as their original, the beautiful portrait of a strange lady whom we are never to meet, is nothing more than the mere photograph, for identification, to which we refer in order to decide whether we know, whether or not we ought to bow to a person who passes us in the street. But let a sensation from a bygone year \u2014 like those recording instruments which preserve the sound and the manner of the various artists who have sung or played into them \u2014 enable our memory to make us hear that name with the particular ring with which it then sounded in our ears, then, while the name itself has apparently not changed, we feel the distance that separates the dreams which at different times its same syllables have meant to us. For a moment, from the clear echo of its warbling in some distant spring, we can extract, as from the little tubes which we use in painting, the exact, forgotten, mysterious, fresh tint of the days which we had believed ourself to be recalling, when, like a bad painter, we were giving to the whole of our past, spread out on the same canvas, the tones, conventional and all alike, of our unprompted memory. Whereas on the contrary, each of the moments that composed it employed, for an original creation, in a matchless harmony, the colour of those days which we no longer know, and which, for that matter, will still suddenly enrapture me if by any chance the name \u2018Guermantes,\u2019 resuming for a moment, after all these years, the sound, so different from its sound to-day, which it had for me on the day of Mile. Percepied\u2019s marriage, brings back to me that mauve \u2014 so delicate, almost too bright, too new \u2014 with which the billowy scarf of the young Duchess glowed, and, like two periwinkle flowers, growing beyond reach and blossoming now again, her two eyes, sunlit with an azure smile. And the name Guermantes of those days is also like one of those little balloons which have been filled wilh oxygen, or some such gas; when I come to explode it, to make it emit what it contains, I breathe the air of the Combray of that year, of that day, mingled with a fragrance of hawthorn blossom blown by the wind from the corner of the square, harbinger of rain, which now sent the sun packing, now let him spread himself over the red woollen carpet to the sacristy, steeping it in a bright geranium scarlet, with that, so to speak, Wagnerian harmony in its gaiety which makes the wedding service always impressive. But even apart from rare moments such as these, in which suddenly we feel the original entity quiver and resume its form, carve itself out of the syllables now soundless, dead; if, in the giddy rush of daily life, in which they serve only the most practical purposes, names have lost all their colour, like a prismatic top that spins too quickly and seems only grey, when, on the other hand, in our musings we reflect, we seek, so as to return to the past, to slacken, to suspend the perpetual motion by which we are borne alcng, gradually we see once more appear, side by side, but entirely distinct from one another, the tints which in the course of our existence have been successively presented to us by a single name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What form was assumed in my mind by this name Guermantes when my first nurse \u2014 knowing no more, probably, than I know to-day in whose honour it had been composed \u2014 sang me to sleep with that old ditty, Gloire \u00e0 la Marquise de Guermantes, or when, some years later, the veteran Mar\u00e9chal de Guermantes, making my nursery-maid\u2019s bosom swell with pride, stopped in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es to remark: \u201cA fine child that!\u201d and gave me a chocolate drop from his comfit-box, I cannot, of course, now say. Those years of my earliest childhood are no longer a part of myself; they are external to me; I can learn nothing of them save as we learn things that happened before we were born \u2014 from the accounts given me by other people. But more recently I find in the period of that name\u2019s occupation of me seven or eight different shapes which it has successively assumed; the earliest were the most beautiful; gradually my musings, forced by reality to abandon a position that was no longer tenable, established themselves anew in one slightly less advanced until they were obliged to retire still farther. And, with Mme. de Guermantes, was transformed simultaneously her dwelling, itself also the offspring of that name, fertilised from year to year by some word or other that came to my ears and modulated the tone of my musings; that dwelling of hers reflected them in its very stones, which had turned to mirrors, like the surface of a cloud or of a lake. A dungeon keep without mass, no more indeed than a band of orange light from the summit of which the lord and his lady dealt out life and death to their vassals, had given place \u2014 right at the end of that \u2018Guermantes way\u2019 along which, on so many summer afternoons, I retraced with my parents the course of the Vivonne \u2014 to that land of bubbling streams where the Duchess taught me to fish for trout and to know the names of the flowers whose red and purple clusters adorned the walls of the neighbouring gardens; then it had been the ancient heritage, famous in song and story, from which the proud race of Guermantes, like a carved and mellow tower that traverses the ages, had risen already over France when the sky was still empty at those points where, later, were to rise Notre Dame of Paris and Notre Dame of Chartres, when on the summit of the hill of Laon the nave of its cathedral had not yet been poised, like the Ark of the Deluge on the summit of Mount Ararat, crowded with Patriarchs and Judges anxiously leaning from its windows to see whether the wrath of God were yet appeased, carrying with it the types of the vegetation that was to multiply on the earth, brimming over with animals which have escaped even by the towers, where oxen grazing calmly upon the roof look down over the plains of Champagne; when the traveller who left Beauvais at the close of day did not yet see, following him and turning with his road, outspread against the gilded screen of the western sky, the black, ribbed wings of the cathedral. It was, this \u2018Guermantes,\u2019 like the scene of a novel, an imaginary landscape which I could with difficulty picture to myself and longed all the more to discover, set in the midst of real lands and roads which all of a sudden would become alive with heraldic details, within a few miles of a railway station; I recalled the names of the places round it as if they had been situated at the foot of Parnassus or of Helicon, and they seemed precious to me, as the physical conditions \u2014 in the realm of topographical science \u2014 required for the production of an unaccountable phenomenon. I saw again the escutcheons blazoned beneath the windows of Combray church; their quarters filled, century after century, with all the lordships which, by marriage or conquest, this illustrious house had brought flying to it from all the corners of Germany, Italy and France; vast territories in the North, strong cities in the South, assembled there to group themselves in Guermantes, and, losing their material quality, to inscribe allegorically their dungeon vert, or castle triple-towered argent upon its azure field. I had heard of the famous tapestries of Guermantes, I could see them, mediaeval and blue, a trifle coarse, detach themselves like a floating cloud from the legendary, amaranthine name at the foot of the ancient forest in which Childebert went so often hunting; and this delicate, mysterious background of their lands, this vista of the ages, it seemed to me that, as effectively as by journeying to see them, I might penetrate all their secrets simply by coming in contact for a moment in Paris with Mme. de Guermantes, the princess paramount of the place and lady of the lake, as if her face, her speech must possess the local charm of forest groves and streams, and the same secular peculiarities as the old customs recorded in her archives. But then I had met Saint-Loup; he had told me that the castle had borne the name of Guermantes only since the seventeenth century, when that family had acquired it. They had lived, until then, in the neighbourhood, but their title was not taken from those parts. The village of Guermantes had received its name from the castle round which it had been built, and so that it should not destroy the view from the castle, a servitude, still in force, traced the line of its streets and limited the height of its houses. As for the tapestries, they were by Boucher, bought in the nineteenth century by a Guermantes with a taste for the arts, and hung, interspersed with a number of sporting pictures of no merit which he himself had painted, in a hideous drawing-room upholstered in \u2018adrianople\u2019 and plush. By these revelations Saint-Loup had introduced into the castle elements foreign to the name of Guermantes which made it impossible for me to continue to extract solely from the resonance of the syllables the stone and mortar of its walls. And so, in the heart of the name, was effaced the castle mirrored in its lake, and what now became apparent to me, surrounding Mme. de Guermantes as her dwelling, had been her house in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes, limpid like its name, for no material and opaque element intervened to interrupt and blind its transparence. As the word church signifies not only the temple but the assembly of the faithful also, this H\u00f4tel de Guermantes comprised all those who shared the life of the Duchess, but these intimates on whom I had never set eyes were for me only famous and poetic names, and knowing exclusively persons who themselves also were names only, did but enhance and protect the mystery of the Duchess by extending all round her a vast halo which at the most declined in brilliance as its circumference increased\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the parties which she gave, since I could not imagine the guests as having any bodies, any moustaches, any boots, as making any utterances that were commonplace, or even original in a human and rational way, this whirlpool of names, introducing less material substance than would a phantom banquet or a spectral ball, round that statuette in Dresden china which was Madame de Guermantes, kept for her palace of glass the transparence of a showcase. Then, after Saint-Loup had told me various anecdotes about his cousin\u2019s chaplain, her gardener, and the rest, the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes had become \u2014 as the Louvre might have been in days gone by \u2014 a kind of castle, surrounded, in the very heart of Paris, by its own domains, acquired by inheritance, by virtue of an ancient right that had quaintly survived, over which she still enjoyed feudal privileges. But this last dwelling itself vanished when we had come to live beside Mme. de Villeparisis in one of the flats adjoining that occupied by Mme. de Guermantes in a wing of the H\u00f4tel. It was one of those old town houses, a few of which are perhaps still to be found, in which the court of honour \u2014 whether they were alluvial deposits washed there by the rising tide of democracy, or a legacy from a more primitive time when the different trades were clustered round the overlord \u2014 is flanked by little shops and workrooms, a shoemaker\u2019s, for instance, or a tailor\u2019s, such as we see nestling between the buttresses of those cathedrals which the aesthetic zeal of the restorer has not swept clear of such accretions; a porter who also does cobbling, keeps hens, grows flowers, and, at the far end, in the main building, a \u2018Comtesse\u2019 who, when she drives out in her old carriage and pair, flaunting on her hat a few nasturtiums which seem to have escaped from the plot by the porter\u2019s lodge (with, by the coachman\u2019s side on the box, a footman who gets down to leave cards at every aristocratic mansion in the neighbourhood), scatters vague little smiles and waves her hand in greeting to the porter\u2019s children and to such of her respectable fellow-tenants as may happen to be passing, who, to her contemptuous affability and levelling pride, seem all the same\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the house in which we had now come to live, the great lady at the end of the courtyard was a Duchess, smart and still quite young. She was, in fact, Mme. de Guermantes and, thanks to Fran\u00e7oise, I soon came to know all about her household. For the Guermantes (to whom Fran\u00e7oise regularly alluded as the people \u2018below,\u2019 or \u2018downstairs\u2019) were her constant preoccupation from the first thing in the morning when, as she did Mamma\u2019s hair, casting a forbidden, irresistible, furtive glance down into the courtyard, she would say: \u201cLook at that, now; a pair of holy Sisters; that\u2019ll be for downstairs, surely;\u201d or, \u201cOh! just look at the fine pheasants in the kitchen window; no need to ask where they came from, the Duke will have been out with his gun!\u201d\u2014 until the last thing at night when, if her ear, while she was putting out my night-things, caught a few notes of a song, she would conclude: \u201cThey\u2019re having company down below; gay doings, I\u2019ll be bound;\u201d whereupon, in her symmetrical face, beneath the arch of her now snow-white hair, a smile from her young days, sprightly but proper, would for a moment set each of her features in its place, arranging them in an intricate and special order, as though for a country-dance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the moment in the life of the Guermantes which excited the keenest interest in Fran\u00e7oise, gave her the most complete satisfaction and at the same time the sharpest annoyance was that at which, the two halves of the great gate having been thrust apart, the Duchess stepped into her carriage. It was generally a little while after our servants had finished the celebration of that sort of solemn passover which none might disturb, called their midday dinner, during which they were so far taboo that my father himself was not allowed to ring for them, knowing moreover that none of them would have paid any more attention to the fifth peal than to the first, and that the discourtesy would therefore have been a pure waste of time and trouble, though not without trouble in store for himself. For Fran\u00e7oise (who, in her old age, lost no opportunity of standing upon her dignity) would without fail have presented him, for the rest of the day, with a face covered with the tiny red cuneiform hieroglyphs by which she made visible \u2014 though by no means legible \u2014 to the outer world the long tale of her griefs and the profound reasons for her dissatisfactions. She would enlarge upon them, too, in a running \u2018aside,\u2019 but not so that we could catch her words. She called this practice \u2014 which, she imagined, must be infuriating, \u2018mortifying\u2019 as she herself put it,\u2018vexing\u2019 to us \u2014\u2018saying low masses all the blessed day.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The last rites accomplished, Fran\u00e7oise, who was at one and the same time, as in the primitive church, the celebrant and one of the faithful, helped herself to a final glass, undid the napkin from her throat, folded it after wiping from her lips a stain of watered wine and coffee, slipped it into its ring, turned a doleful eye to thank \u2018her\u2019 young footman who, to shew his zeal in her service, was saying: \u201cCome, ma\u2019am, a drop more of the grape; it\u2019s d\u2019licious to-day,\u201d and went straight across to the window, which she flung open, protesting that it was too hot to breathe in \u2018this wretched kitchen.\u2019 Dexterously casting, as she turned the latch and let in the fresh air, a glance of studied indifference into the courtyard below, she furtively elicited the conclusion that the Duchess was not ready yet to start, brooded for a moment with contemptuous, impassioned eyes over the waiting carriage, and, this meed of attention once paid to the things of the earth, raised them towards the heavens, whose purity she had already divined from the sweetness of the air and the warmth of the sun; and let them rest on a corner of the roof, at the place where, every spring, there came and built, immediately over the chimney of my bedroom, a pair of pigeons like those she used to hear cooing from her kitchen at Combray\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Combray, Combray!\u201d she cried. And the almost singing tone in which she declaimed this invocation might, taken with the Arlesian purity of her features, have made the onlooker suspect her of a Southern origin and that the lost land which she was lamenting was no more, really, than a land of adoption. If so, he would have been wrong, for it seems that there is no province that has not its own South-country; do we not indeed constantly meet Savoyards and Bretons in whose speech we find all those pleasing transpositions of longs and shorts that are characteristic of the Southerner? \u201cAh, Combray, when shall I look on thee again, poor land! When shall I pass the blessed day among thy hawthorns, under our own poor lily-oaks, hearing the grasshoppers sing, and the Vivonne making a little noise like someone whispering, instead of that wretched bell from our young master, who can never stay still for half an hour on end without having me run the length of that wicked corridor. And even then he makes out I don\u2019t come quick enough; you\u2019d need to hear the bell ring before he has pulled it, and if you\u2019re a minute late, away he flies into the most towering rage. Alas, poor Combray; maybe I shall see thee only in death, when they drop me like a stone into the hollow of the tomb. And so, nevermore shall I smell thy lovely hawthorns, so white and all. But in the sleep of death I dare say I shall still hear those three peals of the bell which will have driven me to damnation in this world.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her soliloquy was interrupted by the voice of the waistcoat-maker downstairs, the same who had so delighted my grandmother once, long ago, when she had gone to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis, and now occupied no less exalted a place in Franchise\u2019s affections. Having raised his head when he heard our window open, he had already been trying for some time to attract his neighbour\u2019s attention, in order to bid her good day. The coquetry of the young girl that Fran\u00e7oise had once been softened and refined for M. Jupien the querulous face of our old cook, dulled by age, ill-temper and the heat of the kitchen fire, and it was with a charming blend of reserve, familiarity and modesty that she bestowed a gracious salutation on the waistcoat-maker, but without making any audible response, for if she did infringe Mamma\u2019s orders by looking into the courtyard, she would never have dared to go the length of talking from the window, which would have been quite enough (according to her) to bring down on her \u2018a whole chapter\u2019 from the Mistress. She pointed to the waiting carriage, as who should say: \u201cA fine pair, eh!\u201d though what she actually muttered was: \u201cWhat an old rattle-trap!\u201d but principally because she knew that he would be bound to answer, putting his hand to his lips so as to be audible without having to shout:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou could have one too if you liked, as good as they have and better, I dare say, only you don\u2019t care for that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Franoise, after a modest, evasive signal of delight, the meaning of which was, more or less: \u201cTastes differ, you know; simplicity\u2019s the rule in this house,\u201d shut the window again in case Mamma should come in. These \u2018you\u2019 who might have had more horses than the Guermantes were ourselves, but Jupien was right in saying \u2018you\u2019 since, except for a few purely personal gratifications, such as, when she coughed all day long without ceasing and everyone in the house was afraid of catching her cold, that of pretending, with an irritating little titter, that she had not got a cold, like those plants that an animal to which they are wholly attached keeps alive with food which it catches, eats and digests for them and of which it offers them the ultimate and easily assimilable residue, Fran\u00e7oise lived with us in full community; it was we who, with our virtues, our wealth, our style of living, must take on ourselves the task of concocting those little sops to her vanity out of which was formed \u2014 with the addition of the recognised rights of freely practising the cult of the midday dinner according to the traditional custom, which included a mouthful of air at the window when the meal was finished, a certain amount of loitering in the street when she went out to do her marketing, and a holiday on Sundays when she paid a visit to her niece \u2014 the portion of happiness indispensable to her existence. And so it can be understood that Fran\u00e7oise might well have succumbed in those first days of our migration, a victim, in a house where my father\u2019s claims to distinction were not yet known, to a malady which she herself called \u2018wearying,\u2019 wearying in the active sense in which the word ennui is employed by Corneille, or in the last letters of soldiers who end by taking their own lives because they are wearying for their girls or for their native villages. Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s wearying had soon been cured by none other than Jupien, for he at once procured her a pleasure no less keen, indeed more refined than she would have felt if we had decided to keep a carriage. \u201cVery good class, those Juliens,\u201d (for Fran\u00e7oise readily assimilated new names to those with which she was already familiar) \u201cvery worthy people; you can see it written on their faces.\u201d Jupien was in fact able to understand, and to inform the world that if we did not keep a carriage it was because we had no wish for one. This new friend of Fran\u00e7oise was very little at home, having obtained a post in one of the Government offices. A waistcoat-maker first of all, with the \u2018chit of a girl\u2019 whom my grandmother had taken for his daughter, he had lost all interest in the exercise of that calling after his assistant (who, when still little more than a child, had shewn great skill in darning a torn skirt, that day when my grandmother had gone to call on Mme. de Villeparisis) had turned to ladies\u2019 fashions and become a seamstress. A prentice hand, to begin with, in a dressmaker\u2019s workroom, set to stitch a seam, to fasten a flounce, to sew on a button or to press a crease, to fix a waistband with hooks and eyes, she had quickly risen to be second and then chief assistant, and having formed a connexion of her own among ladies of fashion now worked at home, that is to say in our courtyard, generally with one or two of her young friends from the workroom, whom she had taken on as apprentices. After this, Jupien\u2019s presence in the place had ceased to matter. No doubt the little girl (a big girl by this time) had often to cut out waistcoats still. But with her friends to assist her she needed no one besides. And so Jupien, her uncle, had sought employment outside. He was free at first to return home at midday, then, when he had definitely succeeded the man whose substitute only he had begun by being, not before dinner-time. His appointment to the \u2018regular establishment\u2019 was, fortunately, not announced until some weeks after our arrival, so that his courtesy could be brought to bear on her long enough to help Fran\u00e7oise to pass through the first, most difficult phase without undue suffering. At the same time, and without underrating his value to Fran\u00e7oise as, so to speak, a sedative during the period of transition, I am bound to say that my first impression of Jupien had been far from favourable. At a little distance, entirely ruining the effect that his plump cheeks and vivid colouring would otherwise have produced, his eyes, brimming with a compassionate, mournful, dreamy gaze, led one to suppose that he was seriously ill or had just suffered a great bereavement. Not only was he nothing of the sort, but as soon as he opened his mouth (and his speech, by the way, was perfect) he was quite markedly cynical and cold. There resulted from this discord between eyes and lips a certain falsity which was not attractive, and by which he had himself the air of being made as uncomfortable as a guest who arrives in morning dress at a party where everyone else is in evening dress, or as a commoner who having to speak to a Royal Personage does not know exactly how he ought to address him and gets round the difficulty by cutting down his remarks to almost nothing. Jupien\u2019s (here the comparison ends) were, on the contrary, charming. Indeed, corresponding possibly to this overflowing of his face by his eyes (which one ceased to notice when one came to know him), I soon discerned in him a rare intellect, and one of the most spontaneously literary that it has been my privilege to come across, in the sense that, probably without education, he possessed or had assimilated, with the help only of a few books skimmed in early life, the most ingenious turns of speech. The most gifted people that I had known had died young. And so I was convinced that Jupien\u2019s life would soon be cut short. Kindness was among his qualities, and pity, the most delicate and the most generous feelings for others. But his part in the life of Fran\u00e7oise had soon ceased to be indispensable. She had learned to put up with understudies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, when a tradesman or servant came to our door with a parcel or message, while seeming to pay no attention and merely pointing vaguely to an empty chair, Fran\u00e7oise so skilfully put to the best advantage the few seconds that he spent in the kitchen, while he waited for Mamma\u2019s answer, that it was very seldom that the stranger went away without having ineradicably engraved upon his memory the conviction that, if we \u2018did not have\u2019 any particular thing, it was because we had \u2018no wish\u2019 for it. If she made such a point of other people\u2019s knowing that we \u2018had money\u2019 (for she knew nothing of what Saint-Loup used to call partitive articles, and said simply \u2018have money,\u2019 \u2018fetch water\u2019), of their realising that we were rich, it was not because riches with nothing else besides, riches without virtue, were in her eyes the supreme good in life; but virtue without riches was not her ideal either. Riches were for her, so to speak, a necessary condition of virtue, failing which virtue itself would lack both merit and charm. She distinguished so little between them that she had come in time to invest each with the other\u2019s attributes, to expect some material comfort from virtue, to discover something edifying in riches\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As soon as she had shut the window again, which she did quickly \u2014 otherwise Mamma would, it appeared, have heaped on her \u2018every conceivable insult\u2019\u2014 Fran\u00e7oise began with many groans and sighs to put straight the kitchen table\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere are some Guermantes who stay in the Rue de la Chaise,\u201d began my father\u2019s valet; \u201cI had a friend who used to be with them; he was their second coachman. And I know a fellow, not my old pal, but his brother-in-law, who did his time in the Army with one of the Baron de Guermantes\u2019s stud grooms. Does your mother know you\u2019re out?\u201d added the valet, who was in the habit, just as he used to hum the popular airs of the season, of peppering his conversation with all the latest witticisms\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise, with the tired eyes of an ageing woman, eyes which moreover saw everything from Combray, in a hazy distance, made out not the witticism that underlay the words, but that there must be something witty in them since they bore no relation to the rest of his speech and had been uttered with considerable emphasis by one whom she knew to be a joker. She smiled at him, therefore, with an air of benevolent bewilderment, as who should say: \u201cAlways the same, that Victor!\u201d And she was genuinely pleased, knowing that listening to smart sayings of this sort was akin \u2014 if remotely \u2014 to those reputable social pleasures for which, in every class of society, people make haste to dress themselves in their best and run the risk of catching cold. Furthermore, she believed the valet to be a friend after her own heart, for he never left off denouncing, with fierce indignation, the appalling measures which the Republic was about to enforce against the clergy. Fran\u00e7oise had not yet learned that our cruellest adversaries are not those who contradict and try to convince us, but those who magnify or invent reports which may make us unhappy, taking care not to include any appearance of justification, which might lessen our discomfort, and perhaps give us some slight regard for a party which they make a point of displaying to us, to complete our torment, as being at once terrible and triumphant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess must be connected with all that lot,\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, bringing the conversation back to the Guermantes of the Rue de la Chaise, as one plays a piece over again from the andante. \u201cI can\u2019t recall who it was told me that one of them had married a cousin of the Duke. It\u2019s the same kindred, anyway. Ay, they\u2019re a great family, the Guermantes!\u201d she added, in a tone of respect founding the greatness of the family at once on the number of its branches and the brilliance of its connexions, as Pascal founds the truth of Religion on Reason and on the Authority of the Scriptures. For since there was but the single word \u2018great\u2019 to express both meanings, it seemed to her that they formed a single idea, her vocabulary, like cut stones sometimes, shewing thus on certain of its facets a flaw which projected a ray of darkness into the recesses of her mind. \u201cI wonder now if it wouldn\u2019t be them that have their castle at Guermantes, not a score of miles from Combray; then they must be kin to their cousin at Algiers, too.\u201d My mother and I long asked ourselves who this cousin at Algiers could be until finally we discovered that Fran\u00e7oise meant by the name \u2018Algiers\u2019 the town of Angers. What is far off may be more familiar to us than what is quite near. Fran\u00e7oise, who knew the name \u2018Algiers\u2019 from some particularly unpleasant dates that used to be given us at the New Year, had never heard of Angers. Her language, like the French language itself, and especially that of place-names, was thickly strewn with errors. \u201cI meant to talk to their butler about it. What is it again you call him?\u201d she interrupted herself as though putting a formal question as to the correct procedure, which she went on to answer with: \u201cOh, of course, it\u2019s Antoine you call him!\u201d as though Antoine had been a title. \u201cHe\u2019s the one who could tell me, but he\u2019s quite the gentleman, he is, a great scholar, you\u2019d say they\u2019d cut his tongue out, or that he\u2019d forgotten to learn to speak. He makes no response when you talk to him,\u201d went on Fran\u00e7oise, who used \u2018make response\u2019 in the same sense as Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, quite untruthfully, \u201cso long as I know what\u2019s boiling in my pot, I don\u2019t bother my head about what\u2019s in other people\u2019s. Whatever he is, he\u2019s not a Catholic. Besides, he\u2019s not a courageous man.\u201d (This criticism might have led one to suppose that Fran\u00e7oise had changed her mind about physical bravery which, according to her, in Combray days, lowered men to the level of wild beasts. But it was not so. \u2018Courageous\u2019 meant simply a hard worker.) \u201cThey do say, too, that he\u2019s thievish as a magpie, but it doesn\u2019t do to believe all one hears. The servants never stay long there because of the lodge; the porters are jealous and set the Duchess against them. But it\u2019s safe to say that he\u2019s a real twister, that Antoine, and his Antoinesse is no better,\u201d concluded Fran\u00e7oise, who, in furnishing the name \u2018Antoine\u2019 with a feminine ending that would designate the butler\u2019s wife, was inspired, no doubt, in her act of word-formation by an unconscious memory of the words chanoine and chanoinesse. If so, she was not far wrong. There is still a street near Notre-Dame called Rue Chanoinesse, a name which must have been given to it (since it was never inhabited by any but male Canons) by those Frenchmen of olden days of whom Fran\u00e7oise was, properly speaking, the contemporary. She proceeded, moreover, at once to furnish another example of this way of forming feminine endings, for she went on: \u201cBut one thing sure and certain is that it\u2019s the Duchess that has Guermantes Castle. And it\u2019s she that is the Lady Mayoress down in those parts. That\u2019s always something.\u201d\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can well believe that it is something,\u201d came with conviction from the footman, who had not detected the irony\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou think so, do you, my boy, you think it\u2019s something? Why, for folk like them to be Mayor and Mayoress, it\u2019s just thank you for nothing. Ah, if it was mine, that Guermantes Castle, you wouldn\u2019t see me setting foot in Paris, I can tell you. I\u2019m sure a family who\u2019ve got something to go on with, like Monsieur and Madame here, must have queer ideas to stay on in this wretched town rather than get away down to Combray the moment they\u2019re free to start, and no one hindering them. Why do they put off retiring? They\u2019ve got everything they want. Why wait till they\u2019re dead? Ah, if I had only a crust of dry bread to eat and a faggot to keep me warm in winter, a fine time I\u2019d have of it at home in my brother\u2019s poor old house at Combray. Down there you do feel you\u2019re alive; you haven\u2019t all these houses stuck up in front of you, there is so little noise at night-time, you can hear the frogs singing five miles off and more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat must indeed be fine!\u201d exclaimed the young footman with enthusiasm, as though this last attraction had been as peculiar to Combray as the gondola is to Venice. A more recent arrival in the household than my father\u2019s valet, he used to talk to Fran\u00e7oise about things which might interest not himself so much as her. And Fran\u00e7oise, whose face wrinkled up in disgust when she was treated as a mere cook, had for the young footman, who referred to her always as the \u2018housekeeper,\u2019 that peculiar tenderness which Princes not of the blood royal feel towards the well-meaning young men who dignify them with a \u2018Highness.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt any rate one knows what one\u2019s about, there, and what time of year it is. It isn\u2019t like here where you won\u2019t find one wretched buttercup flowering at holy Easter any more than you would at Christmas, and I can\u2019t hear so much as the tiniest ang\u00e9lus ring when I lift my old bones out of bed in the morning. Down there, you can hear every hour; there\u2019s only the one poor bell, but you say to yourself: \u2018My brother will be coming in from the field now,\u2019 and you watch the daylight fade, and the bell rings to bless the fruits of the earth, and you have time to take a turn before you light the lamp. But here it\u2019s daytime and it\u2019s nighttime, and you go to bed, and you can\u2019t say any more than the dumb beasts what you\u2019ve been about all day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI gather M\u00e9s\u00e9glise is a fine place, too, Madame,\u201d broke in the young footman, who found that the conversation was becoming a little too abstract for his liking, and happened to remember having heard us, at table, mention M\u00e9s\u00e9glise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, is it?\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise with the broad smile which one could always bring to her lips by uttering any of those names \u2014 M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, Combray, Tansonville. They were so intimate a part of her life that she felt, on meeting them outside it, on hearing them used in conversation, a hilarity more or less akin to that which a professor excites in his class by making an allusion to some contemporary personage whose name the students had never supposed could possibly greet their ears from the height of the academic chair. Her pleasure arose also from the feeling that these places were something to her which they were not for the rest of the world, old companions with whom one has shared many delights; and she smiled at them as if she found in them something witty, because she did find there a great part of herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, you may well say so, son, it is a pretty enough place is M\u00e9s\u00e9glise;\u201d she went on with a tinkling laugh, \u201cbut how did you ever come to hear tell of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow did I hear of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise? But it\u2019s a well-known place; people have told me about it \u2014 yes, over and over again,\u201d he assured her with that criminal inexactitude of the informer who, whenever we attempt to form an impartial estimate of the importance that a thing which matters to us may have for other people, makes it impossible for us to succeed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can tell you, it\u2019s better down there, under the cherry trees, than standing before the fire all day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to them even of Eulalie as a good person. For since Eulalie\u2019s death Fran\u00e7oise had completely forgotten that she had loved her as little in her lifetime as she loved every one whose cupboard was bare, who was dying of hunger, and after that came, like a good for nothing, thanks to the bounty of the rich, to \u2018put on airs.\u2019 It no longer pained her that Eulalie had so skilfully managed, Sunday after Sunday, to secure her \u2018trifle\u2019 from my aunt. As for the latter, Fran\u00e7oise never left off singing her praises\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut it was at Combray, surely, that you used to be, with a cousin of Madame?\u201d asked the young footman\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, with Mme. Octave \u2014 oh, a dear, good, holy woman, my poor friends, and a house where there was always enough and to spare, and all of the very best, a good woman, you may well say, who had no pity on the partridges, or the pheasants, or anything; you might turn up five to dinner or six, it was never the meat that was lacking, and of the first quality too, and white wine, and red wine, and everything you could wish.\u201d (Fran\u00e7oise used the word \u2018pity\u2019 in the sense given it by Labruy\u00e8re.) \u201cIt was she that paid the damages, always, even if the family stayed for months and years.\u201d (This reflection was not really a slur upon us, for Fran\u00e7oise belonged to an epoch when the words \u2018damages\u2019 was not restricted to a legal use and meant simply expense.) \u201cAh, I can tell you, people didn\u2019t go empty away from that house. As his reverence the Cur\u00e9 has told us, many\u2019s the time, if there ever was a woman who could count on going straight before the Throne of God, it was she. Poor Madame, I can hear her saying now, in the little voice she had: \u2018You know, Fran\u00e7oise, I can eat nothing myself, but I want it all to be just as nice for the others as if I could.\u2019 They weren\u2019t for her, the victuals, you may be quite sure. If you\u2019d only seen her, she weighed no more than a bag of cherries; there wasn\u2019t that much of her. She would never listen to a word I said, she would never send for the doctor. Ah, it wasn\u2019t in that house that you\u2019d have to gobble down your dinner. She liked her servants to be fed properly. Here, it\u2019s been just the same again to-day; we haven\u2019t had time for so much as to break a crust of bread; everything goes like ducks and drakes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What annoyed her more than anything were the rusks of pulled bread that my father used to eat. She was convinced that he had them simply to give himself airs and to keep her \u2018dancing.\u2019 \u201cI can tell you frankly,\u201d the young footman assured her, \u201cthat I never saw the like.\u201d He said it as if he had seen everything, and as if in him the range of a millennial experience extended over all countries and their customs, among which was not anywhere to be found a custom of eating pulled bread. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d the butler muttered, \u201cbut that will all be changed; the men are going on strike in Canada, and the Minister told Monsieur the other evening that he\u2019s clearing two hundred thousand francs out of it.\u201d There was no note of censure in his tone, not that he was not himself entirely honest, but since he regarded all politicians as unsound the crime of peculation seemed to him less serious than the pettiest larceny. He did not even stop to ask himself whether he had heard this historic utterance aright, and was not struck by the improbability that such a thing would have been admitted by the guilty party himself to my father without my father\u2019s immediately turning him out of the house. But the philosophy of Combray made it impossible for Fran\u00e7oise to expect that the strikes in Canada could have any repercussion on the use of pulled bread. \u201cSo long as the world goes round, look, there\u2019ll be masters to keep us on the trot, and servants to do their bidding.\u201d In disproof of this theory of perpetual motion, for the last quarter of an hour my mother (who probably did not employ the same measures of time as Fran\u00e7oise in reckoning the duration of the latter\u2019s dinner) had been saying:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat on earth can they be doing? They\u2019ve been at least two hours at their dinner.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she rang timidly three or four times. Fran\u00e7oise, \u2018her\u2019 footman, the butler, heard the bell ring, not as a summons to themselves, and with no thought of answering it, but rather like the first sounds of the instruments being tuned when the next part of a concert is just going to begin, and one knows that there will be only a few minutes more of interval. And so, when the peals were repeated and became more urgent, our servants began to pay attention, and, judging that they had not much time left and that the resumption of work was at hand, at a peal somewhat louder than the rest gave a collective sigh and went their several ways, the footman slipping downstairs to smoke a cigarette outside the door, Fran\u00e7oise, after a string of reflexions on ourselves, such as: \u201cThey\u2019ve got the jumps to-day, surely,\u201d going up to put her things tidy in her attic, while the butler, having supplied himself first with note-paper from my bedroom, polished off the arrears of his private correspondence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite the apparent stiffness of their butler, Fran\u00e7oise had been in a position, from the first, to inform me that the Guermantes occupied their mansion by virtue not of an immemorial right but of a quite recent tenancy, and that the garden over which it looked on the side that I did not know was quite small and just like all the gardens along the street; and I realised at length that there were not to be seen there pit and gallows or fortified mill, secret chamber, pillared dovecot, manorial bakehouse or tithe-barn, dungeon or drawbridge, or fixed bridge either for that matter, any more than toll-houses or pinnacles, charters, muniments, ramparts or commemorative mounds. But just as Elstir, when the bay of Balbec, losing its mystery, had become for me simply a portion, interchangeable with any other, of the total quantity of salt water distributed over the earth\u2019s surface, had suddenly restored to it a personality of its own by telling me that it was the gulf of opal, painted by Whistler in his \u2018Harmonies in Blue and Silver,\u2019 so the name Guermantes had seen perish under the strokes of Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s hammer the last of the dwellings that had issued from its syllables when one day an old friend of my father said to us, speaking of the Duchess: \u201cShe is the first lady in the Faubourg Saint-Germain; hers is the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\u201d No doubt the most exclusive drawing-room, the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain was little or nothing after all those other mansions of which in turn I had dreamed. And yet in this one too (and it was to be the last of the series), there was something, however humble, quite apart from its material components, a secret differentiation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it became all the more essential that I should be able to explore in the drawing-room of Mme. de Guermantes, among her friends, the mystery of her name, since I did not find it in her person when I saw her leave the house in the morning on foot, or in the afternoon in her carriage. Once before, indeed, in the church at Combray, she had appeared to me in the blinding flash of a transfiguration, with cheeks irreducible to, impenetrable by, the colour of the name Guermantes and of afternoons on the banks of the Vivonne, taking the place of my shattered dream like a swan or willow into which has been changed a god or nymph, and which henceforward, subjected to natural laws, will glide over the water or be shaken by the wind. And yet, when that radiance had vanished, hardly had I lost sight of it before it formed itself again, like the green and rosy afterglow of sunset after the sweep of the oar has broken it, and in the solitude of my thoughts the name had quickly appropriated to itself my impression of the face. But now, frequently, I saw her at her window, in the courtyard, in the street, and for myself at least if I did not succeed in integrating in her the name Guermantes, I cast the blame on the impotence of my mind to accomplish the whole act that I demanded of it; but she, our neighbour, she seemed to make the same error, nay more to make it without discomfiture, without any of my scruples, without even suspecting that it was an error. Thus Mme. de Guermantes shewed in her dresses the same anxiety to follow the fashions as if, believing herself to have become simply a woman like all the rest, she had aspired to that elegance in her attire in which other ordinary women might equal and perhaps surpass her; I had seen her in the street gaze admiringly at a well-dressed actress; and in the morning, before she sallied forth on foot, as if the opinion of the passers-by, whose vulgarity she accentuated by parading familiarly through their midst her inaccessible life, could be a tribunal competent to judge her, I would see her before the glass playing, with a conviction free from all pretence or irony, with passion, with ill-humour, with conceit, like a queen who has consented to appear as a servant-girl in theatricals at court, this part, so unworthy of her, of a fashionable woman; and in this mythological oblivion of her natural grandeur, she looked to see whether her veil was hanging properly, smoothed her cuffs, straightened her cloak, as the celestial swan performs all the movements natural to his animal species, keeps his eyes painted on either side of his beak without putting into them any glint of life, and darts suddenly after a bud or an umbrella, as a swan would, without remembering that he is a god. But as the traveller, disappointed by the first appearance of a strange town, reminds himself that he will doubtless succeed in penetrating its charm if he visits its museums and galleries, so I assured myself that, had I been given the right of entry into Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s house, were I one of her friends, were I to penetrate into her life, I should then know what, within its glowing orange-tawny envelope, her name did really, objectively enclose for other people, since, after all, my father\u2019s friend had said that the Guermantes set was something quite by itself in the Faubourg Saint-Germain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The life which I supposed them to lead there flowed from a source so different from anything in my experience, and must, I felt, be so indissolubly associated with that particular house that I could not have imagined the presence, at the Duchess\u2019s parties, of people in whose company I myself had already been, of people who really existed. For not being able suddenly to change their nature, they would have carried on conversations there of the sort that I knew; their partners would perhaps have stooped to reply to them in the same human speech; and, in the course of an evening spent in the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, there would have been moments identical with moments that I had already lived. Which was impossible. It was thus that my mind was embarrassed by certain difficulties, and the Presence of Our Lord\u2019s Body in the Host seemed to me no more obscure a mystery than this leading house in the Faubourg, situated here, on the right bank of the river, and so near that from my bed, in the morning, I could hear its carpets being beaten. But the line of demarcation that separated me from the Faubourg Saint-Germain seemed to me all the more real because it was purely ideal. I felt clearly that it was already part of the Faubourg, when I saw the Guermantes doormat, spread out beyond that intangible Equator, of which my mother had made bold to say, having like myself caught a glimpse of it one day when their door stood open, that it was a shocking state. For the rest, how could their dining-room, their dim gallery upholstered in red plush, into which I could see sometimes from our kitchen window, have failed to possess in my eyes the mysterious charm of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to form part of it in an essential fashion, to be geographically situated within it, since to have been entertained to dinner in that room was to have gone into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, to have breathed its atmosphere, since the people who, before going to table, sat down by the side of Mme. de Guermantes on the leather-covered sofa in that gallery were all of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. No doubt elsewhere than in the Faubourg, at certain parties, one might see now and then, majestically enthroned amid the vulgar herd of fashion, one of those men who were mere names and varyingly assumed, when one tried to form a picture of them, the aspect of a tournament or of a royal forest. But here, in the leading house in the Faubourg Saint-German, in the drawing-room, in the dim gallery, there were only they. They were wrought of precious materials, the columns that upheld the temple. Indeed for quiet family parties it was from among them only that Mme. de Guermantes might select her guests, and in the dinners for twelve, gathered around the dazzling napery and plate, they were like the golden statues of the Apostles in the Sainte-Chapelle, symbolic, consecrative pillars before the Holy Table. As for the tiny strip of garden that stretched between high walls at the back of the house, where on summer evenings Mme. de Guermantes had liqueurs and orangeade brought out after dinner, how could I not have felt that to sit there of an evening, between nine and eleven, on its iron chairs \u2014 endowed with a magic as potent as the leathern sofa \u2014 without inhaling the breezes peculiar to the Faubourg Saint-Germain was as impossible as to take a siesta in the oasis of Figuig without thereby being necessarily in Africa. Only imagination and belief can differentiate from the rest certain objects, certain people, and can create an atmosphere. Alas, those picturesque sites, those natural accidents, those local curiosities, those works of art of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, never probably should I be permitted to set my feet among them. And I must content myself with a shiver of excitement as I sighted, from the deep sea (and without the least hope of ever landing there) like an outstanding minaret, like the first palm, like the first signs of some exotic industry or vegetation, the well-trodden doormat of its shore\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if the H\u00f4tel de Guermantes began for me at its hall-door, its dependencies must be regarded as extending a long way farther, according to the Duke, who, looking on all the other tenants as farmers, peasants, purchasers of forfeited estates, whose opinion was of no account, shaved himself every morning in his nightshirt at the window, came down into the courtyard, according to the warmth or coldness of the day, in his shirtsleeves, in pyjamas, in a plaid coat of startling colours, with a shaggy nap, in little light-coloured coats shorter than the jackets beneath, and made one of his grooms lead past him at a trot some horse that he had just been buying. More than once, indeed, the horse broke the window of Jupien\u2019s shop, whereupon Jupien, to the Duke\u2019s indignation, demanded compensation. \u201cIf it were only in consideration of all the good that Madame la Duchesse does in the house, here, and in the parish,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, \u201cit is an outrage on this fellow\u2019s part to claim a penny from us.\u201d But Jupien had stuck to his point, apparently not having the faintest idea what \u2018good\u2019 the Duchess had ever done. And yet she did do good, but \u2014 since one cannot do good to everybody at once \u2014 the memory of the benefits that we have heaped on one person is a valid reason for our abstaining from helping another, whose discontent we thereby make all the stronger. From other points of view than that of charity the quarter appeared to the Duke \u2014 and this over a considerable area \u2014 to be only an extension of his courtyard, a longer track for his horses. After seeing how a new acquisition trotted by itself he would have it harnessed and taken through all the neighbouring streets, the groom running beside the carriage holding the reins, making it pass to and fro before the Duke who stood on the pavement, erect, gigantic, enormous in his vivid clothes, a cigar between his teeth, his head in the air, his eyeglass scrutinous, until the moment when he sprang on the box, drove the horse up and down for a little to try it, then set off with his new turn-out to pick up his mistress in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. M. de Guermantes bade good day, before leaving the courtyard, to two couples who belonged more or less to his world; the first, some cousins of his who, like working-class parents, were never at home to look after their children, since every morning the wife went off to the Schola to study counterpoint and fugue, and the husband to his studio to carve wood and beat leather; and after them the Baron and Baronne de Norpois, always dressed in black, she like a pew-opener and he like a mute at a funeral, who emerged several times daily on their way to church. They were the nephew and niece of the old Ambassador who was our friend, and whom my father had, in fact, met at the foot of the staircase without realising from where he came; for my father supposed that so important a personage, one who had come in contact with the most eminent men in Europe and was probably quite indifferent to the empty distinctions of rank, was hardly likely to frequent the society of these obscure, clerical and narrow-minded nobles. They had not been long in the place; Jupien, who had come out into the courtyard to say a word to the husband just as he was greeting M. de Guermantes, called him \u2018M. Norpois,\u2019 not being certain of his name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMonsieur Norpois, indeed! Oh, that really is good! Just wait a little! This individual will be calling you Comrade Norpois next!\u201d exclaimed M. de Guermantes, turning to the Baron. He was at last able to vent his spleen against Jupien who addressed him as \u2018Monsieur,\u2019 instead of \u2018Monsieur le Duc.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day when M. de Guermantes required some information upon a matter of which my father had professional knowledge, he had introduced himself to him with great courtesy. After that, he had often some neighbourly service to ask of my father and, as soon as he saw him begin to come downstairs, his mind occupied with his work and anxious to avoid any interruption, the Duke, leaving his stable-boys, would come up to him in the courtyard, straighten the collar of his great-coat, with the serviceable deftness inherited from a line of royal body-servants in days gone by, take him by the hand, and, holding it in his own, patting it even to prove to my father, with a courtesan\u2019s or courtier\u2019s shamelessness, that he, the Duc de Guermantes, made no bargain about my father\u2019s right to the privilege of contact with the ducal flesh, lead him, so to speak, on leash, extremely annoyed and thinking only how he might escape, through the carriage entrance out into the street. He had given us a sweeping bow one day when we had come in just as he was going out in the carriage with his wife; he was bound to have told her my name; but what likelihood was there of her remembering it, or my face either? And besides, what a feeble recommendation to be pointed out simply as being one of her tenants! Another, more valuable, would have been my meeting the Duchess in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, who, as it happened, had just sent word by my grandmother that I was to go and see her, and, remembering that I had been intending to go in for literature, had added that I should meet several authors there. But my father felt that I was still a little young to go into society, and as the state of my health continued to give him uneasiness he did not see the use of establishing precedents that would do me no good\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As one of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s footmen was in the habit of talking to Fran\u00e7oise, I picked up the names of several of the houses which she frequented, but formed no impression of any of them; from the moment in which they were a part of her life, of that life which I saw only through the veil of her name, were they not inconceivable?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo-night there\u2019s a big party with a Chinese shadow show at the Princesse de Parme\u2019s,\u201d said the footman, \u201cbut we shan\u2019t be going, because at five o\u2019clock Madame is taking the train to Chantilly, to spend a few days with the Due d\u2019Aumale; but it\u2019ll be the lady\u2019s maid and valet that are going with her. I\u2019m to stay here. She won\u2019t be at all pleased, the Princesse de Parme won\u2019t, that\u2019s four times already she\u2019s written to Madame la Duchesse.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen you won\u2019t be going down to Guermantes Castle this year?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the first time we shan\u2019t be going there: it\u2019s because of the Duke\u2019s rheumatics, the doctor says he\u2019s not to go there till the hot pipes are in, but we\u2019ve been there every year till now, right on to January. If the hot pipes aren\u2019t ready, perhaps Madame will go for a few days to Cannes, to the Duchesse de Guise, but nothing\u2019s settled yet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd to the theatre, do you go, sometimes?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe go now and then to the Op\u00e9ra, usually on the evenings when the Princesse de Parme has her box, that\u2019s once a week; it seems it\u2019s a fine show they give there, plays, operas, everything. Madame refused to subscribe to it herself, but we go all the same to the boxes Madame\u2019s friends take, one one night, another another, often with the Princesse de Guermantes, the Duke\u2019s cousin\u2019s lady. She\u2019s sister to the Duke of Bavaria. And so you\u2019ve got to run upstairs again now, have you?\u201d went on the footman, who, albeit identified with the Guermantes, looked upon masters in general as a political estate, a view which allowed him to treat Fran\u00e7oise with as much respect as if she too were in service with a duchess. \u201cYou enjoy good health, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, if it wasn\u2019t for these cursed legs of mine! On the plain I can still get along\u201d (\u2018on the plain\u2019 meant in the courtyard or in the streets, where Fran\u00e7oise had no objection to walking, in other words \u2018on a plane surface\u2019) \u201cbut it\u2019s these stairs that do me in, devil take them. Good day to you, sir, see you again, perhaps, this evening.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was all the more anxious to continue her conversations with the footman after he mentioned to her that the sons of dukes often bore a princely title which they retained until their fathers were dead. Evidently the cult of the nobility, blended with and accommodating itself to a certain spirit of revolt against it, must, springing hereditarily from the soil of France, be very strongly implanted still in her people. For Fran\u00e7oise, to whom you might speak of the genius of Napoleon or of wireless telegraphy without succeeding in attracting her attention, and without her slackening for an instant the movements with which she was scraping the ashes from the grate or laying the table, if she were simply to be told these idiosyncrasies of nomenclature, and that the younger son of the Duc de Guermantes was generally called Prince d\u2019Ol\u00e9ron, would at once exclaim: \u201cThat\u2019s fine, that is!\u201d and stand there dazed, as though in contemplation of a stained window in church\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise learned also from the Prince d\u2019Agrigente\u2019s valet, who had become friends with her by coming often to the house with notes for the Duchess, that he had been hearing a great deal of talk in society about the marriage of the Marquis de Saint-Loup to Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac, and that it was practically settled\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That villa, that opera-box, into which Mme. de Guermantes transfused the current of her life, must, it seemed to me, be places no less fairylike than her home. The names of Guise, of Parme, of Guermantes-Baviere, differentiated from all possible others the holiday places to which the Duchess resorted, the daily festivities which the track of her bowling wheels bound, as with ribbons, to her mansion. If they told me that in those holidays, in those festivities, consisted serially the life of Mme. de Guermantes, they brought no further light to bear on it. Each of them gave to the life of the Duchess a different determination, but succeeded only in changing the mystery of it, without allowing to escape any of its own mystery which simply floated, protected by a covering, enclosed in a bell, through the tide of the life of all the world. The Duchess might take her luncheon on the shore of the Mediterranean at Carnival time, but, in the villa of Mme. de Guise, where the queen of Parisian society was nothing more, in her white linen dress, among numberless princesses, than a guest like any of the rest, and on that account more moving still to me, more herself by being thus made new, like a star of the ballet who in the fantastic course of a figure takes the place of each of her humbler sisters in succession; she might look at Chinese shadow shows, but at a party given by the Princesse de Parme, listen to tragedy or opera, but from the box of the Princesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we localise in the body of a person all the potentialities of that person\u2019s life, our recollections of the people he knows and has just left or is on his way to meet, if, having learned from Fran\u00e7oise that Mme. de Guermantes was going on foot to luncheon with the Princesse de Parme, I saw her, about midday, emerge from her house in a gown of flesh-coloured satin over which her face was of the same shade, like a cloud that rises above the setting sun, it was all the pleasures of the Faubourg Saint-Germain that I saw before me, contained in that small compass, as in a shell, between its twin valves that glowed with roseate nacre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had a friend at the Ministry, one A. J. Moreau, who, to distinguish him from the other Moreaus, took care always to prefix both initials to his name, with the result that people called him, for short, \u2018A.J.\u2019 Well, somehow or other, this A. J. found himself entitled to a stall at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique on a gala night, he sent the ticket to my father, and as Berma, whom I had not been again to see since my first disappointment, was to give an act of Ph\u00e8dre, my grandmother persuaded my father to pass it on to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To tell the truth, I attached no importance to this possibility of hearing Berma which, a few years earlier, had plunged me in such a state of agitation. And it was not without a sense of melancholy that I realized the fact of my indifference to what at one time I had put before health, comfort, everything. It was not that there had been any slackening of my desire for an opportunity to contemplate close at hand the precious particles of reality of which my imagination caught a broken glimpse. But my imagination no longer placed these in the diction of a great actress; since my visits to Elstir, it was on certain tapestries, certain modern paintings that I had brought to bear the inner faith I had once had in this acting, in this tragic art of Berma; my faith, my desire, no longer coming forward to pay incessant worship to the diction, the attitudes of Berma, the counterpart that I possessed of them in my heart had gradually perished, like those other counterparts of the dead in ancient Egypt which had to be fed continually in order to maintain their originals in eternal life. This art had become a feeble, tawdry thing. No deep-lying soul inhabited it any more\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That evening, as, armed with the ticket my father had received from his friend, I was climbing the grand staircase of the Opera, I saw in front of me a man whom I took at first for M. de Charlus, whose bearing he had; when he turned his head to ask some question of one of the staff I saw that I had been mistaken, but I had no hesitation in placing the stranger in the same class of society, from the way not only in which he was dressed but in which he spoke to the man who took the tickets and to the box-openers who were keeping him waiting. For, apart from personal details of similarity, there was still at this period between any smart and wealthy man of that section of the nobility and any smart and wealthy man of the world of finance or \u2018big business\u2019 a strongly marked difference. Where one of the latter would have thought he was giving proof of his exclusiveness by adopting a sharp, haughty tone in speaking to an inferior, the great gentleman, affable, pleasant, smiling, had the air of considering, practising an affectation of humility and patience, a pretence of being just one of the audience, as a privilege of his good breeding. It is quite likely that, on seeing him thus dissemble behind a smile overflowing with good nature the barred threshold of the little world apart which he carried in his person, more than one wealthy banker\u2019s son, entering the theatre at that moment, would have taken this great gentleman for a person of no importance if he had not remarked in him an astonishing resemblance to the portrait that had recently appeared in the illustrated papers of a nephew of the Austrian Emperor, the Prince of Saxony, who happened to be in Paris at the time. I knew him to be a great friend of the Guermantes. As I reached the attendant I heard the Prince of Saxony (or his double) say with a smile: \u201cI don\u2019t know the number; it was my cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He may well have been the Prince of Saxony; it was perhaps of the Duchesse de Guermantes (whom, in that event, I should be able to watch in the process of living one of those moments of her unimaginable life in her cousin\u2019s box) that his eyes formed a mental picture when he referred to \u2018my cousin who told me I had only to ask for her box,\u2019 so much so that that smiling gaze peculiar to himself, those so simple words caressed my heart (far more gently than would any abstract meditation) with the alternative feelers of a possible happiness and a vague distinction. Whatever he was, in uttering this sentence to the attendant he grafted upon a commonplace evening in my everyday life a potential outlet into a new world; the passage to which he was directed after mentioning the word \u2018box\u2019 and along which he now proceeded was moist and mildewed and seemed to lead to subaqueous grottoes, to the mythical kingdom of the water-nymphs. I had before me a gentleman in evening dress who was walking away from me, but I kept playing upon and round him, as with a badly fitting reflector on a lamp, and without ever succeeding in making it actually coincide with him, the idea that he was the Prince of Saxony and was on his way to join the Duchesse de Guermantes. And, for all that he was alone, that idea, external to himself, impalpable, immense, unstable as the shadow projected by a magic lantern, seemed to precede and guide him like that deity, invisible to the rest of mankind, who stands beside the Greek warrior in the hour of battle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took my seat, striving all the time to recapture a line from Ph\u00e8dre which I could not quite remember. In the form in which I repeated it to myself it had not the right number of feet, but as I made no attempt to count them, between its unwieldiness and a classical line of poetry it seemed as though no common measure could exist. It would not have surprised me to learn that I must subtract at least half a dozen syllables from that portentous phrase to reduce it to alexandrine dimensions. But suddenly I remembered it, the irremediable asperities of an inhuman world vanished as if by magic; the syllables of the line at once filled up the requisite measure, what there was in excess floated off with the ease, the dexterity of a bubble of air that rises to burst on the water\u2019s brink. And, after all, this excrescence with which I had been struggling consisted of but a single foot\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A certain number of orchestra stalls had been offered for sale at the box office and bought, out of snobbishness or curiosity, by such as wished to study the appearance of people whom they might not have another opportunity of seeing at close quarters. And it was indeed a fragment of their true social life, ordinarily kept secret, that one could examine here in public, for, the Princesse de Parme having herself distributed among her friends the seats in stalls, balconies and boxes, the house was like a drawing-room in which everyone changed his place, went to sit here or there wherever he caught sight of a woman whom he knew\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next to me were some common people who, not knowing the regular subscribers, were anxious to shew that they were capable of identifying them and named them aloud. They went on to remark that these subscribers behaved there as though they were in their own drawing-rooms, meaning that they paid no attention to what was being played. Which was the exact opposite of what did happen. A budding genius who had taken a stall in order to hear Berma thinks only of not soiling his gloves, of not disturbing, of making friends with the neighbour whom chance has put beside him, of pursuing with an intermittent smile the fugitive \u2014 avoiding with apparent want of politeness the intercepted gaze of a person of his acquaintance whom he has discovered in the audience and to whom, after a thousand indecisions, he makes up his mind to go and talk just as the three hammer-blows from the stage, sounding before he has had time to reach his friend, force him to take flight, like the Hebrews in the Red Sea, through a heaving tide of spectators and spectatresses whom he has obliged to rise and whose dresses he tears as he passes, or tramples on their boots. On the other hand it was because the society people sat in their boxes (behind the general terrace of the balcony, as in so many little drawing-rooms, the fourth walls of which had been removed, or in so many little caf\u00e9s, to which one might go for refreshment, without letting oneself be intimidated by the mirrors in gilt frames or the red plush seats, in the Neapolitan style, of the establishment), it was because they rested an indifferent hand on the gilded shafts of the columns which upheld this temple of the lyric art, it was because they remained unmoved by the extravagant honours which seemed to be being paid them by a pair of carved figures which held out towards the boxes branches of palm and laurel, that they and they only would have had minds free to listen to the play, if only they had had minds\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At first there was nothing visible but vague shadows, in which one suddenly struck \u2014 like the gleam of a precious stone which one cannot see \u2014 the phosphorescence of a pair of famous eyes, or, like a medallion of Henri IV on a dark background, the bent profile of the Due d\u2019Aumale, to whom an invisible lady was exclaiming \u201cMonseigneur must allow me to take his coat,\u201d to which the Prince replied, \u201cOh, come, come! Really, Madame d\u2019Ambresac.\u201d She took it, in spite of this vague prohibition, and was envied by all the rest her being thus honoured\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in the other boxes, everywhere almost, the white deities who inhabited those sombre abodes had flown for shelter against their shadowy walls and remained invisible. Gradually, however, as the performance went on, their vaguely human forms detached themselves, one by one, from the shades of night which they patterned, and, raising themselves towards the light, allowed their semi-nude bodies to emerge, and rose, and stopped at the limit of their course, at the luminous, shaded surface on which their brilliant faces appeared behind the gaily breaking foam of the feather fans they unfurled and lightly waved, beneath their hyacinthine locks begemmed with pearls, which the flow of the tide seemed to have caught and drawn with it; this side of them, began the orchestra stalls, abode of mortals for ever separated from the transparent, shadowy realm to which, at points here and there, served as boundaries, on its brimming surface, the limpid, mirroring eyes of the water-nymphs. For the folding seats on its shore, the forms of the monsters in the stalls were painted upon the surface of those eyes in simple obedience to the laws of optics and according to their angle of incidence, as happens with those two sections of external reality to which, knowing that they do not possess any soul, however rudimentary, that can be considered as analogous to our own, we should think ourselves mad if we addressed a smile or a glance of recognition: namely, minerals and people to whom we have not been introduced. Beyond this boundary, withdrawing from the limit of their domain, the radiant daughters of the sea kept turning at every moment to smile up at the bearded tritons who clung to the anfractuosities of the cliff, or towards some aquatic demi-god, whose head was a polished stone to which the tides had borne a smooth covering of seaweed, and his gaze a disc of rock crystal. They leaned towards these creatures, offering them sweetmeats; sometimes the flood parted to admit a fresh Nereid who, belated, smiling, apologetic, had just floated into blossom out of the shadowy depths; then, the act ended, having no further hope of hearing the melodious sounds of earth which had drawn them to the surface, plunging back all in a moment the several sisters vanished into the night. But of all these retreats, to the thresholds of which their mild desire to behold the works of man brought the curious goddesses who let none approach them, the most famous was the cube of semi-darkness known to the world as the stage box of the Princesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like a mighty goddess who presides from far aloft over the sports of lesser deities, the Princess had deliberately remained a little way back on a sofa placed sideways in the box, red as a reef of coral, beside a big, glassy splash of reflexion which was probably a mirror and made one think of the section cut by a ray of sunlight, vertical, clear, liquid, through the flashing crystal of the sea. At once plume and blossom, like certain subaqueous growths, a great white flower, downy as the wing of a bird, fell from the brow of the Princess along one of her cheeks, the curve of which it followed with a pliancy, coquettish, amorous, alive, and seemed almost to enfold it like a rosy egg in the softness of a halcyon\u2019s nest. Over her hair, reaching in front to her eyebrows and caught back lower down at the level of her throat, was spread a net upon which those little white shells which are gathered on some shore of the South Seas alternated with pearls, a marine mosaic barely emerging from the waves and at every moment plunged back again into a darkness in the depths of which even then a human presence was revealed by the ubiquitous flashing of the Princess\u2019s eyes. The beauty which set her far above all the other fabulous daughters of the dusk was not altogether materially and comprehensively inscribed on her neck, her shoulders, her arms, her figure. But the exquisite, unfinished line of the last was the exact starting point, the inevitable focus of invisible lines which the eye could not help prolonging, marvellous lines, springing into life round the woman like the spectrum of an ideal form projected upon the screen of darkness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s the Princesse de Guermantes,\u201d said my neighbour to the gentleman beside her, taking care to begin the word \u2018Princesse\u2019 with a string of P\u2019s, to shew that a title like that was absurd. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t been sparing with her pearls. I\u2019m sure, if I had as many as that, I wouldn\u2019t make such a display of them; it doesn\u2019t look at all well, not to my mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, when they caught sight of the Princess, all those who were looking round to see who was in the audience felt springing up for her in their hearts the rightful throne of beauty. Indeed, with the Duchesse de Luxembourg, with Mme. de Morienval, with Mme. de Saint-Euverte, and any number of others, what enabled one to identify their faces would be the juxtaposition of a big red nose to a hare-lip, or of a pair of wrinkled cheeks to a faint moustache. These features were nevertheless sufficient in themselves to attract the eye, since having merely the conventional value of a written document they gave one to read a famous and impressive name; but also they gave one, cumulatively, the idea that ugliness had about it something aristocratic, and that it was unnecessary that the face of a great lady, provided it was distinguished, should be beautiful as well. But like certain artists who, instead of the letters of their names, set at the foot of their canvas a form that is beautiful in itself, a butterfly, a lizard, a flower, so it was the form of a delicious face and figure that the Princess had put in the corner of her box, thereby shewing that beauty can be the noblest of signatures; for the presence there of Mme. de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, who brought to the theatre only such persons as at other times formed part of her intimate circle, was in the eyes of specialists in aristocracy the best possible certificate of the authenticity of the picture which her box presented, a sort of evocation of a scene in the ordinary private life of the Princess in her palaces in Munich and in Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our imagination being like a barrel organ out of order, which always plays some other tune than that shewn on its card, every time that I had heard any mention of the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, a recollection of certain sixteenth-century masterpieces had begun singing in my brain. I was obliged to rid myself quickly of this association, now that I saw her engaged in offering crystallised fruit to a stout gentleman in a swallowtail coat. Certainly I was very far from the conclusion that she and her guests were mere human beings like the rest of the audience. I understood that what they were doing there was all only a game, and that as a prelude to the acts of their real life (of which, presumably, this was not where they spent the important part) they had arranged, in obedience to a ritual unknown to me, they were feigning to offer and decline sweetmeats, a gesture robbed of its ordinary significance and regulated beforehand like the step of a dancer who alternately raises herself on her toes and circles about an upheld scarf. For all I knew, perhaps at the moment of offering him her sweetmeats the goddess was saying, with that note of irony in her voice (for I saw her smile): \u201cDo have one, won\u2019t you?\u201d What mattered that to me? I should have found a delicious refinement in the deliberate dryness, in the style of M\u00e9rim\u00e9e or Meilhac, of such words addressed by a goddess to a demi-god who, conscious himself what were the sublime thoughts which they both had in their minds, in reserve, doubtless, until the moment when they would begin again to live their true life, consenting to join in the game, was answering with the same mysterious bitterness: \u201cThanks; I should like a cherry.\u201d And I should have listened to this dialogue with the same avidity as to a scene from Le Mari de la D\u00e9butante, where the absence of poetry, of lofty thoughts, things so familiar to me which, I suppose, Meilhac could easily, had he chosen, have put into it a thousand times over, seemed to me in itself a refinement, a conventional refinement and therefore all the more mysterious and instructive\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat fat fellow is the Marquis de Ganan\u00e7ay,\u201d came in a knowing tone from the man next to me, who had not quite caught the name whispered in the row behind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquis de Palancy, his face bent downwards at the end of his long neck, his round bulging eye glued to the glass of his monocle, was moving with a leisurely displacement through the transparent shade and appeared no more to see the public in the stalls than a fish that drifts past, unconscious of the press of curious gazers, behind the glass wall of an aquarium. Now and again he paused, a venerable, wheezing monument, and the audience could not have told whether he was in pain, asleep, swimming, about to spawn, or merely taking breath. No one else aroused in me so much envy as he, on account of his apparent familiarity with this box and the indifference with which he allowed the Princess to hold out to him her box of sweetmeats; throwing him, at the same time, a glance from her fine eyes, cut in a pair of diamonds which at such moments wit and friendliness seemed to liquefy, whereas, when they were at rest, reduced to their purely material beauty, to their mineral brilliance alone, if the least reflected flash disturbed them ever so slightly, they set the darkness ablaze with inhuman horizontal splendid fires. But now, because the act ofPh\u00e8dre in which Berma was playing was due to start, the Princess came to the front of the box; whereupon, as if she herself were a theatrical production, in the zone of light which she traversed, I saw not only the colour but the material of her adornments change. And in the box, dry now, emerging, a part no longer of the watery realm, the Princess, ceasing to be a Nereid, appeared turbanned in white and blue like some marvellous tragic actress dressed for the part of Za\u00efre, or perhaps of Orosmane; finally, when she had taken her place in the front row I saw that the soft halcyon\u2019s nest which tenderly shielded the rosy nacre of her cheeks was \u2014 downy, dazzling, velvety, an immense bird of paradise\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But now my gaze was diverted from the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s box by a little woman who came in, ill-dressed, plain, her eyes ablaze with indignation, followed by two young men, and sat down a few places from me. At length the curtain went up. I could not help being saddened by the reflexion that there remained now no trace of my old disposition, at the period when, so as to miss nothing of the extraordinary phenomenon which I would have gone to the ends of the earth to see, I kept my mind prepared, like the sensitive plates which astronomers take out to Africa, to the West Indies, to make and record an exact observation of a comet or an eclipse; when I trembled for fear lest some cloud (a fit of ill humour on the artist\u2019s part or an incident in the audience) should prevent the spectacle from presenting itself with the maximum of intensity; when I should not have believed that I was watching it in the most perfect conditions had I not gone to the very theatre which was consecrated to it like an altar, in which I then felt to be still a part of it, though an accessory part only, the officials with their white carnations, appointed by her, the vaulted balcony covering a pit filled with a shabbily dressed crowd, the women selling programmes that had her photograph, the chestnut trees in the square outside, all those companions, those confidants of my impressions of those days which seemed to me to be inseparable from them. Ph\u00e8dre, the \u2018Declaration Scene,\u2019 Berma, had had then for me a sort of absolute existence. Standing aloof from the world of current experience they existed by themselves, I must go to meet them, I should penetrate what I could of them, and if I opened my eyes and soul to their fullest extent I should still absorb but a very little of them. But how pleasant life seemed to me: the triviality of the form of it that I myself was leading mattered nothing, no more than the time we spend on dressing, on getting ready to go out, since, transcending it, there existed in an absolute form, good and difficult to approach, impossible to possess in their entirety, those more solid realities,  Ph\u00e8dre and the way in which Berma spoke her part. Steeped in these dreams of perfection in the dramatic art (a strong dose of which anyone who had at that time subjected my mind to analysis at any moment of the day or even the night would have been able to prepare from it), I was like a battery that accumulates and stores up electricity. And a time had come when, ill as I was, even if I had believed that I should die of it, I should still have been compelled to go and hear Berma. But now, like a hill which from a distance seems a patch of azure sky, but, as we draw nearer, returns to its place in our ordinary field of vision, all this had left the world of the absolute and was no more than a thing like other things, of which I took cognisance because I was there, the actors were people of the same substance as the people I knew, trying to speak in the best possible way these lines of Ph\u00e8dre, which themselves no longer formed a sublime and individual essence, distinct from everything else, but were simply more or less effective lines ready to slip back into the vast corpus of French poetry, of which they were merely a part. I felt a discouragement that was all the more profound in that, if the object of my headstrong and active desire no longer existed, the same tendencies, on the other hand, to indulge in a perpetual dream, which varied from year to year but led me always to sudden impulses, regardless of danger, still persisted. The day on which I rose from my bed of sickness and set out to see, in some country house or other, a picture by Elstir or a mediaeval tapestry, was so like the day on which I ought to have started for Venice, or that on which I did go to hear Berma, or start for Balbec, that I felt before going that the immediate object of my sacrifice would, after a little while, leave me cold, that then I might pass close by the place without stopping even to look at that picture, those tapestries for which I would at this moment risk so many sleepless nights, so many hours of pain. I discerned in the instability of its object the vanity of my effort, and at the same time its vastness, which I had not before noticed, like a neurasthenic whose exhaustion we double by pointing out to him that he is exhausted. In the meantime my musings gave a distinction to everything that had any connexion with them. And even in my most carnal desires, magnetised always in a certain direction, concentrated about a single dream, I might have recognised as their primary motive an idea, an idea for which I would have laid down my life, at the innermost core of which, as in my day dreams while I sat reading all afternoon in the garden at Combray, lay the thought of perfection\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I no longer felt the same indulgence as on the former occasion towards the deliberate expressions of affection or anger which I had then remarked in the delivery and gestures of Aricie, Ism\u00e8ne and Hippolyte. It was not that the players \u2014 they were the same, by the way \u2014 did not still seek, with the same intelligent application, to impart now a caressing inflexion, or a calculated ambiguity to their voices, now a tragic amplitude, or a suppliant meekness to their movements. Their intonations bade the voice: \u201cBe gentle, sing like a nightingale, caress and woo\u201d; or else, \u201cnow wax furious,\u201d and then hurled themselves upon it, trying to carry it off with them in their frenzied rush. But it, mutinous, independent of their diction, remained unalterably their natural voice with its material defects or charms, its everyday vulgarity or affectation, and thus presented a sum-total of acoustic or social phenomena which the sentiment contained in the lines they were repeating was powerless to alter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly the gestures of the players said to their arms, to their garments: \u201cBe majestic.\u201d But each of these unsubmissive members allowed to flaunt itself between shoulder and elbow a biceps which knew nothing of the part; they continued to express the triviality of everyday life and to bring into prominence, instead of fine shades of Racinian meaning, mere muscular attachments; and the draperies which they held up fell back again along vertical lines in which the natural law that governs falling bodies was challenged only by an insipid textile pliancy. At this point the little woman who was sitting near me exclaimed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot a hand! Did you ever see such a get-up? She\u2019s too old; she can\u2019t play the part; she ought to have retired ages ago.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amid a sibilant protest from their neighbours the two young men with her succeeded in making her keep quiet and her fury raged now only in her eyes. This fury could, moreover, be prompted only by the thought of success, of fame, for Berma, who had earned so much money, was overwhelmed with debts. Since she was always making business or social appointments which she was prevented from keeping, she had messengers flying with apologies along every street in Paris, and what with rooms in hotels which she would never occupy engaged in advance, oceans of scent to bathe her dogs, heavy penalties for breaches of contract with all her managers, failing any more serious expense and being not so voluptuous as Cleopatra, she would have found the means of squandering on telegrams and jobmasters provinces and kingdoms. But the little woman was an actress who had never tasted success, and had vowed a deadly hatred against Berma. The latter had just corne on to the stage. And then \u2014 oh, the miracle \u2014 like those lessons which we laboured in vain to learn overnight, and find intact, got by heart, on waking up next morning, like, too, those faces of dead friends which the impassioned efforts of our memory pursue without recapturing them, and which, when we are no longer thinking of them, are there before our eyes just as they were in life \u2014 the talent of Berma, which had evaded me when I sought so greedily to seize its essential quality, now, after these years of oblivion, in this hour of indifference, imposed itself, with all the force of a thing directly seen, on my admiration. Formerly, in my attempts to isolate the talent, I deducted, so to speak, from what I heard the part itself, a part common to all the actresses who appeared as Ph\u00e8dre, which I had myself studied beforehand so that I might be capable of subtracting it, of receiving in the strained residue only the talent of Mme. Berma. But this talent which I sought to discover outside the part itself was indissolubly one with it. So with a great musician (it appears that this was the case with Vinteuil when he played the piano), his playing is that of so fine a pianist that one cannot even be certain whether the performer is a pianist at all, since (not interposing all that mechanism of muscular effort, crowned here and there with brilliant effects, all that spattering shower of notes in which at least the listener who does not quite know where he is thinks that he can discern talent in its material, tangible objectivity) his playing is become so transparent, so full of what he is interpreting, that himself one no longer sees and he is nothing now but a window opening upon a great work of art. The intentions which surrounded, like a majestic or delicate border, the voice and mimicry of Aricie, Ism\u00e8ne or Hippolyte I had been able to distinguish, but Ph\u00e8dre had taken hers into herself, and my mind had not succeeded in wresting from her diction and attitudes, in apprehending in the miserly simplicity of their unbroken surfaces those treasures, those effects of which no sign emerged, so completely had they been absorbed. Berma\u2019s voice, in which not one atom of lifeless matter refractory to the mind remained undissolved, did not allow any sign to be discernible around it of that overflow of tears which one could feel, because they had not been able to absorb it in themselves, trickling over the marble voice of Aricie or Ism\u00e8ne, but had been brought to an exquisite perfection in each of its tiniest cells like the instrument of a master violinist, in whom one means, when one says that his music has a fine sound, to praise not a physical peculiarity but a superiority of soul; and, as in the classical landscape where in the place of a vanished nymph there is an inanimate waterspring, a clear and concrete intention had been transformed into a certain quality of tone, strangely, appropriately, coldly limpid. Berma\u2019s arms, which the lines themselves, by the same dynamic force that made the words issue from her lips, seemed to raise on to her bosom like leaves disturbed by a gush o\u00ee water; her attitude, on the stage, which she had gradually built up, which she was to modify yet further, and which was based upon reasonings of a different profundity from those of which traces might be seen in the gestures of her fellow-actors, but of reasonings that had lost their original deliberation, and had melted into a sort of radiance in which they sent throbbing, round the person of the heroine, elements rich and complex, but which the fascinated spectator took not as an artistic triumph but as a natural gift; those white veils themselves, which, tenuous and clinging, seemed to be of a living substance and to have been woven by the suffering, half-pagan, half-Jansenist, around which they drew close like a frail, shrinking chrysalis; all of them, voice, attitude, gestures, veils, were nothing more, round this embodiment of an idea, which a line of poetry is (an embodiment that, unlike our human bodies, covers the soul not with an opaque screen which prevents us from seeing it, but with a purified, a quickened garment through which the soul is diffused and we discover it), than additional envelopes which instead of concealing shewed up in greater splendour the soul that had assimilated them to itself and had spread itself through them, than layers of different substances, grown translucent, the interpolation of which has the effect only of causing a richer refraction of the imprisoned, central ray that pierces through them, and of making more extensive, more precious and more fair the matter purified by fire in which it is enshrined. So Berma\u2019s interpretation was, around Racine\u2019s work, a second work, quickened also by the breath of genius\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My own impression, to tell the truth, though more pleasant than on the earlier occasion, was not really different. Only, I no longer put it to the test of a pre-existent, abstract and false idea of dramatic genius, and I understood now that dramatic genius was precisely this. It had just occurred to me that if I had not derived any pleasure from my first hearing of Berma, it was because, as earlier still when I used to meet Gilberte in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, I had come to her with too strong a desire. Between my two disappointments there was perhaps not only this resemblance, but another more profound. The impression given us by a person or a work (or a rendering, for that matter) of marked individuality is peculiar to that person or work. We have brought to it the ideas of \u2018beauty,\u2019 \u2018breadth of style,\u2019 \u2018pathos\u2019 and so forth which we might, failing anything better, have had the illusion of discovering in the commonplace show of a \u2018correct\u2019 face or talent, but our critical spirit has before it the insistent challenge of a form of which it possesses no intellectual equivalent, in which it must detect and isolate the unknown element. It hears a shrill sound, an oddly interrogative intonation. It asks itself: \u201cIs that good? Is what I am feeling just now admiration? Is that richness of colouring, nobility, strength?\u201d And what answers it again is a shrill voice, a curiously questioning tone, the despotic impression caused by a person whom one does not know, wholly material, in which there is no room left for \u2018breadth of interpretation.\u2019 And for this reason it is the really beautiful works that, if we listen to them with sincerity, must disappoint us most keenly, because in the storehouse of our ideas there is none that corresponds to an individual impression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was precisely what Berma\u2019s acting shewed me. This was what was meant by nobility, by intelligence of diction. Now I could appreciate the worth of a broad, poetical, powerful interpretation, or rather it was to this that those epithets were conventionally applied, but only as we give the names of Mars, Venus, Saturn to planets which have no place in classical mythology. We feel in one world, we think, we give names to things in another; between the two we can establish a certain correspondence, but not bridge the interval. It was quite narrow, this interval, this fault that I had had to cross when, that afternoon on which I went first to bear Berma, having strained my ears to catch every word, I had found some difficulty in correlating my ideas of \u2018nobility of interpretation,\u2019 of \u2018originality,\u2019 and had broken out in applause only after a moment of unconsciousness and as if my applause sprang not from my actual impression but was connected in some way with my preconceived ideas, with the pleasure that I found in saying to myself: \u201cAt last I am listening to Berma.\u201d And the difference that there is between a person, or a work of art which is markedly individual and the idea of beauty, exists just as much between what they make us feel and the idea of love, or of admiration. Wherefore we fail to recognise them. I had found no pleasure in listening to Berma (any more than, earlier still, in seeing Gilberte). I had said to myself: \u201cWell, I do not admire this.\u201d But then I was thinking only of mastering the secret of Berma\u2019s acting, I was preoccupied with that alone, I was trying to open my mind as wide as possible to receive all that her acting contained. I understood now that all this amounted to nothing more nor less than admiration\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This genius of which Berma\u2019s rendering of the part was only the revelation, was it indeed the genius of Racine and nothing more?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thought so at first. I was soon to be undeceived when the curtain fell on the act from Ph\u00e8dre, amid enthusiastic recalls from the audience, through which the old actress, beside herself with rage, drawing her little body up to its full height, turning sideways in her seat, stiffened the muscles of her face and folded her arms on her bosom to shew that she was not joining the others in their applause, and to make more noticeable a protest which to her appeared sensational though it passed unperceived. The piece that followed was one of those novelties which at one time I had expected, since they were not famous, to be inevitably trivial and of no general application, devoid as they were of any existence outside the performance that was being given of them at the moment. But I had not with them as with a classic the disappointment of seeing the infinity and eternity of a masterpiece occupy no more space or time than the width of the footlights and the length of a performance which would finish it as effectively as a piece written for the occasion. Besides, at every fresh passage which, I felt, had appealed to the audience and would onc day be famous, in place of the fame which it was prevented from having won in the past I added that which it would enjoy in the future, by a mental process the converse of that which consists in imagining masterpieces on the day of their first thin performance, when it seemed inconceivable that a title which no one had ever heard before could one day be set, bathed in the same mellow light, beside those of the author\u2019s other works. And this part would be set one day in the list of her finest impersonations, next to that of Ph\u00e8dre. Not that in itself it was not destitute of all literary merit. But Berma was as sublime in one as in the other. I realised then that the work of the playwright was for the actress no more than the material, the nature of which was comparatively unimportant, for the creation of her masterpiece of interpretation, just as the great painter whom I had met at Balbec, Elstir, had found the inspiration for two pictures of equal merit in a school building without any character and a cathedral which was in itself a work of art. And as the painter dissolves houses, carts, people, in some broad effect of light which makes them all alike, so Berma spread out great sheets of terror or tenderness over words that were all melted together in a common mould, lowered or raised to one level, which a lesser artist would have carefully detached from one another. No doubt each of them had an inflexion of its own, and Berma\u2019s diction did not prevent one from catching the rhythm of the verse. Is it not already a first element of ordered complexity, of beauty, when, on hearing a rhyme, that is to say something which is at once similar to and different from the preceding rhyme, which was prompted by it, but introduces the variety of a new idea, one is conscious of two systems overlapping each other, one intellectual, the other prosodie? But Berma at the same time made her words, her lines, her whole speeches even, flow into lakes of sound vaster than themselves, at the margins of which it was a joy to see them obliged to stop, to break off; thus it is that a poet takes pleasure in making hesitate for a moment at the rhyming point the word which is about to spring forth, and a composer in merging the various words of his libretto in a single rhythm which contradicts, captures and controls them. Thus into the prose sentences of the modern playwright as into the poetry of Racine Berma managed to introduce those vast images of grief, nobility, passion, which were the masterpieces of her own personal art, and in which she could be recognised as, in the portraits which he has made of different sitters, we recognise a painter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had no longer any desire, as on the former occasion, to be able to arrest and perpetuate Berma\u2019s attitudes, the fine colour effect which she gave for a moment only in a beam of limelight which at once faded never to reappear, nor to make her repeat a single line a hundred times over. I realised that my original desire had been more exacting than the intentions of the poet, the actress, the great decorative artist who supervised her productions, and that that charm which floated over a line as it was spoken, those unstable poses perpetually transformed into others, those successive pictures were the transient result, the momentary object, the changing masterpiece which the art of the theatre undertook to create and which would perish were an attempt made to fix it for all time by a too much enraptured listener. I did not even make a resolution to come back another day and hear Berma again. I was satisfied with her; it was when I admired too keenly not to be disappointed by the object of my admiration, whether that object were Gilberte or Berma, that I demanded in advance, of the impression to be received on the morrow, the pleasure that yesterday\u2019s impression had refused to afford me. Without seeking to analyse the joy which I had begun now to feel, and might perhaps have been turning to some more profitable use, I said to myself, as in the old days I might have said to one of my schoolfellows: \u201cCertainly, I put Berma first!\u201d not without a confused feeling that Berma\u2019s genius was not, perhaps, very accurately represented by this affirmation of my preference, or this award to her of a \u2018first\u2019 place, whatever the peace of mind that it might incidentally restore to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as the curtain was rising on this second play I looked up at Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s box. The Princess was in the act \u2014 by a movement that called into being an exquisite line which my mind pursued into the void \u2014 of turning her head towards the back of the box; her party were all standing, and also turning towards the back, and between the double hedge which they thus formed, with all the assurance, the grandeur of the goddess that she was, but with a strange meekness which so late an arrival, making every one else get up in the middle of the performance, blended with the white muslin in which she was attired, just as an adroitly compounded air of simplicity, shyness and confusion tempered her triumphant smile, the Duchesse de Guermantes, who had at that moment entered the box, came towards her cousin, made a profound obeisance to a young man with fair hair who was seated in the front row, and turning again towards the amphibian monsters who were floating in the recesses of the cavern, gave to these demi-gods of the Jockey Club \u2014 who at that moment, and among them all M. de Palancy in particular, were the men whom I should most have liked to be \u2014 the familiar \u2018good evening\u2019 of an old and intimate friend, an allusion to the daily sequence of her relations with them during the last fifteen years. I felt the mystery, but could not solve the riddle of that smiling gaze which she addressed to her friends, in the azure brilliance with which it glowed while she surrendered her hand to one and then to another, a gaze which, could I have broken up its prism, analysed its crystallisation, might perhaps have revealed to me the essential quality of the unknown form of life which became apparent in it at that moment. The Duc de Guermantes followed his wife, the flash of his monocle, the gleam of his teeth, the whiteness of his carnation or of his pleated shirt-front scattering, to make room for their light, the darkness of his eyebrows, lips and coat; with a wave of his outstretched hand which he let drop on to their shoulders, vertically, without moving his head, he commanded the inferior monsters, who were making way for him, to resume their seats, and made a profound bow to the fair young man. One would have said that the Duchess had guessed that her cousin, of whom, it was rumoured, she was inclined to make fun for what she called her \u2018exaggerations\u2019 (a name which, from her own point of view, so typically French and restrained, would naturally be applied to the poetry and enthusiasm of the Teuton), would be wearing this evening one of those costumes in which the Duchess thought of her as \u2018dressed up,\u2019 and that she had decided to give her a lesson in good taste. Instead of the wonderful downy plumage which, from the crown of the Princess\u2019s head, fell and swept her throat, instead of her net of shells and pearls, the Duchess wore in her hair only a simple aigrette, which, rising above her arched nose and level eyes, reminded one of the crest on the head of a bird. Her neck and shoulders emerged from a drift of snow-white muslin, against which fluttered a swansdown fan, but below this her gown, the bodice of which had for its sole ornament innumerable spangles (either little sticks and beads of metal, or possibly brilliants), moulded her figure with a precision that was positively British. But different as their two costumes were, after the Princess had given her cousin the chair in which she herself had previously been sitting, they could be seen turning to gaze at one another in mutual appreciation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possibly a smile would curve the lips of Mme. de Guermantes when next day she referred to the headdress, a little too complicated, which the Princess had worn, but certainly she would declare that it had been, all the same, quite lovely, and marvellously arranged; and the Princess, whose own tastes found something a little cold, a little austere, a little \u2018tailor-made\u2019 in her cousin\u2019s way of dressing, would discover in this rigid sobriety an exquisite refinement. Moreover the harmony that existed between them, the universal and pre-established gravitation exercised by their upbringing, neutralised the contrasts not only in their apparel but in their attitude. By those invisible magnetic longitudes which the refinement of their manners traced between them the expansive nature of the Princess was stopped short, while on the other side the formal correctness of the Duchess allowed itself to be attracted and relaxed, turned to sweetness and charm. As, in the play which was now being performed, to realise how much personal poetry Berma extracted from it one had only to entrust the part which she was playing, which she alone could play, to no matter what other actress, so the spectator who should raise his eyes to the balcony might see in two smaller boxes there how an \u2018arrangement\u2019 supposed to suggest that of the Princesse de Guermantes simply made the Baronne de Morienval appear eccentric, pretentious and ill-bred, while an effort, as painstaking as it must have been costly, to imitate the clothes and style of the Duchesse de Guermantes only made Mme. de Cambremer look like some provincial schoolgirl, mounted on wires, rigid, erect, dry, angular, with a plume of raven\u2019s feathers stuck vertically in her hair. Perhaps the proper place for this lady was not a theatre in which it was only with the brightest stars of the season that the boxes (even those in the highest tier, which from below seemed like great hampers brimming with human flowers and fastened to the gallery on which they stood by the red cords of their plush-covered partitions) composed a panorama which deaths, scandals, illnesses, quarrels would soon alter, but which this evening was held motionless by attention, heat, giddiness, dust, smartness or boredom, in that so to speak everlasting moment of unconscious waiting and calm torpor which, in retrospect, seems always to have preceded the explosion of a bomb or the first flicker of a fire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The explanation of Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s presence on this occasion was that the Princesse de Parme, devoid of snobbishness as are most truly royal personages, and to make up for this devoured by a pride in and passion for charity which held an equal place in her heart with her taste for what she believed to be the Arts, had bestowed a few boxes here and there upon women like Mme. de Cambremer who were not numbered among the highest aristocratic society but with whom she was connected in various charitable undertakings. Mme. de Cambremer never took her eyes off the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes, which was all the simpler for her since, not being actually acquainted with either, she could not be suspected of angling for recognition. Inclusion in the visiting lists of these two great ladies was nevertheless the goal towards which she had been marching for the last ten years with untiring patience. She had calculated that she might reach it, possibly, in five years more. But having been smitten by a relentless malady, the inexorable character of which \u2014 for she prided herself upon her medical knowledge \u2014 she thought she knew, she was afraid that she might not live so long. This evening she was happy at least in the thought that all these women whom she barely knew would see in her company a man who was one of their own set, the young Marquis de Beausergent, Mme. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s brother, who moved impartially in both worlds and with whom the women of the second were greatly delighted to bedizen themselves before the eyes of those of the first. He was seated behind Mme. de Cambremer on a chair placed at an angle, so that he might rake the other boxes with his glasses. He knew everyone in the house, and, to greet his friends, with the irresistible charm of his beautifully curved figure, and fine fair head, he half rose from his seat, stiffening his body, a smile brightening his blue eyes, with a blend of deference and detachment, a picture delicately engraved, in its rectangular frame, and placed at an angle to the wall, like one of those old prints which portray a great nobleman in his courtly pride. He often accepted these invitations to go with Mme. de Cambremer to the play. In the theatre itself, and on their way out, in the lobby, he stood gallantly by her side in the thick of the throng of more brilliant friends whom he saw about him, and to whom he refrained from speaking, to avoid any awkwardness, just as though he had been in doubtful company. If at such moments there swept by him the Princesse de Guermantes, lightfoot and fair as Diana, letting trail behind her the folds of an incomparable cloak, turning after her every head and followed by every eye (and, most of all, by Mme. de Cambremer\u2019s), M. de Beausergent would become absorbed in conversation with his companion, acknowledging the friendly and dazzling smile of the Princess only with constraint, under compulsion, and with the well-bred reserve, the considerate coldness of a person whose friendliness might at the moment have been inconvenient\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had not Mme. de Cambremer known already that the box belonged to the Princess, she could still have told that the Duchesse de Guermantes was the guest from the air of keener interest with which she was surveying the spectacle of stage and stalls, out of politeness to her hostess. But simultaneously with this centrifugal force, an equal and opposite force generated by the same desire to be sociable drew her attention back to her own attire, her plume, her necklace, her bodice and also to that of the Princess, whose subject, whose slave her cousin seemed thus to proclaim herself, come thither solely to see her, ready to follow her elsewhere should it have taken the fancy of the official occupant of the box to rise and leave, and regarding as composed merely of strangers, worth looking at simply as curiosities, the rest of the house, in which, nevertheless, she numbered many friends to whose boxes she regularly repaired on other evenings and with regard to whom she never failed on those occasions to demonstrate a similar loyalism, exclusive, conditional and hebdomadary. Mme. de Cambremer was surprised to see her there that evening. She knew that the Duchess was staying on very late at Guermantes, and had supposed her to be there still. But she had been told, also, that sometimes, when there was some special function in Paris which she considered it worth her while to attend, Mme. de Guermantes would order one of her carriages to be brought round as soon as she had taken tea with the guns, and, as the sun was setting, start out at a spanking pace through the gathering darkness of the forest, then over the high road, to join the train at Combray and so be in Paris the same evening. \u201cPerhaps she has come up from Guermantes on purpose to hear Berma,\u201d thought Mme. de Cambremer, and marvelled at the thought. And she remembered having heard Swann say in that ambiguous jargon which he used in common with M. de Charlus: \u201cThe Duchess is one of the noblest souls in Paris, the cream of the most refined, the choicest society.\u201d For myself, who derived from the names Guermantes, Bavaria and Cond\u00e9 what I imagined to be the life, the thoughts of the two cousins (I could no longer so ascribe their faces, having seen them), I would rather have had their opinion of Ph\u00e8dre than that of the greatest critic in the world. For in his I should have found merely intellect, an intellect superior to my own but similar in kind. But what the Duchesse and Princesse de Guermantes might think, an opinion which would have furnished me with an invaluable clue to the nature of these two poetic creatures, I imagined with the aid of their names, I endowed with an irrational charm, and, with the thirst, the longing of a fever-stricken wretch, what I demanded that their opinion of Ph\u00e8dre should yield to me was the charm of the summer afternoons that I had spent in wandering along the Guermantes way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Cambremer was trying to make out how exactly the cousins were dressed. For my own part, I never doubted that their garments were peculiar to themselves, not merely in the sense in which the livery with red collar or blue facings had belonged once exclusively to the houses of Guermantes and Cond\u00e9, but rather as is peculiar to a bird the plumage which, as well as being a heightening of its beauty, is an extension of its body. The toilet of these two ladies seemed to me like a materialisation, snow-white or patterned with colour, of their internal activity, and, like the gestures which I had seen the Princesse de Guermantes make, with no doubt in my own mind that they corresponded to some idea latent in hers, the plumes which swept downward from her brow, and her cousin\u2019s glittering spangled bodice seemed each to have a special meaning, to be to one or the other lady an attribute which was hers and hers alone, the significance of which I would eagerly have learned; the bird of paradise seemed inseparable from its wearer as her peacock is from Juno, and I did not believe that any other woman could usurp that spangled bodice, any more than the fringed and flashing aegis of Minerva. And when I turned my eyes to their box, far more than on the ceiling of the theatre, painted with cold and lifeless allegories, it was as though I had seen, thanks to a miraculous rending of the clouds that ordinarily veiled it, the Assembly of the Gods in the act of contemplating the spectacle of mankind, beneath a crimsor canopy, in a clear lighted space, between two pillars of Heaven. I gazed on this brief transfiguration with a disturbance which was partly soothed by the feeling that I myself was unknown to these Immortals; the Duchess had indeed seen me once with her husband, but could surely have kept no memory of that, and it gave me no pain that she found herself, owing to the place that she occupied in the box, in a position to gaze down upon the nameless, collective madrepores of the public in the stalls, for I had the happy sense that my own personality had been dissolved in theirs, when, at the moment in which, by the force of certain optical laws, there must, I suppose, have come to paint itself on the impassive current of those blue eyes the blurred outline of the protozoon, devoid of any individual existence, which was myself, I saw a ray illumine them; the Duchess, goddess turned woman, and appearing in that moment a thousand times more lovely, raised, pointed in my direction the white-gloved hand which had been resting on the balustrade of the box, waved it at me in token of friendship; my gaze felt itself trapped in the spontaneous incandescence of the flashing eyes of the Princess, who had unconsciously set them ablaze merely by turning her head to see who it might be that her cousin was thus greeting, while the Duchess, who had remembered me, showered upon me the sparkling and celestial torrent of her smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now every morning, long before the hour at which she would appear, I went by a devious course to post myself at the corner of the street along which she generally came, and, when the moment of her arrival seemed imminent, strolled homewards with an air of being absorbed in something else, looking the other way and raising my eyes to her face as I drew level with her, but as though I had not in the least expected to see her. Indeed, for the first few mornings, so as to be sure of not missing her, I waited opposite the house. And every time that the carriage gate opened (letting out one after another so many people who were none of them she for whom I was waiting) its grinding rattle continued in my heart in a series of oscillations which it took me a long time to subdue. For never was devotee of a famous actress whom he did not know, posting himself and patrolling the pavement outside the stage door, never was angry or idolatrous crowd, gathered to insult or to carry in triumph through the streets the condemned assassin or the national hero whom it believes to be on the point of coming whenever a sound is heard from the inside of the prison or the palace, never were these so stirred by their emotion as I was, awaiting the emergence of this great lady who in her simple attire was able, by the grace of her movements (quite different from the gait she affected on entering a drawing-room or a box), to make of her morning walk \u2014 and for me there was no one in the world but herself out walking \u2014 a whole poem of elegant refinement and the finest ornament, the most curious flower of the season. But after the third day, so that the porter should not discover my stratagem, I betook myself much farther afield, to some point upon the Duchess\u2019s usual route. Often before that evening at the theatre I had made similar little excursions before luncheon when the weather was fine; if it had been raining, at the first gleam of sunshine I would hasten downstairs to take a turn, and if, suddenly, coming towards me, on the still wet pavement changed by the sun into a golden lacquer, in the transformation scene of a crossroads dusty with a grey mist which the sun tanned and gilded, I caught sight of a schoolgirl followed by her governess or of a dairy-maid with her white sleeves, I stood motionless, my hand pressed to my heart which was already leaping towards an unexplored form of life; I tried to bear in mind the street, the time, the number of the door through which the girl (whom I followed sometimes) had vanished and failed to reappear. Fortunately the fleeting nature of these cherished images, which I promised myself that I would make an effort to see again, prevented them from fixing themselves with any vividness in my memory. No matter, I was less sad now at the thought of my own ill health, of my never having summoned up courage to set to work, to begin a book, the world appeared to me now a pleasanter place to live in, life a more interesting experience now that I had learned that the streets of Paris, like the roads round Balbec, were aflower with those unknown beauties whom I had so often sought to evoke from the woods of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, each one of whom aroused a sensual longing which she alone appeared capable of assuaging\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On coming home from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique I had added for next morning to the list of those which for some days past I had been hoping to meet again the form of Mme. de Guermantes, tall, with her high-piled crown of silky, golden hair; with the kindness promised me in the smile which she had directed at me from her cousin\u2019s box. I would follow the course which Fran\u00e7oise had told me that the Duchess generally took, and I would try at the same time, in the hope of meeting two girls whom I had seen a few days earlier, not to miss the break-up of their respective class and catechism. But in the mean time, ever and again, the scintillating smile of Mme. de Guermantes, the pleasant sensation it had given me, returned. And without exactly knowing what I was doing, I tried to find a place for them (as a woman studies the possible effect on her dress of some set of jewelled buttons that have just been given her) beside the romantic ideas which I had long held and which Albertine\u2019s coldness, Gis\u00e8le\u2019s premature departure, ana before them my deliberate and too long sustained separation from Gilberte, had set free (the idea, for instance of being loved by a woman, of having a life in common with her); next, it had been the image of one or other of the two girls seen in the street that I brought into relation with those ideas, to which immediately afterwards I was trying to adapt my memory of the Duchess. Compared with those ideas my memory of Mme. de Guermantes at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique was a very little thing, a tiny star twinkling beside the long tail of a blazing comet; moreover I had been quite familiar with the ideas long before I came to know Mme. de Guermantes; my memory of her, on the contrary, I possessed but imperfectly; every now and then it escaped me; it was during the hours when, from floating vaguely in my mind in the same way as the images of various other pretty women, it passed gradually into a unique and definite association \u2014 exclusive of every other feminine form \u2014 with those romantic ideas of so much longer standing than itself, it was during those few hours in which I remembered it most clearly that I ought to have taken steps to find out exactly what it was; but I did not then know the importance which it was to assume for me; it was pleasant merely as a first private meeting with Mme. de Guermantes inside myself, it was the first, the only accurate sketch, the only one taken from life, the only one that was really Mme. de Guermantes; during the few hours in which I was fortunate enough to retain it without having the sense to pay it any attention, it must all the same have been charming, that memory, since it was always to it, and quite freely moreover, to that moment, without haste, without strain, without the slightest compulsion or anxiety, that my ideas of love returned; then, as gradually those ideas fixed it more definitely, it acquired from them a proportionately greater strength but itself became more vague; presently I could no longer recapture it; and in my dreams I probably altered it completely, for whenever I saw Mme. de Guermantes I realised the difference \u2014 never twice, as it happened, the same \u2014 between what I had imagined and what I saw. And now every morning, certainly at the moment when Mme. de Guermantes emerged from her gateway at the top of the street I saw again her tall figure, her face with its bright eyes and crown of silken hair \u2014 all the things for which I was there waiting; but, on the other hand, a minute or two later, when, having first turned my eyes away so as to appear not to be waiting for this encounter which I had come out to seek, I raised them to look at the Duchess at the moment in which we converged, what I saw then were red patches (as to which I knew not whether they were due to the fresh air or to a faulty complexion) on a sullen face which with the curtest of nods, a long way removed from the affability of the Ph\u00e8dre evening, acknowledged my salute, which I addressed to her daily with an air of surprise, and which did not seem to please her. And yet, after a few days, during which the memory of the two girls fought against heavy odds for the mastery of my amorous feelings against that of Mme. de Guermantes, it was in the end the latter which, as though of its own accord, generally prevailed while its competitors withdrew; it was to it that I finally found myself, deliberately moreover, and as though by preference and for my own pleasure, to have transferred all my thoughts of love. I had ceased to dream of the little girls coming from their catechism, or of a certain dairy-maid; and yet I had also lost all hope of encountering in the street what I had come out to seek, either the affection promised to me, at the theatre, in a smile, or the profile, the bright face beneath its pile of golden hair which were so only when seen from afar. Now I should not even have been able to say what Mme. de Guermantes was like, by what I recognised her, for every day, in the picture which she presented as a whole, the face was different, as were the dress and the hat\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Why did I one morning, when I saw bearing down on me beneath a violet hood a sweet, smooth face whose charms were symmetrically arranged about a pair of blue eyes, a face in which the curve of the nose seemed to have been absorbed, gauge from a joyous commotion in my bosom that I was not going to return home without having caught a glimpse of Mme. de Guermantes; and on the next feel the same disturbance, affect the same indifference, turn away my eyes in the same careless manner as on the day before, on the apparition, seen in profile as she crossed from a side street and crowned by a navy-blue toque, of a beak-like nose bounding a flushed cheek chequered with a piercing eye, like some Egyptian deity? Once it was not merely a woman with a bird\u2019s beak that I saw but almost the bird itself; the outer garments, even the toque of Mme. de Guermantes were of fur, and since she thus left no cloth visible, she seemed naturally furred, like certain vultures whose thick, smooth, dusky, downy plumage suggests rather the skin of a wild beast. From the midst of this natural plumage, the tiny head arched out its beak and the two eyes on its surface were piercing-keen and blue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day I had been pacing up and down the street for hours on end without a vestige of Mme. de Guermantes when suddenly, inside a pastrycook\u2019s shop tucked in between two of the mansions of this aristocratic and plebeian quarter, there appeared, took shape the vague and unfamiliar face of a fashionably dressed woman who was asking to see some little cakes, and, before I had had time to make her out, there shot forth at me like a lightning flash, reaching me sooner than its accompaniment of thunder, the glance of the Duchess; another time, having failed to meet her and hearing twelve strike, I realised that it was not worth my while to wait for her any longer, I Was sorrowfully making my way homewards; and, absorbed in my own disappointment, looking absently after and not seeing a carriage that had overtaken me, I realised suddenly that the movement of her head which I saw a lady make through the carriage window was meant for me, and that this lady, whose features, relaxed and pale, or it might equally be tense and vivid, composed, beneath a round hat which nestled at the foot of a towering plume, the face of a stranger whom I had supposed that I did not know, was Mme. de Guermantes, by whom I had let myself be greeted without so much as acknowledging her bow. And sometimes I came upon her as I entered the gate, standing outside the lodge where the detestable porter whose scrutinous eye I loathed and dreaded was in the act of making her a profound obeisance and also, no doubt, his daily report. For the entire staff of the Guermantes household, hidden behind the window curtains, were trembling as they watched a conversation which they were unable to overhear, but which meant as they very well knew that one or other of them would certainly have his \u2018day out\u2019 stopped by the Duchess to whom this Cerberus was betraying him. In view of the whole series of different faces which Mme. Guermantes displayed thus one after another, faces that occupied a relative and varying extent, contracted one day, vast the next, in her person and attire as a whole, my love was not attached to any one of those changeable and ever-changing elements of flesh and fabric which replaced one another as day followed day, and which she could modify, could almost entirely reconstruct without altering my disturbance because beneath them, beneath the new collar and the strange cheek, I felt that it was still Mme. de Guermantes. What I loved was the invisible person who set all this outward show in motion, her whose hostility so distressed me, whose approach set me trembling, whose life I would fain have made my own and driven out of it her friends. She might flaunt a blue feather or shew a fiery cheek without her actions\u2019 losing their importance for me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should not myself have felt that Mme. de Guermantes was tired of meeting me day after day, had I not learned it indirectly by reading it on the face, stiff with coldness, disapproval and pity which Fran\u00e7oise shewed when she was helping me to get ready for these morning walks. The moment I asked her for my outdoor things I felt a contrary wind arise in her worn and battered features. I made no attempt to win her confidence, for I knew that I should not succeed. She had, for at once discovering any unpleasant thing that might have happened to my parents or myself, a power the nature of which I have never been able to fathom. Perhaps it was not supernatural, but was to be explained by sourees of information that were open to her alone: as it may happen that the news which often reaches a savage tribe several days before the post has brought it to the European colony has really been transmitted to them not by telepathy but from hill-top to hill-top by a chain of beacon fires. So, in the particular instance of my morning walks, possibly Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s servants had heard their mistress say how tired she was of running into me every day without fail wherever she went, and had repeated her remarks to Fran\u00e7oise. My parents might, it is true, have attached some servant other than Fran\u00e7oise to my person, still I should have been no better off. Fran\u00e7oise was in a sense less of a servant than the others. In her way of feeling things, of being kind and pitiful, hard and distant, superior and narrow, of combining a white skin with red hands, she was still the village maiden whose parents had had \u2018a place of their own\u2019 but having come to grief had been obliged to put her into service. Her presence in our household was the country air, the social life of a farm of fifty years ago wafted to us by a sort of reversal of the normal order of travel whereby it is the place that comes to visit the person. As the glass cases in a local museum are filled with specimens of the curious handiwork which the peasants still carve or embroider or whatever it may be in certain parts of the country, so our flat in Paris was decorated with the words of Fran\u00e7oise, inspired by a traditional local sentiment and governed by extremely ancient laws. And she could in Paris find her way back as though by clues of coloured thread to the songbirds and cherry trees of her childhood, to her mother\u2019s deathbed, which she still vividly saw. But in spite of all this wealth of background, once she had come to Paris and had entered our service she had acquired \u2014 as, obviously, anyone else coming there in her place would have acquired \u2014 the ideas, the system of interpretation used by the servants on the other floors, compensating for the respect which she was obliged to shew to us by repeating the rude words that the cook on the fourth floor had used to her mistress, with a servile gratification so intense that, for the first time in our lives, feeling a sort of solidarity between ourselves and the detestable occupant of the fourth floor flat, we said to ourselves that possibly we too were \u2018employers\u2019 after all. This alteration in Fran\u00e7oise\u2019\u00bb character was perhaps inevitable. Certain forms of existence are so abnormal that they are bound to produce certain characteristic faults; such was the life led by the King at Versailles among his courtiers, a life as strange as that of a Pharaoh or a Doge \u2014 and, far more even than his, the life of his courtiers. The life led by our servants is probably of an even more monstrous abnormality, which only its familiarity can prevent us from seeing. But it was actually in details more intimate still that I should have been obliged, if I had dismissed Fran\u00e7oise, to keep the same servant. For various others might, in years to come, enter my service; already furnished with the defects common to all servants, they underwent nevertheless a rapid transformation with me. As, in the rules of tactics, an attack in one sector compels a counter-attack in another, so as not to be hurt by the asperities of my nature, all of them effected in their own an identical resilience, always at the same points, and to make up for this took advantage of the gaps in my line to thrust out advanced posts. Of these gaps I knew nothing, any more than of the salients to which they gave rise, precisely because they were gaps. But my servants, by gradually becoming spoiled, taught me of their existence. It was from the defects which they invariably acquired that I learned what were my own natural and invariable shortcomings; their character offered me a sort of negative plate of my own. We had always laughed, my mother and I, at Mme. Sazerat, who used, in speaking of her servants, expressions like \u2018the lower orders\u2019 or \u2018the servant class.\u2019 But I am bound to admit that what made it useless to think of replacing Fran\u00e7oise by anyone else was that her successor would inevitably have belonged just as much to the race of servants in general and to the class of my servants in particular\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to Fran\u00e7oise, I never in my life experienced any humiliation without having seen beforehand on her face a store of condolences prepared and waiting; and if then in my anger at the thought of being pitied by her I tried to pretend that on the contrary I had scored a distinct success, my lies broke feebly on the wall of her respectful but obvious unbelief and the consciousness that she enjoyed of her own infallibility. For she knew the truth. She refrained from uttering it, and made only a slight movement with her lips as if she still bad her mouth full and was finishing a tasty morsel. She refrained from uttering it, or so at least I long believed, for at that time I still supposed that it was by means of words that one communicated the truth to others. Indeed the words that people used to me recorded their meaning so unalterably on the sensitive plate of my mind that I could no more believe it to be possible that anyone who had professed to love me did not love me than Fran\u00e7oise herself could have doubted when she had read it in a newspaper that some clergyman or gentleman was prepared, on receipt of a stamped envelope, to furnish us free of charge with an infallible remedy for every known complaint or with the means of multiplying our income an hundredfold. (If, on the other hand, our doctor were to prescribe for her the simplest ointment to cure a cold in the head, she, so stubborn to endure the keenest suffering, would complain bitterly of what she had been made to sniff, insisting that it tickled her nose and that life was not worth living.) But she was the first person to prove to me by her example (which I was not to understand until, long afterwards, when it was given me afresh and to my greater discomfort, as will be found in the later volumes of this work, by a person who was dearer to me than Fran\u00e7oise) that the truth has no need to be uttered to be made apparent, and that one may perhaps gather it with more certainty, without waiting for words, without even bothering one\u2019s head about them, from a thousand outward signs, even from certain invisible phenomena, analogous in the sphere of human character to what in nature are atmospheric changes. I might perhaps have suspected this. since to myself at that time it frequently occurred that I said things in which there was no vestige of truth, while I made the real truth plain by all manner of involuntary confidences expressed by my body and in my actions (which were at once interpreted by Fran\u00e7oise); I ought perhaps to have suspected it, but to do so I should first have had to be conscious that I myself was occasionally untruthful and dishonest. Now untruthfulness and dishonesty were with me, as with most people; called into being in so immediate, so contingent a fashion, and in self-defence, by some particular interest, that my mind, fixed on some lofty ideal, allowed my character, in the darkness below, to set about those urgent, sordid tasks, and did net look down to observe them. When Fran\u00e7oise, in the evening, was polite to me, and asked my permission before sitting down in my room, it seemed as though her face became transparent and I could see the goodness and honesty that lay beneath. But Jupien, who had lapses into indiscretion of which I learned only later, revealed afterwards that she had told him that I was not worth the price of a rope to hang me, and that I had tried to insult her in every possible way. These words of Jupien set up at once before my eyes, in new and strange colours, a print of the picture of my relations with Fran\u00e7oise so different from that on which I used to like letting my eyes rest, and in which, without the least possibility of doubt, Fran\u00e7oise adored me and lost no opportunity of singing my praises, that I realised that it is not only the material world that is different from the aspect in which we see it; that all reality is perhaps equally dissimilar from what we think ourselves to be directly perceiving; that the trees, the sun and the sky would not be the same as what we see if they were apprehended by creatures having eyes differently constituted from ours, or, better still, endowed for that purpose with organs other than eyes which would furnish trees and sky and sun with equivalents, though not visual. However that might be, this sudden outlet which Jupien threw open for me upon the real world appalled me. So far it was only Fran\u00e7oise that was revealed, and of her I barely thought. Was it the same with all one\u2019s social relations? And in what depths of despair might this not some day plunge me, if it were the same with love? That was the future\u2019s secret. For the present only Fran\u00e7oise was concerned. Did she sincerely believe what she had said to Jupien? Had she said it to embroil Jupien with me, possibly so that we should not appoint Jupien\u2019s girl as her successor? At any rate I realised the impossibility of obtaining any direct and certain knowledge of whether Fran\u00e7oise loved or lothed me. And thus it was she who first gave me the idea that a person does not (as I had imagined) stand motionless and clear before our eyes with his merits, his defects, his plans, his intentions with regard to ourself exposed on his surface, like a garden at which, with all its borders spread out before us, we gaze through a railing, but is a shadow which we can never succeed in penetrating, of which there can be no such thing as direct knowledge, with respect to which we form countless beliefs, based upon his words and sometimes upon his actions, though neither words nor actions can give us anything but inadequate and as it proves contradictory information \u2014 a shadow behind which we can alternately imagine, with equal justification, that there burns the flame of hatred and of love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was genuinely in love with Mme. de Guermantes. The greatest happiness that I could have asked of God would have been that He should overwhelm her under every imaginable calamity, and that ruined, despised, stripped of all the privileges that divided her from me, having no longer any home of her own or people who would condescend to speak to her, she should come to me for refuge. I imagined her doing so. And indeed on those evenings when some change in the atmosphere or in my own condition brought to the surface of my consciousness some forgotten scroll on which were recorded impressions of other days, instead of profiting by the refreshing strength that had been generated in me, instead of employing it to decipher in my own mind thoughts which as a rule escaped me, instead of setting myself at last to work, I preferred to relate aloud, to plan out in the third person, with a flow of invention as useless as was my declamation of it, a whole novel crammed with adventure, in which the Duchess, fallen upon misfortune, came to implore assistance from me \u2014 me who had become, by a converse change of circumstances, rich and powerful. And when I had let myself thus for hours on end imagine the circumstances, rehearse the sentences with which I should welcome the Duchess beneath my roof, the situation remained unaltered; I had, alas, in reality, chosen to love the very woman who, in her own person, combined perhaps the greatest possible number of different advantages; in whose eyes, accordingly, I could not hope, myself, ever to cut any figure; for she was as rich as the richest commoner \u2014 and noble also; without reckoning that personal charm which set her at the pinnacle of fashion, made her among the rest a sort of queen\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt that I was annoying her by crossing her path in this way every morning; but even if I had had the courage to refrain, for two or three days consecutively, from doing so, perhaps that abstention, which would have represented so great a sacrifice on my part, Mme. de Guermantes would not have noticed, or would have set it down to some obstacle beyond my control. And indeed I could not have succeeded in making myself cease to track her down except by arranging that it should be impossible for me to do so, for the need incessantly reviving in me to meet her, to be for a moment the object of her attention, the person to whom her bow was addressed, was stronger than my fear of arousing her displeasure. I should have had to go away for some time; and for that I had not the heart. I did think of it more than once. I would then tell Fran\u00e7oise to pack my boxes, and immediately afterwards to unpack them. And as the spirit of imitation, the desire not to appear behind the times, alters the most natural and most positive form of oneself, Fran\u00e7oise, borrowing the expression from her daughter\u2019s vocabulary, used to remark that I was \u2018dippy.\u2019 She did not approve of this; she said that I was always \u2018balancing,\u2019 for she made use, when she was not aspiring to rival the moderns, of the language of Saint-Simon. It is true that she liked it still less when I spoke to her as master to servant. She knew that this was not natural to me, and did not suit me, a condition which she rendered in words as \u2018where there isn\u2019t a will.\u2019 I should never have had the heart to leave Paris except in a direction that would bring me closer to Mme. de Guermantes. This was by no means an impossibility. Should I not indeed find myself nearer to her than I was in the morning, in the street, solitary, abashed, feeling that not a single one of the thoughts which I should have liked to convey to her ever reached her, in that weary patrolling up and down of walks which might be continued, day after day, for ever without the slightest advantage to myself, if I were to go miles away from Mme. de Guermantes, but go to some one of her acquaintance, some one whom she knew to be particular in the choice of his friends and who would appreciate my good qualities, would be able to speak to her about me, and if not to obtain it from her at least to make her know what I wanted, some one by means of whom, in any event, simply because I should discuss with him whether or not it would be possible for him to convey this or that message to her, I should give to my solitary and silent meditations a new form, spoken, active, which would seem an advance, almost a realisation. What she did during the mysterious daily life of the \u2018Guermantes\u2019 that she was \u2014 this was the constant object of my thoughts; and to break through the mystery, even by indirect means, as with a lever, by employing the services of a person to whom were not forbidden the town house of the Duchess, her parties, unrestricted conversation with her, would not that be a contact more distant but at the same time more effective than my contemplation of her every morning in the street?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The friendship, the admiration that Saint-Loup felt for me seemed to me undeserved and had hitherto left me unmoved. All at once I attached a value to them, I would have liked him to disclose them to Mme. de Guermantes, I was quite prepared even to ask him to do so. For when we are in love, all the trifling little privileges that we enjoy we would like to be able to divulge to the woman we love, as people who have been disinherited and bores of other kinds do to us in everyday life. We are distressed by her ignorance of them; we seek consolation in the thought that just because they are never visible she has perhaps added to the opinion which she already had of us this possibility of further advantages that must remain unknown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup had not for a long time been able to come to Paris, whether, as he himself explained, on account of his military duties, or, as was more likely, on account of the trouble that he was having with his mistress, with whom he had twice now been on the point of breaking off relations. He had often told me what a pleasure it would be to him if I came to visit him at that garrison town, the name of which, a couple of days after his leaving Balbec, had caused me so much joy when I had read it on the envelope of the first letter I received from my friend. It was (not so far from Balbec as its wholly inland surroundings might have led one to think) one of those little fortified towns, aristocratic and military, set in a broad expanse of country over which on fine days there floats so often into the distance a sort of intermittent haze of sound which \u2014 as a screen of poplars by its sinuosities outlines the course of a river which one cannot see \u2014 indicates the movements of a regiment on parade, so that the very atmosphere of its streets, avenues and squares has been gradually tuned to a sort of perpetual vibration, musical and martial, while the most ordinary note of cartwheel or tramway is prolonged in vague trumpet calls, indefinitely repeated, to the hallucinated ear, by the silence. It was not too far away from Paris for me to be able, if I took the express, to return, join my mother and grandmother and sleep in my own bed. As soon as I realised this, troubled by a painful longing, I had too little will power to decide not to return to Paris but rather to stay in this town; but also too little to prevent a porter from carrying my luggage to a cab and not to adopt, as I walked behind him, the unburdened mind of a traveller who is looking after his luggage and for whom no grandmother is waiting anywhere at home, to get into the carriage with the complete detachment of a person who, having ceased to think of what it is that he wants, has the air of knowing what he wants, and to give the driver the address of the cavalry barracks. I thought that Saint-Loup might come to sleep that night at the hotel at which I should be staying, so as to make less painful for me the first shock of contact with this strange town. One of the guard went to find him, and I waited at the barrack gate, before that huge ship of stone, booming with the November wind, out of which, every moment, for it was now six o\u2019clock, men were emerging in pairs into the street, staggering as if they were coming ashore in some foreign port in which they found themselves temporarily anchored\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup appeared, moving like a whirlwind, his eyeglass spinning in the air before him; I had not given my name, I was eager to enjoy his surprise and delight. \u201cOh! What a bore!\u201d he exclaimed, suddenly catching sight of me, and blushing to the tips of his ears. \u201cI have just had a week\u2019s leave, and I shan\u2019t be off duty again for another week.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, preoccupied by the thought of my having to spend this first night alone, for he knew better than anyone my bed-time agonies, which he had often remarked and soothed at Balbec, he broke off his lamentation to turn and look at me, coax me with little smiles, with tender though unsymmetrical glances, half of them coming directly from his eye, the other half through his eyeglass, but both sorts alike an allusion to the emotion that he felt on seeing me again, an allusion also to that important matter which I did not always understand but which concerned me now vitally, our friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say! Where are you going to sleep? Really, I can\u2019t recommend the hotel where we mess; it is next to the Exhibition ground, where there\u2019s a show just starting; you\u2019ll find it beastly crowded. No, you\u2019d better go to the H\u00f4tel de Flandre; it is a little eighteenth-century palace with old tapestries. It \u2018makes\u2019 quite an \u2018old-world residence.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup employed in every connexion the word \u2018makes\u2019 for \u2018has the air of,\u2019 because the spoken language, like the written, feels from time to time the need of these alterations in the meanings of words, these refinements of expression. And just as journalists often have not the least idea from what school of literature come the \u2018turns of speech\u2019 that they borrow, so the vocabulary, the very diction of Saint-Loup were formed in imitation of three different aesthetes, none of whom he knew personally but whose way of speaking had been indirectly instilled into him. \u201cBesides,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthe hotel I mean is more or less adapted to your supersensitiveness of hearing. You will have no neighbours. I quite see that it is a slender advantage, and as, after all, another visitor may arrive to-morrow, it would not be worth your while to choose that particular hotel with so precarious an object in view. No, it is for its appeal to the eye that I recommend it. The rooms are quite attractive, all the furniture is old and comfortable; there is something reassuring about that.\u201d But to me, less of an artist than Saint-Loup, the pleasure that an attractive house could give was superficial, almost non-existent, and could not calm my growing anguish, as painful as that which I used to feel long ago at Combray when my mother did not come upstairs to say good night, or that which I felt on the evening of my arrival at Balbec in the room with the unnaturally high ceiling, which smelt of flowering grasses. Saint-Loup read all this in my fixed gaze\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cA lot you care, though, about this charming palace, my poor fellow; you\u2019re quite pale; and here am I like a great brute talking to you about tapestries which you won\u2019t have the heart to look at, even. I know the room they\u2019ll put you in; personally I find it most enlivening, but I can quite understand that it won\u2019t have the same effect on you with your sensitive nature. You mustn\u2019t think I don\u2019t understand; I don\u2019t feel the same myself, but I can put myself in your place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment a serjeant who was exercising a horse on the square, entirely absorbed in making the animal jump, disregarding the salutes of passing troopers, but hurling volleys of oaths at such as got in his way, turned with a smile to Saint-Loup and, seeing that he had a friend with him, saluted us. But his horse at once reared. Saint-Loup flung himself at its head, caught it by the bridle, succeeded in quieting it and returned to my side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he resumed; \u201cI assure you that I fully understand; I feel for you as keenly as you do yourself. I am wretched,\u201d he went on, laying his hand lovingly on my shoulder, \u201cwhen I think that if I could have stayed with you to-night, I might have been able, if we talked till morning, to relieve you of a little of your unhappiness. I can lend you any number of books, but you won\u2019t want to read if you\u2019re feeling like that. And I shan\u2019t be able to get anyone else to take my duty here; I\u2019ve been off now twice running because my girl came down to see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he knitted his brows partly with vexation and also in the effort to decide, like a doctor, what remedy he might best apply to my disease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRun along and light the fire in my quarters,\u201d he called to a trooper who passed us. \u201cHurry up; get a move on!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After which he turned once more to me, and his eyeglass and his peering, myopic gaze hinted an allusion to our great friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo! To see you here, in these barracks where I have spent so much time thinking about you, I can scarcely believe my eyes. I must be dreaming. And how are you? Better, I hope. You must tell me all about yourself presently. We\u2019ll go up to my room; we mustn\u2019t hang about too long on the square, there\u2019s the devil of a draught; I don\u2019t feel it now myself, but you aren\u2019t accustomed to it, I\u2019m afraid of your catching cold. And what about your work; have you started yet? No? You are a quaint fellow! If I had your talent I\u2019m sure I should be writing morning, noon and night. It amuses you more to do nothing? What a pity it is that it\u2019s the useless fellows like me who are always ready to work, and the ones who could if they wanted to, won\u2019t. There, and I\u2019ve clean forgotten to ask you how your grandmother is. Her Proudhons are in safe keeping. I never part from them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An officer, tall, handsome, majestic, emerged with slow and solemn gait from the foot of a staircase. Saint-Loup saluted him and arrested the perpetual instability of his body for the moment occupied in holding his hand against the peak of his cap. But he had flung himself into the action with so much force, straightening himself with so sharp a movement, and, the salute ended, let his hand fall with so abrupt a relaxation, altering all the positions of shoulder, leg, and eyeglass, that this moment was one not so much of immobility as of a throbbing tension in which were neutralised the excessive movements which he had just made and those on which he was about to embark. Meanwhile the officer, without coming any nearer us, calm, benevolent, dignified, imperial, representing, in short, the direct opposite of Saint-Loup, himself also, but without haste, raised his hand to the peak of his cap\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI must just say a word to the Captain,\u201d whispered Saint-Loup. \u201cBe a good fellow, and go and wait for me in my room. It\u2019s the second on the right, on the third floor; I\u2019ll be with you in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And setting off at the double, preceded by his eyeglass which fluttered in every direction, he made straight for the slow and stately Captain whose horse had just been brought round and who, before preparing to mount, was giving orders with a studied nobility of gesture as in some historical painting, and as though he were setting forth to take part in some battle of the First Empire, whereas he was simply going to ride home, to the house which he had taken for the period of his service at Donci\u00e8res, and which stood in a Square that was named, as though in an ironical anticipation of the arrival of this Napoleonid, Place de la R\u00e9publique. I started to climb the staircase, nearly slipping on each of its nail-studded steps, catching glimpses of barrack-rooms, their bare walls edged with a double line of beds and kits. I was shewn Saint-Loup\u2019s room. I stood for a moment outside its closed door, for I could hear some one stirring; he moved something, let fall something else; I felt that the room was not empty, that there must be somebody there. But it was only the freshly lighted fire beginning to burn. It could not keep quiet, it kept shifting its faggots about, and very clumsily. I entered the room; it let one roll into the fender and set another smoking. And even when it was not moving, like an ill-bred person it made noises all the time, which, from the moment I saw the flames rising, revealed themselves to me as noises made by a fire, although if I had been on the other side of a wall I should have thought that they came from some one who was blowing his nose and walking about. I sat down in the room and waited. Liberty hangings and old German stuffs of the eighteenth century managed to rid it of the smell that was exhaled by the rest of the building, a coarse, insipid, mouldy smell like that of stale toast. It was here, in this banning room, that I could have dined and slept with a calm and happy mind Saint-Loup seemed almost to be present by reason of the text-books which littered his table, between his photographs, among which I could make out my own and that of the Duchesse de Guermantes, by the light of the fire which had at length grown accustomed to the grate, and, like an animal crouching in an ardent, noiseless, faithful watchfulness, let fall only now and then a smouldering log which crumbled into sparks, or licked with a tongue of flame the sides of the chimney. I heard the tick of Saint-Loup\u2019s watch, which could not be far away. This tick changed its place every moment \u2018for I could not see the watch; it seemed to come from behind, from in front of me, from my right, from my left, sometimes to die away as though at a great distance. Suddenly I caught sight of the watch on the table. Then I heard the tick in a fixed place from which it did not move again. That is to say, I thought I heard it at this place; I did not hear it there; I saw it there, for sounds have no position in space. Or rather we associate them with movements, and in that way they serve the purpose of warning us of those movements, of appearing to make them necessary and natural. Certainly it happens commonly enough that a sick man whose ears have been stopped with cotton-wool ceases to hear the noise of a fire such as was crackling at that moment in Saint-Loup\u2019s fireplace, labouring at the formation of brands and cinders, which it then lets fall into the fender, nor would he hear the passage of the tramway-cars whose music took its flight, at regular intervals, over the Grand\u2019place of Donci\u00e8res. Let the sick man then read a book, and the pages will turn silently before him, as though they were moved by the fingers of a god. The dull thunder of a bath which is being filled becomes thin, faint and distant as the twittering of birds in the sky. The withdrawal of sound, its dilution, take from it all its power to hurt us; driven mad a moment ago by hammer-blows which seemed to be shattering the ceiling above our head, it is with a quiet delight that we now gather in their sound, light, caressing, distant, like the murmur of leaves playing by the roadside with the passing breeze. We play games of patience with cards which we do not hear, until we imagine that we have not touched them, that they are moving of their own accord, and, anticipating our desire to play with them, have begun to play with us. And in this connexion we may ask ourselves whether, in the case of love (to which indeed we may add the love of life and the love of fame, since there are, it appears, persons who are acquainted with these latter sentiments), we ought not to act like those who, when a noise disturbs them, instead of praying that it may cease, stop their ears; and, with them for our pattern, bring our attention, our defensive strength to bear on ourselves, give ourselves as an objective to capture not the \u2018other person\u2019 with whom we are in love but our capacity for suffering at that person\u2019s hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return to the problem of sounds, we have only to thicken the wads which close the aural passages, and they confine to a pianissimo the girl who has just been playing a boisterous tune overhead; if we go farther, and steep the wad in grease, at once the whole household must obey its despotic rule; its laws extend even beyond our portals. Pianissimo is not enough; the wad instantly orders the piano to be shut, and the music lesson is abruptly ended; the gentleman who was walking up and down in the room above breaks off in the middle of his beat; the movement of carriages and tramways is interrupted as though a Sovereign were expected to pass. And indeed this attenuation of sounds sometimes disturbs our slumbers instead of guarding them. Only yesterday the incessant noise in our ears, by describing to us in a continuous narrative all that was happening in the street and in the house, succeeded at length in making us sleep, like L boring book; to-night, through the sheet of silence that is spread over our sleep a shock, louder than the rest, manages to make itself heard, gentle as a sigh, unrelated to any other sound, mysterious; and the call for an explanation which it emits is sufficient to awaken us. Take away for a moment from the sick man the cotton-wool that has been stopping his ears and in a flash the full daylight, the sun of sound dawns afresh, dazzling him, is born again in his universe; in all haste returns the multitude of exiled sounds; we are present, as though it were the chanting of choirs of angels, at the resurrection of the voice. The empty streets are filled for a moment with the whirr of the swift, consecutive wings of the singing tramway-cars. In the bedroom itself, the sick man has created, not, like Prometheus, fire, but the sound of fire. And when we increase or reduce the wads of cottonwool, it is as though we were pressing alternately one and the other of the two pedals with which we have extended the resonant compass of the outer world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only there are also suppressions of sound which are not temporary. The man who has grown completely deaf cannot even heat a pan of milk by his bedside, but he must keep an eye open to watch, on the tilted lid, for the white, arctic reflexion, like that of a coming snowstorm, which is the warning sign which he is wise to obey, by cutting off (as Our Lord bade the waves be still) the electric current; for already the swelling, jerkily climbing egg of boiling milk-film is reaching its climax in a series of sidelong movements, has filled and set bellying the drooping sails with which the cream has skimmed its surface, sends in a sudden storm a scud of pearly substance flying overboard \u2014 sails which the cutting off of the current, if the electric storm is hushed in time, will fold back upon themselves and let fall with the ebbing tide, changed now to magnolia petals. But if the sick man should not be quick enough in taking the necessary precautions, presently, when his drowned books and watch are seen barely emerging from the milky tide, he will be obliged to call the old nurse who, though he be himself an eminent statesman or a famous writer, will tell him that he has no more sense than a child of five. At other times in the magic chamber, between us and the closed door, a person who was not there a moment ago makes his appearance; it is a visitor whom we did not hear coming in, and who merely gesticulates, like a figure in one of those little puppet theatres, so restful for those who have taken a dislike to the spoken tongue. And for this totally deaf man, since the loss of a sense adds as much beauty to the world as its acquisition, it is with ecstasy that he walks now upon an earth grown almost an Eden, in which sound has not yet been created. The highest waterfalls unfold for his eyes alone their ribbons of crystal, stiller than the glassy sea, like the cascades of Paradise. As sound was for him before his deafness the perceptible form in which the cause of a movement was draped, objects moved without sound seemed to be being moved also without cause; deprived of all resonant quality, they shew a spontaneous activity, seem to be alive. They move, halt, become alight of their own accord. Of their own accord they vanish in the air like the winged monsters of prehistoric days. In the solitary and unneighboured home of the deaf man the service which, before his infirmity was complete, was already shewing an increased discretion, was being carried on in silence, is now assured him with a sort of surreptitious deftness, by mutes, as at the court of a fairy-tale king. And, as upon the stage, the building on which the deaf man looks from his window \u2014 be it barracks, church, or town hall \u2014 is only so much scenery. If one day it should fall to the ground, it may emit a cloud of dust and leave visible ruins; but, less material even than a palace on the stage, though it has not the same exiguity, it will subside in the magic universe without letting the fall of its heavy blocks of stone tarnish, with anything so vulgar as sound, the chastity of the prevailing silence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The silence, though only relative, which reigned in the little barrack-room where I sat waiting was now broken. The door opened and Saint-Loup, dropping his eyeglass, dashed in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, my dear Robert, you make yourself very comfortable here,\u201d I said to him; \u201chow jolly it would be if one were allowed to dine and sleep here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And to be sure, had it not been against the regulations, what repose untinged by sadness I could have tasted there, guarded by that atmosphere of tranquillity, vigilance and gaiety which was maintained by a thousand wills controlled and free from care, a thousand heedless spirits, in that great community called a barracks where, time having taken the form of action, the sad bell that tolled the hours outside was replaced by the same joyous clarion of those martial calls, the ringing memory of which was kept perpetually alive in the paved streets of the town, like the dust that floats in a sunbeam; \u2014 a voice sure of being heard, and musical because it was the command not only of authority to obedience but of wisdom to happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you\u2019d rather stay with me and sleep here, would you, than to go the hotel by yourself?\u201d Saint-Loup asked me, smiling\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Robert, it is cruel of you to be sarcastic about it,\u201d I pleaded; \u201cyou know it\u2019s not possible, and you know how wretched I shall be over there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood! You flatter me!\u201d he replied. \u201cIt occurred to me just now that you would rather stay here to-night. And that is precisely what I stopped to ask the Captain.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd he has given you leave?\u201d I cried\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe hadn\u2019t the slightest objection.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! I adore him!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; that would be going too far. But now, let me just get hold of my batman and tell him to see about our dinner,\u201d he went on, while I turned away so as to hide my tears\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were several times interrupted by one or other of Saint-Loup\u2019s friends\u2019 coming in. He drove them all out again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGet out of here. Buzz off!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I begged him to let them stay\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, really; they would bore you stiff; they are absolutely uncultured; all they can talk about is racing, or stables shop. Besides, I don\u2019t want them here either; they would spoil these precious moments I\u2019ve been looking forward to. But you mustn\u2019t think, when I tell you that these fellows are brainless, that everything military is devoid of intellectuality. Far from it. We have a major here who is a splendid chap. He\u2019s given us a course in which military history is treated like a demonstration, like a problem in algebra. Even from the aesthetic point of view there is a curious beauty, alternately inductive and deductive, about it which you couldn\u2019t fail to appreciate.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s not the officer who\u2019s given me leave to stay here to-night?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; thank God! The man you \u2018adore\u2019 for so very trifling a service is the biggest fool that ever walked the face of the earth. He is perfect at looking after messing, and at kit inspections; he spends hours with the serjeant major and the master tailor. There you have his mentality. Apart from that he has a vast contempt, like everyone here, for the excellent major I was telling you about. No one will speak to him because he\u2019s a freemason and doesn\u2019t go to confession. The Prince de Borodino would never have an outsider like that in his house. Which is pretty fair cheek, when all\u2019s said and done, from a man whose great-grandfather was a small farmer, and who would probably be a small farmer himself if it hadn\u2019t been for the Napoleonic wars. Not that he hasn\u2019t a lurking sense of his own rather ambiguous position in society, where he\u2019s neither flesh nor fowl. He hardly ever shews his face at the Jockey, it makes him feel so deuced awkward, this so-called Prince,\u201d added Robert, who, having been led by the same spirit of imitation to adopt the social theories of his teachers and the worldly prejudices of his relatives, had unconsciously wedded the democratic love of humanity to a contempt for the nobility of the Empire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was looking at the photograph of his aunt, and the thought that, since Saint-Loup had this photograph in his possession, he might perhaps give it to me, made me feel all the fonder of him and hope to do him a thousand services, which seemed to me a very small exchange for it. For this photograph was like one encounter more, added to all those that I had already had, with Mme. de Guermantes; better still, a prolonged encounter, as if, by some sudden stride forward in our relations, she had stopped beside me, in a garden hat, and had allowed me for the first time to gaze at my leisure at that plump cheek, that arched neck, that tapering eyebrow (veiled from me hitherto by the swiftness of her passage, the bewilderment of my impressions, the imperfection of memory); and the contemplation of them, as well as of the bare bosom and arms of a woman whom I had never seen save in a high-necked and long-sleeved bodice, was to me a voluptuous discovery, a priceless favour. Those lines, which had seemed to me almost a forbidden spectacle, I could study there, as in a text-book of the only geometry that had any value for me. Later on, when I looked at Robert, I noticed that he too was a little like the photograph of his aunt, and by a mysterious process which I found almost as moving, since, if his face had not been directly created by hers, the two had nevertheless a common origin. The features of the Duchesse de Guermantes, which were pinned to my vision of Combray, the nose like a falcon\u2019s beak, the piercing eyes, seemed to have served also as a pattern for the cutting out \u2014 in another copy analogous and slender, with too delicate a skin \u2014 of Robert\u2019s face, which might almost be superimposed upon his aunt\u2019s. I saw in him, with a keen longing, those features characteristic of the Guermantes, of that race which had remained so individual in the midst of a world with which it was not confounded, in which it remained isolated in the glory of an ornithomorphic divinity, for it seemed to have been the issue, in the age of mythology, of the union of a goddess with a bird\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert, without being aware of its cause, was touched by my evident affection. This was moreover increased by the sense of comfort inspired in me by the heat of the fire and by the champagne which bedewed at the same time my brow with beads of sweat and my cheeks with tears; it washed down the partridges; I ate mine with the dumb wonder of a profane mortal of any sort when he finds in a form of life with which he is not familiar what he has supposed that form of life to exclude \u2014 the wonder, for instance, of an atheist who sits down to an exquisitely cooked dinner in a presbytery. And next morning, when I awoke, I rose and went to cast from Saint-Loup\u2019s window, which being at a great height overlooked the whole countryside, a curious scrutiny to make the acquaintance of my new neighbour, the landscape which I had not been able to distinguish the day before, having arrived too late, at an hour when it was already sleeping beneath the outspread cloak of night. And yet, early as it had awoken from its sleep, I could see the ground, when I opened the window and looked out, only as one sees it from the window of a country house, overlooking the lake, shrouded still in its soft white morning gown of mist which scarcely allowed me to make out anything at all. But I knew that, before the troopers who were busy with their horses in the square had finished grooming them, it would have cast its gown aside. In the meantime, I could see only a meagre hill, rearing close up against the side of the barracks a back already swept clear of darkness, rough and wrinkled. Through the transparent curtain of frost I could not take my eyes from this stranger who, too, was looking at me for the first time. But when I had formed the habit of coming to the barracks, my consciousness that the hill was there, more real, consequently, even when I did not see it, than the hotel at Balbec, than our house in Paris, of which I thought as of absent \u2014 or dead \u2014 friends, that is to say without any strong belief in their existence, brought it about that, even although I was not aware of it myself, its reflected shape outlined itself on the slightest impressions that I formed at Donci\u00e8res, and among them, to begin with this first morning, on the pleasing impression of warmth given me by the cup of chocolate prepared by Saint-Loup\u2019s batman in this comfortable room, which had the effect of being an optical centre from which to look out at the hill \u2014 the idea of there being anything else to do but just gaze at it, the idea of actually climbing it, being rendered impossible by this same mist. Imbibing the shape of the hill, associated with the taste of hot chocolate and with the whole web of my fancies at that particular time, this mist, without my having thought at all about it, succeeded in moistening all my subsequent thoughts about that period, just as a massive and unmelting lump of gold had remained allied to my impressions of Balbec, or as the proximity of the outside stairs of blackish sandstone gave a grey background to my impressions of Combray. It did not, however, persist late into the day; the sun began by hurling at it, in vain, a few darts which sprinkled it with brilliants before they finally overcame it. The hill might expose its grizzled rump to the sun\u2019s rays, which, an hour later, when I went down to the town, gave to the russet tints of the autumn leaves, to the reds and blues of the election posters pasted on the walls, an exaltation which raised my spirits also and made me stamp, singing as I went, on the pavements from which I could hardly keep myself from jumping in the air for joy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But after that first night I had to sleep at the hotel. And I knew beforehand that I was doomed to find sorrow there. It was like an unbreathable aroma which all my life long had been exhaled for me by every new bedroom, that is to say by every bedroom; in the one which I usually occupied I was not present, my mind remained elsewhere, and in its place sent only the sense of familiarity. But I could not employ this servant, less sensitive than myself, to look after things for me in a new place, where I preceded him, where I arrived by myself, where I must bring into contact with its environment that \u2018Self\u2019 which I rediscovered only at year-long intervals, but always the same, having not grown at all since Combray, since my first arrival at Balbec, weeping, without any possibility of consolation, on the edge of an unpacked trunk\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As it happened, I was mistaken. I had no time to be sad, for I was not left alone for an instant. The fact of the matter was that there remained of the old palace a superfluous refinement of structure and decoration, out of place in a modern hotel, which, released from the service of any practical purpose, had in its long spell of leisure acquired a sort of life: passages winding about in all directions, which one was continually crossing in their aimless wanderings, lobbies as long as corridors and as ornate as drawing-rooms, which had the air rather of being dwellers there themselves than of forming part of a dwelling, which could not be induced to enter and settle down in any of the rooms but wandered about outside mine and came up at once to offer me their company \u2014 neighbours of a sort, idle but never noisy, menial ghosts of the past who had been granted the privilege of staying, provided they kept quiet, by the doors of the rooms which were let to visitors, and who, every time that I came across them, greeted me with a silent deference. In short, the idea of a lodging, of simply a case for our existence from day to day which shields us only from the cold and from being overlooked by other people, was absolutely inapplicable to this house, an assembly of rooms as real as a colony of people, living, it was true, in silence, but things which one was obliged to meet, to avoid, to appreciate, as one came in. One tried not to disturb them, and one could not look without respect at the great drawing-room which had formed, far back in the eighteenth century, the habit of stretching itself at its ease, among its hangings of old gold and beneath the clouds of its painted ceiling. And one was seized with a more personal curiosity as to the smaller rooms which, without any regard for symmetry, ran all round it, innumerable, startled, fleeing in disorder as far as the garden, to which they had so easy an access down three broken steps\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If I wished to go out or to come in without taking the lift or being seen from the main staircase, a smaller private staircase, no longer in use, offered me its steps so skilfully arranged, one close above another, that there seemed to exist in their gradation a perfect proportion of the same kind as those which, in colours, scents, savours, often arouse in us a peculiar, sensuous pleasure. But the pleasure to be found in going up and downstairs I had had to come here to learn, as once before to a health resort in the Alps to find that the act \u2014 as a rule not noticed \u2014 of drawing breath could be a perpetual delight. I received that dispensation from effort which is granted to us only by the things to which long use has accustomed us, when I set my feet for the first time on those steps, familiar before ever I knew them, as if they possessed, deposited on them, perhaps, embodied in them by the masters of long ago whom they used to welcome every day, the prospective charm of habits which I had not yet contracted and which indeed could only grow weaker once they had become my own. I looked into a room; the double doors closed themselves behind me, the hangings let in a silence in which I felt myself invested with a sort of exhilarating royalty; a marble mantelpiece with ornaments of wrought brass \u2014 of which one would have been wrong to think that its sole idea was to represent the art of the Directory \u2014 offered me a fire, and a little easy chair on short legs helped me to warm myself as comfortably as if I had been sitting on the hearthrug. The walls held the room in \u00e0 close embrace, separating it from the rest of the world and, to let in, to enclose what made it complete, parted to make way for the bookcase, reserved a place for the bed, on either side of which a column airily upheld the raised ceiling of the alcove. And the room was prolonged in depth by two closets as large as itself, the latter of which had hanging from its wall, to scent the occasion on which one had recourse to it, a voluptuous rosary of orris-roots; the doors, if I left them open when I withdrew into this innermost retreat, were not content with tripling its dimensions without its ceasing to be well-proportioned, and not only allowed my eyes to enjoy the delights of extension after those of concentration, but added further to the pleasure of my solitude, which, while still inviolable, was no longer shut in, the sense of liberty. This closet looked out upon a courtyard, a fair solitary stranger whom I was glad to have for a neighbour when next morning my eyes fell on her, a captive between her high walls in which no other window opened, with nothing but two yellowing trees which were enough to give a pinkish softness to the pure sky above\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before going to bed I decided to leave the room in order to explore the whole of my fairy kingdom. I walked down a long gallery which did me homage successively with all that it had to offer me if I could not sleep, an armchair placed waiting in a corner, a spinet, on a table against the wall, a bowl of blue crockery filled with cinerarias, and, in an old frame, the phantom of a lady of long ago whose powdered hair was starred with blue flowers, holding in her hand a bunch of carnations. When I came to the end, the bare wall in which no door opened said to me simply \u201cNow you must turn and go back, but, you see, you are at home here, the house is yours,\u201d while the soft carpet, not to be left out, added that if I did not sleep that night I could easily come in barefoot, and\u2019 the unshuttered windows, looking out over the oper, country, assured me that they would hold a sleepless vigil and that, at whatever hour I chose to come in, I need not be afraid of disturbing anyone. And behind a hanging curtain I surprised only a little closet which, stopped by the wall and unable to escape any farther, had hidden itself there with a guilty conscience and gave me a frightened stare from its little round window, glowing blue in the moonlight. I went to bed, but the presence of the eiderdown quilt, of the pillars, of the neat fireplace, by straining my attention to a pitch beyond that of Paris, prevented me from letting myself go upon my habitual train of fancies. And as it is this particular state of strained attention that enfolds our slumbers, acts upon them, modifies them, brings them into line with this or that series of past impressions, the images that filled my dreams that first night were borrowed from a memory entirely distinct from that on which I was in the habit of drawing. If I had been tempted while asleep to let myself be swept back upon my ordinary current of remembrance, the bed to which I was not accustomed, the comfortable attention which I was obliged to pay to the position of my various limbs when I turned over, were sufficient to correct my error, to disentangle and to keep running the new thread of my dreams. It is the same with sleep as with our perception of the external world. It needs only a modification in our habits to make it poetic, it is enough that while undressing we should have dozed off unconsciously upon the bed, for the dimensions of our dream-world to be altered and its beauty felt. We awake, look at our watch, see \u2018four o\u2019clock\u2019; it is only four o\u2019clock in the morning, but we imagine that the whole day has gone by, so vividly does this nap of a few minutes, unsought by us, appear to have come down to us from the skies, by virtue of some divine right, full-bodied, vast, like an Emperor\u2019s orb of gold. In the morning, while worrying over the thought that my grandfather was ready, and was waiting for me to start on our walk along the M\u00e9s\u00e9glise way, I was awakened by the blare of a regimental band which passed every day beneath my windows. But on several occasions \u2014 and I mention these because one cannot properly describe human life unless one shews it soaked in the sleep in which it plunges, which, night after night, sweeps round it as a promontory is encircled by the sea \u2014 the intervening layer of sleep was strong enough to bear the shock of the music and I heard nothing. On the other mornings it gave way for a moment; but, still velvety with the refreshment of having slept, my consciousness (like those organs by which, after a local anaesthetic, a cauterisation, not perceived at first, is felt only at the very end and then as a faint burning smart) was touched only gently by the shrill points of the fifes which caressed it with a vague, cool, matutinal warbling; and after this brief interruption in which the silence had turned to music it relapsed into my slumber before even the dragoons had finished passing, depriving me of the latest opening buds of the sparkling clangorous nosegay. And the zone of my consciousness which its springing stems had brushed was so narrow, so circumscribed with sleep that later on, when Saint-Loup asked me whether I had heard the band, I was no longer ertain that the sound of its brasses had not been as imaginary as that which I heard during the day echo, after the slightest noise, from the paved streets of the town. Perhaps I had heard it only in a dream, prompted by my fear of being awakened, or else of not being awakened and so not seeing the regiment march past. For often, when I was still asleep at the moment when, on the contrary, I had supposed that the noise would awaken me, for the next hour I imagined that I was awake, while still drowsing, and I enacted to myself with tenuous shadow-shapes on the screen of my slumber the various scenes of which it deprived me but at which I had the illusion of looking on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What one has meant to do during the day, as it turns out, sleep intervening, one accomplishes only in one\u2019s dreams, that is to say after it has been distorted by sleep into following another line than one would have chosen when awake. The same story branches off and has a different ending. When all is said, the world in which we live when we are asleep is so different that people who have difficulty in going to sleep seek first of all to escape from the waking world. After having desperately, for hours on end, with shut eyes, revolved in their minds thoughts similar to those which they would have had with their eyes open, they take heart again on noticing that the last minute has been crawling under the weight of an argument in formal contradiction of the laws of thought, and their realisation of this, and the brief \u2018absence\u2019 to which it points, indicate that the door is now open through which they will perhaps be able, presently, to escape from the perception of the real, to advance to a resting-place more or less remote on the other side, which will mean their having a more or less \u2018good\u2019 night. But already a great stride has been made when we turn our back on the real, when we reach the cave in which \u2018auto-suggestions\u2019 prepare \u2014 like witches \u2014 the hell-broth of imaginary maladies or of the recurrence of nervous disorders, and watch for the hour at which the storm that has been gathering during our unconscious sleep will break with sufficient force to make sleep cease\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not far thence is the secret garden in which grow like strange flowers the kinds of sleep, so different one from another, the sleep induced by datura, by the multiple extracts of ether, the sleep of belladonna, of opium, of valerian, flowers whose petals remain shut until the day when the predestined visitor shall come and, touching them, bid them open, and for long hours inhale the aroma of their peculiar dreams into a marvelling and bewildered being. At the end of the garden stands the convent with open windows through which we hear voices repeating the lessons learned before we went to sleep, which we shall know only at the moment of awakening; while, a presage of that moment, sounds the resonant tick of that inward alarum which our preoccupation has so effectively regulated that when our housekeeper comes in with the warning: \u201cIt is seven o\u2019clock,\u201d she will find us awake and ready. On the dim walls of that chamber which opens upon our dreams, within which toils without ceasing that oblivion of the sorrows of love whose task, interrupted and brought: to nought at times by a nightmare big with reminiscence, is ever speedily resumed, hang, even after we are awake, the memories of our dreams, but so overshadowed that otten we catch sight of them for the first time only in the broad light of the afternoon when the ray of a similar idea happens by chance to strike them; some of them brilliant and harmonious while we slept, but already so distorted that, having failed to recognise them, we can but hasten to lay them in the earth like dead bodies too quickly decomposed or relics so seriously damaged, so nearly crumbling into dust that the most skilful restorer could not bring them back to their true form or make anything of them. Near the gate is the quarry to which our heavier slumbers repair in search of substances which coat the brain with so unbreakable a glaze that, to awaken the sleeper, his own will is obliged, even on a golden morning, to smite him with mighty blows like a young Siegfried. Beyond this, again, are the nightmares of which the doctors foolishly assert that they tire us more than does insomnia, whereas on the contrary they enable the thinker to escape from the strain of thought; those nightmares with their fantastic picture-books in which our relatives who are dead are shewn meeting with a serious accident which at the same time does not preclude their speedy recovery. Until then we keep them in a little rat-cage, in which they are smaller than white mice and, covered with big red spots, out of each of which a feather sprouts, engage us in Ciceronian dialogues. Next to this picture-book is the revolving disc of awakening, by virtue of which we submit for a moment to the tedium of having to return at once to a house which was pulled down fifty years ago, the memory of which is gradually effaced as sleep grows more distant by a number of others, until we arrive at that memory which the disc presents only when it has ceased to revolve and which coincides with what we shall see with opened eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I had heard nothing, being in one of those slumbers into which we fall as into a pit from which we are heartily glad to be drawn up a little later, heavy, overfed, digesting all that has been brought to us (as by the nymphs who fed the infant Hercules) by those agile, vegetative powers whose activity is doubled while we sleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That kind of sleep is called \u2018sleeping like lead,\u2019 and it seems as though one has become, oneself, and remains for a few moments after such a sleep is ended, simply a leaden image. One is no longer a person. How then, seeking for one\u2019s mind, one\u2019s personality, as one seeks for a thing that is lost, does one recover one\u2019s own self rather than any other? Why, when one begins again to think, is it not another personality than yesterday\u2019s that is incarnate in one? One fails to see what can dictate the choice, or why, among the millions of human beings any one of whom one might be, it is on him who one was overnight that unerringly one lays one\u2019s hand? What is it that guides us, when there has been an actual interruption \u2014 whether it be that our unconsciousness has been complete or our dreams entirely different from ourselves? There has indeed been death, as when the heart has ceased to beat and a rhythmical friction of the tongue revives us. No doubt the room, even if we have seen it only once before, awakens memories to which other, older memories cling. Or were some memories also asleep in us of which we now become conscious? The resurrection at our awakening \u2014 after that healing attack of mental alienation which is sleep \u2014 must after all be similar to what occurs when we recapture a name, a line, a refrain that we had forgotten. And perhaps the resurrection of the soul after death is to be conceived as a phenomenon of memory\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had finished sleeping, tempted by the sunlit sky \u2014 but discouraged by the chill \u2014 of those last autumn mornings, so luminous and so cold, in which winter begins, to get up and look at the trees on which the leaves were indicated now only by a few strokes, golden or rosy, which seemed to have been left in the air, on an invisible web, I raised my head from the pillow and stretched my neck, keeping my body still hidden beneath the bedclothes; like a chrysalis in the process of change I was a dual creature, with the different parts of which a single environment did not agree; for my eyes colour was sufficient, without warmth; my chest on the other hand was anxious for warmth and not for colour. I rose only after my fire had been lighted, and studied the picture, so delicate and transparent, of the pink and golden morning, to which I had now added by artificial means the element of warmth that it lacked, poking my fire which burned and smoked like a good pipe and gave me, as a pipe would have given me, a pleasure at once coarse because it was based upon a material comfort and delicate because beyond it was printed a pure vision. The walls of my dressing-room were covered with a paper on which a violent red background was patterned with black and white flowers, to which it seemed that I should have some difficulty in growing accustomed. But they succeeded only in striking me as novel, in forcing me to enter not into conflict but into contact with them, in modulating the gaiety, the songs of my morning toilet, they succeeded only in imprisoning me in the heart of a sort of poppy, out of which to look at a world which I saw quite differently from in Paris, from the gay screen which was this new dwelling-place, of a different aspect from the house of my parents, and into which flowed a purer air. On certain days, I was agitated by the desire to see my grandmother again, or by the fear that she might be ill, or else it was the memory of some undertaking which I had left half-finished in Paris, and which seemed to have made no progress; sometimes again it was some difficulty in which, even here, I had managed to become involved. One or other of these anxieties had kept me from sleeping, and I was without strength to face my sorrow which in a moment grew to fill the whole of my existence. Then from the hotel I sent a messenger to the barracks, with a line to Saint-Loup: I told him that, should it be materially possible \u2014 I knew that it was extremely difficult for him \u2014 I should be most grateful if he would look in for a minute. An hour later he arrived; and on hearing his ring at the door I felt myself liberated from my obsessions. I knew that, if they were stronger than I, he was stronger than they, and my attention was diverted from them and concentrated on him who would have to settle them. He had come into the room, and already he had enveloped me in the gust of fresh air in which from before dawn he had been displaying so much activity, a vital atmosphere very different from that of my room, to which I at once adapted myself by appropriate reactions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope you weren\u2019t angry with me for bothering you; there is something that is worrying me, as you probably guessed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; I just supposed you wanted to see me, and I thought it very nice of you. I was delighted that you should have sent for me. But what is the trouble? Things not going well? What can I do to help?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He listened to my explanations, and gave careful answers; but before he had uttered a word he had transformed me to his own likeness; compared with the important occupations which kept him so busy, so alert, so happy, the worries which, a moment ago, I had been unable to endure for another instant seemed to me as to him negligible; I was like a man who, not having been able to open his eyes for some days, sends for a doctor, who neatly and gently raises his eyelid, removes from beneath it and shews him a grain of sand; the sufferer is healed and comforted. All my cares resolved themselves into a telegram which Saint-Loup undertook to dispatch. Life seemed to me so different, so delightful; I was flooded with such a surfeit of strength that I longed for action\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you doing now?\u201d I asked him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI must leave you, I\u2019m afraid; we\u2019re going on a route march in three quarters of an hour, and I have to be on parade.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen it\u2019s been a great bother to you, coming here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no bother at all, the Captain was very good about it; he told me that if it was for you I must go at once; but you understand, I don\u2019t like to seem to be abusing the privilege.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut if I got up and dressed quickly and went by myself to the place where you\u2019ll be training, it would interest me immensely, and I could perhaps talk to you during the breaks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shouldn\u2019t advise you to do that; you have been lying awake, racking your brains over a thing which, I assure you, is not of the slightest importance, but now that it has ceased to worry you, lay your head down on the pillow and go to sleep, which you will find an excellent antidote to the d\u00e9min\u00e9ralisation of your nerve-cells; only you mustn\u2019t go to sleep too soon, because our band-boys will be coming along under your windows; but as soon as they\u2019ve passed I think you\u2019ll be left in peace, and we shall meet again this evening, at dinner.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But soon I was constantly going to see the regiment being trained in field operations, when I began to take an interest in the military theories which Saint-Loup\u2019s friends used to expound over the dinner-table, and when it had become the chief desire of my life to see at close quarters their various leaders, just as a person who makes music his principal study and spends his life in the concert halls finds pleasure in frequenting the caf\u00e9s in which one mingles with the life of the members of the orchestra. To reach the training ground I used to have to take tremendously long walks. In the evening after dinner the longing for sleep made my head drop every now and then as in a swoon. Next morning I realised that I had no more heard the band than, at Balbec, after the evenings on which Saint-Loup had taken me to dinner at Rivebelle, I used to hear the concert on the beach. And at the moment when I wished to rise I had a delicious feeling of incapacity; I felt myself fastened to a deep, invisible ground by the articulations (of which my tiredness made me conscious) of muscular and nutritious roots. I felt myself full of strength; life seemed to extend more amply before me; this was because I had reverted to the good tiredness of my childhood at Combray on the mornings following days on which we had taken the Guermantes walk. Poets make out that we recapture for a moment the self that we were long ago when we enter some house or garden in which we used to live in our youth. But these are most hazardous pilgrimages, which end as often in disappointment as in success. The fixed places, contemporary with different years, it is in ourselves that we should rather seek to find them. This is where the advantage comes in, to a certain extent, of great exhaustion followed by a good night\u2019s rest. Good nights, to make us descend into the most subterranean galleries of sleep, where no reflexion from overnight, no gleam of memory comes to lighten the inward monologue (if so be that it cease not also), turn so effectively the soil and break through the surface stone of our body that we discover there, where our muscles dive down and throw out their twisted roots and breathe the air of the new life, the garden in which as a child we used to play. There is no need to travel in order to see it again; we must dig down inwardly to discover it. What once covered the earth is no longer upon it but beneath; a mere excursion does not suffice for a visit to the dead city, excavation is necessary also. But we shall see how certain impressions, fugitive and fortuitous, carry us back even more effectively to the past, with a more delicate precision, with a flight more light-winged, more immaterial, more headlong, more unerring, more immortal than these organic dislocations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes my exhaustion was greater still; I had, without any opportunity of going to bed, been following the operations for several days on end. How blessed then was my return to the hotel! As I got into bed I seemed to have escaped at last from the hands of enchanters, sorcerers like those who people the \u2018romances\u2019 beloved of our forebears in the seventeenth century. My sleep that night and the lazy morning that followed it were no more than a charming fairy tale. Charming; beneficent perhaps also. I reminded myself that the keenest sufferings have their place of sanctuary, that one can always, when all else fails, find repose. These thoughts carried me far\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On days when, although there was no parade, Saint-Loup had to stay in barracks, I used often to go and visit him there. It was a long way; I had to leave the town and cross the viaduct, from either side of which I had an immense view. A strong breeze blew almost always over this high ground, and filled all the buildings erected on three sides of the barrack-square, which howled incessantly like a cave of the winds. While I waited for Robert \u2014 he being engaged on some duty or other \u2014 outside the door of his room or in the mess, talking to some of his friends to whom he had introduced me (and whom later on I came now and then to see, even when he was not to be there), looking down from the window three hundred feet to the country below, bare now except where recently sown fields, often still soaked with rain and glittering in the sun, shewed a few stripes of green, of the brilliance and translucent limpidity of enamel, I could hear him discussed by the others, and I soon learned what a popular favourite he was. Among many of the volunteers, belonging to other squadrons^ sons of rich business or professional men who looked at the higher aristocratic society only from outside and without penetrating its enclosure, the attraction which they naturally felt towards what they knew of Saint-Loup\u2019s character was reinforced by the distinction that attached in their eyes to the young man whom, on Saturday evenings, when they went on pass to Paris, they had seen supping in the Caf\u00e9 de la Paix with the Duc d\u2019Uz\u00e8s and the Prince d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans. And on that account, into his handsome face, his casual way of walking and saluting officers, the perpetual dance of his eyeglass, the affectation shewn in the cut of his service dress \u2014 the caps always too high, the breeches of too fine a cloth and too pink a shade \u2014 they had introduced the idea of a \u2018tone\u2019 which, they were positive, was lacking in the best turned-out officers in the regiment, even the majestic Captain to whom I had been indebted for the privilege of sleeping in barracks, who seemed, in comparison, too pompous and almost common\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of them said that the Captain had bought a new horse. \u201cHe can buy as many horses as he likes. I passed Saint-Loup on Sunday morning in the All\u00e9e des Acacias; now he\u2019s got some style on a horse!\u201d replied his companion, and knew what he was talking about, for these young fellows belonged to a class which, if it does not frequent the same houses and know the same people, yet, thanks to money and leisure, does not differ from the nobility in its experience of all those refinements of life which money can procure. At any rate their refinement had, in the matter of clothes, for instance, something about it more studied, more impeccable than that free and easy negligence which had so delighted my grandmother in Saint-Loup. It gave quite a thrill to these sons of big stockbrokers or bankers, as they sat eating oysters after the theatre, to see at an adjoining table Serjeant Saint-Loup. And what a tale there was to tell in barracks on Monday night, after a week-end leave, by one of them who was in Robert\u2019s squadron, and to whom he had said how d\u2019ye do \u2018most civilly,\u2019 while another, who was not in the same squadron, was quite positive that, in spite of this, Saint-Loup had recognised him, for two or three times he had put up his eyeglass and stared in the speaker\u2019s direction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, my brother saw him at the Paix,\u201d said another, who had been spending the day with his mistress; \u201cmy brother says his dress coat was cut too loose and didn\u2019t fit him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat was the waistcoat like?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe wasn\u2019t wearing a white waistcoat; it was purple, with sort of palms on it; stunning!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the \u2018old soldiers\u2019 (sons of the soil who had never heard of the Jockey Club and simply put Saint-Loup in the category of ultra-rich non-commissioned officers, in which they included all those who, whether bankrupt or not, lived in a certain style, whose income or debts ran into several figures, and who were generous towards their men), the gait, the eyeglass, the breeches, the caps of Saint-Loup, even if they saw in them nothing particularly aristocratic, furnished nevertheless just as much interest and meaning. They recognised in these peculiarities the character, the style which they had assigned once and for all time to this most popular of the \u2018stripes\u2019 in the regiment, manners like no one\u2019s else, scornful indifference to what his superior officers might think, which seemed to them the natural corollary of his goodness to his subordinates. The morning cup of coffee in the canteen, the afternoon \u2018lay-down\u2019 in the barrack-room seemed pleasanter, somehow, when some old soldier fed the hungering, lazy section with some savoury titbit as to a cap in which Saint-Loup had appeared on parade\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was the height of my pack.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome off it, old chap, you don\u2019t expect us to believe that; it couldn\u2019t have been the height of your pack,\u201d interrupted a young college graduate who hoped by using these slang terms not to appear a \u2018learned beggar,\u2019 and by venturing on this contradiction to obtain confirmation of a fact the thought of which enchanted him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, so it wasn\u2019t the height of my pack, wasn\u2019t it? You measured it, I suppose! I tell you this much, the C. O. glared at it as if he\u2019d have liked to put him in clink. But you needn\u2019t think the great Saint-Loup felt squashed; no, he went and he came, and down with his head and up with his head, and that blinking glass screwed in his eye all the time. We\u2019ll see what the \u2018Capstan\u2019 has to say when he hears. Oh, very likely he\u2019ll say nothing, but you may be sure he won\u2019t be pleased. But there\u2019s nothing so wonderful about that cap. I hear he\u2019s got thirty of \u2019em and more at home, at his house in town.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did you hear that, old man? From our blasted corporal-dog?\u201d asked the young graduate, pedantically displaying the new forms of speech which he had only recently acquired and with which he took a pride in garnishing his conversation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did I hear it? From his batman; what d\u2019you think?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Now you\u2019re talking. That\u2019s a chap who knows when he\u2019s well off!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should say so! He\u2019s got more in his pocket than I have, certain sure! And besides he gives him all his own things, and everything. He wasn\u2019t getting his grub properly, he says. Along comes de Saint-Loup, and gives cooky hell: \u2018I want him to be properly fed, d\u2019you hear,\u2019 he says, \u2018and I don\u2019t care what it costs.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The old soldier made up for the triviality of the words quoted by the emphasis of his tone, in a feeble imitation of the speaker which had an immense success\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On leaving the barracks I would take a stroll, and then, to fill up the time before I went, as I did every evening, to dine with Saint-Loup at the hotel in which he and his friends had established their mess, I made for my own, as soon as the sun had set, so as to have a couple of hours in which to rest and read. In the square, the evening light bedecked the pepper-pot turrets of the castle with little pink clouds which matched the colour of the bricks, and completed the harmony by softening the tone of the latter where it bathed them. So strong a current of vitality coursed through my nerves that no amount of movement on my part could exhaust it; each step I took, after touching a stone of the pavement, rebounded off it. I seemed to have growing on my heels the wings of Mercury. One of the fountains was filled with a ruddy glow, while in the other the moonlight had already begun to turn the water opalescent. Between them were children at play, uttering shrill cries, wheeling in circles, obeying some necessity of the hour, like swifts or bats. Next door to the hotel, the old National Courts and the Louis XVI orangery, in which were installed now the savings-bank and the Army Corps headquarters, were lighted from within by the palely gilded globes of their gas-jets which, seen in the still clear daylight outside, suited those vast, tall, eighteenth-century windows from which the last rays of the setting sun had not yet departed, as would have suited a complexion heightened with rouge a headdress of yellow tortoise-shell, and persuaded me to seek out my fireside and the lamp which, alone in the shadowy front of my hotel, was striving to resist the gathering darkness, and for the sake of which I went indoors before it was quite dark, for pleasure, as to an appetising meal. I kept, when I was in my room, the same fulness of sensation that I had felt outside. It gave such an apparent convexity of surface to things which as a rule seem flat and empty, to the yellow flame of the fire, the coarse blue paper on the ceiling, on which the setting sun had scribbled corkscrews and whirligigs, like a schoolboy with a piece of red chalk, the curiously patterned cloth on the round table, on which a ream of essay paper and an inkpot lay in readiness for me, with one of Bergotte\u2019s novels, that ever since then these things have continued to seem to me to be enriched with a whole form of existence which I feel that I should be able to extract from them if it were granted me to set eyes on them again. I thought with joy of the barracks that I had just left and of their weather-cock turning with every wind that blew. Like a diver breathing through a pipe which rises above the surface of the water, I felt that I was in a sense maintaining contact with a healthy, open-air life when I kept as a baiting-place those barracks, that towering observatory, dominating a country-side furrowed with canals of green enamel, into whose various buildings I esteemed as a priceless privilege, which I hoped would last, my freedom to go whenever I chose, always certain of a welcome\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At seven o\u2019clock I dressed myself and went out again to dine with Saint-Loup at the hotel where he took his meals. I liked to go there on foot. It was by now pitch dark, and after the third day of my visit there began to blow, as soon as night had fallen, an icy wind which seemed a harbinger of snow. As I walked, I ought not, strictly speaking, to have ceased for a moment to think of Mme. de Guermantes; it was only in the attempt to draw nearer to her that I had come to visit Robert\u2019s garrison. But a memory, a grief, are fleeting things. There are days when they remove so far that we are barely conscious of them, we think that they have gone for ever. Then we pay attention to other things. And the streets of this town had not yet become for me what streets are in the place where one is accustomed to live, simply means of communication between one part and another. The life led by the inhabitants of this unknown world must, it seemed to me, be a marvellous thing, and often the lighted windows of some dwelling-house kept me standing for a long while motionless in the darkness by laying before my eyes the actual and mysterious scenes of an existence into which I might not penetrate. Here the fire-spirit displayed to me in purple colouring the booth of a chestnut seller in which a couple of serjeants, their belts slung over the backs of chairs, were playing cards, never dreaming that a magician\u2019s wand was making them emerge from the night, like a transparency on the stage, and presenting them in their true lineaments at that very moment to the eyes of an arrested passerby whom they could not see. In a little curiosity shop a candle, burned almost to its socket, projecting its warm glow over an engraving reprinted it in sanguine, while, battling against the darkness, the light of the big lamp tanned a scrap of leather, inlaid a dagger with fiery spangles, on pictures which were only bad copies spread a priceless film of gold like the patina of time or the varnish used by a master, made in fact of the whole hovel, in which there was nothing but pinchbeck rubbish, a marvellous composition by Rembrandt. Sometimes I lifted my gaze to some huge old dwelling-house on which the shutters had not been closed and in which amphibious men and women floated slowly to and fro in the rich liquid that after nightfall rose incessantly from the wells of the lamps to fill the rooms to the very brink of the outer walls of stone and glass, the movement of their bodies sending through it long unctuous golden ripples. I proceeded on my way, and often, in the dark alley that ran past the cathedral, as long ago on the road to M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, the force of my desire caught and held me; it seemed that a woman must be on the point of appearing, to satisfy it; if, in the darkness, I felt suddenly brush past me a skirt, the violence of the pleasure which I then felt made it impossible for me to believe that the contact was accidental and I attempted to seize in my arms a terrified stranger. This gothic alley meant for me something so real that if I had been successful in raising and enjoying a woman there, it would have been impossible for me not to believe that it was the ancient charm of the place that was bringing us together, and even though she were no more than a common street-walker, stationed there every evening, still the wintry night, the strange place, the darkness, the mediaeval atmosphere would have lent her their mysterious glamour. I thought of what might be in store for me; to try to forget Mme. de Guermantes seemed to me a dreadful thing, but reasonable, and for the first time possible, easy perhaps even. In the absolute quiet of this neighbourhood I could hear ahead of me shouted words and laughter which must come from tipsy revellers staggering home. I waited to see them, I stood peering in the direction from which I had heard the sound. But I was obliged to wait for some time, for the surrounding silence was so intense that it allowed to travel with the utmost clearness and strength sounds that were still a long way off. Finally the revellers did appear; not, as I had supposed, in front of me, but ever so far behind. Whether the intersection of sidestreets, the interposition of buildings had, by reverberation, brought about this acoustic error, or because it is very difficult to locate a sound when the place from which it comes is not known, I had been as far wrong over direction as over distance\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The wind grew stronger. It was thick and bristling with coming snow. I returned to the main street and jumped on board the little tramway-car on which, from its platform, an officer, without apparently seeing them, was acknowledging the salutes of the loutish soldiers who trudged past along the pavement, their faces daubed crimson by the cold, reminding me, in this little town which the sudden leap from autumn into early winter seemed to have transported farther north, of the rubicund faces which Breughel gives to his merry, junketing, frostbound peasants\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And sure enough at the hotel where I was to meet Saint-Loup and his friends and to which the fair now beginning had attracted a number of people from near and far, I found, as I hurried across the courtyard with its glimpses of glowing kitchens in which chickens were turning on spits, pigs were roasting, lobsters being flung, alive, into what the landlord called the \u2018everlasting fire,\u2019 an influx (worthy of some Numbering of the People Before Bethlehem such as the old Flemish masters used to paint) of new arrivals who assembled there in groups, asking the landlord or one of his staff (who, if he did not like the look of them, would recommend lodgings elsewhere in the town) whether they could have dinner and beds, while a scullion hurried past holding a struggling fowl by the neck. And similarly, in the big dining-room which I crossed the first day before coming to the smaller room in which my friend was waiting for me, it was of some feast in the Gospels portrayed with a mediaeval simplicity and an exaggeration typically Flemish that one was reminded by the quantity of fish, pullets, grouse, woodcock, pigeons, brought in dressed and garnished and piping hot by breathless waiters who slid over the polished floor to gain speed and set them down on the huge carving table where they were at once cut up but where \u2014 for most of the people had nearly finished dinner when I arrived \u2014 they accumulated untouched, as though their profusion and the haste of those who brought them in were due not so much to the requirements of the diners as to respect for the sacred text, scrupulously followed in the letter but quaintly illustrated by real details borrowed from local custom, and to an aesthetic and religious scruple for making evident to the eye the solemnity of the feast by the profusion of the victuals and the assiduity of the servers. One of these stood lost in thought at the far end of the room by a sideboard; and to find out from him, who alone appeared calm enough to be capable of answering me, in which room our table had been laid, making my way forward among the chafing-dishes that had been lighted here and there to keep the late comers\u2019 plates from growing cold (which did not, however, prevent the dessert, in the centre of the room, from being piled on the outstretched hands of a huge mannikin, sometimes supported on the wings of a duck, apparently of crystal, but really of ice, carved afresh every day with a hot iron by a sculptor-cook, quite in the Flemish manner), I went straight \u2014 at the risk of being knocked down by his colleagues \u2014 towards this servitor, in whom I felt that I recognised a character who is traditionally present in all these sacred subjects, for he reproduced with scrupulous accuracy the blunt features, fatuous and ill-drawn, the musing expression, already half aware of the miracle of a divine presence which the others have not yet begun to suspect. I should add that, in view probably of the coming fair, this presentation was strengthened by a celestial contingent, recruited in mass, of cherubim and seraphim. A young angel musician, whose fair hair enclosed a fourteen-year-old face, was not, it was true, playing on any instrument, but stood musing before a gong or a pile of plates, while other less infantile angels flew swiftly across the boundless expanse of the room, beating the air with the ceaseless fluttering of the napkins which fell along the lines of their bodies like the wings in \u2018primitive\u2019 paintings, with pointed ends. Fleeing those ill-defined regions, screened by a hedge of palms through which the angelic servitors looked, from a distance, as though they had floated down out of the empyrean, I explored my way to the smaller room in which Saint-Loup\u2019s table was laid. I found there several of his friends who dined with him regularly, nobles except for one or two commoners in whom the young nobles had, in their school days, detected likely friends, and with whom they readily associated, proving thereby that they were not on principle hostile to the middle class, even though it were Republican, provided it had clean hands and went to mass. On the first of these evenings, before we sat down to dinner, I drew Saint-Loup into a corner and, in front of all the rest but so that they should not hear me, said to him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert, this is hardly the time or the place for what I am going to say, but I shan\u2019t be a second. I keep on forgetting to ask you when I\u2019m in the barracks; isn\u2019t that Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s photograph that you have on your table?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes; my good aunt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course she is; what a fool I am; you told me before that she was; I\u2019d forgotten all about her being your aunt. I say, your friends will be getting impatient, we must be quick, they\u2019re looking at us; another time will do; it isn\u2019t at all important.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s all right; go on as long as you like. They can wait.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no; I do want to be polite to them; they\u2019re so nice; besides, it doesn\u2019t really matter in the least, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you know that worthy Oriane, then?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This \u2018worthy Oriane,\u2019 as he might have said, \u2018that good Oriane,\u2019 did not imply that Saint-Loup regarded Mme. de Guermantes as especially good. In this instance the words \u2018good,\u2019 \u2018excellent,\u2019 \u2018worthy\u2019 are mere reinforcements of the demonstrative \u2018that,\u2019 indicating a person who is known to both parties and of whom the speaker does not quite know what to say to someone outside the intimate circle. The word \u2018good\u2019 does duty as a stopgap and keeps the conversation going for a moment until the speaker has hit upon \u201cDo you see much of her?\u201d or \u201cI haven\u2019t set eyes on her for months,\u201d or \u201cI shall be seeing her on Tuesday,\u201d or \u201cShe must be getting on, now, you know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how funny it is that it should be her photograph, because we\u2019re living in her house now, in Paris, and I\u2019ve been hearing the most astounding things\u201d (I should have been hard put to it to say what) \u201cabout her, which have made me immensely interested in her, only from a literary point of view, don\u2019t you know, from a \u2014 how shall I put it \u2014 from a Balzacian point of view; but you\u2019re so clever you can see what I mean; I don\u2019t need to explain things to you; but we must hurry up; what on earth will your friends think of my manners?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey will think absolutely nothing; I have told them that you are sublime, and they are a great deal more alarmed than you are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are too kind. But listen, what I want to say is this: I suppose Mme. de Guermantes hasn\u2019t any idea that I know you, has she?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t say; I haven\u2019t seen her since the summer, because I haven\u2019t had any leave since she\u2019s been in town.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I was going to say is this: I\u2019ve been told that she looks on me as an absolute idiot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat I do not believe; Oriane is not exactly an eagle, but all the same she\u2019s by no means stupid.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know that, as a rule, I don\u2019t care about your advertising the good opinion you\u2019re kind enough to hold of me; I\u2019m not conceited. That\u2019s why I\u2019m sorry you should have said flattering things about me to your friends here (we will go back to them in two seconds). But Mme. de Guermantes is different; if you could let her know \u2014 if you would even exaggerate a trifle \u2014 what you think of me, you would give me great pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course I will, if that\u2019s all you want me to do; it\u2019s not very difficult; but what difference can it possibly make to you what she thinks of you? I suppose you think her no end of a joke, really; anyhow, if that\u2019s all you want we can discuss it in front of the others or when we are by ourselves; I\u2019m afraid of your tiring yourself if you stand talking, and it\u2019s so inconvenient too, when we have heaps of opportunities of being alone together.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was precisely this inconvenience that had given me courage to approach Robert; the presence of the others was for me a pretext that justified my giving my remarks a curt and incoherent form, under cover of which I could more easily dissemble the falsehood of my saying to my friend that I had forgotten his connexion with the Duchess, and also did not give him time to frame \u2014 with regard to my reasons for wishing that Mme. de Guermantes should know that I was his friend, was clever, and so forth \u2014 questions which would have been all the more disturbing in that I should not have been able to answer them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert, I\u2019m surprised that a man of your intelligence should fail to understand that one doesn\u2019t discuss the things that will give one\u2019s friends pleasure; one does them. Now I, if you were to ask me no matter what, and indeed I only wish you would ask me to do something for you, I can assure you I shouldn\u2019t want any explanations. I may ask you for more than I really want; I have no desire to know Mme. de Guermantes, but just to test you I ought to have said that I was anxious to dine with Mme. de Guermantes; I am sure you would never have done it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot only should I have done it, I will do it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhen?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNext time I\u2019m in Paris, three weeks from now, I expect.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe shall see; I dare say she won\u2019t want to see me, though. I can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t say that; it\u2019s everything in the world, because now I can see what sort of friend you are; whether what I ask you to do is important or not, disagreeable or not, whether I am really keen about it or ask you only as a test, it makes no difference; you say you will do it, and there you shew the fmeness of your mind and heart. A stupid friend would have started a discussion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which was exactly what he had just been doing; but perhaps I wanted to flatter his self-esteem; perhaps also I was sincere, the sole touchstone of merit seeming to me to be the extent to which a friend could be useful in respect of the one thing that seemed to me to have any importance, namely my love. Then I went on, perhaps from cunning, possibly from a genuine increase of affection inspired by gratitude, expectancy, and the copy of Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s very features which nature had made in producing her nephew Robert: \u201cBut, I say, we mustn\u2019t keep them waiting any longer, and I\u2019ve mentioned only one of the two things I wanted to ask you, the less important; the other is more important to me, but I\u2019m afraid you will never consent. Would it bore you if we were to call each other tu?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBore me? My dear fellow! Joy! Tears of joy! Undreamed-of happiness!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you \u2014 tu I mean; you begin first \u2014 ever so much. It is such a pleasure to me that you needn\u2019t do anything about Mme. de Guermantes if you\u2019d rather not, this is quite enough for me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can do both.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, Robert! Listen to me a minute,\u201d I said to him later while we were at dinner. \u201cOh, it\u2019s really too absurd the way our conversation is always being interrupted, I can\u2019t think why \u2014 you remember the lady I was speaking to you about just now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re quite sure you know who\u2019 I mean?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, what do you take me for, a village idiot?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t care to give me her photograph, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0had meant to ask him only for the loan of it. But when the time came to speak I felt shy, I decided that the request was indiscreet, and in order to hide my confusion I put the question more bluntly, and increased my demand, as if it had been quite natural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; I should have to ask her permission first,\u201d was his answer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He blushed as he spoke. I could see that he had a reservation in his mind, that he credited me also with one, that he would give only a partial service to my love, under the restraint of certain moral principles, and for this I hated him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time I was touched to see how differently Saint-Loup behaved towards me now that I was no longer alone with him, and that his friends formed an audience. His increased affability would have left me cold had I thought that it was deliberately assumed; but I could feel that it was spontaneous and consisted only of all that he had to say about me in my absence and refrained as a rule from saying when we were together by ourselves. In our private conversations I might certainly suspect the pleasure that he found in talking to me, but that pleasure he almost always left unexpressed. Now, at the same remarks from me which, as a rule, he enjoyed without shewing it, he watched from the corner of his eye to see whether they produced on his friends the effect on which he had counted, an effect corresponding to what he had promised them beforehand. The mother of a girl in her first season could be no more unrelaxing in her attention to her daughter\u2019s responses and to the attitude of the public. If I had made some remark at which, alone in my company, he would merely have smiled, he was afraid that the others might not have seen the point, and put in a \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d to make me repeat what I had said, to attract attention, and turning at once to his friends and making himself automatically, by facing them with a hearty laugh, the fugleman of their laughter, presented me for the first time with the opinion that he actually held of me and must often have expressed to them. So that I caught sight of myself suddenly from without, like a person who reads his name in a newspaper or sees himself in a mirror\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It occurred to me, one of these evenings, to tell a mildly amusing story about Mme. Blandais, but I stopped at once, remembering that Saint-Loup knew it already, and that when I had tried to tell him it on the day following my arrival he had interrupted me with: \u201cYou told me that before, at Balbec.\u201d I was surprised, therefore, to find him begging me to go on and assuring me that he did not know the story, and that it would amuse him immensely. \u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten it for the moment,\u201d I said to him, \u201cbut you\u2019ll remember as I go on.\u201d \u201cNo, really; I swear you\u2019re mistaken. You\u2019ve never told me. Do go on.\u201d And throughout the story he fixed a feverish and enraptured gaze alternately on myself and on his friends. I realised only after I had finished, amid general laughter, that it had struck him that this story would give his friends a good idea of my wit, and that it was for this reason that he had pretended not to know it. Such is the stuff of friendship\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the third evening, one of his friends, to whom I had not had an opportunity before of speaking, conversed with me at great length; and I overheard him telling Saint-Loup how much he had been enjoying himself. And indeed we sat talking together almost all evening, leaving our glasses of sauterne untouched on the table before us, isolated, sheltered from the others by the sumptuous curtains of one of those intuitive sympathies between man and man which, when they are not based upon any physical attraction, are the only kind that is altogether mysterious. Of such an enigmatic nature had seemed to me, at Balbec, that feeling which Saint-Loup had for me, which was not to be confused with the interest of our conversations, a feeling free from any material association, invisible, intangible, and yet a thing of the presence of which in himself, like a sort of inflammatory gas, he had been so far conscious as to refer to it with a smile. And yet there was perhaps something more surprising still in this sympathy born here in a single evening, like a flower that had budded and opened in a few minutes in the warmth of this little room. I could not help asking Robert when he spoke to me about Balbec whether it were really settled that he was to marry Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac. He assured me that not only was it not settled, but there had never been any thought of such a match, he had never seen her, he did not know who she was. If at that moment I had happened to see any of the social gossipers who had told me of this coming event, they would promptly have announced the betrothal of Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac to some one who was not Saint-Loup and that of Saint-Loup to some one who was not Mlle. d\u2019Ambresac. I should have surprised them greatly had I reminded them of their incompatible and still so recent predictions. In order that this little game may continue, and multiply false reports by attaching the greatest possible number to every name in turn, nature has furnished those who play it with a memory as short as their credulity is long\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup had spoken to me of another of his friends who was present also one with whom he was on particularly good terms just then, since they were the only two advocates in their mess of the retrial of Dreyfus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as a brother of this friend of Saint-Loup, who had been trained at the Schola Cantorum, thought about every new musical work not at all what his father, his mother, his cousins, his club friends thought, but exactly what the other students thought at the Schola, so this non-commissioned nobleman (of whom Bloch formed an extraordinary opinion when I told him about him, because, touched to hear that he belonged to the same party as himself, he nevertheless imagined him on account of his aristocratic birth and religious and military upbringing to be as different as possible, endowed with the same romantic attraction as a native of a distant country) had a \u2018mentality,\u2019 as people were now beginning to say, analogous to that of the whole body of Dreyfusards in general and of Bloch in particular, on which the traditions of his family and the interests of his career could retain no hold whatever. Similarly one of Saint-Loup\u2019s cousins had married a young Eastern princess who was said to write poetry quite as fine as Victor Hugo\u2019s or Alfred de Vigny\u2019s, and in spite of this was supposed to have a different type of mind from what one would naturally expect, the mind of an Eastern princess immured in an Arabian Nights palace. For the writers who had the privilege of meeting her was reserved the disappointment or rather the joy of listening to conversation which gave the impression not of Scheherazade but of a person of genius of the type of Alfred de Vigny or Victor Hugo\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat fellow? Oh, he\u2019s not like Saint-Loup, he\u2019s a regular devil,\u201d my new friend informed me; \u201che\u2019s not even straight about it. At first, he used to say: \u2018Just wait a little, there\u2019s a man I know well, a clever, kind-hearted fellow, General de Boisdeffre; you need have no hesitation in accepting his decision.\u2019 But as soon as he heard that Boisdeffre had pronounced Dreyfus guilty, Boisdeffre ceased to count: clericalism, staff prejudices, prevented his forming a candid opinion, although there is no one in the world (or was, rather, before this Dreyfus business) half so clerical as our friend. Next he told us that now we were sure to get the truth, the case had been put in the hands of Saussier, and he, a soldier of the Republic (our friend coming of an ultra-monarchist family, if you please), was a man of bronze, a stern unyielding conscience. But when Saussier pronounced Esterhazy innocent, he found fresh reasons to account for the decision, reasons damaging not to Dreyfus but to General Saussier. It was the militarist spirit that blinded Saussier (and I must explain to you that our friend is just as much militarist as clerical, or at least he was; I don\u2019t know what to think of him now). His family are all brokenhearted at seeing him possessed by such ideas.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t you think,\u201d I suggested, turning half towards Saint-Loup so as not to appear to be cutting myself off from him, as well as towards his friend, and so that we might all three join in the conversation, \u201cthat the influence we ascribe to environment is particularly true of intellectual environment. One is the man of one\u2019s idea. There are far fewer ideas than men, therefore all men with similar ideas are alike. As there is nothing material in an idea, so the people who are only materially neighbours of the man with an idea can do nothing to alter it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point I was interrupted by Saint-Loup, because another of the young men had leaned across to him with a smile and, pointing to me, exclaimed: \u201cDuroc! Duroc all over!\u201d I had no idea what this might mean, but I felt the expression on the shy young face to be more than friendly. While I was speaking, the approbation of the party seemed to Saint-Loup superfluous; he insisted on silence. And just as a conductor stops his orchestra with a rap from his baton because some one in the audience has made a noise, so he rebuked the author of this disturbance: \u201cGibergue, you must keep your mouth shut when people are speaking. You can tell us about it afterwards.\u201d And to me: \u201cPlease go on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I gave a sigh of relief, for I had been afraid that he was going to make me begin all over again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd as an idea,\u201d I went on, \u201cis a thing that cannot participate in human interests and would be incapable of deriving any benefit from them, the men who are governed by an idea are not influenced by material considerations.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I had finished, \u201cThat\u2019s one in the eye for you, my boys,\u201d exclaimed Saint-Loup, who had been following me with his gaze with the same anxious solicitude as if I had been walking upon a tight-rope. \u201cWhat were you going to say, Gibergue?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just saying that your friend reminded me of Major Duroc. I seemed to hear him speaking.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, I\u2019ve often thought so myself,\u201d replied Saint-Loup; \u201cthey have several points in common, but you\u2019ll find there are a thousand things in this fellow that Duroc hasn\u2019t got.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup was not satisfied with this comparison. In an ecstasy of joy, into which there no doubt entered the joy that he felt in making me shine before his friends, with extreme volubility, stroking me as though he were rubbing down a horse that had just come first past the post, he reiterated: \u201cYou\u2019re the cleverest man I know, do you hear?\u201d He corrected himself, and added: \u201cYou and Elstir. \u2014 You don\u2019t mind my bracketing him with you, I hope. You understand \u2014 punctiliousness. It\u2019s like this: I say it to you as one might have said to Balzac: \u2018You are the greatest novelist of the century \u2014 you and Stendhal.\u2019 Excessive punctiliousness, don\u2019t you know, and at heart an immense admiration. No? You don\u2019t admit Stendhal?\u201d he went on, with an ingenuous confidence in my judgment which found expression in a charming, smiling, almost childish glance of interrogation from his green eyes. \u201cOh, good! I see you\u2019re on my side; Bloch can\u2019t stand Stendhal. I think it\u2019s idiotic of him. The Chartreuse is after all an immense work, don\u2019t you think? I am so glad you agree with me. What is it you like best in theChartreuse, answer me?\u201d he appealed to me with a boyish impetuosity. And the menace of his physical strength made the question almost terrifying. \u201cMosca? Fabrice?\u201d I answered timidly that Mosca reminded me a little of M. de Norpois. Whereupon peals of laughter from the young Siegfried Saint-Loup. And while I was going on to explain: \u201cBut Mosca is far more intelligent, not so pedantic,\u201d I heard Robert cry: \u201cBravo!\u201d actually clapping his hands, and, helpless with laughter, gasp: \u201cOh, perfect! Admirable! You really are astounding.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I took a particular pleasure in talking to this young man, as for that matter to all Robert\u2019s friends and to Robert himself, about their barracks, the officers of the garrison, and the army in general. Thanks to the immensely enlarged scale on which we see the things, however petty they may be, in the midst of which we eat, and talk, and lead our real life; thanks to that formidable enlargement which they undergo, and the effect of which is that the rest of the world, not being present, cannot compete with them, and assumes in comparison the unsubstantiality of a dream, I had begun to take an interest in the various personalities of the barracks, in the officers whom I saw in the square when I went to visit Saint-Loup, or, if I was awake then, when the regiment passed beneath my windows. I should have liked to know more about the major whom Saint-Loup so greatly admired, and about the course of military history which would have appealed to me \u201ceven from an aesthetic point of view.\u201d I knew that with Robert the spoken word was, only too often, a trifle hollow, but at other times implied the assimilation of valuable ideas which he was fully capable of grasping. Unfortunately, from the military point of view Robert was exclusively preoccupied at this time with the case of Dreyfus. He spoke little about it, since he alone of the party at table was a Dreyfusard; the others were violently opposed to the idea of a fresh trial, except my other neighbour, my new friend, and his opinions appeared to be somewhat vague. A firm admirer of the colonel, who was regarded as an exceptionally competent officer and had denounced the current agitation against the Army in several of his regimental orders, which won him the reputation of being an anti-Dreyfusard, my neighbour had heard that his commanding officer had let fall certain remarks which had led to the supposition that he had his doubts as to the guilt of Dreyfus and retained his admiration for Picquart. In the latter respect, at any rate, the rumour of Dreyfusism as applied to the colonel was as ill-founded as are all the rumours, springing from none knows where, which float around any great scandal. For, shortly afterwards, this colonel having been detailed to interrogate the former Chief of the Intelligence Branch, had treated him with a brutality and contempt the like of which had never been known before. However this might be (and naturally he had not taken the liberty of going direct to the colonel for his information), my neighbour had paid Saint-Loup the compliment of telling him \u2014 in the tone in which a Catholic lady might tell a Jewish lady that her parish priest denounced the pogroms in Russia and might openly admire the generosity of certain Israelites \u2014 that their colonel was not, with regard to Dreyfusism \u2014 to a certain kind of Dreyfusism, at least \u2014 the fanatical, narrow opponent that he had been made out to be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not surprised,\u201d was Saint-Loup\u2019s comment; \u201cfor he\u2019s a sensible man. But in spite of that he is blinded by the prejudices of his caste, and above all by his clericalism. Now,\u201d he turned to me, \u201cMajor Duroc, the lecturer on military history I was telling you about; there\u2019s a man who is whole-heartedly in support of our views, or so I\u2019m told. And I should have been surprised to hear that he wasn\u2019t, for he\u2019s not only a brilliantly clever man, but a Radical-Socialist and a freemason.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Partly out of courtesy to his friends, whom these expressions of Saint-Loup\u2019s faith in Dreyfus made uncomfortable, and also because the subject was of more interest to myself, I asked my neighbour if it were true that this major gave a demonstration of military history which had a genuine aesthetic beauty. \u201cIt is absolutely true.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut what do you mean by that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, all that you read, let us say, in the narrative of a military historian, the smallest facts, the most trivial happenings, are only the outward signs of an idea which has to be analysed, and which often brings to light other ideas, like a palimpsest. So that you have a field for study as intellectual as any science you care to name, or any art, and one that is satisfying to the mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGive me an example or two, if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is not very easy to explain,\u201d Saint-Loup broke in. \u201cYou read, let us say, that this or that Corps has tried . . . but before we go any further, the serial number of the Corps, its order of battle are not without their significance. If it is not the first time that the operation has been attempted, and if for the same operation we find a different Corps being brought up, it is perhaps a sign that the previous Corps have been wiped out or have suffered heavy casualties in the said operation; that they are no longer in a fit state to carry it through successfully. Next, we must ask ourselves what was this Corps which is now out of action; if it was composed of shock troops, held in reserve for big attacks, a fresh Corps of inferior quality will have little chance of succeeding where the first has failed. Furthermore, if we are not at the start of a campaign, this fresh Corps may itself be a composite formation of odds and ends withdrawn from other Corps, which throws a light on the strength of the forces the belligerent still has at his disposal and the proximity of the moment when his forces shall be definitely inferior to the enemy\u2019s, which gives to the operation on which this Corps is about to engage a different meaning, because, if it is no longer in a condition to make good its losses, its successes even will only help mathematically to bring it nearer to its ultimate destruction. And then, the serial number of the Corps that it has facing it is of no less significance. If, for instance, it is a much weaker unit, which has already accounted for several important units of the attacking force, the whole nature of the operation is changed, since, even if it should end in the loss of the position which the defending force has been holding, simply to have held it for any length of time may be a great success if a very small defending force has been sufficient to disable highly important forces on the other side. You can understand that if, in the analysis of the Corps engaged on both sides, there are all these points of importance, the study of the position itself, of the roads, of the railways which it commands, of the lines of communication which it protects, is of the very highest. One must study what I may call the whole geographical context,\u201d he added with a laugh. And indeed he was so delighted with this expression that, every time he employed it, even months afterwards, it was always accompanied by the same laugh. \u201cWhile the operation is being prepared by one of the belligerents, if you read that one of his patrols has been wiped out in the neighbourhood of the position by the other belligerent, one of the conclusions which you are entitled to draw is that one side was attempting to reconnoitre the defensive works with which the other intended to resist his attack. An exceptional burst of activity at a given point may indicate the desire to capture that point, but equally well the desire to hold the enemy in check there, not to retaliate at the point at which he has attacked you; or it may indeed be only a feint, intended to cover by an increased activity the relief of troops in that sector. (Which was a classic feint in Napoleon\u2019s wars.) On the other hand, to appreciate the significance of any movement, its probable object, and, as a corollary, the other movements by which it will be accompanied or followed, it is not immaterial to consult, not so much the announcements issued by the Higher Command, which may be intended to deceive the enemy, to mask a possible check, as the manual of field operations in use in the country in question. We are always entitled to assume that the manoeuvre which an army has attempted to carry out is that prescribed by the rules that are applicable to the circumstances. If, for instance, the rule lays down that a frontal attack should be accompanied by a flank attack; if, after the flank attack has failed, the Higher Command makes out that it had no connexion with the main attack and was merely a diversion, there is a strong likelihood that the truth will be found by consulting the rules and not the reports issued from Headquarters. And there are not only the regulations governing each army to be considered, but their traditions, their habits, their doctrines; the study of diplomatic activities, with their perpetual action or reaction upon military activities, must not be neglected either. Incidents apparently insignificant, which at the time are not understood, will explain to you how the enemy, counting upon a support which these incidents shew to have been withheld, was able to carry out only a part of his strategic plan. So that, if you can read between the lines of military history, what is a confused jumble for the ordinary reader becomes a chain of reasoning as straightforward as a picture is for the picture-lover who can see what the person portrayed is wearing and has in his hands, while the visitor hurrying through the gallery is bewildered by a blur of colour which gives him a headache. But just as with certain pictures, in which it is not enough to observe that the figure is holding a chalice, but one must know why the painter chose to place a chalice in his hands, what it is intended to symbolise, so these military operations, apart from their immediate object, are quite regularly traced, in the mind of the general responsible for the campaign, from the plans of earlier battles, which we may call the past experience, the literature, the learning, the etymology, the aristocracy (whichever you like) of the battles of to-day. Observe that I am not speaking for the moment of the local, the (what shall I call it?) spatial identity of battles. That exists also. A battle-field has never been, and never will be throughout the centuries, simply the ground upon which a particular battle has been fought. If it has been a battle-field, that was because it combined certain conditions of geographical position, of geological formation, drawbacks even, of a kind that would obstruct the enemy (a river, for instance, cutting his force in two), which made it a good field of battle. And so what it has been it will continue to be. A painter doesn\u2019t make a studio out of any old room; so you don\u2019t make a battle-field out of any old piece of ground. There are places set apart for the purpose. But, once again, this is not what I was telling you about; it was the type of battle which one follows, in a sort of strategic tracing, a tactical imitation, if you like. Battles like Ulm, Lodi, Leipzig, Cannae. I can\u2019t say whether there is ever going to be another war, or what nations are going to fight in it, but, if a war does come, you may be sure that it will include (and deliberately, on the commander\u2019s part) a Cannae, an Austerlitz, a Rosbach, a Waterloo. Some of our people say quite openly that Marshal von Schieffer and General Falkenhausen have prepared a Battle of Cannae against France, in the Hannibal style, pinning their enemy down along his whole front, and advancing on both flanks, especially through Belgium, while Bernhardi prefers the oblique order of Frederick the Great, Lenthen rather than Cannae. Others expound their views less crudely, but I can tell you one thing, my boy, that Beauconseil, the squadron commander I introduced you to the other day, who is an officer with a very great future before him, has swotted up a little Pratzen attack of his own; he knows it inside out, he is keeping it up his sleeve, and if he ever has an opportunity to put it into practice he will make a clean job of it and let us have it on a big scale. The break through in the centre at Rivoli, too; that\u2019s a thing that will crop up if there\u2019s ever another war. It\u2019s no more obsolete than the Iliad. I must add that we are practically condemned to make frontal attacks, because we can\u2019t afford to repeat the mistake we made in Seventy; we must assume the offensive, and nothing else. The only thing that troubles me is that if I see only the slower, more antiquated minds among us opposing this splendid doctrine, still, one of the youngest of my masters, who is a genius, I mean Mangin, would like us to leave room, provisionally of course, for the defensive. It is not very easy to answer him when he cites the example of Austerlitz, where the defence was merely a prelude to attack and victory.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The enunciation of these theories by Saint-Loup made me happy. They gave me to hope that perhaps I was not being led astray, in my life at Donci\u00e8res, with regard to these officers whom I used to hear being discussed while I sat sipping a sauterne which bathed them in its charming golden glint, by the same magnifying power which had swollen to such enormous proportions in my eyes while I was at Balbec the King and Queen of the South Sea Island, the little group of the four epicures, the young gambler, Legrandin\u2019s brother-in-law, now shrunken so in my view as to appear nonexistent. What gave me pleasure to-day would not, perhaps, leave me indifferent to-morrow, as had always happened hitherto; the creature that I still was at this moment was not, perhaps, doomed to immediate destruction since to the ardent and fugitive passion which I had felt on these few evenings for everything connected with military life, Saint-Loup, by what he had just been saying to me, touching the art of war, added an intellectual foundation, of a permanent character, capable of attaching me to itself so strongly that I might, without any attempt to deceive myself, feel assured that after I had left Donci\u00e8res I should continue to take an interest in the work of my friends there, and should not be long in coming to pay them another visit. At the same time, so as to make quite sure that this art of war was indeed an art in the true sense of the word:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou interest me \u2014 I beg your pardon, tu interest me enormously,\u201d I said to Saint-Loup, \u201cbut tell me, there is one point that puzzles me. I feel that I could be keenly thrilled by the art of strategy, but if so I must first be sure that it is not so very different from the other arts, that knowing the rules is not everything. You tell me that plans of battles are copied. I do find something aesthetic, just as you said, in seeing beneath a modern battle the plan of an older one, I can\u2019t tell you how attractive it sounds. But then, does the genius of the commander count for nothing? Does he really do no more than apply the rules? Or, in point of science, are there great generals as there are great surgeons, who, when the symptoms exhibited by two states of ill-health are identical to the outward eye, nevertheless feel, for some infinitesimal reason, founded perhaps on their experience, but interpreted afresh, that in one case they ought to do one thing, in another case another; that in one case it is better to operate, in another to wait?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should just say so! You will find Napoleon not attacking when all the rules ordered him to attack, but some obscure divination warned him not to. For instance, look at Austerlitz, or in 1806 take his instructions to Lannes. But you will find certain generals slavishly imitating one of Napoleon\u2019s movements and arriving at a diametrically opposite result. There are a dozen examples of that in 1870. But even for the interpretation of what the enemy may do, what he actually does is only a symptom which may mean any number of different things. Each of them has an equal chance of being the right thing, if one looks only to reasoning and science, just as in certain difficult cases all the medical science in the world will be powerless to decide whether the invisible tumour is malignant or not, whether or not the operation ought to be performed. It is his instinct, his divination \u2014 like Mme. de Th\u00e8bes (you follow me?)\u2014 which decides, in the great general as in the great doctor. Thus I\u2019ve been telling you, to take one instance, what might be meant by a reconnaissance on the eve of a battle. But it may mean a dozen other things also, such as to make the enemy think you are going to attack him at one point whereas you intend to attack him at another, to put out a screen which will prevent him from seeing the preparations for your real operation, to force him to bring up fresh troops, to hold them, to immobilise them in a different place from where they are needed, to form an estimate of the forces at his disposal, to feel him, to force him to shew his hand. Sometimes, indeed, the fact that you employ an immense number of troops in an operation is by no means a proof that that is your true objective; for you may be justified in carrying it out, even if it is only a feint, so that your feint may have a better chance of deceiving the enemy. If I had time now to go through the Napoleonic wars from this point of view, I assure you that these simple classic movements which we study here, and which you will come and see us practising in the field, just for the pleasure of a walk, you young rascal \u2014 no, I know you\u2019re not well, I apologise! \u2014 well, in a war, when you feel behind you the vigilance, the judgment, the profound study of the Higher Command, you are as much moved by them as by the simple lamps of a lighthouse, only a material combustion, but an emanation of the spirit, sweeping through space to warn ships of danger. I may have been wrong, perhaps, in speaking to you only of the literature of war. In reality, as the formation of the soil, the direction of wind and light tell us which way a tree will grow, so the conditions in which a campaign is fought, the features of the country through which you march, prescribe, to a certain extent, and limit the number of the plans among which the general has to choose. Which means that along a mountain range, through a system of valleys, over certain plains, it is almost with the inevitability and the tremendous beauty of an avalanche that you can forecast the line of an army on the march.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow you deny me that freedom of choice in the commander, that power of divination in the enemy who is trying to discover his plan, which you allowed me a moment ago.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all. You remember that book of philosophy we read together at Balbec, the richness of the world of possibilities compared with the real world. Very well. It is the same again with the art of strategy. In a given situation there will be four plans that offer themselves, one of which the general has to choose, as a disease may pass through various phases for which the doctor has to watch. And here again the weakness and greatness of the human elements are fresh causes of uncertainty. For of these four plans let us assume that contingent reasons (such as the attainment of minor objects, or time, which may be pressing, or the smallness of his effective strength and shortage of rations) lead the general to prefer the first, which is less perfect, but less costly also to carry out, is more rapid, and has for its terrain a richer country for feeding his troops. He may, after having begun with this plan, which the enemy, uncertain at first, will soon detect, find that success lies beyond his grasp, the difficulties being too great (that is what I call the element of human weakness), abandon it and try the second or third or fourth. But it may equally be that he has tried the first plan (and this is what I call human greatness) merely as a feint to pin down the enemy, so as to surprise him later at a point where he has not been expecting an attack. Thus at Ulm, Mack, who expected the enemy to advance from the west, was surrounded from the north where he thought he was perfectly safe. My example is not a very good one, as a matter of fact. And Ulm is a better type of enveloping battle, which the future will see reproduced, because it is not only a classic example from which generals will seek inspiration, but a form that is to some extent necessary (one of several necessities, which leaves room for choice, for variety) like a type of crystallisation. But it doesn\u2019t much matter, really, because these conditions are after all artificial. To go back to our philosophy book; it is like the rules of logic or scientific laws, reality does conform to it more or less, but bear in mind that the great mathematician Poincar\u00e9 is by no means certain that mathematics are strictly accurate. As to the rules themselves, which I mentioned to you, they are of secondary importance really, and besides they are altered from time to time. We cavalrymen, for instance, have to go by the Field Service of 1895, which, you may say, is out of date since it is based on the old and obsolete doctrine which maintains that cavalry warfare has little more than a moral effect, in the panic that the charge creates in the enemy. Whereas the more intelligent of our teachers, all the best brains in the cavalry, and particularly the major I was telling you about, anticipate on the contrary that the decisive victory will be obtained by a real hand-to-hand encounter in which our weapons will be sabre and lance and the side that can hold out longer will win, not simply morally and by creating panic, but materially.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSaint-Loup is quite right, and it is probable that the next Field Service will shew signs of this evolution,\u201d put in my other neighbour\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am not ungrateful for your support, for your opinions seem to make more impression upon my friend than mine,\u201d said Saint-Loup with a smile, whether because the growing attraction between his comrade and myself annoyed him slightly or because he thought it graceful to solemnise it with this official confirmation. \u201cPerhaps I may have underestimated the importance of the rules; I don\u2019t know. They do change, that must be admitted. But in the meantime they control the military situation, the plans of campaign and concentration. If they reflect a false conception of strategy they may be the principal cause of defeat. All this is a little too technical for you,\u201d he remarked to me. \u201cAfter all, you may say that what does most to accelerate the evolution of the art of war is wars themselves. In the course of a campaign, if it is at all long, you will see one belligerent profiting by the lessons furnished him by the successes and mistakes, perfecting the methods of the other, who will improve on him in turn. But all that is a thing of the past. With the terrible advance of artillery, the wars of the future, if there are to be any more wars, will be so short that, before we have had time to think of putting our lessons into practice, peace will have been signed.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t be so touchy,\u201d I told Saint-Loup, reverting to the first words ol this speech. \u201cI was listening to you quite eagerly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf you will kindly not fly into a passion, and will allow me to speak,\u201d his friend went on, \u201cI shall add to what you have just been saying that if battles copy and coincide with one another it is not merely due to the mind of the commander. It may happen that a mistake on his part (for instance, his failure to appreciate the strength of the enemy) will lead him to call upon his men for extravagant sacrifices, sacrifices which certain units will make with an abnegation so sublime that their part in the battle will be analogous to that played by some other unit in some other battle, and these will be quoted in history as interchangeable examples: to stick to 1870, we have the Prussian Guard at Saint-Privat, and the Turcos at Froeschviller and Wissembourg.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Interchangeable; very neat! Excellent! The lad has brains,\u201d was Saint-Loup\u2019s comment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was not unmoved by these last examples, as always when, beneath the particular instance, I was afforded a glimpse of the general law. Still, the genius of the commander, that was what interested me, I was anxious to discover in what it consisted, what steps, in given circumstances, when the commander who lacked genius could not withstand the enemy, the inspired leader would take to re-establish his jeopardised position, which, according to Saint-Loup, was quite possible and had been done by Napoleon more than once. And to understand what military worth meant I asked for comparisons between the various generals whom I knew by name, which of them had most markedly the character of a leader, the gifts of a tactician; at the risk of boring my new friends, who however shewed no signs of boredom, but continued to answer me with an inexhaustible good nature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I felt myself isolated, not only from the great, freezing night which extended far around us and in which we heard from time to time the whistle of a train which only rendered more keen the pleasure of being where we were, or the chime of an hour which, happily, was still a long way short of that at which these young men would have to buckle on their sabres and go, but also from all my external obsessions, almost from the memory of Mme. de Guermantes, by the hospitality of Saint-Loup, to which that of his friends, reinforcing it, gave, so to speak, a greater solidity; by the warmth also of this little dining-room, by the savour of the well-chosen dishes that were set before us. They gave as much pleasure to my imagination as to my appetite; sometimes the little piece of still life from which they had been taken, the rugged holy water stoup of the oyster in which lingered a few drops of brackish water, or the knotted stem, the yellow leaves of a bunch of grapes still enveloped them, inedible, poetic and remote as a landscape, and producing, at different points in the course of the meal, the impressions of rest in the shade of a vine and of an excursion out to sea; on other evenings it was the cook alone who threw into relief these original properties of our food, which he presented in its natural setting, like a work of art; and a fish cooked in wine was brought in on a long earthenware dish, on which, as it stood out in relief on a bed of bluish herbs, unbreakable now but still contorted from having been dropped alive into boiling water, surrounded by a circle of satellite creatures in their shells, crabs, shrimps and mussels, it had the appearance of being part of a ceramic design by Bernard Palissy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am jealous, furious,\u201d Saint-Loup attacked me, half smiling, half in earnest, alluding to the interminable conversations aside which I had been having with his friend. \u201cIs it because you find him more intelligent than me; do you like him better than me? Well, I suppose he\u2019s everything now, and no one else is to have a look in!\u201d Men who are enormously in love with a woman, who live in the society of woman-lovers, allow themselves pleasantries on which others, who would see less innocence in them, would never venture\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the conversation became general, they avoided any reference to Dreyfus for fear of offending Saint-Loup. The following week, however, two of his friends were remarking what a curious thing it was that, living in so military an atmosphere, he was so keen a Dreyfusard, almost an anti-militarist. \u201cThe reason is,\u201d I suggested, not wishing to enter into details, \u201cthat the influence of environment is not so important as people think . . . \u201d I intended of course to stop at this point, and not to reiterate the observations which I had made to Saint-Loup a few days earlier. Since, however, I had repeated these words almost textually, I proceeded to excuse myself by adding: \u201cAs, in fact, I was saying the other day . . . \u201d But I had reckoned without the reverse side of Robert\u2019s polite admiration of myself and certain other persons. That admiration reached its fulfilment in so entire an assimilation of their ideas that, in the course of a day or two, he would have completely forgotten that those ideas were not his own. And so, in the matter of my modest theory, Saint-Loup, for all the world as though it had always dwelt in his own brain, and as though I were merely poaching on his preserves, felt it incumbent upon him to greet my discovery with warm approval\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, yes; environment is of no importance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with as much vehemence as if he were afraid of my interrupting, or failing to understand him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe real influence is that of one\u2019s intellectual environment! One is the man of one\u2019s idea!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stopped for a moment, with the satisfied smile of one who has digested his dinner, dropped his eyeglass and, fixing me with a gimlet-like stare:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll men with similar ideas are alike,\u201d he informed me, with a challenging air. Probably he had completely forgotten that I myself had said to him, only a few days earlier, what on the other hand he remembered so well\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not arrive at Saint-Loup\u2019s restaurant every evening in the same state of mind. If a memory, a sorrow that weigh on us are able to leave us so effectively that we are no longer aware of them, they can also return and sometimes remain with us for a long time. There were evenings when, as I passed through the town on my way to the restaurant, I felt so keen a longing for Mme. de Guermantes that I could scarcely breathe; you might have said that part of my breast had been cut open by a skilled anatomist, taken out, and replaced by an equal part of immaterial suffering, by an equivalent load of longing and love. And however neatly the wound may have been stitched together, there is not much comfort in life when regret for the loss of another person is substituted for one\u2019s entrails, it seems to be occupying more room than they, one feels it perpetually, and besides, what a contradiction in terms to be obliged to think a part of one\u2019s body. Only it seems that we are worth more, somehow. At the whisper of a breeze we sigh, from oppression, but from weariness also. I would look up at the sky. If it were clear, I would say to myself: \u201cPerhaps she is in the country; she is looking at the same stars; and, for all I know, when I arrive at the restaurant Robert may say to me: \u2018Good news! I have just heard from my aunt; she wants to meet you; she is coming down here.\u2019\u201d It was not in the firmament alone that I enshrined the thought of Mme. de Guermantes, A passing breath of air, more fragrant than the rest, seemed to bring me a message from her, as, long ago, from Gilberte in the cornfields of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise. We do not change; we introduce into the feeling with which we regard a person many slumbering elements which that feeling revives but which are foreign to it. Besides, with these feelings for particular people, there is always something in us that is trying to bring them nearer to the truth, that is to say, to absorb them in a more general feeling, common to the whole of humanity, with which people and the suffering that they cause us are merely a means to enable us to communicate. What brought a certain pleasure into my grief was that I knew it to be a tiny fragment of the universal love. Simply because I thought that I recognised sorrows which I had felt on Gilberte\u2019s account, or else when in the evenings at Combray Mamma would not stay in any room, and also the memory of certain pages of Bergotte, in the agony I now felt, to which Mme. de Guermantes, her coldness, her absence, were not clearly linked, as cause is to effect in the mind of a philosopher, I did not conclude that Mme. de Guermantes was not the cause of that agony. Is there not such a thing as a diffused bodily pain, extending, radiating out into other parts, which, however, it leaves, to vanish altogether, if the practitioner lays his finger on the precise spot from which it springs? And yet, until that moment, its extension gave it for us so vague, so fatal a semblance that, powerless to explain or even to locate it, we imagined that there was no possibility of its being healed. As I made my way to the restaurant I said to myself: \u201cA fortnight already since I last saw Mme. de Guermantes.\u201d A fortnight which did not appear so enormous an interval save to me, who, when Mme. de Guermantes was concerned, reckoned time by minutes. For me it was no longer the stars and the breeze merely, but the arithmetical divisions of time that assumed a dolorous and poetic aspect. Each day now was like the loose crest of a crumbling mountain, down one side of which I felt that I could descend into oblivion, but down the other was borne by the necessity of seeing the Duchess again. And I was continually inclining one way or the other, having no stable equilibrium. One day I said to myself: \u201cPerhaps there will be a letter to-night;\u201d and on entering the dining-room I found courage to ask Saint-Loup:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t happen to have had any news from Paris?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he replied gloomily; \u201cbad news.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I breathed a sigh of relief when I realised that it was only he who was unhappy, and that the news came from his mistress. But I soon saw that one of its consequences would be to prevent Robert, for ever so long, from taking me to see his aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I learned that a quarrel had broken out between him and his mistress, through the post presumably, unless she had come down to pay him a flying visit between trains. And the quarrels, even when relatively slight, which they had previously had, had always seemed as though they must prove insoluble. For she was a girl of violent temper, who would stamp her foot and burst into tears for reasons as incomprehensible as those that make children shut themselves into dark cupboards, not come out for dinner, refuse to give any explanation, and only redouble their sobs when, our patience exhausted, we visit them with a whipping. To say that Saint-Loup suffered terribly from this estrangement would be an understatement of the truth, which would give the reader a false impression of his grief. When he found himself alone, the only picture in his mind being that of his mistress parting from him with the respect which she had felt for him at the sight of his energy, the anxieties which he had had at first gave way before the irreparable, and the cessation of an anxiety is so pleasant a thing that the rupture, once it was certain, assumed for him something of the same kind of charm as a reconciliation. What he began to suffer from, a little later, was a secondary and accidental grief, the tide of which flowed incessantly from his own heart, at the idea that perhaps she would be glad to make it up, that it was not inconceivable that she was waiting for a word from him, that in the mean time, to be avenged on him, she would perhaps on a certain evening, in a certain place, do a certain thing, and that he had only to telegraph to her that he was coming for it not to happen, that others perhaps were taking advantage of the time which he was letting slip, and that in a few days it would be too late to recapture her, for she would be already bespoke. Among all these possibilities he was certain of nothing; his mistress preserved a silence which wrought him up to such a frenzy of grief that he began to ask himself whether she might not be in hiding at Donci\u00e8res, or have sailed for the Indies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has been said that silence is a force; in another and widely different sense it is a tremendous force in the hands of those who are loved. It increases the anxiety of the lover who has to wait. Nothing so tempts us to approach another person as what is keeping us apart; and what barrier is there so insurmountable as silence? It has been said also that silence is a torture, capable of goading to madness him who is condemned to it in a prison cell. But what a torture \u2014 keener than that of having to keep silence \u2014 to have to endure the silence of the person one loves! Robert asked himself: \u201cWhat can she be doing, never to send me a single word, like this? She hates me, perhaps, and will always go on hating me.\u201d And he reproached himself. Thus her silence did indeed drive him mad with jealousy and remorse. Besides, more cruel than the silence of prisons, that kind of silence is in itself a prison. An immaterial enclosure, I admit, but impenetrable, this interposed slice of empty atmosphere through which, despite its emptiness, the visual rays of the abandoned lover cannot pass. Is there a more terrible illumination than that of silence which shews us not one absent love but a thousand, and shews us each of them in the act of indulging in some fresh betrayal? Sometimes, in an abrupt relaxation of his strain, Robert would imagine that this period of silence was just coming to an end, that the long expected letter was on its way. He saw it, it arrived, he started at every sound, his thirst was already quenched, he murmured: \u201cThe letter! The letter!\u201d After this glimpse of a phantom oasis of affection, he found himself once more toiling across the real desert of a silence without end\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He suffered in anticipation, without a single omission, all the griefs and pains of a rupture which at other moments he fancied he might somehow contrive to avoid, like people who put all their affairs in order with a view to a migration abroad which they never make, whose minds, no longer certain where they will find themselves living next day, flutter helplessly for the time being, detached from them, like a heart that is taken out of a dying man and continues to beat, though disjoined from the rest of his body. Anyhow, this hope that his mistress would return gave him courage to persevere in the rupture, as the belief that one will return alive from the battle helps one to face death. And inasmuch as habit is, of all the plants of human growth, the one that has least need of nutritious soil in order to live, and is the first to appear upon what is apparently the most barren rock, perhaps had he begun by effecting their rupture as a feint he would in the end have grown genuinely accustomed to it. But his uncertainty kept him in a state of emotion which, linked with the memory of the woman herself, was akin to love. He forced himself, nevertheless, not to write to her, thinking perhaps that it was a less cruel torment to live without his mistress than with her in certain conditions, or else that, after the way in which they had parted, it was necessary to wait for excuses from her, if she was to keep what he believed her to feel for him in the way, if not of love, at any rate of esteem and regard. He contented himself with going to the telephone, which had recently been installed at Donci\u00e8res, and asking for news from, or giving instructions to a lady\u2019s maid whom he had procured and placed with his friend. These communications were, as it turned out, complicated and took up much of his time, since, influenced by what her literary friends preached to her about the ugliness of the capital, but principally for the sake of her animals, her dogs, her monkey, her canaries and her parrokeet, whose incessant din her Paris landlord had declined to tolerate for another moment, Robert\u2019s mistress had now taken a little house in the neighbourhood of Versailles. Meanwhile he, down at Donci\u00e8res, no longer slept a wink all night. Once, in my room, overcome by exhaustion, he dozed off for a little. But suddenly he began to talk, tried to get up and run, to stop something from happening, said: \u201cI hear her; you shan\u2019t . . . you shan\u2019t. . . . \u201d He awoke. He had been dreaming, he explained to me, that he was in the country with the serjeant-major. His host had tried to keep him away from a certain part of the house. Saint-Loup had discovered that the serjeant-major had staying with him a subaltern, extremely rich and extremely vicious, whom he knew to have a violent passion for his mistress. And suddenly in his dream he had distinctly heard the spasmodic, regular cries which his mistress was in the habit of uttering at the moment of gratification. He had tried to force the serjeant-major to take him to the room in which she was. And the other had held him back, to keep him from going there, with an air of annoyance at such a want of discretion in a guest which, Robert said, he would never be able to forget\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt was an idiotic dream,\u201d he concluded, still quite breathless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the same I could see that, during the hour that followed, he was more than once on the point of telephoning to his mistress to beg for a reconciliation. My father had now had the telephone for some time at home, but I doubt whether that would have been of much use to Saint-Loup. Besides, it hardly seemed to me quite proper to make my parents, or even a mechanical instrument installed in their house, play pander between Saint-Loup and his mistress, ladylike and high-minded as the latter might be. His bad dream began to fade from his memory. With a fixed and absent stare, he came to see me on each of those cruel days which traced in my mind as they followed one after the other the splendid sweep of a staircase forged in hard metal on which Robert stood asking himself what decision his friend was going to take\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At length she wrote to ask whether he would consent to forgive her. As soon as he realised that a definite rupture had been avoided he saw all the disadvantages of a reconciliation. Besides, he had already begun to suffer less acutely, and had almost accepted a grief the sharp tooth of which he would have, in a few months perhaps, to feel again if their intimacy were to be resumed. He did not hesitate for long. And perhaps he hesitated only because he was now certain of being able to recapture his mistress, of being able to do it and therefore of doing it. Only she asked him, so that she might have time to recover her equanimity, not to come to Paris at the New Year. Now he had not the heart to go to Paris without seeing her. On the other hand, she had declared her willingness to go abroad with him, bot for that he would need to make a formal application for leave, which Captain de Borodino was unwilling to grant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m sorry about it, because of your meeting with my aunt, which will have to be put off. I dare say I shall be in Paris at Easter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe shan\u2019t be able to call on Mme. de Guermantes then, because I shall have gone to Balbec. But, really, it doesn\u2019t matter in the least, I assure you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo Balbec? But you didn\u2019t go there till August.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know; but next year they\u2019re making me go there earlier, for my health.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All that he feared was that I might form a bad impression of his mistress, after what he had told me. \u201cShe is violent simply because she is too frank, too thorough in her feelings. But she is a sublime creature. You can\u2019t imagine what exquisite poetry there is in her. She goes every year to spend all Souls\u2019 Day at Bruges. \u2018Nice\u2019 of her, don\u2019t you think? If you ever do meet her you\u2019ll see what I mean; she has a greatness. . . . \u201d And, as he was infected with certain of the mannerisms used in the literary circles in which the lady moved: \u201cThere is something sidereal about her, in fact something bardic; you know what I mean, the poet merging into the priest.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was searching all through dinner for a pretext which would enable Saint-Loup to ask his aunt to see me without my having to wait until he came to Paris. Now such a pretext was furnished by the desire that I had to see some more pictures by Elstir, the famous painter whom Saint-Loup and I had met at Balbec. A pretext behind which there was, moreover, an element of truth, for if, on my visits to Elstir, what I had asked of his painting had been that it should lead me to the comprehension and love of things better than itself, a real thaw, an authentic square in a country town, live women on a beach (all the more would I have commissioned from it the portraits of the realities which I had not been able to fathom, such as a lane of hawthorn-blossoms, not so much that it might perpetuate their beauty for me as that it might reveal that beauty to me), now, on the other hand, it was the originality, the seductive attraction of those paintings that aroused my desire, and what I wanted above anything else was to look at other pictures by Elstir\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to me, also, that the least of his pictures were something quite different from the masterpieces even of greater painters than himself. His work was like a realm apart, whose frontiers were not to be passed, matchless in substance. Eagerly collecting the infrequent periodicals in which articles on him and his work had appeared, I had learned that it was only recently that he had begun to paint landscapes and still life, and that he had started with mythological subjects (I had seen photographs of two of these in his studio), and had then been for long under the influence of Japanese art\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several of the works most characteristic of his various manners were scattered about the provinces. A certain house at les Andelys, in which there was one of his finest landscapes, seemed to me as precious, gave me as keen a desire to go there and see it as did a village in the Chartres district, among whose millstone walls was enshrined a glorious painted window; and towards the possessor of this treasure, towards the man who, inside his ugly house, on the main Street, closeted like an astrologer, sat questioning one of those mirrors of the world which Elstir\u2019s pictures were, and who had perhaps bought it for many thousands of francs, I felt myself borne by that instinctive sympathy which joins the very hearts, the inmost natures of those who think alike upon a vital subject. Now three important works by my favourite painter were described in one of these articles as belonging to Mme. de Guermantes. So that it was, after all, quite sincerely that, on the evening on which Saint-Loup told me of his lady\u2019s projected visit to Bruges, I was able, during dinner, in front of his friends, to let fall, as though on the spur of the moment:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, if you don\u2019t mind. Just one last word on the subject of the lady we were speaking about. You remember Elstir, the painter I met at Balbec?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, of course I do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou remember how much I admired his work?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI do, quite well; and the letter we sent him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well, one of the reasons \u2014 not one of the chief reasons, a subordinate reason \u2014 why I should like to meet the said lady \u2014 you do know who\u2019 I mean, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course I do. How involved you\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIs that she has in her house one very fine picture, at least, by Elstir.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, I never knew that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cElstir will probably be at Balbec at Easter; you know he stays down there now all the year round, practically. I should very much like to have seen this picture before I leave Paris. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019re on sufficiently intimate terms with your aunt: but couldn\u2019t you manage, somehow, to give her so good an impression of me that she won\u2019t refuse, and then ask her if she\u2019ll let me come and see the picture without you, since you won\u2019t be there?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll answer for her; I\u2019ll make a special point of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Robert, you are an angel; I do love you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s very nice of you to love me, but it would be equally nice if you were to call me tu, as you promised, and as you began to do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope it\u2019s not your departure that you two are plotting together,\u201d one of Robert\u2019s friends said to me. \u201cYou know, if Saint-Loup does go on leave, it needn\u2019t make any difference, we shall still be here. It will be less amusing for you, perhaps, but we\u2019ll do all we can to make you forget his absence.\u201d As a matter of fact, just as we had decided that Robert\u2019s mistress would have to go to Bruges by herself, the news came that Captain de Borodino, obdurate hitherto in his refusal, had given authority for Serjeant Saint-Loup to proceed on long leave to Bruges. What had happened was this. The Prince, extremely proud of his luxuriant head of hair, was an assiduous customer of the principal hairdresser in the town, who had started life as a boy under Napoleon III\u2019s barber. Captain de Borodino was on the best of terms with the hairdresser, being, in spite of his air of majesty, quite simple in his dealings with his inferiors. But the hairdresser, through whose books the Prince\u2019s account had been running without payment for at least five years, swollen no less by bottles of Portugal and Eau des Souverains, irons, razors, and strops, than by the ordinary charges for shampooing, haircutting and the like, had a greater respect for Saint-Loup, who always paid on the nail and kept several carriages and saddle-horses. Having learned of Saint-Loup\u2019s vexation at not being able to go with his mistress, he had spoken strongly about it to the Prince at a moment when he was trussed up in a white surplice with his head held firmly over the back of the chair and his throat menaced by a razor. This narrative of a young man\u2019s gallant adventures won from the princely captain a smile of Bonapartish indulgence. It is hardly probable that he thought of his unpaid bill, but the barber\u2019s recommendation tended to put him in as good a humour as one from a duke would have put him in a bad. While his chin was still smothered in soap, the leave was promised, and the warrant was signed that evening. As for the hairdresser, who was in the habit of boasting all day long of his own exploits, and in order to do so claimed for himself, shewing an astonishing faculty for lying, distinctions that were pure fabrications, having for once rendered this signal service to Saint-Loup, not only did he refrain from publishing it broadcast, but, as if vanity were obliged to lie, and when there was no scope for lying gave place to modesty, he never mentioned the matter to Robert again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All his friends assured me that, as long as I stayed at Donci\u00e8res, or if I should come there again at any time, even although Robert were away, their horses, their quarters, their time would be at my disposal, and I felt that it was with the greatest cordiality that these young men put their comfort and youth and strength at the service of my weakness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy on earth,\u201d they went on, after insisting that I should stay, \u201cdon\u2019t you come down here every year; you see how our quiet life appeals to you! Besides you\u2019re so keen about everything that goes on in the regiment; quite the old soldier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For I continued my eager demands that they would classify the different officers whose names I knew according to the degree of admiration which they seemed to deserve, just as, in my schooldays, I used to make the other boys classify the actors of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais. If, in the place of one of the generals whom I had always heard mentioned at the head of the list, such as Galliffet or N\u00e9grier, one of Saint-Loup\u2019s friends, with a contemptuous: \u201cBut N\u00e9grier is one of the feeblest of our general officers,\u201d put the new, intact, appetising name of Pau or Geslin de Bourgogne, I felt the same joyful surprise as long ago when the outworn name of Thiron or Febvre was sent flying by the sudden explosion of the unfamiliar name of Amaury. \u201cBetter even than N\u00e9grier? But in what respect; give me an example?\u201d I should have liked there to exist profound differences even among the junior officers of the regiment, and I hoped in the reason for these differences to seize the essential quality of what constituted military superiority. The one whom I should have been most interested to hear discussed, because he was the one whom I had most often seen, was the Prince de Borodino. But neither Saint-Loup nor his friends, if they did justice to the fine officer who kept his squadron up to the supreme pitch of efficiency, liked the man. Without speaking of him, naturally, in the same tone as of certain other officers, rankers and freemasons, who did not associate much with the rest and had, in comparison, an uncouth, barrack-room manner, they seemed not to include M. de Borodino among the officers of noble birth, from whom, it must be admitted, he differed considerably in his attitude even towards Saint-Loup. The others, taking advantage of the fact that Robert was only an N.C.O., and that therefore his influential relatives might be grateful were he invited to the houses of superior officers on whom ordinarily they would have looked down, lost no opportunity of having him to dine when any bigwig was expected who might be of use to a young cavalry serjeant. Captain de Borodino alone confined himself to his official relations (which, for that matter, were always excellent) with Robert. The fact was that the Prince, whose grandfather had been made a Marshal and a Prince-Duke by the Emperor, with whose family he had subsequently allied himself by marriage, while his father had married a cousin of Napoleon III and had twice been a Minister after the Coup d\u2019Etat, felt that in spite of all this he did not count for much with Saint-Loup and the Guermantes connexion, who in turn, since he did not look at things from the same point of view as they, counted for very little with him. He suspected that, for Saint-Loup, he himself was \u2014 he, a kinsman of the Hohenzollern \u2014 not a true noble but the grandson of a farmer, but at the same time he regarded Saint-Loup as the son of a man whose Countship had been confirmed by the Emperor \u2014 one of what were known in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as \u2018touched-up\u2019 Counts \u2014 and who had besought him first for a Prefecture, then for some other post a long way down the list of subordinates to His Highness the Prince de Borodino, Minister of State, who was styled on his letters \u2018Monseigneur\u2019 and was a nephew of the Sovereign\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Something more than a nephew, possibly. The first Princesse de Borodino was reputed to have bestowed her favours on Napoleon I, whom she followed to the Isle of Elba, and the second hers on Napoleon III. And if, in the Captain\u2019s placid countenance, one caught a trace of Napoleon I\u2014 if not in his natural features, at least in the studied majesty of the mask \u2014 the officer had, particularly in his melancholy and kindly gaze, in his drooping moustache, something that reminded one also of Napoleon III; and this in so striking a fashion that, having asked leave, after Sedan, to join the Emperor in captivity, and having been sent away by Bismarck, before whom he had been brought, the latter, happening to look up at the young man who was preparing to leave the room, was at once impressed by the likeness and, reconsidering his decision, recalled him and gave him the authorisation which he, in common with every one else, had just been refused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the Prince de Borodino was not prepared to make overtures to Saint-Loup nor to the other representatives of Faubourg Saint-Germain society that there were in the regiment (while he frequently invited two subalterns of plebeian origin who were pleasant companions) it was because, looking down upon them all from the height of his Imperial grandeur, he drew between these two classes of inferiors the distinction that one set consisted of inferiors who knew themselves to be such and with whom he was delighted to spend his time, being beneath his outward majesty of a simple, jovial humour, and the other of inferiors who thought themselves his superiors, a claim which he could not allow. And so, while all the other officers of the regiment made much of Saint-Loup, the Prince de Borodino, to whose care the young man had been recommended by Marshal X\u2014 \u2014 confined himself to being obliging with regard to the military duties which Saint-Loup always performed in the most exemplary fashion, but never had him to his house except on one special occasion when he found himself practically compelled to invite him, and when, as this occurred during my stay at Donci\u00e8res, he asked him to bring me to dinner also. I had no difficulty that evening, as I watched Saint-Loup sitting at his Captain\u2019s table, in distinguishing, in their respective manners and refinements, the difference that existed between the two aristocracies: the old nobility and that of the Empire. The offspring of a caste the faults of which, even if he repudiated them with all the force of his intellect, had been absorbed into his blood, a caste which, having ceased to exert any real authority for at least a century, saw nothing more now in the protective affability which formed part of its regular course of education, than an exercise, like horsemanship or fencing, cultivated without any serious purpose, as a sport; on meeting representatives of that middle class on which the old nobility so far looked down as to believe that they were nattered by its intimacy and would be honoured by the informality of its tone, Saint-Loup would take the hand of no matter who might be introduced to him, though he had failed perhaps to catch the stranger\u2019s name, in a friendly grip, and as he talked to him (crossing and uncrossing his legs all the time, flinging himself back in his chair in an attitude of absolute unconstraint, one foot in the palm of his hand) call him \u2018my dear fellow.\u2019 Belonging o the other hand to a nobility whose titles still preserved their original meaning, provided that their holders still possessed the splendid emoluments given in reward for glorious services and bringing to mind the record of high offices in which one is in command of numberless men and must know how to deal with men, the Prince de Borodino \u2014 not perhaps very distinctly or with any clear personal sense of superiority, but at any rate in his body, which revealed it by its attitudes and behaviour generally \u2014 regarded his own rank as a prerogative that was still effective; those same commoners whom Saint-Loup would have slapped on the shoulder and taken by the arm he addressed with a majestic affability, in which a reserve instinct with grandeur tempered the smiling good-fellowship that came naturally to him, in a tone marked at once by a genuine kindliness and a stiffness deliberately assumed. This was due, no doubt, to his being not so far removed from the great Embassies, and the Court itself, at which his father had held the highest posts, whereas the manners of Saint-Loup, the elbow on the table, the foot in the hand, would not have been well received there; but principally it was due to the fact that he looked down less upon the middle classes because they were the inexhaustible source from which the first Emperor had chosen his marshals and his nobles and in which the second had found a Rouher and a Fould\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Son, doubtless, or grandson of an Emperor, who had nothing more important to do than to command a squadron, the preoccupations of his putative father and grandfather could not, for want of an object on which to fasten themselves, survive in any real sense in the mind of M. de Borodino. But as the spirit of an artist continues to model, for many years after he is dead, the statue which he carved, so they had taken shape in him, were materialised, incarnate in him, it was they that his face reflected. It was with, in his voice, the vivacity of the first Emperor that he worded a reprimand to a corporal, with the dreamy melancholy of the second that he puffed out the smoke of a cigarette. When he passed in plain clothes through the streets of Donci\u00e8res, a certain sparkle in his eyes escaping from under the brim of the bowler hat sent radiating round this captain of cavalry a regal incognito; people trembled when he strode into the serjeant-major\u2019s office, followed by the adjutant and the quartermaster, as though by Berthier and Mass\u00e9na. When he chose the cloth for his squadron\u2019s breeches, he fastened on the master-tailor a gaze capable of baffling Talleyrand and deceiving Alexander; and at times, in the middle of an inspection, he would stop, let his handsome blue eyes cloud with dreams, twist his moustache, with the air of one building up a new Prussia and a new Italy. But a moment later, reverting from Napoleon III to Napoleon I, he would point out that the equipment was not properly polished, and would insist on tasting the men\u2019s rations. And at home, in his private life, it was for the wives of middle class officers (provided that their husbands were not freemasons) that he would bring out not only a dinner service of royal blue S\u00e8vres, fit for an Ambassador (which had been given to his father by Napoleon, and appeared even more priceless in the commonplace house on a provincial street in which he was living, like those rare porcelains which tourists admire with a special delight in the rustic china-cupboard of some old manor that has been converted into a comfortable and prosperous farmhouse), but other gifts of the Emperor also: those noble and charming manners, which too would have won admiration in some diplomatic post abroad, if, for some men, it did not mean a lifelong condemnation to the most unjust form of ostracism, merely to be well born; his easy gestures, his kindness, his grace, and, embedding beneath an enamel that was of royal blue, also glorious images, the mysterious, illuminated, living reliquary of his gaze. And, in treating of the social relations with the middle classes which the Prince had at Donci\u00e8res, it may be as well to add these few words. The lieutenant-colonel played the piano beautifully; the senior medical officer\u2019s wife sang like a Conservatoire medallist. This latter couple, as well as the lieutenant-colonel and his wife, used to dine every week with M. de Borodino. They were flattered, unquestionably, knowing that when the Prince went to Paris on leave he dined with Mme. de Pourtal\u00e8s, and the Murats, and people like that. \u201cBut,\u201d they said to themselves, \u201che\u2019s just a captain, after all; he\u2019s only too glad to get us to come. Still, he\u2019s a real friend, you know.\u201d But when M. de Borodino, who had long been pulling every possible wire to secure an appointment for himself nearer Paris, was posted to Beauvais, he packed up and went, and forgot as completely the two musical couples as he forgot the Donci\u00e8res theatre and the little restaurant to which he used often to send out for his luncheon, and, to their great indignation, neither the lieutenant-colonel nor the senior medical officer, who had so often sat at his table, ever had so much as a single word from him for the rest of their lives. One morning, Saint-Loup confessed to me that he had written to my grandmother to give her news of me, with the suggestion that, since there was telephonic connexion between Paris and Donci\u00e8res, she might make use of it to speak to me. In short, that very day she was to give me a call, and he advised me to be at the post office at about a quarter to four. The telephone was not yet at that date as commonly in use as it is to-day. And yet habit requires so short a time to divest of their mystery the sacred forces with which we are in contact, that, not having had my call at once, the only thought in my mind was that it was very slow, and badly managed, and I almost decided to lodge a complaint. Like all of us nowadays I found not rapid enough for my liking in its abrupt changes the admirable sorcery for which a few moments are enough to bring before us, invisible but present, the person to whom we have been wishing to speak, and who, while still sitting at his table, in the town in which he lives (in my grandmother\u2019s case, Paris), under another sky than ours, in weather that is not necessarily the same, in the midst of circumstances and worries of which we know nothing, but of which he is going to inform us, finds himself suddenly transported hundreds of miles (he and all the surroundings in which he remains immured) within reach of our ear, at the precise moment which our fancy has ordained. And we are like the person in the fairy-tale to whom a sorceress, on his uttering the wish, makes appear with supernatural clearness his grandmother or his betrothed in the act of turning over a book, of shedding tears, of gathering flowers, quite close to the spectator and yet ever so remote, in the place in which she actually is at the moment. We need only, so that the miracle may be accomplished, apply our lips to the magic orifice and invoke \u2014 occasionally for rather longer than seems to us necessary, I admit \u2014 the Vigilant Virgins to whose voices we listen every day without ever coming to know their faces, and who are our Guardian Angels in the dizzy realm of darkness whose portals they so jealously keep; the All Powerful by whose intervention the absent rise up at our side, without our being permitted to set eyes on them; the Danaids of the Unseen who without ceasing empty, fill, transmit the urns of sound; the ironic Furies who, just as we were murmuring a confidence to a friend, in the hope that no one was listening, cry brutally: \u201cI hear you!\u201d; the ever infuriated servants of the Mystery, the umbrageous priestesses of the Invisible, the Young Ladies of the Telephone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, the moment our call has sounded, in the night filled with phantoms to which our ears alone are unsealed, a tiny sound, an abstract sound \u2014 the sound of distance overcome \u2014 and the voice of the dear one speaks to us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is she, it is her voice that is speaking, that is there. But how remote it is! How often have I been unable to listen without anguish, as though, confronted by the impossibility of seeing, except after long hours of journeying, her whose voice has been so close to my ear, I felt more clearly the sham and illusion of meetings apparently most pleasant, and at what a distance we may be from the people we love at the moment when it seems that we have only to stretch out our hand to seize and hold them. A real presence indeed that voice so near \u2014 in actual separation. But a premonition also of an eternal separation! Over and again, as I listened in this way, without seeing her who spoke to me from so far away, it has seemed to me that the voice was crying to me from depths out of which one does not rise again, and I have known the anxiety that was one day to wring my heart when a voice should thus return (alone, and attached no longer to a body which I was never more to see), to murmur, in my ear, words I would fain have kissed as they issued from lips for ever turned to dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This afternoon, alas, at Donci\u00e8res, the miracle did not occur. When I reached the post office, my grandmother\u2019s call had already been received; I stepped into the box; the line was engaged; some one was talking who probably did not realise that there was nobody to answer him, for when I raised the receiver to my ear, the lifeless block began squeaking like Punchinello; I silenced it, as one silences a puppet, by putting it back on its hook, but, like Punchinello, as soon as I took it again in my hand, it resumed its gabbling. At length, giving it up as hopeless, by hanging up the receiver once and for all, I stifled the convulsions of this vociferous stump which kept up its chatter until the last moment, and went in search of the operator, who told me to wait a little; then I spoke, and, after a few seconds of silence, suddenly I heard that voice which I supposed myself, mistakenly, to know so well; for always until then, every time that my grandmother had talked to me, I had been accustomed to follow what she was saying on the open score of her face, in which the eyes figured so largely; but her voice itself I was hearing this afternoon for the first time. And because that voice appeared to me to have altered in its proportions from the moment that it was a whole, and reached me in this way alone and without the accompaniment of her face and features, I discovered for the first time how sweet that voice was; perhaps, too, it had never oeen so sweet, for my grandmother, knowing me to be alone and unhappy, felt that she might let herself go in the outpouring of an affection which, on her principle of education, she usually restrained and kept hidden. It was sweet, but also how sad it was, first of all on account of its very sweetness, a sweetness drained almost \u2014 more than any but a few human voices can ever have been \u2014 of every element of resistance to others, of all selfishness; fragile by reason of its delicacy it seemed at every moment ready to break, to expire in a pure flow of tears; then, too, having it alone beside me, seen, without the mask of her face, I noticed for the first time the sorrows that had scarred it in the course of a lifetime\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Was it, however, solely the voice that, because it was alone, gave me this new impression which tore my heart? Not at all; it was rather that this isolation of the voice was like a symbol, a presentation, a direct consequence of another isolation, that of my grandmother, separated, for the first time in my life, from myself. The orders or prohibitions which she addressed to me at every moment in the ordinary course of my life, the tedium of obedience or the fire of rebellion which neutralised the affection that I felt for her were at this moment eliminated, and indeed might be eliminated for ever (since my grandmother no longer insisted on having me with her under her control, was in the act of expressing her hope that I would stay at Donci\u00e8res altogether, or would at any rate extend my visit for as long as possible, seeing that both my health and my work seemed likely to benefit by the change); also, what I held compressed in this little bell that was ringing in my ear was, freed from the conflicting pressures which had, every day hitherto, given it a counterpoise, and from this moment irresistible, carrying me altogether away, our mutual affection. My grandmother, by telling me to stay, filled me with an anxious, an insensate longing to return. This freedom of action which for the future she allowed me and to which I had never dreamed that she would consent, appeared to me suddenly as sad as might be my freedom of action after her death (when I should still love her and she would for ever have abandoned me). \u201cGranny!\u201d I cried to her, \u201cGranny!\u201d and would fain have kissed her, but I had beside me only that voice, a phantom, as impalpable as that which would come perhaps to revisit me when my grandmother was dead. \u201cSpeak to me!\u201d but then it happened that, left more solitary still, I ceased to catch the sound of her voice. My grandmother could no longer hear me; she was no longer in communication with me; we had ceased to stand face to face, to be audible to one another; I continued to call her, sounding the empty night, in which I felt that her appeals also must be straying. I was shaken by the same anguish which, in the distant past, I had felt once before, one day when, a little child, in a crowd, I had lost her, an anguish due less to my not finding her than to the thought that she must be searching for me, must be saying to herself that I was searching for her; an anguish comparable to that which I was to feel on the day when we speak to those who can no longer reply and whom we would so love to have hear all the things that we have not told them, and our assurance that we are not unhappy. It seemed as though it were already a beloved ghost that I had allowed to lose herself in the ghostly world, and, standing alone before the instrument, I went on vainly repeating: \u201cGranny, Granny!\u201d as Orpheus, left alone, repeats the name of his dead wife, is decided to leave the post office, to go and find Robert at his restaurant, in order to tell him that, as I was half expecting a telegram which would oblige me to return to Paris, I wished at all costs to find out at what times the trains left. And yet, before reaching this decision, I felt I must make one attempt more to invoke the Daughters of the Night, the Messengers of the Word, the Deities without form or feature; but the capricious Guardians had not deigned once again to unclose the miraculous portals, or more probably, had not been able; in vain might they untiringly appeal, as was their custom, to the venerable inventor of printing and the young prince, collector of impressionist paintings and driver of motor-cars (who was Captain de Borodino\u2019s nephew); Gutenberg and Wagram left their supplications unanswered, and I came away, feeling that the Invisible would continue to turn a deaf ear\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When I came among Robert and his friends, I withheld the confession that my heart was no longer with them, that my departure was now irrevocably fixed. Saint-Loup appeared to believe me, but I learned afterwards that he had from the first moment realised that my uncertainty was feigned and that he would not see me again next day. And while, letting their plates grow cold, his friends joined him in searching through the time-table for a train which would take me to Paris, and while we heard in the cold, starry night the whistling of the engines on the line, I certainly felt no longer the same peace of mind which on all these last evenings I had derived from the friendship of the former and the latter\u2019s distant passage. And yet they did not fail me this evening, performing the same office in a different way. My departure overpowered me less when I was no longer obliged to think of it by myself, when I felt that there was concentrated on what was to be done the more normal, more wholesome activity of my strenuous friends, Robert\u2019s brothers in arms, and of those other strong creatures, the trains, whose going and coming, night and morning, between Donci\u00e8res and Paris, broke up in retrospect what had been too compact and insupportable in my long isolation from my grandmother into daily possibilities of return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t doubt the truth of what you\u2019re saying, or that you aren\u2019t thinking of leaving us just yet,\u201d said Saint-Loup, smiling; \u201cbut pretend you are going, and come and say good-bye to me to-morrow morning; early, otherwise there\u2019s a risk of my not seeing you; I\u2019m going out to luncheon, I\u2019ve got leave from the Captain; I shall have to be back in barracks by two, as we are to be on the march all afternoon. I suppose the man to whose house I\u2019m going, a couple of miles out, will manage to get me back in time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Scarcely had he uttered these words when a messenger came for me from my hotel; the telephone operator had sent to find me. I ran to the post office, for it was nearly closing time. The word \u2018trunks\u2019 recurred incessantly in the answers given me by the officiais. I was in a fever of anxiety, for it was my grandmother who had asked for me. The office was closing for the night. Finally I got my connexion. \u201cIs that you, Granny?\u201d A woman\u2019s voice, with a strong English accent, answered: \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t know your voice.\u201d Neither did I recognise the voice that was speaking to me; besides, my grandmother called me tu, and not vous. And then all was explained. The young man for whom his grandmother had called on the telephone had a name almost identical with my own, and was staying in an annex of my hotel. This call coming on the very day on which I had been telephoning to my grandmother, I had never for a moment doubted that it was she who was asking for me. Whereas it was by pure coincidence that the post office and the hotel had combined to make a twofold error\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following morning I rose late, and failed to catch Saint-Loup, who had already started for the country house where he was invited to luncheon. About half past one, I had decided to go in any case to the barracks, so as to be there before he arrived, when, as I was crossing one of the avenues on the way there, I noticed, coming behind me in the same direction as myself, a tilbury which, as it overtook me, obliged me to jump out of its way; an N.C.O. was driving it, wearing an eyeglass; it was Saint-Loup. By his side was the friend whose guest he had been at luncheon, and whom I had met once before at the hotel where we dined. I did not dare shout to Robert since he was not alone, but, in the hope that he would stop and pick me up, I attracted his attention by a sweeping wave of my hat, which might be regarded as due to the presence of a stranger. I knew that Robert was short-sighted; still, I should have supposed that, provided he saw me at all, he could not fail to recognise me; he did indeed see my salute, and returned it, but without stopping; driving on at full speed, without a smile, without moving a muscle of his face, he confined himself to keeping his hand raised for a minute to the peak of his cap, as though he were acknowledging the salute of a trooper whom he did not know personally. I ran to the barracks, but it was a long way; when I arrived, the regiment was parading on the square, on which I was not allowed to stand, and I was heart-broken at not having been able to say good-bye to Saint-Loup; I went up to his room, but he had gone; I was reduced to questioning a group of sick details, recruits who had been excused route-marches, the young graduate, one of the \u2018old soldiers,\u2019 who were watching the regiment parade\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen Serjeant Saint-Loup, have you, by any chance?\u201d I asked\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s gone on parade, sir,\u201d said the old soldier\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never saw him,\u201d said the graduate\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou never saw him,\u201d exclaimed the old soldier, losing all interest in me, \u201cyou never saw our famous Saint-Loup, the figure he\u2019s cutting with his new breeches! When the Capstan sees that, officer\u2019s cloth, my word!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, you\u2019re a wonder, you are; officer\u2019s cloth,\u201d replied the young graduate, who, reported \u2018sick in quarters,\u2019 was excused marching and tried, not without some misgivings, to be on easy terms with the veterans. \u201cThis officer\u2019s cloth you speak of is cloth like that, is it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir?\u201d asked the old soldier angrily\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was indignant that the young graduate should throw doubt on the breeches\u2019 being made of officer\u2019s cloth, but, being a Breton, coming from a village that went by the name of Penguern-Stereden, having learned French with as much difficulty as if it had been English or German, whenever he felt himself overcome by emotion he would go on saying \u2018Sir?\u2019 to give himself time to find words, then, after this preparation, let loose his eloquence, confining himself to the repetition of certain words which he knew better than others, but without haste, taking every precaution to gloss over his unfamiliarity with the pronunciation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! It is cloth like that,\u201d he broke out, with a fury the intensity of which increased as the speed of his utterance diminished. \u201cAh! It is cloth like that; when I tell you that it is, officer\u2019s cloth, when-I-tell-you-a-thing, if-I-tell-you-a-thing, it\u2019s because I know, I should think.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cVery well, then;\u201d replied the young graduate, overcome by the force of this argument. \u201cKeep your hair on, old boy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere, look, there\u2019s the Capstan coming along. No, but just look at Saint-Loup; the way he throws his leg out; and his head. Would you call that a non-com? And his eyeglass; oh, he\u2019s hot stuff, he is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I asked these troopers, who did not seem at all embarrassed by my presence, whether I too might look out of the window. They neither objected to my doing so nor moved to make room for me. I saw Captain de Borodino go majestically by, putting his horse into a trot, and apparently under the illusion that he was taking part in the Battle of Austerlitz. A few loiterers had stopped by the gate to see the regiment file out. Erect on his charger, his face inclined to plumpness, his cheeks of an Imperial fulness, his eye lucid, the Prince must have been the victim of some hallucination, as I was myself whenever, after the tramway-car had passed, the silence that followed its rumble seemed to me to throb and echo with a vaguely musical palpitation. I was wretched at not having said good-bye to Saint-Loup, but I went nevertheless, for my one anxiety was to return to my grandmother; always until then, in this little country town, when I thought of what my grandmother must be doing by herself, I had pictured her as she was when with me, suppressing my own personality but without taking into account the effects of such a suppression; now, I had to free myself, at the first possible moment, in her arms, from the phantom, hitherto unsuspected and suddenly called into being by her voice, of a grandmother really separated from me, resigned, having, what I had never yet thought of her as having, a definite age, who had just received a letter from me in an empty house, as I had once before imagined Mamma in a house by herself, when I had left her to go to Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, this phantom was just what I did see when, entering the drawing-room before my grandmother had been told of my return, I found her there, reading. I was in the room, or rather I was not yet in the room since she was not aware of my presence, and, like a woman whom one surprises at a piece of work which she will lay aside if anyone comes in, she had abandoned herself to a train of thoughts which she had never allowed to be visible by me. Of myself \u2014 thanks to that privilege which does not last but which one enjoys during the brief moment of return, the faculty of being a spectator, so to speak, of one\u2019s own absence \u2014 there was present only the witness, the observer, with a hat and travelling coat, the stranger who does not belong to the house, the photographer who has called to take a photograph of places which one will never see again. The process that mechanically occurred in my eyes when I caught sight of my grandmother was indeed a photograph. We never see the people who are dear to us save in the animated system, the perpetual motion of our incessant love for them, which before allowing the images that their faces present to reach us catches them in its vortex, flings them back upon the idea that we have always had of them, makes them adhere to it, coincide with it. How, since into the forehead, the cheeks of my grandmother I had been accustomed to read all the most delicate, the most permanent qualities of her mind; how, since every casual glance is an act of necromancy, each face that we love a mirror of the past, how could I have failed to overlook what in her had become dulled and changed, seeing that in the most trivial spectacles of our daily life, our eye, charged with thought, neglects, as would a classical tragedy, every image that does not assist the action of the play and retains only those that may help to make its purpose intelligible. But if, in place of our eye, it should be a purely material object, a photographic plate, that has watched the action, then what we shall see, in the courtyard of the Institute, for example, will be, instead of the dignified emergence of an Academician who is going to hail a cab, his staggering gait, his precautions to avoid tumbling upon his back, the parabola of his fall, as though he were drunk, or the ground frozen over. So is it when some casual sport of chance prevents our intelligent and pious affection from coming forward in time to hide from our eyes what they ought never to behold, when it is forestalled by our eyes, and they, arising first in the field and having it to themselves, set to work mechanically, like films, and shew us, in place of the loved friend who has long ago ceased to exist but whose death our affection has always hitherto kept concealed from us, the new person whom a hundred times daily that affection has clothed with a dear and cheating likeness. And, as a sick man who for long has not looked at his own reflexion, and has kept his memory of the face that he never sees refreshed from the ideal image of himself that he carries in his mind, recoils on catching sight in the glass, in the midst of an arid waste of cheek, of the sloping red structure of a nose as huge as one of the pyramids of Egypt, I, for whom my grandmother was still myself, I who had never seen her save in my own soul, always at the same place in the past, through the transparent sheets of contiguous, overlapping memories, suddenly in our drawing-room which formed part of a new world, that of time, that in which dwell the strangers of whom we say \u201cHe\u2019s begun to age a good deal,\u201d for the first time and for a moment only, since she vanished at once, I saw, sitting on the sofa, beneath the lamp, red-faced, heavy and common, sick, lost in thought, following the lines of a book with eyes that seemed hardly sane, a dejected old woman whom I did not know\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My request to be allowed to inspect the Elstirs in Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s collection had been met by Saint-Loup with: \u201cI will answer for her.\u201d And indeed, as ill luck would have it, it was he and he alone who did answer. We answer readily enough for other people when, setting our mental stage with the little puppets that represent them, we manipulate these to suit our fancy. No doubt even then we take into account the difficulties due to another person\u2019s nature being different from our own, and we do not fail to have recourse to some plan of action likely to influence that nature, an appeal to his material interest, persuasion, the rousing of emotion, which will neutralise contrary tendencies on his part. But these differences from our own nature, it is still our own nature that is imagining them, these difficulties, it is we that are raising them; these compelling motives, it is we that are applying them. And so with the actions which before our mind\u2019s eye we have made the other person rehearse, and which make him act as we choose; when we wish to see him perform them in real life, the case is altered, we come up against unseen resistances which may prove insuperable. One of the strongest is doubtless that which may be developed in a woman who is not in love with him by the disgust inspired in her, a fetid, insurmountable loathing, by the man who is in love with her; during the long weeks in which Saint-Loup still did not come to Paris, his aunt, to whom I had no doubt of his having written begging her to do so, never once asked me to call at her house to see the Elstirs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I perceived signs of coldness on the part of another occupant of the building. This was Jupien. Did he consider that I ought to have gone in and said how d\u2019ye do to him, on my return from Donci\u00e8res, before even going upstairs to our own flat? My mother said no, that there was nothing unusual about it. Fran\u00e7oise had told her that he was like that, subject to sudden fits of ill humour, without any cause. These invariably passed off after a little time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the winter was drawing to an end. One morning, after several weeks of showers and storms, I heard in my chimney \u2014 instead of the wind, formless, elastic, sombre, which convulsed me with a longing to go to the sea \u2014 the cooing of the pigeons that were nesting in the wall outside; shimmering, unexpected, like a first hyacinth, gently tearing open its fostering heart that there might shoot forth, purple and satin-soft, its flower of sound, letting in like an opened window into my bedroom still shuttered and dark the heat, the dazzling brightness, the fatigue of a first fine day. That morning, I was surprised to find myself humming a music-hall tune which had never entered my head since the year in which I had been going to Florence and Venice. So profoundly does the atmosphere, as good days and bad recur, act on our organism and draw from dim shelves where we had forgotten them, the melodies written there which our memory rould not decipher. Presently a more conscious dreamer accompanied this musician to whom I was listening inside myself, without having recognised at first what he was playing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I quite realised that it was not for any reason peculiar to Balbec that on my arrival there I had failed to find in its church the charm which it had had for me before I knew it; that at Florence or Parma or Venice my imagination could no more take the place of my eyes when I looked at the sights there. I realised this. Similarly, one New Year\u2019s afternoon, as night fell, standing before a column of playbills, I had discovered the illusion that lies in our thinking that certain solemn holidays differ essentially from the other days in the calendar. And yet I could not prevent my memory of the time during which I had looked forward to spending Easter in Florence from continuing to make that festival the atmosphere, so to speak, of the City of Flowers, to give at once to Easter Day something Florentine and to Florence something Paschal. Easter was still a long way off; but in the range of days that stretched out before me the days of Holy Week stood out more clearly at the end of those that merely came between. Touched by a far-flung ray, like certain houses in a village which one sees from a distance when the rest are in shadow, they had caught and kept all the sun\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weather had now become milder. And my parents themselves, by urging me to take more exercise, gave me an excuse for resuming my morning walks. I had meant to give them up, since they meant my meeting Mme. de Guermantes. But it was for this very reason that I kept thinking all the time of those walks, which led to my finding, every moment, a fresh reason for taking them, a reason that had no connexion with Mme. de Guermantes and no difficulty in convincing me that, had she never existed, I should still have taken a walk, without fail, at that hour every morning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas, if to me meeting any person other than herself would not have mattered, I felt that to her meeting anyone in the world except myself would have been endurable. It happened that, in the course of her morning walks, she received the salutations of plenty of fools whom she regarded as such. But the appearance of these in her path seemed to her, if not to hold out any promise of pleasure, to be at any rate the result of mere accident. And she stopped them at times, for there are moments in which one wants to escape from oneself, to accept the hospitality offered by the soul of another person, provided always that the other, however modest and plain it may be, is a different soul, whereas in my heart she was exasperated to feel that what she would have found was herself. And so, even when I had, for taking the same way as she, another reason than my desire to see her, I trembled like a guilty man as she came past; and sometimes, so as to neutralise anything extravagant that there might seem to have been in my overtures, I would barely acknowledge her bow, or would fasten my eyes on her face without raising my hat, and succeed only in making her angrier than ever, and begin to regard me as insolent and ill-bred besides\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was now wearing lighter, or at any rate brighter, clothes, and would come strolling down the street in which already, as though it were spring, in front of the narrow shops that were squeezed in between the huge fronts of the old aristocratic mansions, over the booths of the butter-woman and the fruit-woman and the vegetable-woman, awnings were spread to protect them from the sun. I said to myself that the woman whom I could see far off, walking, opening her sunshade, crossing the street, was, in the opinion of those best qualified to judge, the greatest living exponent of the art of performing those movements and of making out of them something exquisitely lovely. Meanwhile she was advancing towards me, unconscious of this widespread reputation, her narrow, stubborn body, which had absorbed none of it, was bent stiffly forward under a scarf of violet silk; her clear, sullen eyes looked absently in front of her, and had perhaps caught sight of me; she was biting her lip; I saw her straighten her muff, give alms to a beggar, buy a bunch of violets from a flower-seller, with the same curiosity that I should have felt in watching the strokes of a great painter\u2019s brush. And when, as she reached me, she gave me a bow that was accompanied sometimes by a faint smile, it was as though she had sketched in colour for me, adding a personal inscription to myself, a drawing that was a masterpiece of art. Each of her gowns seemed to me her natural, necessary surroundings, like the projection around her of a particular aspect of her soul. On one of these Lenten mornings, when she was on her way out to luncheon, I met her wearing a gown of bright red velvet, cut slightly open at the throat. The face of Mme. de Guermantes appeared to be dreaming, beneath its pile of fair hair. I was less sad than usual because the melancholy of her expression, the sort of claustration which the startling hue of her gown set between her and the rest of the world, made her seem somehow lonely and unhappy, and this comforted me. The gown struck me as being the materialisation round about her of the scarlet rays of a heart which I did not recognise as hers and might have been able, perhaps, to console; sheltered in the mystical light of the garment with its gently flowing folds, she made me think of some Saint of the early ages of Christianity. After which I felt ashamed of afflicting with the sight of myself this holy martyr. \u201cBut, after all, the streets are public.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The streets are public, I reminded myself, giving a different meaning to the words, and marvelling that indeed in the crowded thoroughfare often soaked with rain, which made it beautiful and precious as a street sometimes is in the old towns of Italy, the Duchesse de Guermantes mingled with the public life of the world moments of her own secret life, shewing herself thus to all and sundry, jostled by every passer-by, with the splendid gratuitousness of the greatest works of art. As I had been out in the morning, after staying awake all night, in the afternoon my parents would tell me to lie down for a little and try to sleep. There is no need, when one is trying to find sleep, to give much thought to the quest, but habit is very useful, and even freedom from thought. But in these afternoon hours both were lacking. Before going to sleep, I devoted so much time to thinking that I should not be able to sleep, that even after I was asleep a little of my thought remained. It was no more than a glimmer in the almost total darkness, but it was bright enough to cast a reflexion in my sleep, first of the idea that I could not sleep, and then, a reflexion of this reflexion, that it was in my sleep that I had had the idea that I was not asleep, then, by a further refraction, my awakening . . . to a fresh doze in which I was trying to tell some friends who had come into my room that, a moment earlier, when I was asleep, I had imagined that I was not asleep. These shades were barely distinguishable; it would have required a keen \u2014 and quite useless \u2014 delicacy of perception to seize them all. Similarly, in later years, at Venice, long after the sun had set, when it seemed to be quite dark, I have seen, thanks to the echo, itself imperceptible, of a last note of light, held indefinitely on the surface of the canals, as though some optical pedal were being pressed, the reflexion of the palaces unfurled, as though for all time, in a darker velvet, on the crepuscular greyness of the water. One of my dreams was the synthesis of what my imagination had often sought to depict, in my waking hours, of a certain seagirt place and its mediaeval past. In my sleep I saw a gothic fortress rising from a sea whose waves were stilled as in a painted window. An arm of the sea cut the town in two; the green water stretched to my feet; it bathed on the opposite shore the foundations of an oriental church, and beyond it houses which existed already in the fourteenth century, so that to go across to them would have been to ascend the stream of time. This dream in which nature had learned from art, in which the sea had turned gothic, this dream in which I longed to attain, in which I believed that I was attaining to the impossible, it seemed to me that I had often dreamed it before. But as it is the property of what we imagine in our sleep to multiply itself in the past, and to appear, even when novel, familiar, I supposed that I was mistaken. I noticed, however, that I did frequently have this dream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The limitations, too, that are common to all sleep were reflected in mine, but in a symbolical manner; I could not in the darkness make out the faces of the friends who were in the room, for we sleep with our eyes shut. I, who could carry on endless arguments with myself while I dreamed, as soon as I tried to speak to these friends felt the words stick in my throat, for we do not speak distinctly in our sleep; I wanted to go to them, and I could not move my limbs, for we do not walk when we are asleep either; and suddenly I was ashamed to be seen by them, for we sleep without our clothes. So, my eyes blinded, my lips sealed, my limbs fettered, my body naked, the figure of sleep which my sleep itself projected had the appearance of those great allegorical figures (in one of which Giotto has portrayed Envy with a serpent in her mouth) of which Swann had given me photographs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup came to Paris for a few hours only. He came with assurances that he had had no opportunity of mentioning me to his aunt. \u201cShe\u2019s not being at all nice just now, Oriane isn\u2019t,\u201d he explained, with innocent self-betrayal. \u201cShe\u2019s not my old Oriane any longer, they\u2019ve gone and changed her. I assure you, it\u2019s not worth while bothering your head about her. You pay her far too great a compliment. You wouldn\u2019t care to meet my cousin Poictiers?\u201d he went on, without stopping to reflect that this could not possibly give me any pleasure. \u201cQuite an intelligent young woman, she is; you\u2019d like her. She\u2019s married to my cousin, the Duc de Poictiers, who is a good fellow, but a bit slow for her. I\u2019ve told her about you. She said I was to bring you to see her. She\u2019s much better looking than Oriane, and younger, too. Really a nice person, don\u2019t you know, really a good sort.\u201d These were expressions recently \u2014 and all the more ardently \u2014 taken up by Robert, which meant that the person in question had a delicate nature. \u201cI don\u2019t go so far as to say she\u2019s a Dreyfusard, you must remember the sort of people she lives among; still, she did say to me: \u2018If he is innocent, how ghastly for him to be shut up on the Devil\u2019s Isle.\u2019 You see what I mean, don\u2019t you? And then she\u2019s the sort of woman who does a tremendous lot for her old governesses; she\u2019s given orders that they\u2019re never to be sent in by the servants\u2019 stair, when they come to the house. She\u2019s a very good sort, I assure you. The real reason why Oriane doesn\u2019t like her is that she feels she\u2019s the cleverer of the two.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although completely absorbed in the pity which she felt for one of the Guermantes footmen \u2014 who had no chance of going to see his girl, even when the Duchess was out, for it would immediately have been reported to her from the lodge \u2014 Fran\u00e7oise was heartbroken at not having been in the house at the moment of Saint-Loup\u2019s visit, but this was because now she herself paid visits also. She never failed to go out on the days when I most wanted her. It was always to see her brother, her niece and, more particularly, her own daughter, who had recently come to live in Paris. The intimate nature of these visits itself increased the irritation that I felt at being deprived of her services, for I had a foreboding that she would speak of them as being among those duties from which there was no dispensation, according to the laws laid down at Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Champs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so I never listened to her excuses without an ill humour which was highly unjust to her, and was brought to a climax by the way Fran\u00e7oise had of saying not: \u201cI have been to see my brother,\u201d or \u201cI have been to see my niece,\u201d but \u201cI have been to see the brother,\u201d \u201cI just looked in as I passed to bid good day to the niece\u201d (or \u201cto my niece the butcheress\u201d). As for her daughter, Fran\u00e7oise would have been glad to see her return to Combray. But this recent Parisian, making use, like a woman of fashion, of abbreviations, though hers were of a vulgar kind, protested that the week she was going shortly to spend at Combray would seem quite long enough without so much as a sight of \u201cthe Intran.\u201d She was still less willing to go to Franchise\u2019s sister, who lived in a mountainous country, for \u201cmountains,\u201d said the daughter, giving to the adjective a new and terrible meaning, \u201caren\u2019t really interesting.\u201d She could not make Up her mind to go back to M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, where \u201cthe people are so stupid,\u201d where in the market the gossips at their stalls would call cousins with her, and say \u201cWhy, it\u2019s never poor Bazireau\u2019s daughter?\u201d She would sooner die than go back and bury herself down there, now that she had \u201ctasted the life of Paris,\u201d and Fran\u00e7oise, traditionalist as she was, smiled complacently nevertheless at the spirit of innovation that was incarnate in this new Parisian when she said: \u201cVery well, mother, if you don\u2019t get your day out, you have only to send me a pneu.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The weather had turned chilly again. \u201cGo out? What for? To catch your death?\u201d said Fran\u00e7oise, who preferred to remain in the house during the week which her daughter and brother and the butcher-niece had gone to spend at Combray. Being, moreover, the last surviving adherent of the sect in whom persisted obscurely the doctrine of my aunt L\u00e9onie \u2014 a natural philosopher \u2014 Fran\u00e7oise would add, speaking of this unseasonable weather: \u201cIt is the remnant of the wrath of God!\u201d But I responded to her complaints only in a languid smile; all the more indifferent to these predictions, in that whatever befell it would be fine for me; already I could see the morning sun shine on the slope of Fiesole, I warmed myself in its rays; their strength obliged me to half open, half shut my eyelids, smiling the while, and my eyelids, like alabaster lamps, were filled with a rosy glow. It was not only the bells that came from Italy, Italy had come with them. My faithful hands would not lack flowers to honour the anniversary of the pilgrimage which I ought to have made long ago, for since, here in Paris, the weather had turned cold again as in another year at the time of our preparations for departure at the end of Lent, in the liquid, freezing air which bathed the chestnuts and planes on the boulevards, the tree in the courtyard of our house, there were already opening their petals, as in a bowl of pure water, the narcissi, the jonquils, the anemones of the Ponte Vecchio\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had informed us that he now knew, from his friend A. J., where M. de Norpois was going when he met him about the place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s to see Mme. de Villeparisis, they are great friends; I never knew anything about it. It seems she\u2019s a delightful person, a most superior woman. You ought to go and call on her,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnother thing that surprised me very much. He spoke to me of M. de Guermantes as quite a distinguished man; I had always taken him for a boor. It seems, he knows an enormous amount, and has perfect taste, only he\u2019s very proud of his name and his connexions. But for that matter, according to Norpois, he has a tremendous position, not only here but all over Europe. It appears, the Austrian Emperor and the Tsar treat him just like one of themselves. Old Norpois told me that Mme. de Villeparisis had taken quite a fancy to you, and that you would meet all sorts of interesting people in her house. He paid a great tribute to you; you will see him if you go there, and he may have some good advice for you even if you are going to be a writer. For you\u2019re not likely to do anything else; I can see that. It might turn out quite a good career; it\u2019s not what I should have chosen for you, myself; but you\u2019ll be a man in no time now, we shan\u2019t always be here to look after you, and we mustn\u2019t prevent you from following your vocation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If only I had been able to start writing! But whatever the conditions in which I approached the task (as, too, alas, the undertakings not to touch alcohol, to go to bed early, to sleep, to keep fit), whether it were with enthusiasm, with method, with pleasure, in depriving myself of a walk, or postponing my walk and keeping it in reserve as a reward of industry, taking advantage of an hour of good health, utilising the inactivity forced on me by a day of illness, what always emerged in the end from all my effort was a virgin page, undefiled by any writing, ineluctable as that forced card which in certain tricks one invariably is made to draw, however carefully one may first have shuffled the pack. I was merely the instrument of habits of not working, of not going to bed, of not sleeping, which must find expression somehow, cost what it might; if I offered them no resistance, if I contented myself with the pretext they seized from the first opportunity that the day afforded them of acting as they chose, I escaped without serious injury, I slept for a few hours after all, towards morning, I read a little, I did not over-exert myself; but if I attempted to thwart them, if I pretended to go to bed early, to drink only water, to work, they grew restive, they adopted strong measures, they made me really ill, I was obliged to double my dose of alcohol, did not lie down in bed for two days and nights on end, could not even read, and I vowed that another time I would be more reasonable, that is to say less wise, like the victim of an assault who allows himself to be robbed for fear, should he offer resistance, of being murdered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father, in the meantime, had met M. de Guermantes once or twice, and, now that M. de Norpois had told him that the Duke was a remarkable man, had begun to pay more attention to what he said. As it happened, they met in the courtyard and discussed Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cHe tells me, she\u2019s his aunt; \u2018Viparisi,\u2019 he pronounces it. He tells me, too, she\u2019s an extraordinarily able woman. In fact he said she kept a School of Wit,\u201d my father announced to us, impressed by the vagueness of this expression, which he had indeed come across now and then in volumes of memoirs, but without attaching to it any definite meaning. My mother, so great was her respect for him, when she saw that he did not dismiss as of no importance the fact that Mme. de Villeparisis kept a School of Wit, decided that this must be of some consequence. Albeit from my grandmother she had known all the time the exact amount of the Marquise\u2019s intellectual worth, it was immediately enhanced in her eyes. My grandmother, who was not very well just then, was not in favour at first of the suggested visit, and afterwards lost interest in the matter. Since we had moved into our new flat, Mme. de Villeparisis had several times asked my grandmother to call upon her. And invariably my grandmother had replied that she was not going out just at present, in one of those letters which, by a new habit of hers which we did not understand, she no longer sealed herself, but employed Fran\u00e7oise to lick the envelopes for her. As for myself, without any very clear picture in my mind of this School of Wit, I should not have been greatly surprised to find the old lady from Balbec installed behind a desk, as, for that matter, I eventually did\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father would have been glad to know, into the bargain, whether the Ambassador\u2019s support would be worth many votes to him at the Institute, for which he had thoughts of standing as an independent candidate. To tell the truth, while he did not venture to doubt that he would have M. de Norpois\u2019s support, he was by no means certain of it. He had thought it merely malicious gossip when they assured him at the Ministry that M. de Norpois, wishing to be himself the only representative there of the Institute, would put every possible obstacle in the way of my father\u2019s candidature, which besides would be particularly awkward for him at that moment, since he was supporting another candidate already. And yet, when M. Leroy-Beaulieu had first advised him to stand, and had reckoned up his chances, my father had been struck by the fact that, among the colleagues upon whom he could count for support, the eminent economist had not mentioned M. de Norpois. He dared not ask the Ambassador point-blank, but hoped that I should return from my call on Mme. de Villeparisis with his election as good as secured. This call was now imminent. That M. de Norpois would carry on propaganda calculated to assure my father the votes of at least two thirds of the Academy seemed to him all the more probable since the Ambassador\u2019s willingness to oblige was proverbial, those who liked him least admitting that no one else took such pleasure in being of service. And besides, at the Ministry, his protective influence was extended over my father far more markedly than over any other official\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My father had also another encounter about this time, but one at which his extreme surprise ended in equal indignation. In the street one day he ran into Mme. Sazerat, whose life in Paris her comparative poverty restricted to occasional visits to a friend. There was no one who bored my father quite so intensely as did Mme. Sazerat, so much so that Mamma was obliged, once a year, to intercede with him in sweet and suppliant tones: \u201cMy dear, I really must invite Mme. Sazerat to the house, just once; she won\u2019t stay long;\u201d and even: \u201cListen, dear, I am going to ask you to make a great sacrifice; do go and call upon Mme. Sazerat. You know I hate bothering you, but it would be so nice of you.\u201d He would laugh, raise various objections, and go to pay the call. And so, for all that Mme. Sazerat did not appeal to him, on catching sight of her in the street my father went towards her, hat in hand; but to his profound astonishment Mme. Sazerat confined her greeting to the frigid bow enforced by politeness towards a person who is guilty of some disgraceful action or has been condemned to live, for the future, in another hemisphere. My father had come home speechless with rage. Next day my mother met Mme. Sazerat in some one\u2019s house. She did not offer my mother her hand, but only smiled at her with a vague and melancholy air as one smiles at a person with whom one used to play as a child, but with whom one has since severed all one\u2019s relations because she has led an abandoned life, has married a convict or (what is worse still) a co-respondent. Now, from all time my parents had accorded to Mme. Sazerat, and inspired in her, the most profound respect. But (and of this my mother was ignorant) Mme. Sazerat, alone of her kind at Combray, was a Dreyfusard. My father, a friend of M. M\u00e9line, was convinced that Dreyfus was guilty. He had flatly refused to listen to some of his colleagues who had asked him to sign a petition demanding a fresh trial. He never spoke to me for a week, after learning that I had chosen to take a different line. His opinions were well known. He came near to being looked upon as a Nationalist. As for my grandmother, in whom alone of the family a generous doubt was likely to be kindled, whenever anyone spoke to her of the possible innocence of Dreyfus, she gave a shake of her head, the meaning of which we did not at the time understand, but which was like the gesture of a person who has been interrupted while thinking of more serious things. My mother, torn between her love for my father and her hope that I might turn out to have brains, preserved an impartiality which she expressed by silence. Finally my grandfather, who adored the Army (albeit his duties with the National Guard had been the bugbear of his riper years), could never, at Combray, see a regiment go by the garden railings without baring his head as the colonel and the colours passed. All this was quite enough to make Mme. Sazerat, who knew every incident of the disinterested and honourable careers of my father and grandfather, regard them as pillars of Injustice. We pardon the crimes of individuals, but not their participation in a collective crime. As soon as she knew my father to be an anti-Dreyfusard she set between him and herself continents and centuries. Which explains why, across such an interval of time and space, her bow had been imperceptible to my father, and why it had not occurred to her to hold out her hand, or to say a few words which would never have carried across the worlds that lay between\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup, who was coming anyhow to Paris, had promised to take me to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, where I hoped, though I had not said so to him, that we might meet Mme. de Guermantes. He invited me to luncheon in a restaurant with his mistress, whom we were afterwards to accompany to a rehearsal. We were to go out in the morning and call for her at her home on the outskirts of Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had asked Saint-Loup that the restaurant to which we went for luncheon (in the lives of young noblemen with money to spend the restaurant plays as important a part as do bales of merchandise in Arabian stories), might, if possible, be that to which Aim\u00e9 had told me that he would be going as head waiter until the Balbec season started. It was a great attraction to me who dreamed of so many expeditions and made so few to see again some one who formed part not merely of my memories of Balbec but of Balbec itself, who went there year after year, who when ill health or my studies compelled me to stay in Paris would be watching, just the same, through the long July afternoons while he waited for the guests to come in to dinner, the sun creep down the sky and set in the sea, through the glass panels of the great dining-room, behind which, at the hour when the light died, the motionless wings of vessels, smoky blue in the distance, looked like exotic and nocturnal moths in a show-case. Himself magnetised by his contact with the strong lodestone of Balbec, this head waiter became in turn a magnet attracting me. I hoped by talking to him to get at once into communication with Balbec, to have realised here in Paris something of the delights of travel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I left the house early, with Fran\u00e7oise complaining bitterly because the footman who was engaged to be married had once again been prevented, the evening before, from going to see his girl. Fran\u00e7oise had found him in tears; he had been itching to go and strike the porter, but had restrained himself, for he valued his place\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before reaching Saint-Loup\u2019s, where he was to be waiting for me at the door, I ran into Legrandin, of whom we had lost sight since our Combray days, and who, though now grown quite grey, had preserved his air of youthful candour. Seeing me, he stopped:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! So it\u2019s you,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201ca man of fashion, and in a frock coat too! That is a livery in which my independent spirit would be ill at ease. It is true that you are a man of the world, I suppose, and go out paying calls! To go and dream, as I do, before some half ruined tomb, my flowing tie and jacket are not out of place. You know how I admire the charming quality of your soul; that is why I tell you how deeply I regret that you should go forth and deny it among the Gentiles. By being capable of remaining for a moment in the nauseating atmosphere \u2014 which I am unable to breathe \u2014 of a drawing-room, you pronounce on your own future the condemnation, the damnation of the Prophet. I can see it all, you frequent the \u2018light hearts,\u2019 the houses of the great, that is the vice of our middle class to-day. Ah! Those aristocrats! The Terror was greatly to blame for not cutting the heads off every one of them. They are all sinister debauchees, when they are not simply dreary idiots. Still, my poor boy, if that sort of thing amuses you! While you are on your way to your tea-party your old friend will be more fortunate than you, for alone in an outlying suburb he will be watching the pink moon rise in a violet sky. The truth is that I scarcely belong to this Earth upon which I feel myself such an exile; it takes all the force of the law of gravity to hold me here, to keep nie from escaping into another sphere. I belong to a different planet. Goodbye; do not take amiss the old-time frankness of the peasant of the Vivonne, who has also remained a peasant of the Danube. To prove to you that I am your sincere well-wisher, I am going to send you my last novel. But you will not care for it; it is not deliquescent enough, not fin de si\u00e8cle enough for you; it is too frank, too honest; what you want is Bergotte, you have confessed it, high game for the jaded palates of pleasure-seeking epicures. I suppose I am looked upon, in your set, as an old campaigner; I do wrong to put my heart into what I write, that is no longer done; besides, the life of the people is not distinguished enough to interest your little snobbicules. Go, get you gone, try to recall at times the words of Christ: \u2018Do this and ye shall live.\u2019 Farewell, Friend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not with any particular resentment against Legrandin that I parted from him. Certain memories are like friends in common, they can bring about reconciliations; set down amid fields starred with buttercups, upon which were piled the ruins of feudal greatness, the little wooden bridge still joined us, Legrandin and me, as it joined the two banks of the Vivonne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After coming out of a Paris in which, although spring had begun, the trees on the boulevards had hardly put on their first leaves, it was a marvel to Saint-Loup and myself, when the circle train had set us down at the suburban village in which his mistress was living, to see every cottage garden gay with huge festal altars of fruit trees in blossom. It was like one of those peculiar, poetical, ephemeral, local festivals which people travel long distances to attend on certain fixed occasions, only this one was held by Nature. The bloom of the cherry tree is stuck so close to its branches, like a white sheath, that from a distance, among the other trees that shewed as yet scarcely a flower or leaf, one might have taken it, on this day of sunshine that was still so cold, for snow, melted everywhere else, which still clung to the bushes. But the tall pear trees enveloped each house, each modest courtyard in a whiteness more vast, more uniform, more dazzling, as if all the dwellings, all the enclosed spaces in the village were on their way to make, on one solemn date, their first communion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It had been a country village, and had kept its old mayor\u2019s office sunburned and brown, in front of which, in the place of maypoles and streamers, three tall pear trees were, as though for some civic and local festival, gallantly beflagged with white satin. These villages in the environs of Paris still have at their gates parks of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which were the \u2018follies\u2019 of the stewards and favourites of the great. A fruit-grower had utilised one of these which was sunk below the road for his trees, or had simply, perhaps, preserved the plan of an immense orchard of former days. Laid out in quincunxes, these pear trees, less crowded and not so far on as those that I had seen, formed great quadrilaterals \u2014 separated by low walls \u2014 of snowy blossom, on each side of which the light fell differently, so that all these airy roofless chambers seemed to belong to a Palace of the Sun, such as one might unearth in Crete or somewhere; and made one think also of the different ponds of a reservoir, or of those parts of the sea which man, for some fishery, or to plant oyster-beds, has subdivided, when one saw, varying with the orientation of the boughs, the light fall and play upon their trained arms as upon water warm with spring, and coax into unfolding here and there, gleaming amid the open, azure-panelled trellis of the branches, the foaming whiteness of a creamy, sunlit flower\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Never had Robert spoken to me so tenderly of his friend as he did during this walk. She alone had taken root in his heart; his future career in the Army, his position in society, his family, he was not, of course, indifferent altogether to these, but they were of no account compared with the veriest trifle that concerned his mistress. That alone had any importance in his eyes, infinitely more importance than the Guermantes and all the kings of the earth put together. I do not know whether he had formulated the doctrine that she was of a superior quality to anyone else, but I do know that he considered, took trouble only about what affected her. Through her and for her he was capable of suffering, of being happy, perhaps of doing murder. There was really nothing that interested, that could excite him except what his mistress wished, was going to do, what was going on, discernible at most in fleeting changes of expression, in the narrow expanse of her face and behind her privileged brow. So nice-minded in all else, he looked forward to the prospect of a brilliant marriage, solely in order to be able to continue to maintain her, to keep her always. If one had asked oneself what was the value that he set on her, I doubt whether one could ever have imagined a figure high enough. If he did not marry her, it was because a practical instinct warned him that as soon as she had nothing more to expect from him she would leave him, or would at least live as she chose, and that he must retain his hold on her by keeping her in suspense from day to day. For he admitted the possibility that she did not love him. No doubt the general affection called love must have forced him \u2014 as it forces all men \u2014 to believe at times that she did. But in his heart of hearts he felt that this love which she felt for him did not exhaust the possibility of her remaining with him only on account of his money, and that on the day when she had nothing more to expect from him she would make haste (the dupe of her friends and their literary theories, and loving him all the time, really \u2014 he thought) to leave him. \u201cIf she is nice to me to-day,\u201d he confided to me, \u201cI am going to give her something that she\u2019ll like. It\u2019s a necklace she saw at Boucheron\u2019s. It\u2019s rather too much for me just at present \u2014 thirty thousand francs. But, poor puss, she gets so little pleasure out of life. She will be jolly pleased with it, I know. She mentioned it to me and told me she knew somebody who would perhaps give it to her. I don t believe that is true, really, but I wasn\u2019t taking any risks, so I\u2019ve arranged with Boucheron, who is our family jeweller, to keep it for me. I am glad to think that you\u2019re going to meet her; she\u2019s nothing so very wonderful to look at, you know,\u201d (I could see that he thought just the opposite and had said this only so as to make me, when I did see her, admire her all the more) \u201cwhat she has got is a marvellous judgment; she\u2019ll perhaps be afraid to talk much before you, but, by Jove! the things she\u2019ll say to me about you afterwards, you know she says things one can go on thinking about for hours; there\u2019s really something about her that\u2019s quite Pythian.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On our way to her house we passed by a row of little gardens, and I was obliged to stop, for they were all aflower with pear and cherry blossoms; as empty, no doubt, and lifeless only yesterday as a house that no tenant has taken, they were suddenly peopled and adorned by these newcomers, arrived during the night, whose lovely white garments we could see through the railings along the garden paths\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen; I can see you\u2019d rather stop and look at that stuff, and grow poetical about it,\u201d said Robert, \u201cso just wait for me here, will you; my friend\u2019s house is quite close, I will go and fetch her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I waited I strolled up and down the road, past these modest gardens. If I raised my head I could see, now and then, girls sitting in the windows, but outside, in the open air, and at the height of a half-landing, here and there, light and pliant, in their fresh pink gowns, hanging among the leaves, young lilac-clusters were letting themselves be swung by the breeze without heeding the passer-by who was turning his eyes towards their green mansions. I recognised in them the platoons in violet uniform posted at the entrance to M. Swann\u2019s park, past the little white fence, in the warm afternoons of spring, like an enchanting rustic tapestry. I took a path which led me into a meadow. A cold wind blew keenly along it, as at Combray, but from the midst of the rich, moist, country soil, which might have been on the bank of the Vivonne, there had nevertheless arisen, punctual at the trysting place like all its band of brothers, a great white pear tree which waved smilingly in the sun\u2019s face, like a curtain of light materialised and made palpable, its flowers shaken by the breeze but polished and frosted with silver by the sun\u2019s rays\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly Saint-Loup appeared, accompanied by his mistress, and then, in this woman who was for him all the love, every possible delight in life, whose personality, mysteriously enshrined in a body as in a Tabernacle, was the object that still occupied incessantly the toiling imagination of my friend, whom he felt that he would never really know, as to whom he was perpetually asking himself what could be her secret self, behind the veil of eyes and flesh, in this woman I recognised at once \u2018Rachel when from the Lord,\u2019 her who, but a few years since \u2014 women change their position so rapidly in that world, when they do change \u2014 used to say to the procuress: \u201cTo-morrow evening, then, if you want me for anyone, you will send round, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And when they had \u2018come round\u2019 for her, and she found herself alone in the room with the \u2018anyone,\u2019 she had known so well what was required of her that after locking the door, as a prudent woman\u2019s precaution or a ritual gesture, she would begin to take off all her things, as one does before the doctor who is going to sound one\u2019s chest, never stopping in the process unless the \u2018some one,\u2019 not caring for nudity, told her that she might keep on her shift, as specialists do sometimes who, having an extremely fine ear and being afraid of their patient\u2019s catching a chill, are satisfied with listening to his breathing and the beating of his heart through his shirt. On this woman whose whole life, all her thoughts, all her past, all the men who at one time or another had had her were to me so utterly unimportant that if she had begun to tell me about them I should have listened to her only out of politeness, and should barely have heard what she said, I felt that the anxiety, the torment, the love of Saint-Loup had been concentrated in such a way as to make \u2014 out of what was for me a mechanical toy, nothing more \u2014 the cause of endless suffering, the very object and reward of existence. Seeing these two elements separately (because I had known \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019 in a house of ill fame), I realised that many women for the sake of whom men live, suffer, take their lives, may be in themselves or for other people what Rachel was for me. The idea that any one could be tormented by curiosity with regard to her life stupefied me. I could have told Robert of any number of her unchastities, which seemed to me the most uninteresting things in the world. And how they would have pained him! And what had he not given to learn them, without avail!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I realised also then all that the human imagination can put behind a little scrap of face, such as this girl\u2019s face was, if it is the imagination that was the first to know it; and conversely into what wretched elements, crudely material and utterly without value, might be decomposed what had been the inspiration of countless dreams if, on the contrary, it should be so to speak controverted by the slightest actual acquaintance. I saw that what had appeared to me to be not worth twenty francs when it had been offered to me for twenty francs in the house of ill fame, where it was then for me simply a woman desirous of earning twenty francs, might be worth more than a million, more than one\u2019s family, more than all the most coveted positions in life if one had begun by imagining her to embody a strange creature, interesting to know, difficult to seize and to hold. No doubt it was the same thin and narrow face that we saw, Robert and I. But we had arrived at it by two opposite ways, between which there was no communication, and we should never both see it from the same side. That face, with its stares, its smiles, the movements of its lips, I had known from outside as being simply that of a woman of the sort who for twenty francs would do anything that I asked. And so her stares, her smiles, the movements of her lips had seemed to me significant merely of the general actions of a class without any distinctive quality. And beneath them I should not have had the curiosity to look for a person. But what to me had in a sense been offered at the start, that consenting face, had been for Robert an ultimate goal towards which he had made his way through endless hopes and doubts, suspicions, dreams. He gave more than a million francs in order to have for himself, in order that there might not be offered to others what had been offered to me, as to all and sundry, for a score. That he too should not have enjoyed it at the lower price may have been due to the chance of a moment, the instant in which she who seemed ready to yield herself makes off, having perhaps an assignation elsewhere, some reason which makes her more difficult of access that day. Should the man be a sentimentalist, then, even if she has not observed it, but infinitely more if she has, the direst game begins. Unable to swallow his disappointment, to make himself forget about the woman, he starts afresh in pursuit, she flies him, until a mere smile for which he no longer ventured to hope is bought at a thousand times what should have been the price of the last, the most intimate favours. It happens even at times in such a case, when one has been led by a mixture of simplicity in one\u2019s judgment and cowardice in the face of suffering to commit the crowning folly of making an inaccessible idol of a girl, that these last favours, or even the first kiss one is fated never to obtain, one no longer even ventures to ask for them for fear of destroying one\u2019s chances of Platonic love. And it is then a bitter anguish to leave the world without having ever known what were the embraces of the woman one has most passionately loved. As for Rachel\u2019s favours, however, Saint-Loup had by mere accident succeeded in winning them all. Certainly if he had now learned that they had been offered to all the world for a louis, he would have suffered, of course, acutely, but would still have given a million francs for the right to keep them, for nothing that he might have learned could have made him emerge \u2014 since that is beyond human control and can be brought to pass only in spite of it by the action of some great natural law \u2014 from the path he was treading, from which that face could appear to him only through the web of the dreams that he had already spun. The immobility of that thin face, like that of a sheet of paper subjected to the colossal pressure of two atmospheres, seemed to me to be being maintained by two infinities which abutted on her without meeting, for she held them apart. And indeed, when Robert and I were both looking at her we did not both see her from the same side of the mystery\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019\u2014 who seemed to me a small matter \u2014 it was the power of the human imagination, the illusion on which were based the pains of love; these I felt to be vast. Robert noticed that I appeared moved. I turned my eyes to the pear and cherry trees of the garden opposite, so that he might think that it was their beauty that had touched me. And it did touch me in somewhat the same way; it also brought close to me things of the kind which we not only see with our eyes but feel also in our hearts. These trees that I had seen in the garden, likening them in my mind to strange deities, had not my mistake been like the Magdalene\u2019s when, in another garden, she saw a human form and \u2018thought it was the gardener.\u2019 Treasurers of our memories of the age of gold, keepers of the promise that reality is not what we suppose, that the splendour of Poetry, the wonderful radiance of innocence may shine in it and may be the recompense which we strive to earn, these great white creatures, bowed in a marvellous fashion above the shade propitious for rest, for angling or for reading, were they not rather angels? I exchanged a few words with Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress. We cut across the village. Its houses were sordid. But by each of the most wretched, of those that looked as though they had been scorched and branded by a rain of brimstone, a mysterious traveller, halting for a day in the accursed city, a resplendent angel stood erect, extending broadly over it the dazzling protection of the wings of flowering innocence: it was a pear tree. Saint-Loup drew me a little way in front to explain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should have liked it if you and I could have been alone together, in fact I would much rather have had luncheon just with you, and stayed with you until it was time to go to my aunt\u2019s. But this poor girl of mine here, it is such a pleasure to her, and she is so decent to me, don\u2019t you know, I hadn\u2019t the heart to refuse her. You\u2019ll like her, however, she\u2019s literary, you know, a most sensitive nature, and besides it\u2019s such a pleasure to be with her in a restaurant, she is so charming, so simple, always delighted with every, thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I fancy nevertheless that, on this same morning, and then probably for the first and last time, Robert did detach himself for a moment from the woman whom out of successive layers of affection he had gradually created, and beheld suddenly at some distance from himself another Rachel, outwardly the double of his but entirely different, who was nothing more or less than a little light of love. We had left the blossoming orchard and were making for the train which was to take us to Paris when, at the station, Rachel, who was walking by herself, was recognised and accosted by a pair of common little \u2018tarts\u2019 like herself, who first of all, thinking that she was alone, called out: \u201cHello, Rachel, you come with us; Lucienne and Germaine are in the train, and there\u2019s room for one more. Come on. We\u2019re all going to the rink,\u201d and were just going to introduce to her two counter-jumpers, their lovers, who were escorting them, when, noticing that she seemed a little uneasy, they looked up and beyond her, caught sight of us, and with apologies bade her a good-bye to which she responded in a somewhat embarrassed, but still friendly tone. They were two poor little \u2018tarts\u2019 with collars of sham otter skin, looking more or less as Rachel must have looked when Saint-Loup first met her. He did not know them, or their names even, and seeing that they appeared to be extremely intimate with his mistress he could not help wondering whether she too might not once have had, had not still perhaps her place in a life of which he had never dreamed, utterly different from the life she led with him, a life in which one had women for a louis apiece, whereas he was giving more than a hundred thousand francs a year to Rachel, He caught only a fleeting glimpse of that life, but saw also in the thick of it a Rachel other than her whom he knew, a Rachel like the two little \u2018tarts\u2019 in the train, a twenty-franc Rachel. In short, Rachel had for the moment duplicated herself in his eyes, he had seen, at some distance from his own Rachel, the little \u2018tart\u2019 Rachel, the real Rachel, assuming that Rachel the \u2018tart\u2019 was more real than the other. It may then have occurred to Robert that from the hell in which he was living, with the prospect of a rich marriage, of the sale of his name, to enable him to go on giving Rachel a hundred thousand francs every year, he might easily perhaps have escaped, and have enjoyed the favours of his mistress, as the two counter-jumpers enjoyed those of their girls, for next to nothing. But how was it to be done? She had done nothing to forfeit his regard. Less generously rewarded she would be less kind to him, would stop saying and writing the things that so deeply moved him> things which he would quote, with a touch of ostentation, to his friends, taking care to point out how nice it was of her to say them, but omitting to mention that he was maintaining her in the most lavish fashion, or even that he ever gave her anything at all, that these inscriptions on photographs, or greetings at the end of telegrams were but the conversion into the most exiguous, the most precious of currencies of a hundred thousand francs. If he took care not to admit that these rare kindnesses on Rachel\u2019s part were handsomely paid for by himself, it would be wrong to say \u2014 and yet, by a crude piece of reasoning, we do say it, absurdly, of every lover who pays in cash for his pleasure, and of a great many husbands \u2014 that this was from self-esteem or vanity. Saint-Loup had enough sense to perceive that all the pleasures which appeal to vanity he could have found easily and without cost to himself in society, on the strength of his historic name and handsome face, and that his connexion with Rachel had rather, if anything, tended to ostracise him, led to his being less sought after. No; this self-esteem which seeks to appear to be receiving gratuitously the outward signs of the affection of her whom one loves is simply a consequence of love, the need to figure in one\u2019s own eyes and in other people\u2019s as loved in return by the person whom one loves so well. Rachel rejoined us, leaving the two \u2018tarts\u2019 to get into their compartment; but, no less than their sham otter skins and the self-conscious appearance of their young men, the names Lucienne and Germaine kept the new Rachel alive for a moment longer. For a moment Robert imagined a Place Pigalle existence with unknown associates, sordid love affairs, afternoons spent in simple amusements, excursions or pleasure-parties, in that Paris in which the sunny brightness of the streets from the Boulevard de Clichy onwards did not seem the same as the solar radiance in which he himself strolled with his mistress, but must be something different, for love, and suffering which is one with love, have, like intoxication, the power to alter for us inanimate things. It was almost an unknown Paris in the heart of Paris itself that he suspected, his connexion appeared to him like the exploration of a strange form of life, for if when with him Rachel was somewhat similar to himself, it was nevertheless a part of her real life that she lived with him, indeed the most precious part, in view of his reckless expenditure on her, the part that made her so greatly envied by her friends and would enable her one day to retire to the country or to establish herself in the leading theatres, when she had made her pile. Robert longed to ask her who Lucienne and Germaine were, what they would have said to her if she had joined them in their compartment, how they would all have spent a day which would have perhaps ended, as a supreme diversion, after the pleasures of the rink, at the Olympia Tavern, if Robert and I had not been there. For a moment the purlieus of the Olympia, which until then had seemed to him merely deadly dull, aroused curiosity in him and pain, and the sunshine of this spring day beating upon the Rue Caumartin where, possibly, if she had not known Robert, Rachel might have gone in the course of the evening and nave earned a louis, filled him with a vague longing. But what use was it to ply Rachel with questions when he already knew that her answer would be merely silence, or a lie, or something extremely painful for him to hear, which would yet explain nothing. The porters were shutting the doors; we jumped into a first-class carriage; Rachel\u2019s magnificent pearls reminded Robert that she was a woman of great price, he caressed her, restored her to her place in his heart where he could contemplate her, internalised, as he had always done hitherto \u2014 save during this brief instant in which he had seen her in the Place Pigalle of an impressionist painter \u2014 and the train began to move\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was, by the way, quite true that she was \u2018literary.\u2019 She never stopped talking to me about books, new art and Tolstoyism except to rebuke Saint-Loup for drinking so much wine:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! If you could live with me for a year, we\u2019d see a fine change. I should keep you on water and you\u2019d be ever so much better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRight you are. Let\u2019s begin now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut you know quite well I have to work all day!\u201d For she took her art very seriously. \u201cBesides, what would your people say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she began to abuse his family to me in terms which for that matter seemed to me highly reasonable, and with which Saint-Loup, while disobeying her orders in the matter of champagne, entirely concurred. I, who was so much afraid of the effect of wine on him, and felt the good influence of his mistress, was quite prepared to advise him to let his family go hang. Tears sprang to the young woman\u2019s eyes; I had been rash enough to refer to Dreyfus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe poor martyr!\u201d she almost sobbed; \u201cit will be the death of him in that dreadful place.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t upset yourself, Z\u00e9zette, he will come back, he will be acquitted all right, they will admit they\u2019ve made a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut long before then he\u2019ll be dead! Oh, well at any rate his children will bear a stainless name. But just think of the agony he must be going through; that\u2019s what makes my heart bleed. And would you believe that Robert\u2019s mother, a pious woman, says that he ought to be left on the Devil\u2019s Isle, even if he is innocent; isn\u2019t it appalling?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, it\u2019s absolutely true, she does say that,\u201d Robert assured me. \u201cShe\u2019s my mother, I\u2019ve no fault to find with her, but it\u2019s quite clear she hasn\u2019t got a sensitive nature, like Z\u00e9zette.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact these luncheons which were said to be \u2018such a pleasure\u2019 always ended in trouble. For as soon as Saint-Loup found himself in a public place with his mistress, he would imagine that she was looking at every other man in the room, and his brow would darken; she would remark his ill-humour, which she may have thought it amusing to encourage, or, as was more probable, by a foolish piece of conceit preferred, feeling wounded by his tone, not to appear to be seeking to disarm; and would make a show of being unable to take her eyes off some man or other, not that this was always a mere pretence. In fact, the gentleman who, in theatre or caf\u00e9, happened to sit next to them, or, to go no farther, the driver of the cab they had engaged need only have something attractive about him, no matter what, and Robert, his perception quickened by jealousy, would have noticed it before his mistress; he would see in him immediately one of those foul creatures whom he had denounced to me at Balbec, who corrupted and dishonoured women for their own amusement, would beg his mistress to take her eyes off the man, thereby drawing her attention to him. And sometimes she found that Robert had shewn such good judgment in his suspicion that after a little she even left off teasing him in order that he might calm down and consent to go off by himself on some errand which would give her time to begin conversation with the stranger, often to make an assignation, sometimes even to bring matters quickly to a head. I could see as soon as we entered the restaurant that Robert was looking troubled. The fact of the matter was that he had at once remarked, what had escaped our notice at Balbec, namely that, standing among his coarser colleagues, Aim\u00e9, with a modest brilliance, emitted, quite unconsciously of course, that air of romance which emanates until a certain period in life from fine hair and a Grecian nose, features thanks to which he was distinguishable among the crowd of waiters. The others, almost all of them well on in years, presented a series of types, extraordinarily ugly and criminal, of hypocritical priests, sanctimonious confessors, more numerously of comic actors of the old school, whose sugar-loaf foreheads are scarcely to be seen nowadays outside the collections of portraits that hang in the humbly historic green-rooms of little, out of date theatres, where they are represented in the parts of servants or high priests, though this restaurant seemed, thanks to a selective method of recruiting and perhaps to some system of hereditary nomination, to have preserved their solemn type in a sort of College of Augurs. As ill luck would have it, Aim\u00e9 having recognised us, it was he who came to take our order, while the procession of operatic high priests swept past us to other tables. Aim\u00e9 inquired after my grandmother\u2019s health; I asked for news of his wife and children. He gave it with emotion, being a family man. He had an intelligent, vigorous, but respectful air. Robert\u2019s mistress began to gaze at him with a strange attentiveness. But Aim\u00e9\u2018s sunken eyes, in which a slight short-sightedness gave one the impression of veiled depths, shewed no sign of consciousness in his still face. In the provincial hotel in which he had served for many years before coming to Balbec, the charming sketch, now a trifle discoloured and faded, which was his face, and which, for all those years, like some engraved portrait of Prince Eug\u00e8ne, had been visible always at the same place, at the far end of a dining-room that was almost always empty, could not have attracted any very curious gaze. He had thus for long remained, doubtless for want of sympathetic admirers, in ignorance of the artistic value of his face, and but little inclined for that matter to draw attention to it, for he was temperamentally cold. At the most, some passing Parisian, stopping for some reason in the town, had raised her eyes to his, had asked him perhaps to bring something to her in her room before she left for the station, and in the pellucid, Monotonous, deep void of this existence of a faithful husband and servant in a country town had hidden the secret of a caprice without sequel which no one would ever bring to light. And yet Aim\u00e9 must have been conscious of the insistent emphasis with which the eyes of the young actress were fastened upon him now. Anyhow, it did not escape Robert beneath whose skin I saw gathering a flush, not vivid like that which burned his cheeks when he felt any sudden emotion, but faint, diffused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnything specially interesting about that waiter, Z\u00e9zette?\u201d he inquired, after sharply dismissing Aim\u00e9. \u201cOne would think you were studying the part.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere you are, beginning again; I knew it was coming.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBeginning what again, my dear girl? I may have been mistaken; I haven\u2019t said anything, I\u2019m sure. But I have at least the right to warn you against the fellow, seeing that I knew him at Balbec (otherwise I shouldn\u2019t give a damn), and a bigger scoundrel doesn\u2019t walk the face of the earth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed anxious to pacify Robert and began to engage me in a literary conversation in which he joined. I found that it did not bore me to talk to her, for she had a thorough knowledge of the books that I most admired, and her opinion of them agreed more or less with my own; but as I had heard Mme. de Villeparisis declare that she had no talent, I attached but little importance to this evidence of culture. She discoursed wittily on all manner of topics, and would have been genuinely entertaining had she not affected to an irritating extent the jargon of the sets and studios. She applied this, moreover, to everything under the sun; for instance, having acquired the habit of saying of a picture, if it were impressionist, or an opera, if Wagnerian, \u201cAh! That is good!\u201d one day when a young man had kissed her on the ear, and, touched by her pretence of being thrilled, had affected modesty, she said: \u201cYes, as a sensation I call it distinctly good.\u201d But what more surprised me was that the expressions peculiar to Robert (which, moreover, had come to him, perhaps, from literary men whom she knew) were used by her to him and by him to her as though they had been a necessary form of speech, and without any conception of the pointlessness of an originality that is universal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In eating, she managed her hands so clumsily that one assumed that she must appear extremely awkward upon the stage. She recovered her dexterity only when making love, with that touching prescience latent in women who love the male body so intensely that they immediately guess what will give most pleasure to that body, which is yet so different from their own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I ceased to take part in the conversation when it turned upon the theatre, for on that topic Rachel was too malicious for my liking. She did, it was true, take up in a tone of commiseration \u2014 against Saint-Loup, which proved that he was accustomed to hearing Rachel attack her \u2014 the defence of Berma, saying: \u201cOh, no, she\u2019s a wonderful person, really. Of course, the things she does no longer appeal to us, they don\u2019t correspond quite to what we are looking for, but one must think of her at the period to which she belongs; we owe her a great deal. She has done good work, you know. And besides she\u2019s such a fine woman, she has such a good heart; naturally she doesn\u2019t care about the things that interest us, but she has had in her time, with a rather impressive face, a charming quality of mind.\u201d (Our ringers, by the way, do not play the same accompaniment to all our aesthetic judgments. If it is a picture that is under discussion, to shew that it is a fine work with plenty of paint, it is enough to stick out one\u2019s thumb. But the \u2018charming quality of mind\u2019 is more exacting. It requires two fingers, or rather two fingernails, as though one were trying to flick off a particle of dust.) But, with this single exception, Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress referred to the best-known actresses in a tone of ironical superiority which annoyed me because I believed \u2014 quite mistakenly, as it happened \u2014 that it was she who was inferior to them. She was clearly aware that I must regard her as an indifferent actress, and on the other hand have a great regard for those she despised. But she shewed no resentment, because there is in all great talent while it is still, as hers was then, unrecognised, however sure it may be of itself, a vein of humility, and because we make the consideration that we expect from others proportionate not to our latent powers but to the position to which we have attained. (I was, an hour or so later, at the theatre, to see Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress shew great deference towards those very artists against whom she was now bringing so harsh a judgment to bear.) And so, in however little doubt my silence may have left her, she insisted nevertheless on our dining together that evening, assuring me that never had anyone\u2019s conversation delighted her so much as mine. If we were not yet in the theatre, to which we were to go after luncheon, we had the sense of being in a green-room hung with portraits of old members of the company, so markedly were the waiters\u2019 faces those which, one thought, had perished with a whole generation of obscure actors of the Palais-Royal; they had a look, also, of Academicians; stopping before a side table one of them was examining a dish of pears with the expression of detached curiosity that M. de Jussieu might have worn. Others, on either side of him, were casting about the room that gaze instinct with curiosity and coldness which Members of the Institute, who have arrived early, throw at the public, while they exchange a few murmured words which one fails to catch. They were faces well known to all the regular guests. One of them, however, was being pointed out, a newcomer with distended nostrils and a smug upper lip, who looked like a cleric; he was entering upon his duties there for the first time, and everyone gazed with interest at this newly elected candidate. But presently, perhaps to drive Robert away so that she might be alone with Aim\u00e9, Rachel began to make eyes at a young student, who was feeding with another man at a neighbouring table\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cZ\u00e9zette, let me beg you not to look at that young man like that,\u201d said Saint-Loup, on whose face the hesitating flush of a moment ago had been gathered now into a scarlet tide which dilated and darkened his swollen features, \u201cif you must make a scene here, I shall simply finish eating by myself and join you at the theatre afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point a messenger came up to tell Aim\u00e9 that he was wanted to speak to a gentleman in a carriage outside. Saint-Loup, ever uneasy, and afraid now that it might be some message of an amorous nature that was to be conveyed to his mistress, looked out of the window and saw there, sitting up in his brougham, his hands tightly buttoned in white gloves with black seams, a flower in his buttonhole, M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere; you see!\u201d he said to me in a low voice, \u201cmy family hunt me down even here. Will you, please \u2014 I can\u2019t very well do it myself, but you can, as you know the head waiter so well and he\u2019s certain to give us away \u2014 ask him not to go to the carriage. He can ahvays send some other waiter who doesn\u2019t know me. I know my uncle; if they tell him that I\u2019m not known here, he\u2019ll never come inside to look for me, he loathes this sort of place. Really, it\u2019s pretty disgusting that an old petticoat-chaser like him, who is still at it, too, should be perpetually lecturing me and coming to spy on me!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aim\u00e9 on receiving my instructions sent one of his underlings to explain that he was busy and could not come out at the moment, and (should the gentleman ask for the Marquis de Saint-Loup) that they did not know any such person. But Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress, who had failed to catch our whispered conversation and thought that it was still about the young man at whom Robert had been finding fault with her for making eyes, broke out in a torrent of rage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, indeed! So it\u2019s the young man over there, now, is it? Thank you for telling me; it\u2019s a real pleasure to have this sort of thing with one\u2019s meals! Don\u2019t listen to him, please; he\u2019s rather cross to-day, and, you know,\u201d she went on, turning to me, \u201che just says it because he thinks it smart, that it\u2019s the gentlemanly thing to appear jealous always.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she began with feet and fingers to shew signs of nervous irritation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Z\u00e9zette, it is I who find it unpleasant. You are making us all ridiculous before that gentleman, who will begin to imagine you\u2019re making overtures to him, and an impossible bounder he looks, too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, no, I think he\u2019s charming; for one thing, he\u2019s got the most adorable eyes, and a way of looking at women \u2014 you can feel he must love them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can at least keep quiet until I\u2019ve left the room, if you have lost your senses,\u201d cried Robert. \u201cWaiter, my things.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not know whether I was expected to follow him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, I want to be alone,\u201d he told me in the same tone in which he had just been addressing his mistress, and as if he were quite furious with me. His anger was like a single musical phrase to which in an opera several lines are sung which are entirely different from one another, if one studies the words, in meaning and character, but which the music assimilates by a common sentiment. When Robert had gone, his mistress called Aim\u00e9 and asked him various questions. She then wanted to know what I thought of him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAn amusing expression, hasn\u2019t he? Do you know what I should like; it would be to know what he really thinks about things, to have him wait on me often, to take him travelling. But that would be all. If we were expected to love all the people who attract us, life would be pretty ghastly, wouldn\u2019t it? It\u2019s silly of Robert to get ideas like that. All that sort of thing, it\u2019s only just what comes into my head, that\u2019s all; Robert has nothing to worry about.\u201d She was still gazing at Aim\u00e9. \u201cDo look, what dark eyes he has. I should love to know what there is behind them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently came a message that Robert was waiting for her in a private room, to which he had gone to finish his luncheon, by another door, without having to pass through the restaurant again. I thus found myself alone, until I too was summoned by Robert. I found his mistress stretched out on a sofa laughing under the kisses and caresses that he was showering on her. They were drinking champagne. \u201cHallo, you!\u201d she cried to him, having recently picked up this formula which seemed to her the last word in playfulness and wit. I had fed badly, I was extremely uncomfortable, and albeit Legrandin\u2019s words had had no effect on me I was sorry to think that I was beginning in a back room of a restaurant and should be finishing in the wings of a theatre this first afternoon of spring. Looking first at the time to see that she was not making herself late, she offered me a glass of champagne, handed me one of her Turkish cigarettes and unpinned a rose for me from her bodice. Whereupon I said to myself: \u201cI have nothing much to regret, after all; these hours spent in this young woman\u2019s company are not wasted, since I have had from her, charming gifts which could not be bought too dear, a rose, a scented cigarette and a glass of champagne.\u201d I told myself this because I felt that it endowed with an aesthetic character and thereby justified, saved these hours of boredom. I ought perhaps to have reflected that the very need which I felt of a reason that would console me for my boredom was sufficient to prove that I was experiencing no aesthetic sensation. As for Robert and his mistress, they appeared to have no recollection of the quarrel which had been raging between them a few minutes earlier, or of my having been a witness to it. They made no allusion to it, sought no excuse for it any more than for the contrast with it which their present conduct formed. By dint of drinking champagne with them, I began to feel a little of the intoxication that used to come over me at Rivebelle, though probably not quite the same. Not only every kind of intoxication, from that which the sun or travelling gives us to that which we get from exhaustion or wine, but every degree of intoxication \u2014 and each must have a different figure, like the numbers of fathoms on a chart \u2014 lays bare in us exactly at the depth to which it reaches a different kind of man. The room which Saint-Loup had taken was small, but the mirror which was its sole ornament was of such a kind that it seemed to reflect thirty others in an endless vista; and the electric bulb placed at the top of the frame must at night, when the light was on, followed by the procession of thirty flashes similar to its own, give to the drinker, even when alone, the idea that the surrounding space was multiplying itself simultaneously with his sensations heightened by intoxication, and that, shut up by himself in this little cell, he was reigning nevertheless over something far more extensive in its indefinite luminous curve than a passage in the Jardin de Paris. Being then myself at this moment the said drinker, suddenly, looking for him in the glass, I caught sight of him, hideous, a stranger, who was staring at me. The joy of intoxication was stronger than my disgust; from gaiety or bravado I smiled at him, and simultaneously ne smiled back at me. And I felt myself so much under the ephemeral and Potent sway of the minute in which our sensations are so strong, that I am not sure whether my sole regret was not at the thought that this hideous self of whom I had just caught sight in the glass was perhaps there for the last time on earth, and that I should never meet the stranger again in the whole course of my life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert was annoyed only because I was not being more brilliant before his mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat about that fellow you met this morning, who combines snobbery with astronomy; tell her about him, I\u2019ve forgotten the story,\u201d and he watched her furtively\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy, there\u2019s nothing more than what you\u2019ve just said.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a bore you are. Then tell her about Fran\u00e7oise in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. She\u2019ll enjoy that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, do! Bobby is always talking about Fran\u00e7oise.\u201d And taking Saint-Loup by the chin, she repeated, for want of anything more original, drawing the said chin nearer to the light: \u201cHallo, you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since actors had ceased to be for me exclusively the depositaries, in their diction and playing, of an artistic truth, they had begun to interest me in themselves; I amused myself, pretending that what I saw before me were the characters in some old humorous novel, by watching, struck by the fresh face of the young man who had just come into the stalls, the heroine listen distractedly to the declaration of love which the juvenile lead in the piece was addressing to her, while he, through the fiery torrent of his impassioned speech, still kept a burning gaze fixed on an old lady seated in a stage box, whose magnificent pearls had caught his eye; and thus, thanks especially to the information that Saint-Loup gave me as to the private lives of the players, I saw another drama, mute but expressive, enacted beneath the words of the spoken drama which in itself, although of no merit, interested me also; for I could feel in it that there were budding and opening for an hour in the glare of the footlights, created out of the agglutination on the face of an actor of another face of grease paint and pasteboard, on his own human soul the words of a part\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These ephemeral vivid personalities which the characters are in a play that is entertaining also, whom one loves, admires, pities, whom one would like to see again after one has left the theatre, but who by that time are already disintegrated into a comedian who is no longer in the position which he occupied in the play, a text which no longer shews one the comedian\u2019s face, a coloured powder which a handkerchief wipes off, who have returned in short to elements that contain nothing of them, since their dissolution, effected so soon after the end of the show, make us \u2014 like the dissolution of a dear friend \u2014 begin to doubt the reality of our ego and meditate on the mystery of death\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One number in the programme I found extremely trying. A young woman whom Rachel and some of her friends disliked was, with a set of old songs, to make a first appearance on which she had based all her hopes for the future of herself and her family. This young woman was blessed with unduly, almost grotesquely prominent hips and a pretty but too slight voice, weakened still farther by her excitement and in marked contrast to her muscular development. Rachel had posted among the audience a certain number of friends, male and female, whose business it was by their sarcastic comments to put the novice, who was known to be timid, out of countenance, to make her lose her head so that her turn should prove a complete failure, after which the manager would refuse to give her a contract. At the first notes uttered by the wretched woman, several of the male audience, recruited for that purpose, began pointing to her backward profile with jocular comments, several of the women, also in the plot, laughed out loud, each flute-like note from the stage increased the deliberate hilarity, which grew to a public scandal. The unhappy woman, sweating with anguish through her grease-paint, tried for a little longer to hold out then stopped and looked round the audience with an appealing gaze of misery and anger which succeeded only in increasing the uproar. The instinct to imitate others, the desire to shew their own wit and daring added to the party several pretty actresses who had not been forewarned but now threw at the others glances charged with malicious connivance, and sat convulsed with laughter which rang out in such violent peals that at the end of the second song, although there were still five more on the programme, the stage manager rang down the curtain. I tried to make myself pay no more heed to the incident than I had paid to my grandmother\u2019s sufferings when my great-aunt, to tease her, used to give my grandfather brandy, the idea of deliberate wickedness being too painful for me to bear. And yet, just as our pity for misfortune is perhaps not very exact since in our imagination we recreate a whole world of grief by which the unfortunate who has to struggle against it has no time to think of being moved to self-pity, so wickedness has probably not in the mind of the wicked man that pure and voluptuous cruelty which it so pains us to imagine. Hatred inspires him, anger gives him an ardour, an activity in which there is no great joy; he must be a sadist to extract any pleasure from it; ordinarily, the wicked man supposes himself to be punishing the wickedness of his victim; Rachel imagined certainly that the actress whom she was making suffer was far from being of interest to any one, and that anyhow, in having her hissed off the stage, she was herself avenging an outrage on good taste and teaching an unworthy comrade a lesson. Nevertheless, I preferred not to speak of this incident since I had had neither the courage nor the power to prevent it, and it would have been too painful for me, by saying any good of their victim, to approximate to a gratification of the lust for cruelty the sentiments which animated the tormentors who had strangled this career in its infancy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the opening scene of this afternoon\u2019s performance interested me in quite another way. It made me realise in part the nature of the illusion of which Saint-Loup was a victim with regard to Rachel, and which had set a gulf between the images that he and I respectively had in mind of his mistress, when we beheld her that morning among the blossoming pear trees. Rachel was playing a part which involved barely more than her walking on in the little play. But seen thus, she was another woman. She had one of those faces to which distance \u2014 and not necessarily that between stalls and stage, the world being in this respect only a larger theatre \u2014 gives form and outline and which, seen close at hand, dissolve back into dust. Standing beside her one saw only a nebula, a milky way of freckles, of tiny spots, nothing more. At a proper distance, all this ceased to be visible and, from cheeks that withdrew, were reabsorbed into her face, rose like a crescent moon a nose so fine, so pure that one would have liked to be object of Rachel\u2019s attention, to see her again as often as one chose, to her close to one, provided that one had not already seen her differently and at close range. This was not my case but it had been Saint-Loup\u2019s when he first saw her on the stage. Then he had asked himself how he might approach her, how come to know her, there had opened in him a whole fairy realm \u2014 that in which she lived \u2014 from which emanated an exquisite radiance but into which he might not penetrate. He had left the theatre telling himself that it would be madness to write to her, that she would not answer his letter, quite prepared to give his fortune and his name for the creature who was living in him in a world so vastly superior to those too familiar realities, a world made beautiful by desire and dreams of happiness, when at the back of the theatre, a little old building which had itself the air of being a piece of scenery, from the stage door he saw debouch the gay and daintily hatted band of actresses who had just been playing. Young men who knew them were waiting for them outside. The number of pawns on the human chessboard being less than the number of combinations that they are capable of forming, in a theatre from which are absent all the people we know and might have expected to find, there turns up one whom we never imagined that we should see again and who appears so opportunely that the coincidence seems to us providential, although no doubt some other coincidence would have occurred in its stead had we been not in that place but in some other, where other desires would have been aroused and we should have met some other old acquaintance to help us to satisfy them. The golden portals of the world of dreams had closed again upon Rachel before Saint-Loup saw her emerge from the theatre, so that the freckles and spots were of little importance. They vexed him nevertheless, especially as, being no longer alone, he had not now the same opportunity to dream as in the theatre. But she, for all that he could no longer see her, continued to dictate his actions, like those stars which govern us by their attraction even during the hours in which they are not visible to our eyes. And so his desire for the actress with the fine features which had no place now even in Robert\u2019s memory had the result that, dashing towards the old friend whom chance had brought to the spot, he insisted upon an introduction to the person with no features and with freckles, since she was the same person, telling himself that later on he would take care to find out which of the two this same person really was. She was in a hurry, she did not on this occasion say a single word to Saint-Loup, and it was only some days later that he finally contrived, by inducing her to leave her companions, to escort her home. He loved her already. The need for dreams, the desire to be made happy by her of whom one has dreamed, bring it about that not much time is required before one entrusts all one\u2019s chances of happiness to her who a few days since was but a fortuitous apparition, unknown, unmeaning, upon the boards of the theatre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, the curtain having fallen, we moved on to the stage, alarmed at finding myself there for the first time, I felt the need to begin a spirited conversation with Saint-Loup. In this way my attitude, as I did not know what one ought to adopt in a setting that was strange to me, would be entirely dominated by our talk, and people would think that I was so absorbed in it, so unobservant of my surroundings, that it was quite natural that I should not shew the facial expressions proper to a place in which, to judge by what I appeared to be saying, I was barely conscious of standing; and seizing, to make a beginning, upon the first topic that came to my mind:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know,\u201d I said, \u201cI did come to say good-bye to you the day I left Donci\u00e8res; I\u2019ve not had an opportunity to mention it. I waved to you in the street.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDon\u2019t speak about it,\u201d he replied, \u201cI was so sorry. I passed you just outside the barracks, but I couldn\u2019t stop because I was late already. I assure you, I felt quite wretched about it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So he had recognised me! I saw again in my mind the wholly impersonal salute which he had given me, raising his hand to his cap, without a glance to indicate that he knew me, without a gesture to shew that he was sorry he could not stop. Evidently this fiction, which he had adopted at that moment, of not knowing me must have simplified matters for him greatly. But I was amazed to find that he had been able to compose himself to it so swiftly and without any instinctive movement to betray his original impression. I had already observed at Balbec that, side by side with that childlike sincerity of his face, the skin of which by its transparence rendered visible the sudden tide of certain emotions, his body had been admirably trained to perform a certain number of well-bred dissimulations, and that, like a consummate actor, he could, in his regimental and in his social life, play alternately quite different parts. In one of his parts he loved me tenderly, he acted towards me almost as if he had been my brother; my brother he had been, he was now again, but for a moment that day he had been another person who did not know me and who, holding the reins, his glass screwed to his eye, without a look or a smile had lifted his disengaged hand to the peak of his cap to give me correctly the military salute\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The stage scenery, still in its place, among which I was passing, seen thus at close range and without the advantage of any of those effects of lighting and distance on which the eminent artist whose brush had painted it had calculated, was a depressing sight, and Rachel, when I came near her, was subjected to a no less destructive force. The curves of her charming nose had stood out in perspective, between stalls and stage, like the relief of the scenery. It was no longer herself, I recognised her only thanks to her eyes, in which her identity had taken refuge. The form, the radiance of this young star, so brilliant a moment ago, had vanished. On the other hand \u2014 as though we came close to the moon and it ceased to present the appearance of a disk of rosy gold \u2014 on this face, so smooth a surface until now, I could distinguish only protuberances, discolourations, cavities. Despite the incoherence into which were resolved at close range not only the feminine features but the painted canvas, I was glad to be there to wander among the scenery, all that setting which at one time my love of nature had prompted me to dismiss as tedious and artificial until the description of it by Goethe in Wilhelm Meister had given it a sort of beauty in my eyes; and I had already observed with delight, in the thick of a crowd of journalists or men of friends of the actresses, who were greeting one another, talking, smoking, as though in a public thoroughfare, a young man in a black velvet cap and hortensia-coloured skirt, his cheeks chalked in red like a page from a Watteau album, who with his smiling lips, his eyes raised to the ceiling, as he sprang lightly into the air, seemed so entirely of another species than the rational folk in everyday clothes, in the midst of whom he was pursuing like a madman the course of his ecstatic dream, so alien to the preoccupations of their life, so anterior to the habits of their civilisation, so enfranchised from all the laws of nature, that it was as restful and as fresh a spectacle as watching a butterfly straying along a crowded street to follow with one\u2019s eyes, between the strips of canvas, the natural arabesques traced by his winged capricious painted oscillations. But at that moment Saint-Loup conceived the idea that his mistress was paying undue attention to this dancer, who was engaged now in practising for the last time the figure of fun with which he was going to take the stage, and his face darkened\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou might look the other way,\u201d he warned her gloomily. \u201cYou know that none of those dancer-fellows is worth the rope they can at least fall off and break their necks, and they\u2019re the sort of people who go about afterwards boasting that you\u2019ve taken notice of them. Besides, you know very well you\u2019ve been told to go to your dressing-room and change. You\u2019ll be missing your call again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A group of men \u2014 journalists \u2014 noticing the look of fury on Saint-Loup\u2019s face, came nearer, amused, to listen to what we were saying. And as the stage-hands had just set up some scenery on our other side we were forced into close contact with them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but I know him; he\u2019s a friend of mine,\u201d cried Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress, her eyes still fixed on the dancer. \u201cLook how well made he is, do watch those little hands of his dancing away by themselves like his whole body!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dancer turned his head towards her, and his human person appeared beneath the sylph that he was endeavouring to be, the clear grey jelly of his eyes trembled and sparkled between eyelids stiff with paint, and a smile extended the corners of his mouth into cheeks plastered with rouge; then, to amuse the girl, like a singer who hums to oblige us the air of the song in which we have told her that we admired her singing, he began to repeat the movement of his hands, counterfeiting himself with the fineness of a parodist and the good humour of a child\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, that\u2019s too lovely, the way he copies himself,\u201d she cried, clapping her hands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI implore you, my dearest girl,\u201d Saint-Loup broke in, in a tone of utter misery, \u201cdo not make a scene here, I can\u2019t stand it; I swear, if you say another word I won\u2019t go with you to your room, I shall walk straight out; come, don\u2019t be so naughty. . . . You oughtn\u2019t to stand about in the cigar smoke like that, it\u2019ll make you ill,\u201d he went on, to me, with the solicitude he had shewn for me in our Balbec days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! What a good thing it would be if you did go.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI warn you, if I do I shan\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat\u2019s more than I should venture to hope.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen; you know, I promised you the necklace if you behaved nicely to me, but the moment you treat me like this. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Well, that doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least. You gave me your promise; I ought to have known you\u2019d never keep it. You want the whole world to know you\u2019re made of money, but I\u2019m not a money-grubber like you. You can keep your blasted necklace; I know some one else who\u2019ll give it to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo one else can possibly give it to you; I\u2019ve told Boucheron he\u2019s to keep it for me, and I have his promise not to let anyone else have it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere you are, trying to blackmail me, you\u2019ve arranged everything, I see. That\u2019s what they mean by Marsantes, Mater Semita, it smells of the race,\u201d retorted Rachel quoting an etymology which was founded on a wild misinterpretation, for Semita means \u2018path\u2019 and not \u2018Semite,\u2019 but one which the Nationalists applied to Saint-Loup on account of the Dreyfusard views for which, so far as that went, he was indebted to the actress. She was less entitled than anyone to apply the word \u2018Jew\u2019 to Mme. de Marsantes, in whom the ethnologists of society could succeed in finding no trace of Judaism apart from her connexion with the L\u00e9vy-Mirepoix family. \u201cBut this isn\u2019t the last of it, I can tell you. An agreement like that isn\u2019t binding. You have acted treacherously towards me. Boucheron shall be told of it and he\u2019ll be paid twice as much for his necklace. You\u2019ll hear from me before long; don\u2019t you worry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert was in the right a hundred times over. But circumstances are always so entangled that the man who is in the right a hundred times may have been once in the wrong. And I could not help recalling that unpleasant and yet quite innocent expression which he had used at Balbec: \u201cIn that way I keep a hold over her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what I mean about the necklace. I made no formal promise: once you start doing everything you possibly can to make me leave you, it\u2019s only natural, surely, that I shouldn\u2019t give it to you; I fail to understand what treachery you can see in that, or what my ulterior motive is supposed to be. You can\u2019t seriously maintain that I brag about my money, I\u2019m always telling you that I\u2019m only a poor devil without a cent to my name. It\u2019s foolish of you take it in that way, my dear. What possible interest can I have in hurting you? You know very well that my one interest in life is yourself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes, yes, please go on,\u201d she retorted ironically, with the sweeping gesture of a barber wielding his razor. And turning to watch the dancer:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIsn\u2019t he too wonderful with his hands. A woman like me couldn\u2019t do the things he\u2019s doing now.\u201d She went closer to him and, pointing to Robert\u2019s furious face: \u201cLook, he\u2019s hurt,\u201d she murmured, in the momentary elation of a sadic impulse to cruelty totally out of keeping with the genuine feelings of affection for Saint-Loup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, for the last time, I swear to you it doesn\u2019t matter what you do \u2014 in a week you\u2019ll be giving anything to get me back \u2014 I shan\u2019t come; it\u2019s a clean cut, do you hear, it\u2019s irrevocable; you will be sorry one day, when it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps he was sincere in saying this, and the torture of leaving his mistress may have seemed to him less cruel than that of remaining with her in certain circumstances\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy,\u201d he went on, to me, \u201cyou oughtn\u2019t to stand about here, I tell you, it will make you cough.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I pointed to the scenery which barred my way. He touched his hat and said to one of the journalists:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWould you mind, sir, throwing away your cigar; the smoke is bad for my friend.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His mistress had not waited for him to accompany her; on her way to her dressing-room she turned round and:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo they do those tricks with women too, those nice little hands?\u201d she flung to the dancer from the back of the stage, in an artificially melodious tone of girlish innocence. \u201cYou look just like one yourself, I\u2019m sure I could have a wonderful time with you and a girl I know.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s no rule against smoking that I know of; if people aren\u2019t well, they have only to stay at home,\u201d said the journalist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dancer smiled mysteriously back at the actress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! Do stop! You\u2019ll make me quite mad,\u201d she cried to him. \u201cThen there will be trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn any case, sir, you are not very civil,\u201d observed Saint-Loup to the journalist, still with a courteous suavity, in the deliberate manner of a man judging retrospectively the rights and wrongs of an incident that is already closed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment I saw Saint-Loup raise his arm vertically above his head as if he had been making a signal to some one whom I could not see, or like the conductor of an orchestra, and indeed \u2014 without any greater transition than when, at a simple wave of the baton, in a symphony or a ballet, violent rhythms succeed a graceful andante \u2014 after the courteous words that he had just uttered he brought down his hand with a resounding smack upon the journalist\u2019s cheek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now that to the measured conversations of the diplomats, to the smiling arts of peace had succeeded the furious onthrust of war, since blows lead to blows, I should not have been surprised to see the combatants swimming in one another\u2019s blood. But what I could not understand (like people who feel that it is not according to the rules when a war breaks out between two countries after some question merely of the rectification of a frontier, or when a sick man dies after nothing more serious than a swelling of the liver) was how Saint-Loup had contrived to follow up those words, which implied a distinct shade of friendliness, with an action which in no way arose out of them, which they had not, so to speak, announced, that action of an arm raised in defiance not only of the rights of man but of the law of cause and effect, that action created ex nihilo. Fortunately the journalist who, staggering back from the violence of the blow, had turned pale and hesitated for a moment, did not retaliate. As for his friends, one of them had promptly turned away his head and was looking fixedly into the wings for some one who evidently was not there; the second pretended that a speck of dust had got into his eye, and began rubbing and squeezing his eyelid with every sign of being in pain; while the third had rushed off, exclaiming: \u201cGood heavens, I believe the curtain\u2019s going up; we shan\u2019t get into our seats.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to speak to Saint-Loup, but he was so full of his indignation with the dancer that it adhered exactly to the surface of his eyeballs; like a subcutaneous structure it distended his cheeks with the result that, his internal agitation expressing itself externally in an entire immobility, he had not even the power of relaxation, the \u2018play\u2019 necessary to take in a word from me and to answer it. The journalist\u2019s friends, seeing that the incident was at an end, gathered round him again, still trembling. But, ashamed of having deserted him, they were absolutely determined that be should be made to suppose that they had noticed nothing. And so they dilated, one upon the speck of dust in his eye, one upon his false alarm when he had thought that the curtain was going up, the third upon the astonishing resemblance between a man who had just gone by and the speaker\u2019s brother. Indeed they seemed quite to resent their friend\u2019s not having shared their several emotions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, didn\u2019t it strike you? You must be going blind.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I say is that you\u2019re a pack of curs,\u201d growled the journalist whom Saint-Loup had punished\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forgetting the poses they had adopted, to be consistent with which they ought \u2014 but they did not think of it \u2014 to have pretended not to understand what he meant, they fell back on certain expressions traditional in the circumstances: \u201cWhat\u2019s all the excitement? Keep your hair on, old chap. Don\u2019t take the bit in your teeth.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had realised that morning beneath the pear blossom how illusory were the grounds upon which Robert\u2019s love for \u2018Rachel when from the Lord\u2019 was based; I was bound now to admit how very real were the sufferings to which that love gave rise. Gradually the feeling that had obsessed him for the last hour, without a break, began to diminish, receded into him, an unoccupied pliable zone appeared in his eyes. I had stopped for a moment at a corner of the Avenue Gabriel from which I had often in the past seen Gilberte appear. I tried for a few seconds to recall those distant impressions, and was hurrying at a \u2018gymnastic\u2019 pace to overtake Saint-Loup when I saw that a gentleman, somewhat shabbily attired, appeared to be talking to him confidentially. I concluded that this was a personal friend of Robert; at the same time they seemed to be drawing even closer to one another; suddenly, as a meteor flashes through the sky, I saw a number of ovoid bodies assume with a giddy swiftness all the positions necessary for them to form, before Saint-Loup\u2019s face and body, a flickering constellation. Flung out like stones from a catapult, they seemed to me to be at the very least seven in number. They were merely, however, Saint-Loup\u2019s pair of fists, multiplied by the speed with which they were changing their places in this \u2014 to all appearance ideal and decorative \u2014 arrangement. But this elaborate display was nothing more than a pummelling which Saint-Loup was administering, the true character of which, aggressive rather than aesthetic, was first revealed to me by the aspect of the shabbily dressed gentleman who appeared to be losing at once his self-possession, his lower jaw and a quantity of blood. He gave fictitious explanations to the people who came up to question him, turned his head and, seeing that Saint-Loup had made off and was hastening to rejoin me, stood gazing after him with an offended, crushed, but by no means furious expression on his face. Saint-Loup, on the other hand, was furious, although he himself had received no blow, and his eyes were still blazing with anger when he reached me. The incident was in no way connected (as I had supposed) with the assault in the theatre. It was an impassioned loiterer who, seeing the fine looking young soldier that Saint-Loup was, had made overtures to him. My friend could not get over the audacity of this \u2018clique\u2019 who no longer even waited for the shades of night to cover their operations, and spoke of the suggestion that had been made to him with the same indignation as the newspapers use in reporting an armed assault and robbery, in broad daylight, in the centre of Paris. And yet the recipient of his blow was excusable in one respect, for the trend of the downward slope brings desire so rapidly to the point of enjoyment that beauty by itself appears to imply consent. Now, that Saint-Loup was beautiful was beyond dispute. Castigation such as he had just administered has this value, for men of the type that had accosted him, that it makes them think seriously of their conduct, though never for long enough to enable them to amend their ways and thus escape correction at the hands of the law. And so, although Saint-Loup\u2019s arm had shot out instinctively, without any preliminary thought, all such punishments, even when they reinforce the law, are powerless to bring about any uniformity in morals\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These incidents, particularly the one that was weighing most on his mind, seemed to have prompted in Robert a desire to be left alone for a while. After a moment\u2019s silence he asked me to leave him, and to go by myself to call on Mme. de Villeparisis. He would join me there, but preferred that we should not enter the room together, so that he might appear to have only just arrived in Paris, instead of having spent half the day already with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I had supposed before making the acquaintance of Mme. de Villeparisis at Balbec, there was a vast difference between the world in which she lived and that of Mme. de Guermantes. Mme. de Villeparisis was one of those women who, born of a famous house, entering by marriage into another no less famous, do not for all that enjoy any great position in the social world, and, apart from a few duchesses who are their nieces or sisters-in-law, perhaps even a crowned head or two, old family friends, see their drawing-rooms filled only by third-rate people, drawn from the middle classes or from a nobility either provincial or tainted in some way, whose presence there has long since driven away all such smart and snobbish folk as are not obliged to come to the house by ties of blood or the claims of a friendship too old to be ignored. Certainly I had no difficulty after the first few minutes in understanding how Mme. de Villeparisis, at Balbec, had come to be so well informed, better than ourselves even, as to the smallest details of the tour through Spain which my father was then making with M. de Norpois. Even this, however, did not make it possible to rest content with the theory that the intimacy \u2014 of more than twenty years\u2019 standing \u2014 between Mme. de Villeparisis and the Ambassador could have been responsible for the lady\u2019s loss of caste in a world where the smartest women boasted the attachment of lovers far less respectable than he not to mention that it was probably years since he had been anything more to the Marquise than just an old friend. Had Mme. de Villeparisis then had other adventures in days gone by? Being then of a more passionate temperament than now, in a calm and religious old age which nevertheless owed some of its mellow colouring to those ardent, vanished years, had she somehow failed, in the country neighbourhood where she had lived for so long, to avoid certain scandals unknown to the younger generation who simply took note of their effect in the unequal and defective composition of a visiting list bound, otherwise, to have been among the purest of any taint of mediocrity? That \u2018sharp tongue\u2019 which her nephew ascribed to her, had it in those far-off days made her enemies? Had it driven her into taking advantage of certain successes with men so as to avenge herself upon women? All this was possible; nor could the exquisitely sensitive way in which \u2014 giving so delicate a shade not merely to her words but to her intonation \u2014 Mme. de Villeparisis spoke of modesty or generosity be held to invalidate this supposition; for the people who not only speak with approval of certain virtues but actually feel their charm and shew a marvellous comprehension of them (people in fact who will, when they come to write their memoirs, present a worthy picture of those virtues) are often sprung from but not actually part of the silent, simple, artless generation which practised them. That generation is reflected in them but is not continued. Instead of the character which it possessed we find a sensibility, an intelligence which are not conducive to action. And whether or not there had been in the life of Mme. de Villeparisis any of those scandals, which (if there had) the lustre of her name would have blotted out, it was this intellect, resembling rather that of a writer of the second order than that of a woman of position, that was undoubtedly the cause of her social degradation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that they were not specially elevating, the qualities, such as balance and restraint, which Mme. de Villeparisis chiefly extolled; but to speak of restraint in a manner that shall be entirely adequate, the word \u2018restraint\u2019 is not enough, we require some of the qualities of authorship which presuppose a quite unrestrained exaltation; I had remarked at Balbec that the genius of certain great artists was completely unintelligible to Mme. de Villeparisis; and that all she could do was to make delicate fun of them and to express her incomprehension in a graceful and witty form. But this wit and grace, at the point to which she carried them, became themselves \u2014 on another plane, and even although they were employed to belittle the noblest masterpieces \u2014 true artistic qualities. Now the effect of such qualities on any social position is a morbid activity of the kind which doctors call elective, and so disintegrating that the most firmly established pillars of society are hard put to it to hold out for any length of time. What artists call intellect seems pure presumption to the fashionable world which, unable to place itself at the sole point of view from which they, the artists, look at and judge things, incapable of understanding the particular attraction to which they yield when they choose an ex-Pression or start a friendship, feel in their company an exhaustion, an irritation, from which antipathy very shortly springs. And yet in her conversation, and the same may be said of the Memoirs which she afterwards published, Mme. de Villeparisis shewed nothing but a sort of grace that was eminently social. Having passed by great works without mastering sometimes without even noticing them, she had preserved from the period in which she had lived and which, moreover, she described with great aptness and charm, little more than the most frivolous of the gifts that they had had to offer her. But a narrative of this sort, even when it treats exclusively of subjects that are not intellectual, is still a work of the intellect, and to give in a book or in conversation, which is almost the same thing, a deliberate impression of frivolity, a serious touch is required which a purely frivolous person would be incapable of supplying. In a certain book of reminiscences written by a woman and regarded as a masterpiece, the phrase that people quote as a model of airy grace has always made me suspect that, in order to arrive at such a pitch of lightness, the author must originally have had a rather stodgy education, a boring culture, and that as a girl she probably appeared to her friends an insufferable prig. And between certain literary qualities and social failure the connexion is so inevitable that when we open Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s Memoirs to-day, on any page a fitting epithet, a sequence of metaphors will suffice to enable the reader to reconstruct the deep but icy bow which must have been bestowed on the old Marquise on the staircases of the Embassies by a snob like Mme. Leroi, who perhaps may have left a card on her when she went to call on the Guermantes, but never set foot in her house for fear of losing caste among all the doctors\u2019 or solicitors\u2019 wives whom she would find there. A bluestocking Mme. de Villeparisis had perhaps been in her earliest youth, and, intoxicated with the ferment of her own knowledge, had perhaps failed to realise the. importance of not applying to people in society, less intelligent and less educated than herself, those cutting strokes which the injured party never forgets\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, talent is not a separate appendage which one artificially attaches to those qualities which make for social success, in order to create from the whole what people in society call a \u2018complete woman.\u2019 It is the living product of a certain moral complexion, from which as a rule many moral qualities are lacking and in which there predominates a sensibility of which other manifestations such as we do not notice in a book may make themselves quite distinctly felt in the course of a life, certain curiosities for instance, certain whims, the desire to go to this place or that for one\u2019s own amusement and not with a view to the extension, the maintenance or even the mere exercise of one\u2019s social relations. I had seen at Balbec Mme. de Villeparisis hemmed in by a bodyguard of her own servants without even a glance, as she passed, at the people sitting in the hall of the hotel. But I had had a presentiment that this abstention was due not to indifference, and it seemed that she had not always confined herself to it. She would get a sudden craze to know some one or other because she had seen him and thought him good-looking, or merely because she had been told that he was amusing, or because he had struck her as different from the people she knew, who at this period, when she had not yet begun to appreciate them because she imagined that they would never fail her, belonged, all of them, to the purest cream of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. To the bohemian, the humble middle-class gentleman whom she had marked out with her favour she was obliged to address invitations the importance of which he was unable to appreciate, with an insistence which began gradually to depreciate her in the eyes of the snobs who were in the habit of estimating the smartness of a house by the people whom its mistress excluded rather than by those whom she entertained. Certainly, if at a given moment in her youth Mme. de Villeparisis, surfeited with the satisfaction of belonging to the fine flower of the aristocracy, had found a sort of amusement in scandalising the people among whom she lived, and in deliberately impairing her own position in society, she had begun to attach its full importance to that position once it was definitely lost. She had wished to shew the Duchesses that she was better than they, by saying and doing all the things that they dared not say or do. But now that they all, save such as were closely related to her, had ceased to call, she felt herself diminished, and sought once more to reign, but with another sceptre than that of wit. She would have liked to attract to her house all those women whom she had taken such pains to drive away. How many women\u2019s lives, lives of which little enough is known (for we all live in different worlds according to our ages, and the discretion of their elders prevents the young from forming any clear idea of the past and so completing the cycle), have been divided in this way into contrasted periods, the last being entirely devoted to the reconquest of what in the second has been so light-heartedly flung on the wind. Flung on the wind in what way? The young people are all the less capable of imagining it, since they see before them an elderly and respectable Marquise de Villeparisis and have no idea that the grave diarist of the present day, so dignified beneath her pile of snowy hair, can ever have been a gay midnight-reveller who was perhaps the delight in those days, devoured the fortunes perhaps of men now sleeping in their graves; that she should also have set to work, with a persevering and natural industry, to destroy the position which she owed to her high birth does not in the least imply that even at that remote period Mme. de Villeparisis did not attach great importance to her position. In the same way the web of isolation, of inactivity in which a neurasthenic lives may be woven by him from morning to night without therefore seeming endurable, and while he is hastening to add another mesh to the net which holds him captive, it is possible that he is dreaming only of dancing, sport and travel. We are at work every moment upon giving its form to our life, but we do so by copying unintentionally, like the example in a book, the features of the person that we are and not of him who we should like to be. The disdainful bow of Mme. Leroi might to some extent be expressive of the true nature of Mme. de Villeparisis; it in no way corresponded to her ambition\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt at the same moment at which Mme. Leroi was \u2014 to use an expression beloved of Mme. Swann \u2014\u2018cutting\u2019 the Marquise, the latter could seek consolation in remembering how Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie had once said to her: \u201cYou are just like a daughter to me.\u201d But such marks of royal friendship, secret and unknown to the world, existed for the Marquise alone, dusty as the diploma of an old Conservatoire medalist. The only true social advantages are those that create life, that can disappear without the person who has benefited by them needing to try to keep them or to make them public, because on the same day a hundred others will take their place. And for all that she could remember the Queen\u2019s using those words to her, she would nevertheless have bartered them gladly for the permanent faculty of being asked everywhere which Mme. Leroi possessed as in a restaurant a great but unknown artist whose genius is written neither in the lines of his bashful face nor in the antiquated cut of his threadbare coat, would willingly be even the young stock-jobber, of the lowest grade of society, who is sitting with a couple of actresses at a neighbouring table to which in an obsequious and incessant chain come hurrying manager, head waiter, pages and even the scullions who file out of the kitchen to salute him, as in the fairy-tales, while the wine waiter advances, dust-covered like his bottles, limping and dazed, as if on his way up from the cellar he had twisted his foot before emerging into the light of day\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must be remarked, however, that in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room the absence of Mme. Leroi, if it distressed the lady of the house, passed unperceived by the majority of her guests. They were entirely ignorant of the peculiar position which Mme. Leroi occupied, a: position known only to the fashionable world, and never doubted that Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s receptions were, as the readers of her Memoirs to-day are convinced that they must have been, the most brilliant in Paris\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the occasion of this first call which, after leaving Saint-Loup, I went to pay on Mme. Villeparisis, following the advice given by M. de Norpois to my father, I found her in her drawing-room hung with yellow silk, against which the sofas and the admirable armchairs upholstered in Beauvais tapestry stood out with the almost purple redness of ripe raspberries. Side by side with the Guermantes and Villeparisis portraits one saw those \u2014 gifts from the sitters themselves \u2014 of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie, the Queen of the Belgians, the Prince de Joinville and the Empress of Austria. Mme. de Villeparisis herself, capped with an old-fashioned bonnet of black lace (which she preserved with the same instinctive sense of local or historical colour as a Breton inn-keeper who, however Parisian his customers may have become, feels it more in keeping to make his maids dress in coifs and wide sleeves), was seated at a little desk on which in front of her, as well as her brushes, her palette and an unfinished flower-piece in water-colours, were arranged in glasses, in saucers, in cups, moss-roses, zinnias, maidenhair ferns, which on account of the sudden influx of callers she had just left off painting, and which had the effect of being piled on a florist\u2019s counter in some eighteenth-century mezzotint. In this drawing-room, which had been slightly heated on purpose because the Marquise had caught cold on the journey from her house in the country, there were already when I arrived a librarian with whom Mme. de Villeparisis had spent the morning in selecting the autograph letters to herself from various historical personages which were to figure in facsimile as documentary evidence in the Memoirs which she was preparing for the press, and a historian, solemn and tongue-tied, who hearing that she had inherited and still possessed a portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, had come to ask her permission to reproduce it as a plate in his work on the Fronde; a party strengthened presently by the addition of my old friend Bloch, now a rising dramatist, upon whom she counted to secure the gratuitous services of actors and actresses at her next series of afternoon parties. It was true that the social kaleidoscope was in the act of turning and that the Dreyfus case was shortly to hurl the Jews down to the lowest rung of the social ladder. But, for one thing, the anti-Dreyfus cyclone might rage as it would, it is not in the first hour of a storm that the waves are highest. In the second place, Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving a whole section of her family to fulminate against the Jews, had hitherto kept herself entirely aloof from the Case and never gave it a thought. Lastly, a young man like Bloch, whom no one knew, might pass unperceived, whereas leading Jews, representatives of their party, were already threatened. He had his chin pointed now by a goat-beard, wore double glasses and a long frock coat, and carried a glove like a roll of papyrus in his hand. The Rumanians, the Egyptians, the Turks may hate the Jews. But in a French drawing-room the differences between those peoples are not so apparent, and an Israelite making his entry as though he were emerging from the heart of the desert, his body crouching like a hyaena\u2019s, his neck thrust obliquely forward, spreading himself in profound \u2018salaams,\u2019 completely satisfies a certain taste for the oriental. Only it is essential that the Jew should not be actually \u2018in\u2019 society, otherwise he will readily assume the aspect of a lord and his manners become so Gallicised that on his face a rebellious nose, growing like a nasturtium in any but the right direction, will make one think rather of Mascarille\u2019s nose than of Solomon\u2019s. But Bloch, not having been rendered supple by the gymnastics of the Faubourg, nor ennobled by a crossing with England or Spain, remained for a lover of the exotic as strange and savoury a spectacle, in spite of his European costume, as one of Decamps\u2019s Jews. Marvellous racial power which from the dawn of time thrusts to the surface, even in modern Paris, on the stage of our theatres, behind the pigeonholes of our public offices, at a funeral, in the street, a solid phalanx, setting their mark upon our modern ways of hairdressing, absorbing, making us forget, disciplining the frock coat which on them remains not at all unlike the garment in which Assyrian scribes are depicted in ceremonial attire on the frieze of a monument at Susa before the gates of the Palace of Darius. (Later in the afternoon Bloch might have imagined that it was out of anti-semitic malice that M. de Charlus inquired whether his first name was Jewish, whereas it was simply from aesthetic interest and love of local colour.) But, to revert for a moment, when we speak of racial persistence we do not accurately convey the impression we receive from Jews, Greeks, Persians, all those peoples whom it is better to leave with their differences. We know from classical paintings the faces of the ancient Greeks, we have seen Assyrians on the walls of a palace at Susa. And so we feel, on encountering in a Paris drawing-room Orientals belonging to one or another group, that we are in the presence of creatures whom the forces of necromancy must have called to life. We knew hitherto only a superficial image; behold it has gained depth, it extends into three dimensions, it moves. The young Greek lady, daughter of a rich banker and the latest favourite of society, looks exactly like one of those dancers who in the chorus of a ballet at once historical and aesthetic symbolise in flesh and blood the art of Hellas; and yet in the theatre the setting makes these images somehow trite; the spectacle, on the other hand, to which the entry into a drawing-room of a Turkish lady or a Jewish gentleman admits us, by animating their features makes them appear stranger still, as if they really were creatures evoked by the effort of a medium. It is the soul (or rather the pigmy thing to which \u2014 up to the present, at any rate \u2014 the soul is reduced in this sort of materialisation), it is the soul of which we have caught glimpses hitherto in museums alone, the soul of the ancient Greeks, of the ancient Hebrews, torn from a life at once insignificant and transcendental, which seems to be enacting before our eyes this disconcerting pantomime. In the young Greek lady who is leaving the room what we seek in vain to embrace is the figure admired long ago on the side of a vase. I felt that if I had in the light of Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room taken photographs of Bloch, they would have furnished of Israel the same image \u2014 so disturbing because it does not appear to emanate from humanity, so deceiving because all the same it is so strangely like humanity \u2014 which we find in spirit photographs. There is nothing, to speak more generally, not even the insignificance of the remarks made by the people among whom we spend our lives, that does not give us a sense of the supernatural, in our everyday world where even a man of genius from whom we expect, gathered as though around a turning-table, to learn the secret of the Infinite utters only these words \u2014 the same that had just issued from the lips of Bloch: \u201cTake care of my top hat.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, Ministers, my dear sir,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis was saying, addressing herself specially to my friend, and picking up the thread of a conversation which had been broken by my arrival: \u201cnobody ever wanted to see them. I was only a child at the time, but I can remember so well the King begging my grandfather to invite M. Decazes to a rout at which my father was to dance with the Duchesse de Berry. \u2018It will give me pleasure, Florimond,\u2019 said the King. My grandfather, who was a little deaf, thought he had said M. de Castries, which seemed a perfectly natural thing to ask. When he understood that it was M. Decazes, he was furious at first, but he gave in, and wrote a note the same evening to M. Decazes, begging him to pay my grandfather the compliment and give him the honour of his presence at the ball which he was giving the following week. For we were polite, sir, in those days, and no hostess would have dreamed of simply sending her card and writing on it \u2018Tea\u2019 or \u2018Dancing\u2019 or \u2018Music.\u2019 But if we understood politeness we were not incapable of impertinence either. M. Decazes accepted, but the day before the ball it was given out that my grandfather felt indisposed and had cancelled his invitations. He had obeyed the King, but he had not had M. Decazes at his ball. . . . Yes, sir, I remember M. Mole very well, he was a clever man \u2014 he shewed that in his reception of M. de Vigny at the Academy \u2014 but he was very pompous, and I can see him now coming downstairs to dinner in his own house with his tall hat in his hand.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! that is typically suggestive of what must have been a pretty perniciously philistine epoch, for it was no doubt a universal habit to carry one\u2019s hat in one\u2019s hand in one\u2019s own house,\u201d observed Bloch, anxious to make the most of so rare an opportunity of learning from an eyewitness details of the aristocratic life of another day, while the librarian, who was a sort of intermittent secretary to the Marquise, gazed at her tenderly as though he were saying to the rest of us: \u201cThere, you see what she\u2019s like, she knows everything, she has met everybody, you can ask her anything you like, she\u2019s quite amazing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, no,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, drawing nearer to her as she spoke the glass containing the maidenhair which presently she would begin again to paint, \u201cit was a habit M. Mole had; that was all. I never saw my father carry his hat in the house, except of course when the King came, because the King being at home wherever he is the master of the house is only a visitor then in his own drawing-room.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAristotle tells us in the second chapter of . . . \u201d ventured M. Pierre, the historian of the Fronde, but so timidly that no one paid any attention. Having been suffering for some weeks from a nervous insomnia which resisted every attempt at treatment, he had given up going to bed, and, half-dead with exhaustion, went out only whenever his work made it imperative. Incapable of repeating at all often these expeditions which, simple enough for other people, cost him as much effort as if, to make them, he was obliged to come down from the moon, he was surprised to be brought up so frequently against the fact that other people\u2019s lives were not organised on a constant and permanent basis so as to furnish the maximum utility to the sudden outbursts of his own. He sometimes found the doors shut of a library which he had reached only after setting himself artificially on his feet and in a frock coat like some automaton in a story by Mr. Wells. Fortunately he had found Mme. de Villeparisis at home and was going to be shewn the portrait\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile he was cut short by Bloch. \u201cIndeed,\u201d the latter remarked, referring to what Mme. de Villeparisis had said as to the etiquette for royal visits. \u201cDo you know, I never knew that,\u201d as though it were strange that he should not have known it always\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTalking of that sort of visit, you heard the stupid joke my nephew Basin played on me yesterday morning?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis asked the librarian. \u201cHe told my people, instead of announcing him, to say that it was the Queen of Sweden who had called to see me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! He made them tell you just like that! I say, he must have a nerve,\u201d exclaimed Bloch with a shout of laughter, while the historian smiled with a stately timidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was quite surprised, because I had only been back from the country a few days; I had specially arranged, just to be left in peace for a little, that no one was to be told that I was in Paris, and I asked myself how the Queen of Sweden could have heard so soon,\u201d went on Mme. de Villeparisis, leaving her guests amazed to find that a visit from the Queen of Sweden was in itself nothing out of the common to their hostess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Earlier in the day Mme. de Villeparisis might have been collaborating with the librarian in arranging the illustrations to her Memoirs; now she was, quite unconsciously, trying their effect on an average public typical of that from which she would eventually have to enlist her readers. Hers might be different in many ways from a really fashionable drawing-room in which you would have been struck by the absence of a number of middle dass ladies to whom Mme. de Villeparisis was \u2018at home,\u2019 and would have noticed instead such brilliant leaders of fashion as Mme. Leroi had in course of time managed to secure, but this distinction is not perceptible in her Memoirs, from which certain unimportant friendships of the author have disappeared because there is never any occasion to refer to them; while the absence of those who did not come to see her leaves no gap because, in the necessarily restricted space at the author\u2019s disposal, only a few persons can appear, and if these persons are royal personages, historic personalities, then the utmost impression of distinction which any volume of memoirs can convey to the public is achieved. In the opinion of Mme. Leroi, Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s parties were third-rate; and Mme. de Villeparisis felt the sting of Mme. Leroi\u2019s opinion. But hardly anyone to-day remembers who Mme. Leroi was, her opinions have vanished into thin air, and it is the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, frequented as it was by the Queen of Sweden, and as it had been by the Due d\u2019Aumale, the Duc de Broglie, Thiers, Montalembert, Mgr. Dupanloup, which will be looked upon as one of the most brilliant of the nineteenth century by that posterity which has not changed since the days of Homer and Pindar, and for which the enviable things are exalted birth, royal or quasi-royal, and the friendship of kings, the leaders of the people and other eminent men\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now of all this Mme. de Villeparisis had her share in the people who still came to her house and in the memories \u2014 sometimes slightly \u2018touched up\u2019\u2014 by means of which she extended her social activity into the past. And then there was M. de Norpois who, while unable to restore his friend to any substantial position in society, did indeed bring to her house such foreign or French statesmen as might have need of his services and knew that the only effective method of securing them was to pay court to Mme. de Villeparisis. Possibly Mme. Leroi also knew these European celebrities. But, as a well-mannered woman who avoids anything that suggests the bluestocking, she would as little have thought of mentioning the Eastern question to her Prime Ministers as of discussing the nature of love with her novelists and philosophers. \u201cLove?\u201d she had once replied to a pushing lady who had asked her: \u201cWhat are your views on love?\u201d\u2014\u201cLove? I make it, constantly, but I never talk about it.\u201d When she had any of these literary or political lions in her house she contented herself, as did the Duchesse de Guermantes, with setting them down to play poker. They often preferred this to the serious conversations on general ideas in which Mme. de Villeparisis forced them to engage. But these conversations, ridiculous as in the social sense they may have been, have furnished the Memoirs of Mme. de Villeparisis with those admirable passages, those dissertations on politics which read so well in volumes of autobiography, as they do in Corneille\u2019s tragedies. Furthermore, the parties of the Villeparisis of this world are alone destined to be handed down to posterity, because the rerois of this world cannot write, and, if they could, would not have the time. And if the literary bent of the Villeparisis is the cause of the Lerois\u2019 disdain, the disdain of the Lerois does, in its turn, a singular service to the literary bent of the Villeparisis by affording the bluestockings that leisure which the career of letters requires. God, Whose Will it is that there should be a few books in the world well written, breathes with that purpose such disdain into the hearts of the Lerois, for He knows that if these should invite the Villeparisis to dinner the latter would at once rise from their writing tables and order their carriages to be round at eight\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently there came into the room, with slow and solemn step, an oid lady of tall stature who, beneath the raised brim of her straw hat, revealed a monumental pile of snowy hair in the style of Marie-Antoinette. I did not then know that she was one of three women who were still to be seen in Parisian society and who, like Mme. de Villeparisis, while all of the noblest birth, had been reduced, for reasons which were IKJW lost in the night of time and could have been told us only by some old gallant of their period, to entertaining only certain of the dregs of society who were not sought after elsewhere. Each of these ladies had her own \u2018Duchesse de Guermantes,\u2019 the brilliant niece who came regularly to pay her respects, but none of them could have succeeded in attracting to her house the \u2018Duchesse de Guermantes\u2019 of either of the others. Mme. de Villeparisis was on the best of terms with these three ladies, but she did not like them. Perhaps the similarity between their social position and her own gave her an impression of them which was not pleasing. Besides, soured bluestockings as they were, seeking by the number and frequency of the drawing-room comedies which they arranged in their houses to give themselves the illusion of a regular salon, there had grown up among them a rivalry which the decay of her fortune in the course of a somewhat tempestuous existence reduced for each of them, when it was a question of securing the kind assistance of a professional actor or actress, into a sort of struggle for life. Furthermore, the lady with the Mark-Antoinette hair, whenever she set eyes on Mme. de Villeparisis, could not help being reminded of the fact that the Duchesse de Guermantes did not come to her Fridays. Her consolation was that at these same Fridays she could always count on having, blood being thicker than water, the Princesse de Poix, who was her own personal Guermantes, and who never went near Mme. de Villeparisis, albeit Mme. de Poix was an intimate friend of the Duchess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless from the mansion on the Quai Malaquais to the drawing-rooms of the Rue de Tournon, the Rue de la Chaise and the Faubourg Saint-Honor\u00e9, a bond as compelling as it was hateful united the three fallen goddesses, as to whom I would fain have learned by searching in some dictionary of social mythology through what gallant adventure, what sacrilegious presumption, they had incurred their punishment. Their common brilliance of origin, the common decay of their present state entered largely, no doubt, into the necessity which compelled them, while hating one another, to frequent one another\u2019s society. Besides, each of them found in the others a convenient way of being polite to her own guests. How should these fail to suppose that they had scaled the most inaccessible peak of the Faubourg when they were introduced to a lady with a string of titles whose sister was married to a Duc de Sagan or a Prince de Ligne? Especially as there was infinitely more in the newspapers about these sham salons than about the genuine ones. Indeed these old ladies\u2019 \u2018men about town\u2019 nephews \u2014 and Saint-Loup the foremost of them \u2014 when asked by a friend to introduce him to people, would answer at once \u201cI will take you to see my aunt Villeparisis,\u201d (or whichever it was) \u201cyou meet interesting people there.\u201d They knew very well that this would mean less trouble for themselves than trying to get the said friends invited by the smart nieces or sisters-in-law of these ladies. Certain very old men and young women who had heard it from those men, told me that if these ladies were no longer received in society it was because of the extraordinary irregularity of their conduct, which, when I objected that irregular conduct was not necessarily a barrier to social success, was represented to me as having gone far beyond anything that we know to-day. The misconduct of these solemn dames who held themselves so erect assumed on the lips of those who hinted at it something that I was incapable of imagining, proportionate to the magnitude of prehistoric days, to the age of the mammoth. In a word, these three Parcae with their white or blue or red locks had spun the fatal threads of an incalculable number of gentlemen. I felt that the people of to-day exaggerated the vices of those fabulous times, like the Greeks who created Icarus, Theseus, Heracles out of men who had been but little different from those who long afterwards deified them. But one does not tabulate the sum of a person\u2019s vices until he has almost ceased to be in a fit state to practise them, when from the magnitude of his social punishment, which is then nearing the completion of its term and which alone one can estimate, one measures, one imagines, one exaggerates that of the crime that has been committed. In that gallery of symbolical figures which is \u2018society,\u2019 the really light women, the true Messalinas, invariably present the solemn aspect of a lady of at least seventy, with an air of lofty distinction, who entertains everyone she can but not everyone she would like to have, to whose house women will never consent to go whose own conduct falls in any way short of perfection, to whom the Pope regularly sends his Golden Rose, and who as often as not has written \u2014 on the early days of Lamartine \u2014 an essay that has been crowned by the French Academy. \u201cHow d\u2019ye do, Alix?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis greeted the Marie-Antoinette lady, which lady cast a searching glance round the assembly to see whether there was not in this drawing-room any item that might be a valuable addition to her own, in which case she would have to discover it for herself, for Mme. de Villeparisis, she was sure, would be spiteful enough to try to keep it from her. Thus Mme. de Villeparisis took good care not to introduce Bloch to the old lady for fear of his being asked to produce the same play that he was arranging for her in the drawing-room of the Quai Malaquais. Besides it was only tit for tat. For, the evening before, the old lady had had Mme. Ristori, who had recited, and had taken care that Mme. de Villeparisis, from whom she had filched the Italian artist, should not hear of this function until it was over. So that she should not read it first in the newspapers and feel annoyed, the old lady had come ill nerson to tell her about it, shewing no sense of guilt. Mme. de Villeparisis, considering that an introduction of myself was not likely to have the same awkward results as that of Bloch, made me known to the Marie-Antoinette of the Quai Malaquais. The latter, who sought, by making the fewest possible movements, to preserve in her old age those lines, as of a Coysevox goddess, which had years ago charmed the young men of fashion and which spurious poets still celebrated in rhymed charades \u2014 and had acquired the habit of a lofty and compensating stiffness common to all those whom a personal degradation obliges to be continually making advances \u2014 just perceptibly lowered her head with a frigid majesty, and, turning the other way, took no more notice of me than if I had not existed. By this crafty attitude she seemed to be assuring Mme. de Villeparisis: \u201cYou see, I\u2019m nowhere near him; please understand that I\u2019m not interested \u2014 in any sense of the word, you old cat \u2014 in little boys.\u201d But when, twenty minutes later, she left the room, taking advantage of the general conversation, she slipped into my ear an invitation to come to her box the following Friday with another of the three, whose high-sounding name \u2014 she had been born a Choiseul, moreover \u2014 had a prodigious effect on me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI understand, sir, that you are thinkin\u2019 of writin\u2019 somethin\u2019 about Mme. la Duchesse de Montmorency,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the historian of the Fronde in that grudging tone which she allowed, quite unconsciously, to spoil the effect of her great and genuine kindness, a tone due to the shrivelling crossness, the sense of grievance that is a physiological accompaniment of age, as well as to the affectation of imitating the almost rustic speech of the old nobility: \u201cI\u2019m goin\u2019 to let you see her portrait, the original of the copy they have in the Louvre.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She rose, laying down her brushes beside the flowers, and the little apron which then came into sight at her waist, and which she wore so as not to stain her dress with paints, added still further to the impression of an old peasant given by her bonnet and her big spectacles, and offered a sharp contrast to the luxury of her appointments, the butler who had brought in the tea and cakes, the liveried footman for whom she now rang to light up the portrait of the Duchesse de Montmorency, Abbess of one of the most famous Chapters in the East of France. Everyone had risen. \u201cWhat is rather amusin\u2019,\u201d said our hostess, \u201cis that in these Chapters where our great-aunts were so often made Abbesses, the daughters of the King of France would not have been admitted. They were very close corporations.\u201d \u201cNot admit the King\u2019s daughters,\u201d cried Bloch in amazement, \u201cwhy ever not?\u201d \u201cWhy, because the House of France had not enough quartering after that low marriage.\u201d Bloch\u2019s bewilderment increased. \u201cA low marriage? The House of France? When was that?\u201d \u201cWhy, when they married into the Medicis,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis in the most natural manner. \u201cIt\u2019s a fine picture, ain\u2019t it, and in a perfect state of preservation,\u201d she added\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2018My dear,\u201d put in the Marie-Antoinette lady, \u201csurely you remember that when I brought Liszt to see you he said that it was this one that was the copy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should bow to any opinion of Liszt on music, but not on painthe Besides, he was quite off his head then, and I don\u2019t remember his ever saying anything of the sort. But it wasn\u2019t you that brought him here. I had met him any number of times at dinner at Princess Sayn-Wittgenstein\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alix\u2019s shot had missed fire; she stood silent, erect and motionless. Plastered with layers of powder, her face had the appearance of a face of stone. And, as the profile was noble, she seemed, on a triangular and moss-grown pedestal hidden by her cape, the time-worn stucco goddess of a park\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, I see another fine portrait,\u201d began the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The door opened and the Duchesse de Guermantes entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, how are you?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis greeted her without moving her head, taking from her apron-pocket a hand which she held out to the newcomer; and then ceasing at once to take any notice of her niece, in order to return to the historian: \u201cThat is the portrait of the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld. . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A young servant with a bold manner and a charming face (but so finely chiselled, to ensure its perfection, that the nose was a little red and the rest of the skin slightly flushed as though they were still smarting from the recent and sculptural incision) came in bearing a card on a salver\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is that gentleman who has been several times to see Mme. la Marquise.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you tell him I was at home?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe heard the voices.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, very well then, shew him in. It\u2019s a man who was introduced to me,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe told me he was very anxious to come to the house. I certainly never said he might. But here he\u2019s taken the trouble to call five times now; it doesn\u2019t do to hurt people\u2019s feelings. Sir,\u201d she went on to me, \u201cand you, Sir,\u201d to the historian of the Fronde, \u201clet me introduce my niece, the Duchesse de Guermantes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The historian made a low bow, as I did also, and since he seemed to suppose that some friendly remark ought to follow this salute, his eyes brightened and he was preparing to open his mouth when he was once more frozen by the sight of Mme. de Guermantes who had taken advantage of the independence of her torso to throw it forward with an exaggerated politeness and bring it neatly back to a position of rest without letting face or eyes appear to have noticed that anyone was standing before them; after breathing a gentle sigh she contented herself with manifesting the nullity of the impression that had been made on her by the sight of the historian and myself by performing certain movements of her nostrils with a precision that testified to the absolute inertia of her unoccupied attention\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importunate visitor entered the room, making straight for Mme. de Villeparisis with an ingenuous, fervent air: it was Legrandin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you so very much for letting me come and see you,\u201d he began, laying stress on the word \u2018very.\u2019 \u201cIt is a pleasure of a quality altogether rare and subtle that you confer on an old solitary; I assure you that its repercussion . . . \u201d He stopped short on catching sight of me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just shewing this gentleman a fine portrait of the Duchesse de La Rochefoucauld, the wife of the author of the Maxims; it\u2019s a family picture.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes meanwhile had greeted Alix, with apologies for not having been able, that year as in every previous year, to go and see her. \u201cI hear all about you from Madeleine,\u201d she added\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe was at luncheon with me to-day,\u201d said the Marquise of the Quai Malaquais, with the satisfying reflexion that Mme. de Villeparisis could never say that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile I had been talking to Bloch, and fearing, from what I had been told of his father\u2019s change of attitude towards him, that he might be envying my life, I said to him that his must be the happier of the two. My remark was prompted solely by my desire to be friendly. But such friendliness readily convinces those who cherish a high opinion of themselves of their own good fortune, or gives them a desire to convince other people. \u201cYes, I do lead a delightful existence,\u201d Bloch assured me with a beatified smile. \u201cI have three great friends; I do not wish for one more; an adorable mistress; I am infinitely happy. Rare is the mortal to whom Father Zeus accords so much felicity.\u201d I fancy that he was anxious principally to extol himself and to make me envious. Perhaps too there was some desire to shew originality in his optimism. It was evident that he did not wish to reply in the commonplace phraseology that everybody uses: \u201cOh, it was nothing, really,\u201d and so forth, when, to my question: \u201cWas it a good show?\u201d put with regard to an afternoon dance at his house to which I had been prevented from going, he replied in a level, careless tone, as if the dance had been given by some one else: \u201cWhy, yes, it was quite a good show, couldn\u2019t have been better. It was really charming!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat you have just told us interests me enormously,\u201d said Legrandin to Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cfor I was saying to myself only the other day that you shewed a marked likeness to him in the clear-cut turn of your speech, in a quality which I will venture to describe by two contradictory terms, monumental rapidity and immortal instantaneousness. I should have liked this afternoon to take down all the things you say; but I shall remember them. They are, in a phrase which comes, I think, from Joubert, friends of the memery. You have never read Joubert? Oh! he would have admired you so! I will take the liberty this evening of sending you a set of him, it is a privilege to make you a present of his mind. He had not your strength. But he had a great deal of charm all the same.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would have gone up to Legrandin at once and spoken to him, but he kept as far away from me as he could, no doubt in the hope that I might not overhear the stream of flattery which, with a remarkable felicity of expression, he kept pouring out, whatever the topic, to Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She shrugged her shoulders, smiling, as though he had been trying to make fun of her, and turned to the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd this is the famous Marie de Rohan, Duchesse de Chevreuse, who was married first of all to M. de Luynes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear, speaking of Mme. de Luynes reminds me of Yolande; she came to me yesterday evening, and if I had known that you weren\u2019t engaged I\u2019d have sent round to ask you to come. Mme. Ristori turned up quite by chance, and recited some poems by Queen Carmen Sylva in the author\u2019s presence. It was too beautiful!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat treachery!\u201d thought Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cOf course that was what she was whispering about the other day to Mme. de Beaulaincourt and Mme. de Chaponay. I had no engagement,\u201d she replied, \u201cbut I should not have come. I heard Ristori in her great days, she\u2019s a mere wreck now. Besides I detest Carmen Sylva\u2019s poetry. Ristori came here once, the Duchess of Aosta brought her, to recite a canto of the Inferno, by Dante. In that sort of thing she\u2019s incomparable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alix bore the blow without flinching. She remained marble. Her gaze was piercing and blank, her nose proudly arched. But the surface of one cheek was scaling. A faint, strange vegetation, green and pink, was invading her chin. Perhaps another winter would level her with the dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNow, sir, if you are fond of painting, look at the portrait of Mme, de Montmorency,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis said to Legrandin, to stop the flow of compliments which was beginning again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seizing her opportunity, while his back was turned, Mme. de Guermantes pointed to him, with an ironical, questioning look at her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s M. Legrandin,\u201d murmured Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201che has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer, not that that conveys any more to you than it does to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! Oh, but I know her quite well!\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes, and put her hand over her lips. \u201cThat is to say, I don\u2019t know her, but for some reason or other Basin, who meets the husband heaven knows where, took it into his head to tell the wretched woman she might call on me. And she did. I can\u2019t tell you what it was like. She informed me that she had been to London, and gave me a complete catalogue of all the things in the British Museum. And this very day, the moment I leave your house, I\u2019m going, just as you see me now, to drop a card on the monster. And don\u2019t for a moment suppose that it\u2019s an easy thing to do. On the pretence that she\u2019s dying of some disease she\u2019s always at home, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you arrive at seven at night or nine in the morning, she\u2019s ready for you with a dish of strawberry tarts\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, but seriously, you know, she is a monstrosity,\u201d Mme. de Guermantes replied to a questioning glance from her aunt. \u201cShe\u2019s an impossible person, she talks about \u2018plumitives\u2019 and things like that.\u201d \u201cWhat does \u2018plumitive\u2019 mean?\u201d asked Mme. de Villeparisis. \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest idea!\u201d cried the Duchess in mock indignation. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t speak that sort of language.\u201d And seeing that her aunt really did not know what a plumitive was, to give herself the satisfaction of shewing that she was a scholar as well as a purist, and to make fun of her aunt, now, after making fun of Mme. de Cambremer: \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d she said, with a half-laugh which the last traces of her pretended ill humour kept in check, \u201ceverybody knows what it means; a plumitive is a writer, a person who holds a pen. But it\u2019s a dreadful word. It\u2019s enough to make your wisdom teeth drop out. Nothing will ever make me use words like that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd so that\u2019s the brother, is it? I hadn\u2019t realized that yet. But after all it\u2019s not inconceivable. She has the same doormat docility and the same mass of information like a circulating library. She\u2019s just as much of a flatterer as he is, and just as boring. Yes, I\u2019m beginning to see the family likeness now quite plainly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSit down, we\u2019re just going to take a dish of tea,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to her niece. \u201cHelp yourself; you don\u2019t want to look at the pictures of your great-grandmothers, you know them as well as I do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Presently Mme. de Villeparisis sat down again at her desk and went on with her painting. The rest of the party gathered round her, and I took the opportunity to go up to Legrandin and, seeing no harm myself in his presence in Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s drawing-room and never dreaming how much my words would at once hurt him and make him believe that I had deliberately intended to hurt him, say: \u201cWell, sir, I am almost excused for coming to a tea-party when I find you here too.\u201d M. Legrandin concluded from this speech (at least this was the opinion which he expressed of me a few days later) that I was a thoroughly spiteful little wretch who delighted only in doing mischief\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou might at least have the civility to begin by saying how d\u2019ye do to me,\u201d he replied, without offering me his hand and in a coarse and angry voice which I had never suspected him of possessing, a voice which bearing no traceable relation to what he ordinarily said did bear another more immediate and striking relation to something that he was feeling at the moment. What happens is that since we are determined always to keep our feelings to ourselves, we have never given any thought to the manner in which we should express them. And suddenly there is within us a strange and obscene animal making its voice heard, the tones of which may inspire as much terror in the listener who receives the involuntary elliptical irresistible communication of our defect or vice as would the sudden avowal indirectly and uncouthly proffered by a criminal who can no longer refrain from confessing a murder of which one had never imagined him to be guilty. I knew, of course, that idealism, even subjective idealism, did not prevent great philosophers from still having hearty appetites or from presenting themselves with untiring perseverance for election to the Academy. But really Legrandin had no occasion to remind people so often that he belonged to another planet when all his convulsive movements of anger or affability were governed by the desire to occupy a good position on this\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNaturally, when people pester me twenty times on end to go anywhere,\u201d he went on in lower tones, \u201calthough I am perfectly free to do what I choose, still I can\u2019t behave like an absolute boor.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes had sat down. Her name, accompanied as it was by her title, added to her corporeal dimensions the duchy which projected itself round about her and brought the shadowy, sun-splashed coolness of the woods of Guermantes into this drawing-room, to surround the tuffet on which she was sitting. I felt surprised only that the likeness of those woods was not more discernible on the face of the Duchess, about which there was nothing suggestive of vegetation, and at the most the ruddy discolouration of her cheeks \u2014 which ought rather, surely, to have been emblazoned with the name Guermantes \u2014 was the effect, but did not furnish a picture of long gallops in the open air. Later on, when she had ceased to interest me, I came to know many of the Duchess\u2019s peculiarities, notably (to speak for the moment only of that one of which I already at this time felt the charm though without yet being able to discover what it was) her eyes, in which was held captive as in a picture the blue sky of an afternoon in France, broadly expansive, bathed in light even when no sun shone; and a voice which one would have thought, from its first hoarse sounds, to be almost plebeian, through which there trailed, as over the steps of the church at Combray or the pastry-cook\u2019s in the square, the rich and lazy gold of a country sun. But on this first day I discerned nothing, the warmth of my attention volatilised at once the little that I might otherwise have been able to extract from her, in which I should have found some indication of the name Guermantes. In any case, I told myself that it was indeed she who was designated for all the world by the title Duchesse de Guermantes: the inconceivable life which that name signified, this body did indeed contain; it had just introduced that life into a crowd of different creatures, in this room which enclosed it on every side and on which it produced so violent a reaction that I thought I could see, where the extent of that mysterious life ceased, a fringe of effervescence outline its frontiers: round the circumference of the circle traced on the carpet by the balloon of her blue pekin skirt, and in the bright eyes of the Duchess at the point of intersection of the preoccupations, the memories, the incomprehensible, scornful, amused and curious thoughts which filled them from within and the outside images that were reflected on their surface. Perhaps I should have been not quite so deeply stirred had I met her at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s at an evening party, instead of seeing her thus on one of the Marquise\u2019s \u2018days,\u2019 at one of those tea-parties which are for women no more than a brief halt in the course of their afternoon\u2019s outing, when, keeping on the hats in which they have been driving through the streets, they waft into the close atmosphere of a drawing-room the quality of the fresh air outside, and give one a better view of Paris in the late afternoon than do the tall, open windows through which one can hear the bowling wheels of their victorias: Mme. de Guermantes wore a boating-hat trimmed with cornflowers, and what they recalled to me was not, among the tilled fields round Combray where I had so often gathered those flowers, on the slope adjoining the Tansonville hedge, the suns of bygone years; it was the scent and dust of twilight as they had been an hour ago, when Mme. de Guermantes drove through them, in the Rue de la Paix. With a smiling, disdainful, vague air, and a grimace on her pursed lips, with the point of her sunshade, as with the extreme tip of an antenna of her mysterious life, she was tracing circles on the carpet; then, with that indifferent attention which begins by eliminating every point of contact with what one is actually studying, her gaze fastened upon each of us in turn; then inspected the sofas and armchairs, but softened this time by that human sympathy which is aroused by the presence, however insignificant, of a thing one knows, a thing that is almost a person; these pieces of furniture were not like us, they belonged vaguely to her world, they were bound up with the life of her aunt; then from the Beauvais furniture her gaze was carried back to the person sitting on it, and resumed then the same air of perspicacity and that same disapproval which the respect that Mme. de Guermantes felt for her aunt would have prevented her from expressing in words, but which she would obviously have felt had she discovered on the chairs, instead of our presence, that of a spot of grease or a layer of dust\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That admirable writer G\u2014\u2014-entered the room; he had come to pay a call on Mme. de Villeparisis which he regarded as a tiresome duty. The Duchess, although delighted to see him again, gave him no sign of welcome, but instinctively he made straight for her, the charm that she possessed, her tact, her simplicity making him look upon her as a woman of exceptional intelligence. He was bound, moreover, in common politeness to go and talk to her, for, since he was a pleasant and a distinguished man, Mme. de Guermantes frequently invited him to luncheon even when there were only her husband and herself besides, or in the autumn to Guermantes, making use of this intimacy to have him to dinner occasionally with Royalties who were curious to meet him. For the Duchess liked to entertain certain eminent men, on condition always that they were bachelors, a condition which, even when married, they invariably fulfilled for her, for, as their wives, who were bound to be more or less common, would have been a blot on a drawing-room in which there were never any but the most fashionable beauties in Paris, it was always without them that their husbands were invited; and the Duke, to avoid hurting any possible susceptibility, used to explain to these involuntary widowers that the Duchess never had women in the house, could not endure feminine society, almost as though this had been under doctor\u2019s orders, and as be might have said that she could not stay in a room in which there were smells, or eat salt food, or travel with her back to the engine, or wear stays. It was true that these eminent men used to see at the Guermantes\u2019 the Princesse de Parme, the Princesse de Sagan (whom Fran\u00e7oise, hearing her constantly mentioned, had taken to calling, in the belief that this feminine, ending was required by the laws of accidence, \u2018the Sagante\u2019), and plenty more, but their presence was accounted for by the explanation that they were relatives, or such very old friends that it was impossible to exclude them. Whether or not they were convinced by the explanations which the Due de Guermantes had given of the singular malady that made it impossible for the Duchess to associate with other women, the great men duly transmitted them to their wives. Some of these thought that this malady was only an excuse to cloak her jealousy, because the Duchess wished to reign alone over a court of worshippers. Others more simple still thought that perhaps the Duchess had some peculiar habit, a scandalous past it might be, that women did not care to go to her house and that she gave the name of a whim to what was stern necessity. The better among them, hearing their husbands expatiate on the Duchess\u2019s marvellous brain, assumed that She must be so far superior to the rest of womankind that she found their Society boring since they could not talk intelligently about anything. And it was true that the Duchess was bored by other women, if their princely rank did not render them specially interesting. But the excluded wives were mistaken when they imagined that she chose to entertain men alone in order to be free to discuss with them literature, science and philosophy. For she never referred to these, at least with the great intellectuals. If, by virtue of a family tradition such as makes the daughters of great soldiers preserve, in the midst of their most frivolous distractions a respect for military matters, she, the granddaughter of women who had been on terms of friendship with Thiers, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Augier, felt that a place must always be kept in her drawing-room for men of intellect, she had on the other hand derived from the manner, at once condescending and intimate, in which those famous men had been received at Guermantes the foible of looking on men of talent as family friends whose talent does not dazzle one, to whom one does not speak of their work, and who would not be at all interested if one did. Moreover the type of mind illustrated by M\u00e9rim\u00e9e and Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy, which was hers also, led her by reaction from the verbal sentimentality of an earlier generation to a style in conversation that rejects everything to do with fine language and the expression of lofty thoughts, so that she made it a sort of element of good breeding when she was with a poet or a musician to talk only of the food that they were eating or the game of cards to which they would afterwards sit down. This abstention had, on a third person not conversant with her ways, a disturbing effect which amounted to mystification. Mme. de Guermantes having asked him whether it would amuse him to come to luncheon to meet this or that famous poet, devoured by curiosity he would arrive at the appointed hour. The Duchess was talking to the poet about the weather. They sat down to luncheon. \u201cDo you like this way of doing eggs?\u201d she asked the poet. On hearing his approval, which she shared, for everything in her own house appeared to her exquisite, including a horrible cider which she imported from Guermantes: \u201cGive Monsieur some more eggs,\u201d she would tell the butler, while the anxious fellow-guest sat waiting for what must surely have been the object of the party, since they had arranged to meet, in spite of every sort of difficulty, before the Duchess, the poet and he himself left Paris. But the meal went on, one after another the courses were cleared away, not without having first provided Mme. de Guermantes with opportunities for clever witticisms or apt stories. Meanwhile the poet went on eating, and neither Duke nor Duchess shewed any sign of remembering that he was a poet. And presently the luncheon came to an end and the party broke up, without a word having been said about the poetry which, for all that, everyone admired but to which, by a reserve analogous to that of which Swann had given me a foretaste, no one might refer. This reserve was simply a matter of good form. But for the fellow-guest, if he thought at all about the matter, there was something strangely melancholy about it all, and these meals in the Guermantes household made him think of the hours which timid lovers often spend together in talking trivialities until it is time to part, without \u2014 whether from shyness, from audacity or from awkwardness \u2014 the great secret which they would have been happier had they confessed ever succeeding in passing from their hearts to their lips. It must, however, be added that this silence with regard to the serious matters which one was always waiting in vain to see approached, if it might pass as characteristic of the Duchess, was by no means constant with her. Mme. de Guermantes had spent her girlhood in a society somewhat different, equally aristocratic but less brilliant and above all less futile than that in which she now lived, and one of wide culture. It had left beneath her present frivolity a sort of bed-rock of greater solidity, invisibly nutritious, to which indeed the Duchess would repair in search (very rarely, though, for she detested pedantry) of some quotation from Victor Hugo or Lamartine which, extremely appropriate, uttered with a look of true feeling from her fine eyes, never failed to surprise and charm her audience. Sometimes, even, without any pretence of authority, pertinently and quite simply, she would give some dramatist and Academician a piece of sage advice, would make him modify a situation or alter an ending\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If, in the drawing-room of Mme. de Villeparisis, just as in the church at Combray, on the day of Mlle. Percepied\u2019s wedding, I had difficulty in discovering, in the handsome, too human face of Mme. de Guermantes the unknown element of her name, I at least thought that, when she spoke, her conversation, profound, mysterious, would have a strangeness as of a mediaeval tapestry or a gothic window. But in order that I should not be disappointed by the words which I should hear uttered by a person who called herself Mme. de Guermantes, even if I had not been in love with her, it would not have sufficed that those words were fine, beautiful and profound, they would have had to reflect that amaranthine colour of the closing syllable of her name, that colour which I had on my first sight of her been disappointed not to find in her person and had driven to take refuge in her mind. Of course I had already heard Mme. de Villeparisis, Saint-Loup, people whose intelligence was in no way extraordinary, pronounce without any precaution this name Guermantes, simply as that of a person who was coming to see them or with whom they had promised to dine, without seeming to feel that there were latent in her name the glow of yellowing woods in autumn and a whole mysterious tract of country. But this must have been an affectation on their part, as when the classic poets give us no warning of the profound purpose which they had, all the same, in writing, an affectation which I myself also strove to imitate, saying in the most natural tone: \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes,\u201d as though it were a name that was just like other names. And then everybody assured me that she was a highly intelligent woman, a clever talker, that she was one of a little group of most interesting people: words which became accomplices of my dream. For when they spoke of an intelligent group, of clever talk, it was not at all the sort of intelligence that I knew that I imagined, not even that of the greatest minds, it was not at all with men like Bergotte that I peopled this group. No, by intelligence I understood an ineffable faculty gilded by the sun, impregnated with a sylvan coolness. Indeed, had she made the most intelligent remarks (in the sense in which I understood the word when it was used of a philosopher or critic), Mme. de Guermantes would perhaps have disappointed even more keenly my expectation of so special a faculty than if, in the course of a trivial conversation, she had confined herself to discussing kitchen recipes or the furnishing of a country house, to mentioning the names of neighbours and relatives of her own, which would have given me a picture of her life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI thought I should find Basin here, he was meaning to come and see you to-day,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t set eyes on your husband for some days,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis in a somewhat nettled tone. \u201cIn fact, I haven\u2019t seen him.\u2019 well, I have seen him once, perhaps \u2014 since that charming joke he played on me of making my servants announce him as the Queen of Sweden.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes formed a smile by contracting the corners of her mouth as though she were biting her veil\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe met her at dinner last night at Blanche Leroi\u2019s. You wouldn\u2019t know her now, she\u2019s positively enormous; I\u2019m sure she must have something the matter with her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was just telling these gentlemen that you said she looked like a frog,\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes uttered a sort of raucous sound intended to signify that she acknowledged the compliment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t remember making such a charming comparison, but if she was one before, now she\u2019s the frog that has succeeded in swelling to the size of the ox. Or rather, it isn\u2019t quite that, because all her swelling is concentrated in front of her waist, she\u2019s more like a frog in an interesting condition.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh, that is quite clever,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, secretly proud that her guests should be witnessing this display of her niece\u2019s wit\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is purely arbitrary, though,\u201d answered Mme. de Guermantes, ironically detaching this selected epithet, as Swann would have done, \u201cfor I must admit I never saw a frog in the family way. Anyhow, the frog in question, who, by the way, is not asking for a king, for I never saw her so skittish as she\u2019s been since her husband died, is coming to dine with us one day next week. I promised I\u2019d let you know in good time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis gave vent to a confused growl, from which emerged: \u201cI know she was dining with the Mecklenburgs the night before last. Hannibal de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was there. He came and told me about it, and was quite amusing, I must say.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere was a man there who\u2019s a great deal wittier than Babal,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes who, in view of her close friendship wih M. de Br\u00e9\u00e0ut\u00e9-Consalvi, felt that she must advertise their intimacy by the use of this abbreviation. \u201cI mean M. Bergotte.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had never imagined that Bergotte could be regarded as witty; in fact, I thought of him always as mingling with the intellectual section of humanity, that is to say infinitely remote from that mysterious realm of which I had caught a glimpse through the purple hangings of a theatre box, behind which, making the Duchess smile, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 was holding with her, in the language of the gods, that unimaginable thing, a conversation between people of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. I was stupefied to see the balance upset, and Bergotte rise above M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. But above all I was dismayed to think that I had avoided Bergotte on the evening of Ph\u00e8dre, that I had not gone up and spoken to him, when I heard Mme. de Guermantes say to Mme. de Villeparisis:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is the only person I have any wish to know,\u201d went on the Duchess, in whom one could always, as at the turn of a mental tide, see the flow of curiosity with regard to well-known intellectuals sweep over the ebb of her aristocratic snobbishness. \u201cIt would be such a pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The presence of Bergotte by my side, which it would have been so easy for we to secure but which I had thought liable to give Mme. de Guermantes a bad impression of myself, would no doubt, on the contrary, have had the result that she would have signalled to me to join her in her box, and would have invited me to bring the eminent writer, one day, to luncheon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI gather that he didn\u2019t behave very well, he was presented to M. de Cobourg, and never uttered a word to him,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes, dwelling on this odd characteristic as she might have recounted that a Chinaman had blown his nose on a sheet of paper. \u201cHe never once said \u2018Monseigneur\u2019 to him,\u201d she added, with an air of amusement at this detail, as important to her mind as the refusal of a Protestant, during an audience with the Pope, to go on his knees before his Holiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Interested by these idiosyncrasies of Bergotte, she did not, however, appear to consider them reprehensible, and seemed rather to find a certain merit in them, though she would have been put to it to say of what sort. Despite this unusual mode of appreciating Bergotte\u2019s originality, it was a fact which I was later oh not to regard as wholly negligible that Mme. de Guermantes, greatly to the surprise of many of her friends, did consider Bergotte more witty than M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9. Thus it is that such judgments, subversive, isolated, and yet after all just, are delivered in the world of fashion by those rare minds that are superior to the rest. And they sketch then the first rough outlines of the hierarchy of values as the next generation will establish it, instead of abiding eternally by the old standards\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Comte d\u2019Argencourt, Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires at the Belgian Legation and a remote connexion of Mme. de Villeparisis, came limping in, followed presently by two young men, the Baron de Guermantes and H. H. the Due de Ch\u00e2tellerault, whom Mme. de Guermantes greeted with: \u201cHow d\u2019ye do, young Ch\u00e2tellerault,\u201d in a careless tone and without moving from her tuffet, for she was a great friend of the young Duke\u2019s mother, which had given him a deep and lifelong respect for her. Tall, slender, with golden hair and sunny complexions, thoroughly of the Guermantes type, these two young men looked like a condensation of the light of the spring evening which was flooding the spacious room. Following a custom which was the fashion at that time they laid their silk hats on the floor, by their feet. The historian of the Fronde thought that they were embarrassed, like a peasant coming into the mayor\u2019s office and not knowing what to do with his hat. Feeling that he ought in charity to come to the rescue of the awkwardness and timidity which he ascribed to them:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t leave them on the floor, they\u2019ll be trodden on.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A glance from the Baron de Guermantes, tilting the plane of his pupils, shot suddenly from them a wave of pure and piercing azure which froze the well-meaning historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat is that person\u2019s name?\u201d I was asked by the Baron, who had just been introduced to me by Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM. Pierre,\u201d I whispered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPierre what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPierre: it\u2019s his name, he\u2019s a historian, a most distinguished man.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally? You don\u2019t say so.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, it\u2019s a new fashion with these young men to put their hats on the floor,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis explained. \u201cI\u2019m like you, I can never get used to it. Still, it\u2019s better than my nephew Robert, who always leaves his in the hall. I tell him when I see him come in that he looks just like a clock-maker, and I ask him if he\u2019s come to wind the clocks.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou were speaking just now, Madame la Marquise, of M. Mole\u2019s hat; we shall soon be able, like Aristotle, to compile a chapter on hats,\u201d said the historian of the Fronde, somewhat reassured by Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s intervention, but in so faint a voice that no one but myself overheard him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe really is astonishing, the little Duchess,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt, pointing to Mme. de Guermantes who was talking to G\u2014\u2014. \u201cWhenever there\u2019s a famous man in the room you\u2019re sure to find him sitting with her. Evidently that must be the lion of the party over there. It can\u2019t always be M. de Borelli, of course, or M. Schlumberger or M. d\u2019Avenel. But then it\u2019s bound to be M. Pierre Loti or M. Edmond Rostand. Yesterday evening at the Doudeauvilles\u2019, where by the way she was looking splendid in her emerald tiara and a pink dress with a long train, she had M. Deschanel on one side and the German Ambassador on the other: she was holding forth to them about China; the general public, at a respectful distance where they couldn\u2019t hear what was being said, were wondering whether there wasn\u2019t going to be war. Really, you\u2019d have said she was a Queen, holding her circle.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everyone had gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her painting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThose flowers are a truly celestial pink,\u201d said Legrandin, \u201cI should say sky-pink. For there is such a thing as sky-pink just as there is sky-blue. But,\u201d he lowered his voice in the hope that he would not be heard by anyone but the Marquise, \u201cI think I shall still give my vote to the silky, living flesh tint of your rendering of them. You leave Pisanello and Van Huysun a long way behind, with their laborious, dead herbals.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An artist, however modest, is always willing to hear himself preferred to his rivals, and tries only to see that justice is done them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat makes you think that is that they painted the flowers of their period, which we don\u2019t have now, but they did it with great skill.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! The flowers of their period! That is a most ingenious theory,\u201d exclaimed Legrandin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see you\u2019re painting some fine cherry blossoms \u2014 or are they may-flowers?\u201d began the historian of the Fronde, not without hesitation as to the flower, but with a note of confidence in his voice, for he was beginning to forget the incident of the hats\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; they\u2019re apple blossom,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, addressing her aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I see you\u2019re a good countrywoman like me; you can tell one flower from another.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy yes, so they are! But I thought the season for apple blossom was over now,\u201d said the historian, seeking wildly to cover his mistake\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh dear, no; far from it, it\u2019s not out yet; the trees won\u2019t be in blossom for another fortnight, not for three weeks perhaps,\u201d said the librarian who, since he helped with the management of Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s estates, was better informed upon country matters\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt least three weeks,\u201d put in the Duchess; \u201ceven round Paris, where they\u2019re very far forward. Down in Normandy, don\u2019t you know, at his father\u2019s place,\u201d she went on, pointing to the young Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault, \u201cwhere they have some splendid apple trees close to the seashore, like a Japanese screen, they\u2019re never really pink until after the twentieth of May.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI never see them,\u201d said the young Duke, \u201cbecause they give me hay fever. Such a bore.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHay fever? I never heard of that before,\u201d said the historian\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s the fashionable complaint just now,\u201d the librarian informed him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat all depends, you won\u2019t get it at all, probably, if it\u2019s a good year for apples. You know Le Normand\u2019s saying: \u2018When it\u2019s a good year for apples . . . \u2019,\u201d put in M. d\u2019Argencourt who, not being really French, was always trying to give himself a Parisian air\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re quite right,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis told her niece, \u201cthese are from the South. It was a florist who sent them round and asked me to accept them as a present. You\u2019re surprised, I dare say, Monsieur Valm\u00e8re,\u201d she turned to the librarian, \u201cthat a florist should make me a present of apple blossom. Well, I may be an old woman, but I\u2019m not quite on the shelf yet, I have still a few friends,\u201d she went on with a smile that might have been taken as a sign of her simple nature but meant rather, I could not help feeling, that she thought it effective to pride herself on the friendship of a mere florist when she moved in such distinguished circles\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch rose and went over to look at the flowers which Mme. de Villeparisis was painting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNever mind, Marquise,\u201d said the historian, sitting down again, \u201ceven though we should have another of those Revolutions which have stained so many pages of our history with blood \u2014 and, upon my soul, in these days one can never tell,\u201d he added, with a circular and circumspect glance, as though to make sure that there was no \u2018disaffected\u2019 person in the room, though he had not the least suspicion that there actually was, \u201cwith a talent like yours and your five languages you would be certain to get on all right.\u201d The historian of the Fronde was feeling quite refreshed, for he had forgotten his insomnia. But he suddenly remembered that he had not slept for the last six nights, whereupon a crushing weariness, born of his mind, paralysed his limbs, made him bow his shoulders, and his melancholy face began to droop like an old man\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch tried to express his admiration in an appropriate gesture, but only succeeded in knocking over with his elbow the glass containing the spray of apple blossom, and all the water was spilled on the carpet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cReally, you have the fingers of a fairy,\u201d went on (to the Marquise) the historian who, having his back turned to me at that moment, had not noticed Bloch\u2019s clumsiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Bloch took this for a sneer at himself, and to cover his shame in insolence retorted: \u201cIt\u2019s not of the slightest importance; I\u2019m not wet.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis rang the bell and a footman came to wipe the carpet and pick up the fragments of glass. She invited the two young men to her theatricals, and also Mme. de Guermantes, with the injunction:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRemember to tell Gis\u00e8le and Berthe\u201d (the Duchesses d\u2019Auberjon and de Portefin) \u201cto be here a little before two to help me,\u201d as she might have told the hired waiters to come early to arrange the tables\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She treated her princely relatives, as she treated M. de Norpois, without any of the little courtesies which she shewed to the historian, Cottard, Bloch and myself, and they seemed to have no interest for her beyond the possibility of serving them up as food for our social curiosity. This was because she knew that she need not put herself out to entertain people for whom she was not a more or less brilliant woman but the touchy old sister \u2014 who needed and received tactful handling \u2014 of their father or uncle. There would have been no object in her trying to shine before them, she could never have deceived them as to the strength and weakness of her position, for they knew (none so well) her whole history and respected the illustrious race from which she sprang. But, above all, they had ceased to be anything more for her than a dead stock which would not bear fruit again, they would not let her know their new friends, or share their pleasures. She could obtain from them only their occasional presence, or the possibility of speaking of them, at her five o\u2019clock tea-parties as, later on, in her Memoirs, of which these parties were only a sort of rehearsal, a preliminary reading aloud of the manuscript before a selected audience. And the society which all these noble kinsmen and kinswomen served to interest, to dazzle, to enthral, the society of the Cottards, of the Blochs, of the dramatists who were in the public eye at the moment, of the historians of the Fronde and such matters; it was in this society that there existed for Mme. de Villeparisis \u2014 failing that section of the fashionable world which did not call upon her \u2014 the movement, the novelty, all the entertainment of life, it was from people like these that she was able to derive social benefits (which made it well worth her while to let them meet, now and then, though without ever coming to know her, the Duchesse de Guermantes), dinners with remarkable men whose work had interested her, a light opera or a pantomime staged complete by its author in her drawing-room, boxes for interesting shows. Bloch got up to go. He had said aloud that the incident of the broken flower-glass was of no importance, but what he said to himself was different, more different still what he thought: \u201cIf people can\u2019t train their servants to put flowers where they won\u2019t be knocked over and wet their guests and probably cut their hands, it\u2019s much better not to go in for such luxuries,\u201d he muttered angrily. He was one of those susceptible, highly strung persons who cannot bear to think of themselves as having made a blunder which, though they do not admit even to themselves that they have made it, is enough to spoil their whole day. In a black rage, he was just making up his mind never to go into society again. He had reached the point at which some distraction was imperative. Fortunately in another minute Mme. de Villeparisis was to press him to stay. Either because she was aware of the general feeling among her friends, and had noticed the tide of anti-semitism that was beginning to rise, or simply from carelessness, she had not introduced him to any of the people in the room. He, however, being little used to society, felt bound before leaving the room to take leave of them all, to shew his manners, but without any friendliness; he lowered his head several times, buried his bearded chin in his collar, scrutinised each of the party in turn through his glasses with a cold, dissatisfied glare. But Mme. de Villeparisis stopped him; she had still to discuss with him the little play which was to be performed in her house, and also she did not wish him to leave before he had had the pleasure of meeting M. de Norpois (whose failure to appear puzzled her), although as an inducement to Bloch this introduction was quite superfluous, he having already decided to persuade the two actresses whose names he had mentioned to her to come and sing for nothing in the Marquise\u2019s drawing-room, to enhance their own reputations, at one of those parties to which all that was best and noblest in Europe thronged. He had even offered her, in addition, a tragic actress \u2018with pure eyes, fair as Hera,\u2019 who would recite lyrical prose with a sense of plastic beauty. But On hearing this lady\u2019s name Mme. de Villeparisis had declined, for it was that of Saint-Loup\u2019s mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have better news,\u201d she murmured in my ear. \u201cI really believe he\u2019s quite cooled off now, and that before very long they\u2019ll be parted \u2014 in spite of an officer who has played an abominable part in the whole business,\u201d she added. For Robert\u2019s family were beginning to look with a deadly hatred on M. de Borodino, who had given him leave, at the hairdresser\u2019s instance, to go to Bruges, and accused him of giving countenance to an infamous intrigue. \u201cIt\u2019s really too bad of him,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis with that virtuous accent common to all the Guermantes, even the most depraved. \u201cToo, too bad,\u201d she repeated, giving the word a trio of t\u2019s. One felt that she had no doubt of the Prince\u2019s being present at all their orgies. But, as kindness of heart was the old lady\u2019s dominant quality, her expression of frowning severity towards the horrible captain, whose name she articulated with an ironical emphasis: \u201cThe Prince de Borodino!\u201d\u2014 speaking as a woman for whom the Empire simply did not count, melted into a gentle smile at myself with a mechanical twitch of the eyelid indicating a vague understanding between us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have a great admiration for de Saint-Loup-en-Bray,\u201d said Bloch, \u201cdirty dog as he is, because he\u2019s so extremely well-bred. I have a great admiration, not for him but for well-bred people, they\u2019re so rare,\u201d he went on, without thinking, since he was himself so extremely ill-bred, what offence his words were giving. \u201cI will give you an example which I consider most striking of his perfect breeding. I met him once with a young gentleman just as he was about to spring into his wheeled chariot, after he himself had buckled their splendid harness on a pair of steeds, whose mangers were heaped with oats and barley, who had no need of the flashing whip to urge them on. He introduced us, but I did not catch the gentleman\u2019s name; one never does catch people\u2019s names when one\u2019s introduced to them,\u201d he explained with a laugh, this being one of his father\u2019s witticisms. \u201cDe Saint-Loup-en-Bray was perfectly calm, made no fuss about the young gentleman, seemed absolutely at his ease. Well, I found out, by pure chance, a day or two later, that the young gentleman was the son of Sir Rufus Israels!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The end of this story sounded less shocking than its preface, for it remained quite incomprehensible to everyone in the room. The fact was that Sir Rufus Israels, who seemed to Bloch and his father an almost royal personage before whom Saint-Loup ought to tremble, was in the eyes of the Guermantes world a foreign upstart, tolerated in society, on whose friendship nobody would ever have dreamed of priding himself, far from it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI learned this,\u201d Bloch informed us, \u201cfrom the person who holds Sir Rufus\u2019s power of attorney; he is a friend of my father, and quite an extraordinary man. Oh, an absolutely wonderful individual,\u201d he assured us with that affirmative energy, that note of enthusiasm which one puts only into those convictions that did not originate with oneself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me,\u201d Bloch went on, lowering his voice, to myself, \u201chow much do you suppose Saint-Loup has? Not that it matters to me in the least, you quite understand, don\u2019t you. I\u2019m interested from the Balzacian point of view. You don\u2019t happen to know what it\u2019s in, French stocks, foreign stocks, or land or what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could give him no information whatsoever. Suddenly raising his voice, Bloch asked if he might open the windows, and without waiting for an answer, went across the room to do so. Mme. de Villeparisis protested that he must not, that she had a cold. \u201cOf course, if it\u2019s bad for you!\u201d Bloch was downcast. \u201cBut you can\u2019t say it\u2019s not hot in here.\u201d And breaking into a laugh he put into the gaze with which he swept the room an appeal for support against Mme. de Villeparisis. He received none, from these well-bred people. His blazing eyes, having failed to seduce any of the guests from their allegiance, faded with resignation to their normal gravity of expression; he acknowledged his defeat with: \u201cWhat\u2019s the temperature? Seventy-two, at least, I should say. I\u2019m not surprised. I\u2019m simply dripping. And I have not, like the sage Antenor, son of the river Aipheus, the power to plunge myself in the paternal wave to stanch my sweat before laying my body in a bath of polished marble and anointing my limbs with fragrant oils.\u201d And with that need which people feel to outline for the use of others medical theories the application of which would be beneficial to their own health: \u201cWell, if you believe it\u2019s good for you! I must say, I think you\u2019re quite wrong. It\u2019s exactly what gives you your cold.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch was overjoyed at the idea of meeting M. de Norpois. He would like, he told us, to get him to talk about the Dreyfus case. \u201cThere\u2019s a mentality at work there which I don\u2019t altogether understand, and it would be quite sensational to get an interview out of this eminent diplomat,\u201d he said in a tone of sarcasm, so as not to appear to be rating himself below the Ambassador\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis was sorry that he had said this so loud, but minded less when she saw that the librarian, whose strong Nationalist views kept her, so to speak, on leash, was too far off to have overheard. She was more shocked to hear Bloch, led on by that demon of ill-breeding which made him permanently blind to the consequences of what he said, inquiring, with a laugh at the paternal pleasantry: \u201cHaven\u2019t I read a learned treatise by him in which he sets forth a string of irrefutable arguments to prove that the Japanese war was bound to end in a Russian victory and a Japanese defeat? He\u2019s fairly paralytic now, isn\u2019t he? I\u2019m sure he\u2019s the old boy I\u2019ve seen taking aim at his chair before sliding across the room to it, as if he was on wheels.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, no! Not in the least like that! Just wait a minute,\u201d the Marquise went on, \u201cI don\u2019t know what he can be doing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She rang the bell and, when the servant had appeared, as she made no secret, and indeed liked to advertise the fact that her old friend spent the greater part of his time in her house: \u201cGo and tell M. de Norpois to come in\u201d she ordered him, \u201che is sorting some papers in my library; he said he would be twenty minutes, and I\u2019ve been waiting now for an hour and three-quarters. He will tell you about the Dreyfus case, anything you want to know,\u201d she said gruffly to Bloch. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t approve much of the way things are going.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For M. de Norpois was not on good terms with the Government of the day, and Mme. de Villeparisis, although he had never taken the liberty of bringing any actual Ministers to her house (she still preserved all the unapproachable dignity of a great lady, and remained outside and above the political relations which he was obliged to cultivate), was kept well informed by him of everything that went on. Then, too, the politicians of the day would never have dared to ask M. de Norpois to introduce them to Mme. de Villeparisis. But several of them had gone down to see him at her house in the country when they needed his advice or help at critical conjectures. One knew the address. One went to the house. One did not see its mistress. But at dinner that evening she would say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear they\u2019ve been down here bothering you. I trust things are going better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are not in a hurry?\u201d she now asked Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, not at all. I wanted to go because I am not very well; in fact there is some talk of my taking a cure at Vichy for my biliary ducts,\u201d he explained, articulating the last words with a fiendish irony\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, that\u2019s where my nephew Ch\u00e2tellerault\u2019s got to go, you must fix it up together. Is he still in the room? He\u2019s a nice boy, you know,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, and may quite well have meant what she said, feeling that two people whom she knew had no reason not to be friends with each other\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I dare say he wouldn\u2019t care about that \u2014 I don\u2019t really know him \u2014 at least I barely know him. He is sitting over there,\u201d stammered Bloch in ecstasy of confusion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The butler could not have delivered his mistress\u2019s message properly, for M. de Norpois, to make believe that he had just come in from the street, and had not yet seen his hostess, had picked up the first hat that he had found in the hall, and came forward to kiss Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s hand with great ceremony, asking after her health with all the interest that people shew after a long separation. He was not aware that the Marquise had already destroyed any semblance of reality in this charade, which she cut short by taking M. de Norpois and Bloch into an adjoining room. Bloch, who had observed all the courtesy that was being shewn to a person whom he had not yet discovered to be M. de Norpois, had said to me, trying to seem at his ease: \u201cWho is that old idiot?\u201d Perhaps, too, all this bowing and scraping by M. de Norpois had really shocked the better element in Bloch\u2019s nature, the freer and more straightforward manners of a younger generation, and he was partly sincere in condemning it as absurd. However that might be, it ceased to appear absurd, and indeed delighted him the moment it was himself, Bloch, to whom the salutations were addressed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMonsieur l\u2019Ambassadeur,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cI should like you to know this gentleman. Monsieur Bloch, Monsieur le Marquis de Norpois.\u201d She made a point, despite her casual usage of M. de Norpois, of addressing him always as \u201cMonsieur l\u2019Ambassadeur,\u201d as a social convention as well as from an exaggerated respect for his Ambassadorial rank, a respect which the Marquis had inculcated in her, and also with an instinctive application to him of the special manner, less familiar and more ceremonious, in relation to one particular man \u2014 which, in the house of a distinguished woman, in contrast to the liberties that she takes with her other guests, marks that man out instantly as her lover\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois drowned his azure gaze in his white beard, bent his tall body deep down as though he were bowing before all the famous and (to him) imposing connotations of the name Bloch, and murmured: \u201cI am delighted . . . \u201d whereat his young listener, moved, but feeling that the illustrious diplomat was going too far, hastened to correct him, saying: \u201cNot at all! On the contrary, it is I who am delighted.\u201d But this ceremony, which M. de Norpois, in his friendship for Mme. de Villeparisis, repeated for the benefit of every fresh person that his old friend introduced to him, did not seem to her adequate to the deserts of Bloch, to whom she said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cJust ask him anything you want to know; take him into the other room if it\u2019s more convenient; he will be delighted to talk to you. I think you wished to speak to him about the Dreyfus case,\u201d she went on, no more considering whether this would suit M. de Norpois than she would have thought of asking leave of the Duchesse de Montmorency\u2019s portrait before having it lighted up for the historian, or of the tea before pouring it into a cup\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou must speak loud,\u201d she warned Bloch, \u201che\u2019s a little deaf, but he will tell you anything you want to know; he knew Bismarck very well, and Cavour. That is so, isn\u2019t it;\u201d she raised her voice, \u201cyou knew Bismarck well?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you got anything on the stocks?\u201d M. de Norpois asked me with a knowing air as he shook my hand warmly. I took the opportunity to relieve him politely of the hat which he had felt obliged to bring ceremonially into the room, for I saw that it was my own which he had inadvertently taken. \u201cYou shewed me a somewhat laboured little thing in which you went in for a good deal of hair-splitting. I gave you my opinion quite frankly; what you had written was literally not worth the trouble of putting it on paper. Are you thinking of letting us have anything else? You were greatly smitten with Bergotte, if I remember rightly.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not to say anything against Bergotte,\u201d put in the Duchess. \u201cI don\u2019t dispute his talent as a painter; no one would, Duchess. He understands all about etching, if not brush-work on a large scale like M. Cherbuliez. But it seems to me that in these days we have a tendency to confuse the arts, and forget that the novelist\u2019s business is rather to weave a plot and edify his readers than to fiddle away at producing a frontispiece or tailpiece in drypoint. I shall be seeing your father on Sunday at our good friend A. J.\u2018s,\u201d he went on, turning again to myself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had hoped for a moment, when I saw him talking to Mme. de Guermantes, that he would perhaps afford me, for getting myself asked to her house, the help he had refused me for getting to Mme. Swann\u2019s. \u201cAnother of my great favourites,\u201d I told him, \u201cis Elstir. It seems the Duchesse de Guermantes has some wonderful examples of his work, particularly that admirable Bunch of Radishes which I remember at the Exhibition and should so much like to see again; what a masterpiece that is!\u201d And indeed, if I had been a prominent person and had been asked to state what picture I liked best, I should have named this Bunch of Radishes. \u201cA masterpiece?\u201d cried M. de Norpois with a surprised and reproachful air. \u201cIt makes no pretence of being even a picture, it is merely a sketch.\u201d (He was right.) \u201cIf you label a clever little thing of that sort \u2018masterpiece,\u2019 what have you got to say about H\u00e9bert\u2019s Virgin or Dagnan-Bouveret?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI heard you refusing to let him bring Robert\u2019s woman,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes to her aunt, after Bloch had taken the Ambassador aside. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll miss much, she\u2019s a perfect horror, as you know, without a vestige of talent, and besides she\u2019s grotesquely ugly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you mean to say, you know her, Duchess?\u201d asked M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, didn\u2019t you know that she performed in my house before the whole of Paris, not that that\u2019s anything for me to be proud of,\u201d explained Mme. de Guermantes with a laugh, glad nevertheless, since the actress was under discussion, to let it be known that she herself had had the first fruits of her foolishness. \u201cHallo, I suppose I ought to be going now,\u201d she added, without moving\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had just seen her husband enter the room, and these words were an allusion to the absurdity of their appearing to be paying a call together, like a newly married couple, rather than to the often strained relations that existed between her and the enormous fellow she had married, who, despite his increasing years, still led the life of a gay bachelor. Ranging over the considerable party that was gathered round the tea-table the genial, cynical gaze \u2014 dazzled a little by the brightness of the setting sun \u2014 of the little round pupils lodged in the exact centre of his eyes, like the \u2018bulls\u2019 which \u2018the excellent marksman that he was could always hit with such perfect aim and precision, the Duke came forward with a bewildered cautious slowness as though, alarmed by so brilliant a gathering, he was afraid of treading on ladies\u2019 skirts and interrupting conversations. A permanent smile \u2014 suggesting a \u2018Good King of Yvetot\u2019\u2014 slightly pompous, a half-open hand floating like a shark\u2019s fin by his side, which he allowed to be vaguely clasped by his old friends and by the strangers who were introduced to him, enabled him, without his having to make a single movement, or to interrupt his genial, lazy, royal progress, to reward the assiduity of them all by simply murmuring: \u201cHow do, my boy; how do, my dear friend; charmed, Monsieur Bloch; how do, Argencourt;\u201d and, on coming to myself, who was the most highly favoured, when he had been told my name: \u201cHow do, my young neighbour, how\u2019s your father? What a splendid fellow he is!\u201d He made no great demonstration except to Mme. de Villeparisis, who gave him good-day with a nod of her head, drawing one hand from a pocket of her little apron\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Being formidably rich in a world where everyone was steadily growing poorer, and having secured the permanent attachment to his person of the idea of this enormous fortune, he displayed all the vanity of the great nobleman reinforced by that of the man of means, the refinement and breeding of the former just managing to control the latter\u2019s self-sufficiency. One could understand, moreover, that his success with women, which made his wife so unhappy, was not due merely to his name and fortune, for he was still extremely good looking, and his profile retained the purity, the firmness of outline of a Greek god\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you mean to tell me she performed in your house?\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt asked the Duchess\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, don\u2019t you see, she came to recite, with a bunch of lilies in her hand, and more lilies on her dress.\u201d Mme. de Guermantes shared her aunt\u2019s affectation of pronouncing certain words in an exceedingly rustic fashion, but never rolled her r\u2019s like Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before M. de Norpois, under constraint from his hostess, had taken Bloch into the little recess where they could talk more freely, I went up to the old diplomat for a moment and put in a word about my father\u2019s Academic chair. He tried first of all to postpone the conversation to another day. I pointed out that I was going to Balbec. \u201cWhat? Going again to Balbec? Why, you\u2019re a regular globe-trotter.\u201d He listened to what I had to say. At the name of Leroy-Beaulieu, he looked at me suspiciously. I conjectured that he had perhaps said something disparaging to M. Leroy-Beaulieu about my father and was afraid of the economist\u2019s having repeated it to him. All at once he seemed animated by a positive affection for my father. And after one of those opening hesitations out of which suddenly a word explodes as though in spite of the speaker, whose irresistible conviction prevails over his half-hearted efforts at silence: \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said to me with emotion, \u201cyour father must not stand. In his own interest he must not; it is not fair to himself; he owes a certain respect to his own really great merits, which would be compromised by such an adventure. He is too big a man for that. If he should be elected, he will have everything to lose and nothing to gain. He is not an orator, thank heaven. And that is the one thing that counts with my dear colleagues, even if you only talk platitudes. Your father has an important goal in life; he should march straight ahead towards it, and not allow himself to turn aside to beat bushes, even the bushes (more thorny for that matter than flowery) of the grove of Academe. Besides, he would not get many votes. The Academy likes to keep a postulant waiting for some time before taking him to its bosom. For the present, there is nothing to be done. Later on, I don\u2019t say. But he must wait until the Society itself comes in quest of him. It makes a practice; not a very fortunate practice, a fetish rather, of the far\u00e0 da s\u00e8 of our friends across the Alps. Leroy-Beaulieu spoke to me about all this in a way I did not at all like. I pointed out to him, a little sharply perhaps, that a man accustomed as he is to dealing with colonial imports and metals could not be expected to understand the part played by the imponderables, as Bismarck used to say. But, whatever happens, your father must on no account put himself forward as a candidate, Principis obsta. His friends would find themselves placed in a delicate position if he suddenly called upon them for their votes. Indeed,\u201d he broke forth, with an air of candour, fixing his blue eyes on my face, \u201cI am going to say a thing that you will be surprised to hear coming from me, who am so fond of your father. Well, simply because I am fond of him (we are known as the inseparables \u2014Arcades ambo), simply because I know the immense service that he can still render to his country, the reefs from which he can steer her if he remains at the helm; out of affection, out of high regard for him, out of patriotism, I should not vote for him. I fancy, moreover, that I have given him to understand that I should not.\u201d (I seemed to discern in his eyes the stern Assyrian profile of Leroy-Beaulieu.) \u201cSo that to give him my vote now would be a sort of recantation on my part.\u201d M. de Norpois repeatedly dismissed his brpther Academicians as old fossils. Other reasons apart, every member of a club or academy likes to ascribe to his fellow members the type of character that is the direct converse of his own, less for the advantage of being able to say: \u201cAh! If it only rested with me!\u201d than for the satisfaction of making the election which he himself has managed to secure seem more difficult, a greater distinction. \u201cI may tell you,\u201d he concluded, \u201cthat in the best interests of you all, I should prefer to see your father triumphantly elected in ten or fifteen years\u2019 time.\u201d Words which I assumed to have been dictated if not by jealousy, at any rate by an utter lack of any willingness to oblige, and which later on I was to recall when the course of events had given them a different meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou haven\u2019t thought of giving the Institute an address on the price of bread during the Fronde, I suppose,\u201d the historian of that movement timidly inquired of M. de Norpois. \u201cYou could make a considerable success of a subject like that,\u201d (which was to say, \u201cyou would give me a colossal advertisement,\u201d) he added, smiling at the Ambassador pusillanimously, but with a warmth of feeling which made him raise his eyelids and expose a double horizon of eye. I seemed to have seen this look before, and yet I had met the historian for the first time this afternoon. Suddenly I remembered having seen the same expression in the eyes of a Brazilian doctor who claimed to be able to cure choking fits of the kind from which I suffered by some absurd inhalation of the essential oils of plants. When, in the hope that he would pay more attention to my case, I had told him that I knew Professor Cottard, he had replied, as though speaking in Cotterd\u2019s interest: \u201cNow this treatment of mine, if you were to tell him about it, would give him the material for a most sensational paper for the Academy of Medicine!\u201d He had not ventured to press the matter but had stood gazing at me with the same air of interrogation, timid, anxious, appealing, which it had just puzzled me to see on the face of the historian of the Fronde. Obviously the two men were not acquainted and had little nothing in common, but psychological like physical laws have a more or less general application. And the requisite conditions are the same; an identical expression lights the eyes of different human animals, as a single sunrise lights different places, a long way apart, which have no connexion with one another. I did not hear the Ambassador\u2019s reply, for the whole party, with a good deal of noise, had again gathered round Mme. de Villeparisis to watch her at work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know who\u2019 we\u2019re talking about, Basin?\u201d the Duchess asked her husband\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can make a pretty good guess,\u201d said the Duke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! As an actress she\u2019s not, I\u2019m afraid, in what one would call the great tradition.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine,\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes to M. d\u2019Argencourt \u201canything more ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn fact, it was drolatic,\u201d put in M. de Guermantes, whose odd vocabulary enabled people in society to declare that he was no fool and literary people, at the same time, to regard him as a complete imbecile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat I fail to understand,\u201d resumed the Duchess, \u201cis how in the world Robert ever came to fall in love with her. Oh, of course I know one mustn\u2019t discuss that sort of thing,\u201d she added, with the charming pout of a philosopher and sentimentalist whose last illusion had long been shattered. \u201cI know that anybody may fall in love with anybody else. And,\u201d she went on, for, though she might still laugh at modern literature, it, either by its dissemination through the popular press or else in the course of conversation, had begun to percolate into her mind, \u201cthat is the really nice thing about love, because it\u2019s what makes it so \u2018mysterious.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMysterious! Oh, I must confess, cousin, that\u2019s a bit beyond me,\u201d said the Comte d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh dear, yes, it\u2019s a very mysterious thing, love,\u201d declared the Duchess, with the sweet smile of a good-natured woman of the world, but also with the rooted conviction with which a Wagnerian assures a bored gentleman from the Club that there is something more than just noise in the Walk\u00fcre. \u201cAfter all, one never does know what makes one person fall in love with another; it may not be at all what we think,\u201d she added with a smile, repudiating at once by this interpretation the idea she had just suggested. \u201cAfter all, one never knows anything, does one?\u201d she concluded with an air of weary scepticism. \u201cBesides, one understands, doesn\u2019t one; one simply can\u2019t explain other people\u2019s choices in love.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But having laid down this principle she proceeded at once to abandon it and to criticise Saint-Loup\u2019s choice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAll the same, don\u2019t you know, it is amazing to me that a man can find any attraction in a person who\u2019s simply silly.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch, hearing Saint-Loup\u2019s name mentioned and gathering that he was in Paris, promptly made a remark about him so outrageous that everybody was shocked. He was beginning to nourish hatreds, and one felt that he would stop at nothing to gratify them. Once he had established the principle that he himself was of great moral worth and that the sort of people who frequented La Boulie (an athletic club which he supposed to be highly fashionable) deserved penal servitude, every blow he could get against them seemed to him praiseworthy. He went so far once as to speak of a lawsuit which he was anxious to bring against one of his La poulie friends. In the course of the trial he proposed to give certain evidence which would be entirely untrue, though the defendant would be unable to impugn his veracity. In this way Bloch (who, incidentally, never put his plan into action) counted on baffling and infuriating his antagonist. What harm could there be in that, since he whom he sought to injure was a man who thought only of doing the \u2018right thing,\u2019 a La Boulie man, and against people like that any weapon was justified, especially in the hands of a Saint, such as Bloch himself?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, though, what about Swann?\u201d objected M. d\u2019Argencourt, who having at last succeeded in understanding the point of his cousin\u2019s speech, was impressed by her accuracy of observation, and was racking his brains for instances of men who had fallen in love with women in whom he himself had seen no attraction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but Swann\u2019s case was quite different,\u201d the Duchess protested. \u201cIt was a great surprise, I admit, because she\u2019s just a well-meaning idiot, but she was never silly, and she was at one time good looking.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, oh!\u201d muttered Mme. de Villeparisis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou never thought so? Surely, she had some charming points, very fine eyes, good hair, she used to dress, and does still dress, wonderfully. Nowadays, I quite agree, she\u2019s horrible, but she has been a lovely woman in her time. Not that that made me any less sorry when Charles married her, because it was so unnecessary.\u201d The Duchess had not intended to say anything out of the common, but as M. d\u2019Argencourt began to laugh she repeated these last words \u2014 either because she thought them amusing or because she thought it nice of him to laugh \u2014 and looked up at him with a coaxing smile, to add the enchantment of her femininity to that of her wit. She went on: \u201cYes, really, it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble, was it; still, after all, she did have some charm and I can quite understand anybody\u2019s falling in love with her, but if you saw Robert\u2019s girl, I assure you, you\u2019d simply die of laughter. Oh, I know somebody\u2019s going to quote Augier at me: \u2018What matters the bottle so long as one gets drunk?\u2019 Well, Robert may have got drunk, all right, but he certaintly hasn\u2019t shewn much taste in his choice of a bottle! First of all, would you believe that she actually expected me to fit up a staircase right in the middle of my drawing-room. Oh, a mere nothing \u2014 what? \u2014 and she announced that she was going to lie flat on her stomach on the steps. And then, if you\u2019d heard the things she recited, I only remember one scene, but I\u2019m sure nobody could imagine anything like it; it was called the Seven Princesses.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSeven Princesses! Dear, dear, what a snob she must be!\u201d cried M. d\u2019Argencourt. \u201cBut, wait a minute, why, I know the whole play. The author sent a copy to the King, who couldn\u2019t understand a word of it and called on me to explain it to him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt isn\u2019t by any chance, from the Sar Peladan?\u201d asked the historian of the Fronde, meaning to make a subtle and topical allusion, but in so low a tone that his question passed unnoticed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you know the Seven Princesses, do you?\u201d replied the Duchess, \u201cI congratulate you! I only know one, but she\u2019s quite enough; I have no wish to make the acquaintance of the other six. If they are all like the one I\u2019ve seen!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a goose!\u201d I thought to myself. Irritated by the coldness of her greeting, I found a sort of bitter satisfaction in this proof of her complete inability to understand Maeterlinck. \u201cTo think that\u2019s the woman I walk miles every morning to see. Really, I\u2019m too kind. Well, it\u2019s my turn now not to want to see her.\u201d Thus I reasoned with myself; but my words ran counter to my thoughts; they were purely conversational words such as we say to ourselves at those moments when, too much excited to remain quietly alone, we feel the need, for want of another listener, to talk to ourselves, without meaning what we say, as we talk to a stranger\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what it was like,\u201d the Duchess went on; \u201cyou simply couldn\u2019t help laughing. Not that anyone tried; rather the other way, I\u2019m sorry to say, for the young person was not at all pleased and Robert has never really forgiven me. Though I can\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry, actually, because if it had been a success the lady would perhaps have come again, and I don\u2019t quite see Marie-Aynard approving of that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was the name given in the family to Robert\u2019s mother, Mme. de Marsantes, the widow of Aynard de Saint-Loup, to distinguish her from her cousin, the Princesse de Guermantes-Bavi\u00e8re, also a Marie, to whose Christian name her nephews and cousins and brothers-in-law added, to avoid confusion, either that of her husband or another of her own, making her Marie-Gilbert or Marie-Hedwige\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo begin with, there was a sort of rehearsal the night before, which was a wonderful affair!\u201d went on Mme. de Guermantes in ironical pursuit of her theme. \u201cJust imagine, she uttered a sentence, no, not so much, not a quarter of a sentence, and then she stopped; she didn\u2019t open her mouth \u2014 I\u2019m not exaggerating \u2014 for a good five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I say,\u201d cried M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith the utmost politeness I took the liberty of hinting to her that this might seem a little unusual. And she said \u2014 I give you her actual words \u2014\u2018One ought always to repeat a thing as though one were just composing it oneself.\u2019 When you think of it, that really is monumental.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I understood she wasn\u2019t at all bad at reciting poetry,\u201d said one of the two young men\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe hasn\u2019t the ghost of a notion what poetry is,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t need to listen to her to tell that. It was quite enough to see her come in with her lilies. I knew at once that she couldn\u2019t have any talent when I saw those lilies!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everybody laughed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hope, my dear aunt, you aren\u2019t angry with me, over my little joke the other day about the Queen of Sweden. I\u2019ve come to ask your forgiveness.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, no, I\u2019m not at all angry, I even give you leave to eat at my table, if you\u2019re hungry. \u2014 Come along, M. Valm\u00e8re, you\u2019re the daughter of the house,\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis went on to the librarian, repeating a time-honoured pleasantry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M de Guermantes sat upright in the armchair in which he had come to anchor his hat on the carpet by his side, and examined with a satisfied smile the plate of little cakes that was being held out to him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThis gentleman makes you an admirable daughter,\u201d commented M. d\u2019Argencourt, whom the spirit of imitation prompted to keep Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s little joke in circulation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The librarian handed the plate of cakes to the historian of the Fronde\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou perform your functions admirably,\u201d said the latter, startled into speech, and hoping also to win the sympathy of the crowd. At the same time he cast a covert glance of connivance at those who had anticipated him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell me, my dear aunt,\u201d M. de Guermantes inquired of Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cwho was that rather good-looking man who was going out just now as I came in? I must know him, because he gave me a sweeping bow, but I couldn\u2019t place him at all; you know I never can remember names, it\u2019s such a nuisance,\u201d he added, in a tone of satisfaction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cM. Legrandin.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but Oriane has a cousin whose mother, if I\u2019m not mistaken, was a Grandin. Yes, I remember quite well, she was a Grandin de l\u2019Epervier.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cno relation at all. These are plain Grandins. Grandins of nothing at all. But they\u2019d be only too glad to be Grandins of anything you chose to name. This one has a sister called Mme. de Cambremer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, Basin, you know quite well who\u2019 my aunt means,\u201d cried the Duchess indignantly. \u201cHe\u2019s the brother of that great graminivorous creature you had the weird idea of sending to call on me the other day. She stayed a solid hour; I thought I should go mad. But I began by thinking it was she who was mad when I saw a person I didn\u2019t know come browsing into the room looking exactly like a cow.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen, Oriane; she asked me what afternoon you were at home; I couldn\u2019t very well be rude to her; and besides, you do exaggerate so, she\u2019s not in the least like a cow,\u201d he added in a plaintive tone, though not without a quick smiling glance at the audience\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He knew that his wife\u2019s lively wit needed the stimulus of contradiction, the contradiction of common sense which protests that one cannot (for instance) mistake a woman seriously for a cow; by this process Mme. de Guermantes, enlarging upon her original idea, had been inspired to produce many of her most brilliant sayings. And the Duke in his innocent fashion helped her, without seeming to do so, to bring off her effects like, in a railway carriage, the unacknowledged partner of the three-card player\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI admit she doesn\u2019t look like a cow, she looks like a dozen,\u201d exclaimed Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cI assure you, I didn\u2019t know what to do when I saw a herd of cattle come marching into my drawing-room in a hat and heard them ask me how I was. I had half a mind to say: \u2018Please, herd of cattle, you must be making a mistake, you can\u2019t possibly know me, because you\u2019re a herd of cattle,\u2019 but after racking my brains over her I came to the conclusion that your Cambremer woman must be the Infanta Dorothea who had said she was coming to see me one day, and is rather bovine also, so that I was just on the point of saying: \u2018Your Royal Highness\u2019 and using the third person to a herd of cattle. The cut of her dewlap reminded me rather, too, of the Queen of Sweden. But this massed attack had been prepared for by long range artillery fire, according to all the rules of war. For I don\u2019t know how long before, I was bombarded with her cards; I used to find them lying about all over the house, on all the tables and chairs like prospectuses. I couldn\u2019t think what they were supposed to be advertising. You saw nothing in the house but \u2018Marquis et Marquise de Cambremer\u2019 with some address or other which I\u2019ve forgotten; you may be quite sure nothing will ever take me there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut it\u2019s a great distinction to look like a Queen,\u201d said the historian of the Fronde\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGad, sir, Kings and Queens, in these days, don\u2019t amount to much,\u201d said M. de Guermantes, partly because he liked to be thought broad-minded and modern, and also so as not to seem to attach any importance to his own royal friendships, which he valued highly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch and M. de Norpois had returned from the other room and came towards us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, sir,\u201d asked Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201chave you been talking to him about the Dreyfus case?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois raised his eyes to the ceiling, but with a smile, as though calling on heaven to witness the monstrosity of the caprices to which his Dulcinea compelled him to submit. Nevertheless he spoke to Bloch with great affability of the terrible, perhaps fatal period through which France was passing. As this presumably meant that M. de Norpois (to whom Bloch had confessed his belief in the innocence of Dreyfus) was an ardent anti-Dreyfusard, the Ambassador\u2019s geniality, his air of tacit admission that his listener was in the right, of never doubting that they were both of the same opinion, of being prepared to join forces with him to overthrow the Government, flattered Bloch\u2019s vanity and aroused his curiosity. What were the important points which M. de Norpois never specified but on which he seemed implicitly to affirm that he was in agreement with Bloch; what opinion, then, did he hold of the case, that could bring them together? Bloch was all the more astonished at the mysterious unanimity which seemed to exist between him and M. de Norpois, in that it was not confined to politics, Mme. de Villeparisis having spoken at some length to M. de Norpois of Bloch\u2019s literary work\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou are not of your age,\u201d the former Ambassador told him, \u201cand I congratulate you upon that. You are not of this age in which disinterested work no longer exists, in which writers offer the public nothing but obscenities or ineptitudes. Efforts such as yours ought to be encouraged, and would be, if we had a Government.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch was flattered by this picture of himself swimming alone amid a universal shipwreck. But here again he would have been glad of details, would have liked to know what were the ineptitudes to which M. de Norpois referred. Bloch had the feeling that he was working along the same lines as plenty of others; he had never supposed himself to be so exceptional. He returned to the Dreyfus case, but did not succeed in elucidating M. de Norpois\u2019s own views. He tried to induce him to speak of the officers whose names were appearing constantly in the newspapers at that time; they aroused more curiosity than the politicians who were involved also, because they were not, like the politicians, well known already, but, wearing a special garb, emerging from the obscurity of a different kind of life and a religiously guarded silence, simply stood up and spoke and disappeared again, like Lohengrin landing from a skiff drawn by a swan. Bloch had been able, thanks to a Nationalist lawyer of his acquaintance, to secure admission to several hearings of the Zola trial. He would arrive there in the morning and stay until the court rose, with a packet of sandwiches and a flask of coffee, as though for the final examination for a degree, and this change of routine stimulating a nervous excitement which the coffee and the emotional interest of the trial worked up to a climax, he would come out so enamoured of everything that had happened in court that, in the evening, as he sat at home, he would long to immerse himself again in that beautiful dream and would hurry out, to a restaurant frequented by both parties, in search of friends with whom he would go over interminably the whole of the day\u2019s proceedings, and make up, by a supper ordered in an imperious tone which gave him the illusion of power, for the hunger and exhaustion of a day begun so early and unbroken by any interval for luncheon. The human mind, hovering perpetually between the two planes of experience and imagination, seeks to fathom the ideal life of the people it knows and to know the people whose life it has had to imagine. To Bloch\u2019s questions M. de Norpois replied:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere are two officers involved in the case now being tried of whom I remember hearing some time ago from a man in whose judgment I felt great confidence, and who praised them both highly \u2014 I mean M. de Miribel. They are Lieutenant-Colonel Henry and Lieutenant-Colonel Picquart.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut,\u201d exclaimed Bloch, \u201cthe divine Athena, daughter of Zeus, has put in the mind of one the opposite of what is in the mind of the other. And they are fighting against one another like two lions. Colonel Picquart had a splendid position in the Army, but his Moira has led him to the side that was not rightly his. The sword of the Nationalists will carve his tender flesh, and he will be cast out as food for the beasts of prey and the birds that wax fat upon the bodies of men.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois made no reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat are those two palavering about over there?\u201d M. de Guermantes asked Mme. de Villeparisis, indicating M. de Norpois and Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Dreyfus case.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe devil they are. By the way, do you know who is a red-hot supporter of Dreyfus? I give you a thousand guesses. My nephew Robert! I can tell you that, at the Jockey, when they heard of his goings on, there was a fine gathering of the clans, a regular hue and cry. And as he\u2019s coming up for election next week . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOf course,\u201d broke in the Duchess, \u201cif they\u2019re all like Gilbert, who keeps on saying that all the Jews ought to be sent back to Jerusalem.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed; then the Prince de Guermantes is quite of my way of thinking,\u201d put in M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duke made a show of his wife, but did not love her. Extremely self-centred, he hated to be interrupted, besides he was in the habit, at home of treating her brutally. Convulsed with the twofold rage of a bad husband when his wife speaks to him, and a good talker wher he is not listened to, he stopped short and transfixed the Duchess with a glare which made everyone feel uncomfortable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat makes you think we want to hear about Gilbert and Jerusalem? It\u2019s nothing to do with that. But,\u201d he went on in a gentler tone, \u201cyou will agree that if one of our family were to be pilled at the Jockey, especially Robert, whose father was chairman for ten years, it would be a pretty serious matter. What can you expect, my dear, it\u2019s got \u2019em on the raw, those fellows; they\u2019re all over it. I don\u2019t blame them, either; personally, you know that I have no racial prejudice, all that sort of thing seems to me out of date, and I do claim to move with the times; but damn it all, when one goes by the name of \u2018Marquis de Saint-Loup\u2019 one isn\u2019t a Dreyfusard; what more can I say?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Guermantes uttered the words: \u201cWhen one goes by the name of Marquis de Saint-Loup,\u201d with some emphasis. He knew very well that it was a far greater thing to go by that of Duc de Guermantes. But if his self-esteem had a tendency to exaggerate if anything the superiority of the title Duc de Guermantes over all others, it was perhaps not so much the rules of good taste as the laws of imagination that urged him thus to attenuate it. Each of us sees in the brightest colours what he sees at a distance, what he sees in other people. For the general laws which govern perspective in imagination apply just as much to dukes as to ordinary mortals. And not only the laws of imagination, but those of speech. Now, either of two laws of speech may apply here, one being that which makes us express ourselves like others of our mental category and not of our caste. Under this law M. de Guermantes might be, in his choice of expressions, even when he wished to talk about the nobility, indebted to the humblest little tradesman, who would have said: \u201cWhen one goes by the name of Duc de Guermantes,\u201d whereas an educated man, a Swann, a Legrandin would not have said it. A duke may write novels worthy of a grocer, even about life in high society, titles and pedigrees being of no help to him there, and the epithet \u2018aristocratic\u2019 be earned by the writings of a plebeian. Who had been, in this instance, the inferior from whom M. de Guermantes had picked up \u2018when one goes by the name,\u2019 he had probably not the least idea. But another law of speech is that, from time to time, as there appear and then vanish diseases of which nothing more is ever heard, there come into being, no one knows how, spontaneously perhaps or by an accident like that which introduced into France a certain weed from America, the seeds of which, caught in the wool of a travelling rug, fell on a railway embankment, forms of speech which one hears in the same decade on the lips of people who have not in any way combined together to use them. So, just as in a certain year I heard Bloch say, referring to himself, that \u201cthe most charming people, the most brilliant, the best known, the most exclusive had discovered that there was only one man in Paris whom they felt to be intelligent, pleasant, whom they could not do without \u2014 namely Bloch,\u201d and heard the same phrase used by countless other young men who did not know him and varied it only by substituting their own names for his, so I was often to hear this \u2018when one goes by the name.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat can one expect,\u201d the Duke went on, \u201cwith the influence he\u2019s come under; it\u2019s easy to understand.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStill it is rather comic,\u201d suggested the Duchess, \u201cwhen you think of his mother\u2019s attitude, how she bores us to tears with her Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, morning, noon and night.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, but there\u2019s not only his mother to be thought of, you can\u2019t humbug us like that. There\u2019s a damsel, too, a fly-by-night of the worst type; she has far more influence over him than his mother, and she happens to be a compatriot of Master Dreyfus. She has passed on her state of mind to Robert.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou may not have heard, Duke, that there is a new word to describe that sort of mind,\u201d said the librarian, who was Secretary to the Anti-revisionist Committee. \u201cThey say \u2018mentality.\u2019 It means exactly the same thing, but it has this advantage that nobody knows what you\u2019re talking about. It is the very latest expression just now, the \u2018last word\u2019 as people say.\u201d Meanwhile, having heard Bloch\u2019s name, he was watching him question M. de Norpois with misgivings which aroused others as strong though of a different order in the Marquise. Trembling before the librarian, and always acting the anti-Dreyfusard in his presence, she dreaded what he would say were he to find out that she had asked to her house a Jew more or less affiliated to the \u2018Syndicate.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed,\u201d said the Duke, \u201c\u2018mentality,\u2019 you say; I must make a note of that; I shall use it some day.\u201d This was no figure of speech, the Duke having a little pocketbook filled with such \u2018references\u2019 which he used to consult before dinner-parties. \u201cI like \u2018mentality.\u2019 There are a lot of new words like that which people suddenly start using, but they never last. I read somewhere the other day that some writer was \u2018talentuous.\u2019 You may perhaps know what it means; I don\u2019t. And since then I\u2019ve never come across the word again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut \u2018mentality\u2019 is more widely used than \u2018talentuous,\u2019\u201d the historian of the Fronde made his way into the conversation. \u201cI am on a Committee at the Ministry of Education at which I have heard it used several times, as well as at my Club, the Volney, and indeed at dinner at M. Emile Ollivier\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI, who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of Education,\u201d replied the Duke with a feigned humility but with a vanity so intense that his lips could not refrain from curving in a smile, nor his eyes from casting round his audience a glance sparkling with joy, the ironical scorn in which made the poor historian blush, \u201cI who have not the honour to belong to the Ministry of Education,\u201d he repeated, relishing the sound of his words, \u201cnor to the Volney Club (my only clubs are the Union and the Jockey \u2014 you aren\u2019t in the Jockey, I think, sir?\u201d he asked the historian, who, blushing a still deeper red, scenting an insult and failing to understand it, began to tremble in every limb), \u201cI, who am not even invited to dine with M. Emile Ollivier, I must confess that I had never heard \u2018mentality.\u2019 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re in the same boat, Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know,\u201d he went on, \u201cwhy they can\u2019t produce the proofs of Dreyfus\u2019s guilt. Apparently it\u2019s because the War Minister\u2019s wife was his mistress, that\u2019s what people are saying.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I thought it was the Prime Minister\u2019s wife,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI think you\u2019re all equally tiresome about this wretched case,\u201d said the Duchesse de Guermantes, who, in the social sphere, was always anxious to shew that she did not allow herself to be led by anyone. \u201cIt can\u2019t make any difference to me, so far as the Jews are concerned, for the simple reason that I don\u2019t know any of them, and I intend to remain in that state of blissful ignorance. But on the other hand I do think it perfectly intolerable that just because they\u2019re supposed to hold \u2018sound\u2019 views and don\u2019t deal with Jewish tradesmen, or have \u2018Down with the Jews\u2019 printed on their sunshades, we should have a swarm of Durands and Dubois and so forth, women we should never have known but for this business, forced down our throats by Marie-Aynard or Victurnienne. I went to see Marie-Aynard a couple of days ago. It used to be so nice there. Nowadays one finds all the people one has spent one\u2019s life trying to avoid, on the pretext that they\u2019re against Dreyfus, and others of whom you have no idea who they can be.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; it was the War Minister\u2019s wife; at least, that\u2019s the bedside rumour,\u201d went on the Duke, who liked to flavour his conversation with certain expressions which he imagined to be of the old school. \u201cPersonally, of course, as everyone knows, I take just the opposite view to my cousin Gilbert. I am not feudal like him. I would go about with a Negro if he was a friend of mine, and I shouldn\u2019t care two straws what anybody thought; still after all you will agree with me that when one goes by the name of Saint-Loup one doesn\u2019t amuse oneself by running clean against the rails of public opinion, which has more sense than Voltaire or even my nephew. Nor does one go in for what I may be allowed to call these acrobatics of conscience a week before one comes up for a club. It is a bit stiff, really! No, it is probably that little wench of his that has put him on his high horse. I expect she told him that he would be classed among the \u2018intellectuals.\u2019 The intellectuals, they\u2019re the very cream of those gentry. It\u2019s given rise, by the way, to a rather amusing pun, though a very naughty one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the Duke murmured, lowering his voice, for his wife\u2019s and M. d\u2019Argencourt\u2019s benefit, \u201cMater Semita,\u201d which had already made its way into the Jockey Club, for, of all the flying seeds in the world, that to which are attached the most solid wings, enabling it to be disseminated at the greatest distance from its parent branch, is still a joke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWe might ask this gentleman, who has a nerudite air, to explain it to us,\u201d he went on, indicating the historian. \u201cBut it is better not to repeat it, especially as there\u2019s not a vestige of truth in the suggestion. I am not so ambitious as my cousin Mirepoix, who claims that she can trace the descent of her family before Christ to the Tribe of Levi, and I will undertake to prove that there has never been a drop of Jewish blood in our family. Still there is no good in our shutting our eyes to the fact, you may be sure that my dear nephew\u2019s highly original views are liable to make a considerable stir at Landerneau. Especially as Fezensac is ill just now, and Duras will be running the election; you know how he likes to make nuisances,\u201d concluded the Duke, who had never succeeded in learning the exact meaning of certain phrases, and supposed \u2018making nuisances\u2019 to mean \u2018making difficulties.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch tried to pin M. de Norpois down on Colonel Picquart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere can be no two opinions;\u201d replied M. de Norpois, \u201chis evidence had to be taken. I am well aware that, by maintaining this attitude, I have drawn screams of protest from more than one of my colleagues, but to my mind the Government were bound to let the Colonel speak. One can\u2019t dance lightly out of a blind alley like that, or if one does there\u2019s always the risk of falling into a ditch. As for the officer himself, his statement gave one, at the first hearing, a most excellent impression. When one saw him, looking so well in that smart Chasseur uniform, come into court and relate in a perfectly simple and frank tone what he had seen and what he had deduced, and say: \u2018On my honour as a soldier\u2019\u201d (here M. de Norpois\u2019s voice shook with a faint patriotic throb) \u201c\u2018such is my conviction,\u2019 it is impossible to deny that the impression he made was profound.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere; he is a Dreyfusard, there\u2019s not the least doubt of it,\u201d thought Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut where he entirely forfeited all the sympathy that he had managed to attract was when he was confronted with the registrar, Gribelin. When one heard that old public servant, a man who had only one answer to make,\u201d (here M. de Norpois began to accentuate his words with the energy of his sincere convictions) \u201cwhen one listened to him, when one saw him look his superior officer in the face, not afraid to hold his head up to him, and say to him in a tone that admitted of no response: \u2018Colonel, sir, you know very well that I have never told a lie, you know that at this moment, as always, I am speaking the truth,\u2019 the wind changed; M. Picquart might move heaven and earth at the subsequent hearings; he made a complete fiasco.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; evidently he\u2019s an anti-Dreyfusard; it\u2019s quite obvious,\u201d said Bloch to himself. \u201cBut if he considers Picquart a traitor and a liar, how can he take his revelations seriously, and quote them as if he found them charming and believed them to be sincere. And if, on the other hand, he sees in him an honest man easing his conscience, how can he suppose him to have been lying when he was confronted with Gribelin?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn any case, if this man Dreyfus is innocent,\u201d the Duchess broke in, \u201che hasn\u2019t done much to prove it. What idiotic, raving letters he writes from that island. I don\u2019t know whether M. Esterhazy is any better, but he does shew some skill in his choice of words, a different tone altogether. That can\u2019t be very pleasant for the supporters of M. Dreyfus. What a pity for them there\u2019s no way of exchanging innocents.\u201d Everybody laughed. \u201cYou heard what Oriane said?\u201d the Duc de Guermantes inquired eagerly of e. de Villeparisis. \u201cYes; I think it most amusing.\u201d This was not enough for the Duke. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t say that I thought it amusing; or rather it doesn\u2019t make the slightest difference to me whether a thing is amusing or not. I don\u2019t care about wit.\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt protested. \u201cIt is probably because I\u2019ve been a Member of Parliament, where I have listened to brilliant speeches that meant absolutely nothing. I learned there to value, more than anything, logic. That\u2019s probably why they didn\u2019t elect me again. Amusing things leave me cold.\u201d \u201cBasin, don\u2019t play the heavy father like that, my child, you know quite well that no one admires wit more than you do.\u201d \u201cPlease let me finish. It is just because I am unmoved by a certain type of humour, that I am often struck by my wife\u2019s wit. For you will find it based, as a rule, upon sound observation. She reasons like a man; she states her case like a writer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Possibly the explanation of M. de Norpois\u2019s speaking in this way to Bloch, as though they had been in agreement, may have lain in the fact that he himself was so keen an anti-Dreyfusard that, finding the Government not anti-Dreyfusard enough, he was its enemy just as much as the Dreyfusards. Perhaps because the object to which he devoted himself in politics was something more profound, situated on another plane, from which Dreyfusism appeared as an unimportant modality which did not deserve the attention of a patriot interested in large questions of foreign policy. Perhaps, rather, because the maxims of his political wisdom being applicable only to questions of form, of procedure, of expediency, they were as powerless to solve questions of fact as in philosophy pure logic is powerless to tackle the problems of existence; or else because that very wisdom made him see danger in handling such subjects and so, in his caution, he preferred to speak only of minor incidents. But where Bloch made a mistake was in thinking that M. de Norpois, even had he been less cautious by nature and of a less exclusively formal cast of mind, could (supposing he would) have told him the truth as to the part played by Henry, Picquart or du Paty de Clam, or as to any of the different aspects of the case. The truth, indeed, as to all these matters Bloch could not doubt that M. de Norpois knew. How could he fail to know it seeing that he was a friend of all the Ministers? Naturally, Bloch thought that the truth in politics could be approximately reconstructed by the most luminous minds, but he imagined, like the man in the street, that it resided permanently, beyond the reach of argument and in a material form, in the secret files of the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister, who imparted it to their Cabinet. Now, even when a political truth does take the form of written documents, it is seldom that these have any more value than a radiographic plate on which the layman imagines that the patient\u2019s disease is inscribed in so many words, when, as a matter of fact, the plate furnishes simply one piece of material for study, to be combined with a number of others, which the doctor\u2019s reasoning powers will take into consideration as a whole and upon them found his diagnosis. So, too, the truth in politics, when one goes to well-informed men and imagines that one is about to grasp it, eludes one. Indeed, later on (to confine ourselves to the Dreyfus case), when so startling an event occurred as Henry\u2019s confession, followed by his suicide, this fact was at once interpreted in opposite ways by the Dreyfusard Ministers, and by Cavaignac and Cuignet who had themselves made the discovery of the forgery and conducted the examination; still more so among the Dreyfusard Ministers themselves, men of the same shade of Dreyfusism, judging not only from the same documents but in the same spirit, the part played by Henry was explained in two entirely different ways, one set seeing in him an accomplice of Esterhazy, the others assigning that part to du Paty de Clam, thus rallying in support of a theory of their opponent Cuignet and in complete opposition to their supporter Reinach. All that Bloch could elicit from M. de Norpois was that if it were true that the Chief of Staff, M. de Boisdeffre, had had a secret communication sent to M. Rochefort, it was evident that a singularly regrettable irregularity had occurred\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou may be quite sure that the War Minister must (in petto at any rate) be consigning his Chief of Staff to the infernal powers. An official disclaimer would not have been (to my mind) a work of supererogation. But the War Minister expresses himself very bluntly on the matter inter pocula. There are certain subjects, moreover, about which it is highly imprudent to create an agitation over which one cannot retain control afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut those documents are obviously forged,\u201d put in Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois made no reply to this, but announced that he did not approve of the manifestations that were being made by Prince Henri d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBesides, they can only ruffle the calm of the pretorium, and encourage agitations which, looked at from either point of view, would be deplorable. Certainly we must put a stop to the anti-militarist conspiracy, but we cannot possibly tolerate, either, a brawl encouraged by those elements on the Right who instead of serving the patriotic ideal themselves are hoping to make it serve them. Heaven be praised, France is not a South American Republic, and the need has not yet been felt here for a military pronunciamento.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bioch could not get him to speak on the question of Dreyfus\u2019s guilt, nor would he utter any forecast as to the judgment in the civil trial then proceeding. On the other hand, M. de Norpois seemed only too ready to indicate the consequences of this judgment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf it is a conviction,\u201d he said, \u201cit will probably be quashed, for it is seldom that, in a case where there has been such a number of witnesses, there is not some flaw in the procedure which counsel can raise on appeal. To return to Prince Henri\u2019s outburst, I greatly doubt whether it has met with his father\u2019s approval.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou think Chartres is for Dreyfus?\u201d asked the Duchess with a smile, her eyes rounded, her cheeks bright, her nose buried in her plate, her whole manner deliciously scandalised\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all; I meant only that there runs through the whole family, on that side, a political sense which we have seen, in the admirable Princesse Cl\u00e9mentine, carried to its highest power, and which her son, Prince Ferdinand, has kept as a priceless inheritance. You would never have found the Prince of Bulgaria clasping Major Esterhazy to his bosom.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe would have preferred a private soldier,\u201d murmured Mme. de Guermantes, who often met the Bulgarian monarch at dinner at the Prince de Joinville\u2019s, and had said to him once, when he asked if she was not envious: \u201cYes, Sir, of your bracelets.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to Mme. de Sagan\u2019s ball this evening?\u201d M. de Norpois asked Mme. de Villeparisis, to cut short his conversation with Bloch. My friend had not failed to interest the Ambassador, who told us afterwards, not without a quaint simplicity, thinking no doubt of the traces that survived in Bloch\u2019s speech of the neo-Homeric manner which he had on the whole outgrown: \u201cHe is rather amusing, with that way of speaking, a trifle old fashioned, a trifle solemn. You expect him to come out with \u2018The Learned Sisters,\u2019 like Lamartine or Jean-Baptiste Rousseau. It has become quite uncommon in the youth of the present day, as it was indeed in the generation before them. We ourselves were inclined to be romantic.\u201d But however exceptional his companion may have seemed to him, M. de Norpois decided that the conversation had lasted long enough\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t go to balls any more,\u201d she replied with a charming grandmotherly smile. \u201cYou\u2019re going, all of you, I suppose? You\u2019re the right age for that sort of thing,\u201d she added, embracing in a comprehensive glance M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault, his friend and Bloch. \u201cStill, I was asked,\u201d she went on, pretending, just for fun, to be flattered by the distinction. \u201cIn fact, they came specially to ask me.\u201d (\u2018They\u2019 being the Princesse de Sagan.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI haven\u2019t had a card,\u201d said Bloch, thinking that Mme. de Villeparisis would at once offer to procure him one, and that Mme. de Sagan would be glad to see at her ball the friend of a woman whom she had called in person to invite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquise made no reply, and Bloch did not press the point, for he had another, more serious matter to discuss with her, and, with that in view, had already asked her whether he might call again in a couple of days. Having heard the two young men say that they had both just resigned from the Rue Royale Club, which was letting in every Tom, Dick and Harry, he wished to ask Mme. de Villeparisis to arrange for his election there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAren\u2019t they rather bad form, rather stuck-up snobs, these Sagans?\u201d he inquired in a tone of sarcasm\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot at all, they\u2019re the best we can do for you in that line,\u201d M. d\u2019Argencourt, who adopted all the catch-words of Parisian society, assured him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThen,\u201d said Bloch, still half in irony, \u201cI suppose it\u2019s one of the solemnities, the great social fixtures of the season.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis turned merrily to Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTell us, is it a great social solemnity, Mme. de Sagan\u2019s ball?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s no good asking me,\u201d answered the Duchess, \u201cI have never yet succeeded in finding out what a social solemnity is. Besides, society isn\u2019t my strong point.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed; I thought it was just the other way,\u201d said Bloch, who supposed Mme. de Guermantes to be speaking seriously\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He continued, to the desperation of M. de Norpois, to ply him with questions about the Dreyfus case. The Ambassador declared that, looking at it from outside, he got the impression from du Paty de Clam of a somewhat cloudy brain, which had perhaps not been very happily chosen to conduct that delicate operation, which required so much coolness and discernment, a judicial inquiry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI know that the Socialist Party are crying aloud for his head on a charger, as well as for the immediate release of the prisoner from the Devil\u2019s Isle. But I think that we are not yet reduced to the necessity of passing the Caudine Forks of MM. G\u00e9rault-Richard and Company. So far, the whole case has been an utter mystery, I don\u2019t say that on one side just as much as on the other there has not been some pretty dirty work to be hushed up. That certain of your client\u2019s more or less disinterested protectors may have the best intentions I will not attempt to deny, but you know that heaven is paved with such things,\u201d he added, with a look of great subtlety. \u201cIt is essential that the Government should give the impression that they are not in the hands of the factions of the Left, and that they are not going to surrender themselves, bound hand and foot, at the demand of some pretorian guard or other, which, believe me, is not the same thing as the Army. It stands to reason that, should any fresh evidence come to light, a new trial would be ordered. And what follows from that? Obviously, that to demand a new trial is to force an open door. When the day comes, the Government will speak with no uncertain voice or will let fall into abeyance what is their essential prerogative. Cock and bull stories will no longer be enough. We must appoint judges to try Dreyfus. And that will be an easy matter because, although we have acquired the habit, in our sweet France, where we love to belittle ourselves, of thinking or letting it be thought that, in order to hear the words Truth and Justice, it is necessary to cross the Channel, which is very often only a roundabout way of reaching the Spree, there are judges to be found outside Berlin. But once the machinery of Government has been set in motion, will you have ears for the voice of authority? When it bids you perform your duty as a citizen will you have ears for its voice, will you take your stand in the ranks of law and order? When its patriotic appeal sounds, will you have the wisdom not to turn a deaf ear but to answer: \u2018Present!\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois put these questions to Bloch with a vehemence which, while it alarmed my friend, flattered him also; for the Ambassador spoke to him with the air of one addressing a whole party, questioned him as though he had been in the confidence of that party and might be held responsible for the decisions which it would adopt. \u201cShould you fail to disarm,\u201d M. de Norpois went on, without waiting for Bloch\u2019s collective answer, \u201cshould you, before even the ink had dried on the decree ordering the fresh trial of the case, obeying it matters not what insidious word of command, fail, I say, to disarm, and band yourselves, rather, in a sterile opposition which seems to some minds the ultima ratio of policy, should you retire to your tents and burn your boats, you would be doing so to your own, damnation. Are you the prisoners of those who foment disorder? Have you given them pledges?\u201d Bloch was in doubt how to answer. M. de Norpois gave him no time. \u201cIf the negative be true, as I should like to think, and if you have a little of what seems to me to be lamentably lacking in certain of your leaders and your friends, namely political sense, then, on the day when the Criminal Court assembles, if you do not allow yourselves to be dragooned by the fishers in troubled waters, you will have won your battle. I do not guarantee that the whole of the General Staff is going to get away unscathed, but it will be so much to the good if some of them at least can save their faces without setting the heather on fire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt stands to reason, moreover, that it is with the Government that it rests to pronounce judgment, and to close the list \u2014 already too long \u2014 of unpunished crimes, not certainly at the bidding of Socialist agitators, nor yet of any obscure military mouthpiece,\u201d he added, looking Bloch boldly in the face, perhaps with the instinct that leads all Conservatives to establish support for themselves in the enemy\u2019s camp. \u201cGovernment action is not to be dictated by the highest bidder, from wherever the bid may come. The Government are not, thank heaven, under the orders of Colonel Driant, nor, at the other end of the scale, under M. Clemenceau\u2019s. We must curb the professional agitators and prevent them from raising their heads again. France, the vast majority here in France, desires only to be allowed to work in orderly conditions. As to that, there can be no question whatever. But we must not be afraid to enlighten public opinion; and if a few sheep, of the kind our friend Rabelais knew so well, should dash headlong into the water, it would be as well to point out to them that the water in question was troubled, that it had been troubled deliberately by an agency not within our borders, in order to conceal the dangers lurking in its depths. And the Government ought not to give the impression that they are emerging from their passivity in self-defence when they exercise the right which is essentially their own, I mean that of setting the wheels of justice in motion. The Government will accept all your suggestions. If it is proved that there has been a judicial error, they can be sure of an overwhelming majority which would give them room to act with freedom.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou, sir,\u201d said Bloch, turning to M. d\u2019Argencourt, to whom he had been made known, with the rest of the party, on that gentleman\u2019s arrival, \u201cyou are a Dreyfusard, of course; they all are, abroad.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is a question that concerns only the French themselves, don\u2019t you think?\u201d replied M. d\u2019Argencourt with that peculiar form of insolence which consists in ascribing to the other person an opinion which one must, obviously, know that he does not hold since he has just expressed one directly its opposite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bloch coloured; M. d\u2019Argencourt smiled, looking round the room, and if this smile, so long as it was directed at the rest of the company, was charged with malice at Bloch\u2019s expense, it became tempered with cordiality when finally it came to rest on the face of my friend, so as to deprive him of any excuse for annoyance at the words which he had heard uttered, though those words remained just as cruel. Mme. de Guermantes murmured something to M. d\u2019Argencourt which I could not hear, but which must have referred to Bloch\u2019s religion, for there flitted at that moment over the face of the Duchess that expression to which one\u2019s fear of being noticed by the person of whom one is speaking gives a certain hesitancy and unreality, while there is blended with it the inquisitive, malicious amusement inspired in one by a group of human beings to which one feels oneself to be fundamentally alien. To retrieve himself, Bloch turned to the Duc de Ch\u00e2tellerault. \u201cYou, sir, as a Frenchman, you must be aware that people abroad are all Dreyfusards, although everyone pretends that in prance we never know what is going on abroad. Anyhow, I know \u00cf can talk freely to you; Saint-Loup told me so.\u201d But the young Duke, who felt that every one was turning against Bloch, and was a coward as people often are in society, employing a mordant and precious form of wit which he seemed, by a sort of collateral atavism, to have inherited from M. de Charlus, replied: \u201cYou must not ask me, sir, to discuss the Dreyfus case with you; it is a subject which, on principle, I never mention except to Japhetics.\u201d Everyone smiled, except Bloch, not that he was not himself in the habit of making scathing references to his Jewish origin, to that side of his ancestry which came from somewhere near Sinai. But instead of one of these epigrams (doubtless because he had not one ready) the operation of the internal machine brought to Bloch\u2019s lips something quite different. And we caught only: \u201cBut how on earth did you know? Who told you?\u201d as though he had been the son of a convict. Whereas, given his name, which had not exactly a Christian sound, and his face, his surprise argued a certain simplicity of mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What M. de Norpois had said not having completely satisfied him, he went up to the librarian and asked him whether Mme. de Villeparisis did not sometimes have in her house M. du Paty de Clam or M. Joseph Reinach. The librarian made no reply; he was a Nationalist, and never ceased preaching to the Marquise that the social revolution might break out at any moment, and that she ought to shew more caution in the choice of her friends. He asked himself whether Bloch might not be a secret emissary of the Syndicate, come to collect information, and went off at once to repeat to Mme. de Villeparisis the questions that Bloch had put to him. She decided that, at the best, he was ill-bred and might be in a position to compromise M. de Norpois. Also, she wished to give satisfaction to the librarian, the only person of whom she went in fear, by whom she was being indoctrinated, though without any marked success (every morning he read her M. Judet\u2019s article in the Petit Journal). She decided, therefore, to make it plain to Bloch that he need not come to the house again, and had no difficulty in finding, among her social repertory, the scene by which a great lady shows anyone her door, a scene which does not in any way involve the raised finger and blazing eyes that people imagine. As Bloch came up to her to say good-bye, buried in her deep armchair, she seemed only half-awakened from a vague somnolence. Her sunken eyes gleamed with only the feeble though charming light of a pair of pearls. Bloch\u2019s farewell, barely pencilling on the Marquise\u2019s face a languid smile, drew from her not a word, nor did she offer him her hand. This scene left Bloch in utter bewilderment, but as he was surrounded by a circle of spectators he felt that it could not be prolonged without disadvantage to himself, and, to force the Marquise, the hand which she had made no effort to take he himself thrust out at her. Mme. de Villeparisis was startled. But doubtless, while still bent upon giving an immediate satisfaction to the librarian and the anti-Dreyfusard clan, she wished at the same time to provide for the future, and so contented herself with letting her eyelids droop over her closing eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI believe she\u2019s asleep,\u201d said Bloch to the librarian who, feeling that he had the support of the Marquise, assumed an indignant air. \u201cGood-bye madame,\u201d snouted Bloch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The old lady made the slight movement with her lips of a dying woman who wants to open her mouth but whose eye can no longer recognise people. Then she turned, overflowing with a restored vitality, to M. d\u2019Argencourt, while Bloch left the room, convinced that she must be \u2018soft\u2019 in the head. Full of curiosity and anxious to have more light thrown upon so strange an incident, he came to see lier again a few days later. She received him in the most friendly fashion, because she was a good-natured woman, because the librarian was not there, because she had in mind the little play which Bloch was going to produce for her, and finally because she had acted once and for all the little scene of the indignant lady that she had wished to act, a scene that had been universally admired and discussed the same evening in various drawing-rooms, but in a version which had already ceased to bear any resemblance to the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou were speaking just now of the Seven Princesses, Duchess; you know (not that it\u2019s anything to be proud of) that the author of that \u2014 what shall I call it? \u2014 that production is a compatriot of mine,\u201d said M. d\u2019Argencourt with a fine scorn blended with satisfaction at knowing more than anyone else in the room about the author of a work which had been under discussion. \u201cYes, he\u2019s a Belgian, by nationality,\u201d he went on\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIndeed! No, we don\u2019t accuse you of any responsibility for the Seven Princesses. Fortunately for yourself and your compatriots you are not like the author of that absurdity. I know several charming Belgians, yourself, your King, who is inclined to be shy, but full of wit, my Ligne cousins, and heaps of others, but you, I am thankful to say, do not speak the same language as the author of the Seven Princesses. Besides, if you want to know, it\u2019s not worth talking about, because really there is absolutely nothing in it. You know the sort of people who are always trying to seem obscure, and even plan to make themselves ridiculous to conceal the fact that they have not an idea in their heads. If there was anything behind it all, I may tell you that I\u2019m not in the least afraid of a little daring,\u201d she added in a serious tone, \u201cprovided that there is some idea in it. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen Borelli\u2019s piece. Some people seem to have been shocked by it, but I must say, even if they stone me through the streets for saying it,\u201d she went on, without stopping to think that she ran no very great risk of such a punishment, \u201cI found it immensely interesting. But theSeven Princesses! It\u2019s all very well, one of them having a fondness for my nephew, I cannot carry family feeling quite . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Duchess broke off abruptly, for a lady came in who was the Comtesse de Marsantes, Robert\u2019s mother. Mme. de Marsantes was regarded in the Faubourg Saint-Germain as a superior being, of a goodness, a resignation that were positively angelic. So I had been told, and had had no particular reason to feel surprised, not knowing at the same time that she was the sister of the Duc de Guermantes. Later, I have always been taken aback, whenever I have learned that such women, melancholy, pure, victimised, venerated like the ideal forms of saints in church windows, had flowered from the same genealogical stem as brothers brutal, debauched and vile. Brothers and sisters, when they are closely alike in features as were the pue de Guermantes and Mme. de Marsantes, ought (I felt) to have a single intellect in common, the same heart, as a person would have who might vary between good and evil moods but in whom one could not, for all that, expect to find a vast breadth of outlook if he had a narrow mind, or a sublime abnegation if his heart was hard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes attended Bruneti\u00e8re\u2019s lectures. She fascinated the Faubourg Saint-Germain and, by her saintly life, edified it as well. But the morphological link of handsome nose and piercing gaze led one, nevertheless, to classify Mme. de Marsantes in the same intellectual and moral family as her brother the Duke. I could not believe that the mere fact of her being a woman, and perhaps those of her having had an unhappy life and won everyone\u2019s sympathy, could make a person be so different from the rest of her family, as in the old romances, where all the virtues and graces are combined in the sister of wild and lawless brothers. It seemed to me that nature, less unconventional than the old poets, must make use almost exclusively of the elements common to the family, and I was unable to credit her with enough power of invention to construct, out of materials analogous to those that composed a fool and clod, a lofty mind without the least strain of clownishness, a saint unsoiled by any brutality. Mme. de Marsantes was wearing a gown of white surah embroidered with large palms, on which stood out flowers of a different material, these being black. This was because, three weeks earlier, she had lost her cousin, M. de Montmorency, a bereavement which did not prevent her from paying calls or even from going to small dinners, but always in mourning. She was a great lady. Atavism had filled her with the frivolity of generations of life at court, with all the superficial, rigorous duties that that implies. Mme. de Marsantes had not had the strength of character to regret for any length of time the death of her father and mother, but she would not for anything in the world have appeared in colours in the month following that of a cousin. She was more than pleasant to me, both because I was Robert\u2019s friend and because I did not move in the same world as he. This pleasantness was accompanied by a pretence of shyness, by that sort of intermittent withdrawal of the voice, the eyes, the mind which a woman draws back to her like a skirt that has indiscreetly spread, so as not to take up too much room, to remain stiff and erect even in her suppleness, as a good upbringing teaches. A good upbringing which must not, however, be taken too literally, many of these ladies passing very swiftly into a complete dissolution of morals without ever losing the almost childlike correctness of their manners. Mme. de Marsantes was a trifle irritating in conversation since, whenever she had occasion to speak of a plebeian, as for instance Bergotte or Elstir, she would say, isolating the word, giving it its full value, intoning it on two different notes with a modulation peculiar to the Guermantes: \u201cI have had the honour, the great hon-our of meeting Monsieur Bergotte,\u201d or \u201cof making the acquaintance of Monsieur Elstir\u201d whether that her hearers might marvel at her humility or from the sam tendency that Mme. de Guermantes shewed to revert to the use of obsolete forms, as a protest against the slovenly usages of the present day, in which people never professed themselves sufficiently \u2018honoured.\u2019 Whichever Of these was the true reason, one felt that when Mme. de Marsantes said: \u201cI have had the honour, the great hon-our,\u201d she felt she was playing an important part and shewing that she could take in the names of distinguished men as she would have welcomed the men themselves at her home in the country, had they happened to be in the neighbourhood. On the other hand as her family connexion was numerous, as she was devoted to all her relatives, as, slow in speech and fond of explaining things at length, she was always trying to make clear the exact degree of kinship, she found herself (without any desire to create an effect and without really caring to talk about anyone except touching peasants and sublime gamekeepers) referring incessantly to all the mediatised houses in Europe, a failing which people less brilliantly connected than herself could not forgive, and, if they were at all intellectual, derided as a sign of stupidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the country, Mme. de Marsantes was adored for the good that she did, but principally because the purity of a strain of blood into which for many generations there had flowed only what was greatest in the history of France had taken from her manner everything that the lower orders call \u2018manners,\u2019 and had given her a perfect simplicity. She never shrank from kissing a poor woman who was in trouble, and would tell her to come up to the castle for a cartload of wood. She was, people said, the perfect Christian. She was determined to find an immensely rich wife for Robert. Being a great lady means playing the great lady, that is to say, to a certain extent, playing at simplicity. It is a pastime which costs an extremely high price, all the more because simplicity charms people only on condition that they know that you are not bound to live simply, that is to say that you are very rich. Some one said to me afterwards, when I had told him of my meeting her: \u201cYou saw of course that she must have been lovely as a young woman.\u201d But true beauty is so individual, so novel always, that one does not recognise it as beauty. I said to myself this afternoon only that she had a tiny nose, very blue eyes, a long neck and a sad expression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cListen,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the Duchesse de Guermantes, \u201cI\u2019m expecting a woman at any moment whom you don\u2019t wish to know. I thought I\u2019d better warn you, to avoid any unpleasantness. But you needn\u2019t be afraid, I shall never have her here again, only I was obliged to let her come to-day. It\u2019s Swann\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Swann, seeing the dimensions that the Dreyfus case had begun to assume, and fearing that her husband\u2019s racial origin might be used against herself, had besought him never again to allude to the prisoner\u2019s innocence. When he was not present she went farther and used to profess the most ardent Nationalism; in doing which she was only following the example of Mme. Verdurin, in whom a middle-class anti-semitism, latent hitherto, had awakened and grown to a positive fury. Mme. Swann had won by this attitude the privilege of membership in several of the women\u2019s leagues that were beginning to be formed in anti-semitic society, and had succeeded in making friends with various members of the aristocracy. It may seem strange that, so far from following their example, the Duchesse de Guermantes, so close a friend of Swann, had on the contrary always resisted his desire, which he had not concealed from her, to introduce to her his wife. But we shall see in due course that this arose from the peculiar nature of the Duchess, who held that she was not \u2018bound to\u2019 do things, and laid down with despotic force what had been decided by her social \u2018free will,\u2019 which was extremely arbitrary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d said the Duchess. \u201cIt would indeed be most unpleasant. But as I know her by sight I shall be able to get away in time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI assure you, Oriane, she is really quite nice; an excellent woman,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have no doubt she is, but I feel no need to assure myself of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you been invited to Lady Israels\u2019s?\u201d Mme. de Villeparisis asked the Duchess, to change the conversation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, thank heaven, I don\u2019t know the woman,\u201d replied Mme. de Guermantes. \u201cYou must ask Marie-Aynard. She knows her. I never could make out why.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI did indeed know her at one time,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes. \u201cI confess my faults. But I have decided not to know her any more. It seems she\u2019s one of the very worst of them, and makes no attempt to conceal it. Besides, we have all been too trusting, too hospitable. I shall never go near anyone of that race again. While we had old friends, country cousins, people of our own flesh and blood on whom we shut our doors, we threw them open to Jews. And now we see what thanks we get from them. But I\u2019ve no right to speak; I have an adorable son, and, like a young fool, he says and does all the maddest things you can imagine,\u201d she went on, having caught some allusion by M. d\u2019Argencourt to Robert. \u201cBut, talking of Robert, haven\u2019t you seen him?\u201d she asked Mme. de Villeparisis; \u201cbeing Saturday, I thought he\u2019d be coming to Paris on leave, and in that case he would be sure to pay you a visit.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact Mme. de Marsantes thought that her son would not obtain leave that week; but knowing that, even if he did, he would never dream of coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis, she hoped, by making herself appear to have expected to find him in the room, to procure his forgiveness from her susceptible aunt for all the visits that he had failed to pay her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert here! But I have never had a single word from him; I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen him since Balbec.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is so busy; he has so much to do,\u201d pleaded Mme. de Marsantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A faint smile made Mme. de Guermantes\u2019s eyelashes quiver as she studied the circle which, with the point of her sunshade, she was tracing on the carpet. Whenever the Duke had been too openly unfaithful to his wife, Mme. de Marsantes had always taken up the cudgels against her own brother on her sister-in-law\u2019s behalf. The latter had a grateful and bitter memory of this protection, and was not herself seriously shocked by Robert\u2019s pranks. At this point the door opened again and Robert himself entered the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, talk of the Saint!\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes, who had her back to the door, had not seen her son come in. When she did catch sight of him, her motherly bosom was convulsed with joy, as by the beating of a wing, her body half rose her seat, her face quivered and she fastened on Robert eyes big astonishment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat! You\u2019ve come! How delightful! What a surprise!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! Talk of the Saint! \u2014 I see,\u201d cried the Belgian diplomat, with a shout of laughter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDelicious, ain\u2019t it?\u201d came tartly from the Duchess, who hated puns and had ventured on this one only with a pretence of making fun of herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood afternoon, Robert,\u201d she said, \u201cI believe he\u2019s forgotten his aunt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0They talked for a moment, probably about myself, for as Saint-Loup was leaving her to join his mother Mme. de Guermantes turned to me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood afternoon; how are you?\u201d was her greeting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She allowed to rain on me the light of her azure gaze, hesitated for a moment, unfolded and stretched towards me the stem of her arm, leaned forward her body which sprang rapidly backwards like a bush that has been pulled down to the ground and, on being released, returns to its natural position. Thus she acted under the fire of Saint-Loup\u2019s eyes, which kept her under observation and were making frantic efforts to obtain some further concession still from his aunt. Fearing that our conversation might fail altogether, he joined in, to stimulate it, and answered for me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe\u2019s not very well just now, he gets rather tired; I think he would be a great deal better, by the way, if he saw you more often, for I can\u2019t help telling you that he admires you immensely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, but that\u2019s very nice of him,\u201d said Mme. de Guermantes in a deliberately casual tone, as if I had brought her her cloak. \u201cI am most flattered.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLook, I must go and talk to my mother for a minute; take my chair,\u201d said Saint-Loup, thus forcing me to sit down next to his aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were both silent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI see you sometimes in the morning,\u201d she said, as though she were telling me something that I did not know, and I for my part had never seen her. \u201cIt\u2019s so good for one, a walk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOriane,\u201d began Mme. de Marsantes in a low tone, \u201cyou said you were going on to Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u2019s; would you be so very kind as to tell her not to expect me to dinner, I shall stay at home now that I\u2019ve got Robert. And one other thing, but I hardly like to ask you, if you would leave word as you pass to tell them to send out at once for a box of the cigars Robert likes. \u2018Corona,\u2019 they\u2019re called. I\u2019ve none in the house.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert came up to us; he had caught only the name of Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWho in the world is Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol?\u201d he inquired, in a sur \u2014 prised but decisive tone, for he affected a studied ignorance of everything to do with society\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, my dear boy, you know quite well,\u201d said his mother. \u201cShe\u2019s Vermandois\u2019s sister. It was she gave you that nice billiard table you liked so much.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, she\u2019s Vermandois\u2019s sister, I had no idea of that. Really, my family are amazing,\u201d he went on, turning so as to include me in the conversation and adopting unconsciously Bloch\u2019s intonation just as he borrowed his ideas, \u201cthey know the most unheard-of people, people called Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u201d (emphasising the final consonant of each word) \u201cand names like that; they go to balls, they drive in victorias, they lead a fabulous existence. It\u2019s prodigious.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes made in her throat a slight, short, sharp sound, as of an involuntary laugh which one chokes back, meaning thereby to shew that she paid just as much tribute as the laws of kinship imposed on her to her nephew\u2019s wit. A servant came in to say that the Prince von Faffenheim-Munsterburg-Weinigen had sent word to M. de Norpois that he was waiting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBring him in, sir,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to the old Ambassador, who started in quest of the German Minister\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cStop, sir; do you think I ought to shew him the miniature of the Empress Charlotte?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be delighted,\u201d said the Ambassador in a tone of conviction, and as though he were envying the fortunate Minister the favour that was in store for him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, I know he\u2019s very sound,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes, \u201cand that is so rare among foreigners. But I\u2019ve found out all about him. He is anti-semitism personified.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Prince\u2019s name preserved in the boldness with which its opening syllables were \u2014 to borrow an expression from music \u2014 attacked, and in the stammering repetition that scanned them, the impulse, the mannered simplicity, the heavy delicacies of the Teutonic race, projected like green boughs over the \u2018heim\u2019 of dark blue enamel which glowed with the mystic light of a Rhenish window behind the pale and finely wrought gildings of the German eighteenth century. This name included, among the several names of which it was composed, that of a little German watering-place to which as a child I had gone with my grandmother, at the foot of a mountain honoured by the feet of Goethe, from the vineyards of which we used to drink, at the Kurhof, their illustrious vintages with elaborate and sonorous names, like the epithets which Homer applies to his heroes. And so, scarcely had I heard the Prince\u2019s name spoken than, before I had recalled the watering-place, the name itself seemed to shrink, to grow rich with humanity, to find large enough a little place in my memory to which it clung, familiar, earth to earth, picturesque, savoury, light, with something about it, too, that was authorised, prescribed. And then, M. de Guermantes, in explaining who the Prince was, quoted a number of his titles, and I recognised the name of a village threaded by the river on which, every evening, my cure finished for the day, I used to go in a boat amid the mosquitoes, and that of a forest so far away that the doctor would not allow me to make the excursion to it. And indeed it was comprehensible that the suzerainty of the lord extended to the surrounding places and associated afresh in the enumeration of his titles the names which one could read, close together, upon a map. Thus beneath the visor of the Prince of the Holy Roman Empire and Knight of Franconia it was the face of a dear and smiling land, on which had often lingered for me the light of the six-o\u2019clock sun, that I saw, at any rate before the Prince, Rheingraf and Elector Palatine had entered the room. For I speedily learned that the revenues which he drew from the forest and river, peopled with gnomes and undines, and from the enchanted mountain on which rose the ancient Burg that cherished memories of Luther and Lewis the Germanic, he employed in keeping five Charron motor-cars, a house in Paris and one in London, a box on Mondays at the Opera and another for the \u2018Tuesdays\u2019 at the \u2018Fran\u00e7ais.\u2019 He did not seem to me, nor did he seem to regard himself as different from other men of similar fortune and age who had a less poetic origin. He had their culture, their ideals, he was proud of his rank, but purely on account of the advantages it conferred on him, and had now only one ambition in life, to be elected a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences, which was the reason of his coming to see Mme. de Villeparisis. If he, whose wife was a leader of the most exclusive set in Berlin, had begged to be introduced to the Marquise, it was not the result of any desire on his part for her acquaintance. Devoured for years past by this ambition to be elected to the Institute, he had unfortunately never been in a position to reckon above five the number of Academicians who seemed prepared to vote for him. He knew that M. de Norpois could by himself dispose of at least ten others, a number which he was capable, by skilful negotiations, of increasing still further. And so the Prince, who had known him in Russia when they were both there as Ambassadors, had gone to see him and had done everything in his power to win him over. But in vain might he multiply his friendly overtures, procure for the Marquis Russian decorations, quote him in articles on foreign politics; he had had before him an ingrate, a man in whose eyes all these attentions appeared to count as nothing, who had not advanced the prospects of his candidature one inch, had not even promised him his own vote. No doubt M. de Norpois received him with extreme politeness, indeed begged that he would not put himself out and \u201ctake the trouble to come so far out of his way,\u201d went himself to the Prince\u2019s residence, and when the Teutonic Knight had launched his: \u201cI should like immensely to be your colleague,\u201d replied in a tone of deep emotion: \u201cAh! I should be most happy!\u201d And no doubt a simpleton, a Dr. Cottard would have said to himself: \u201cWell, here he is in my house; it was he who insisted on coming, because he regards me as a more important person than himself; he tells me that he would be happy to see me in the Academy; words do have some meaning after all, damn it, probably if he doesn\u2019t offer to vote for me it is because it hasn\u2019t occurred to him. He lays so much stress on my great influence; presumably he imagines that larks drop into my mouth ready roasted, that I have all the support I want, and that is why he doesn\u2019t offer me his; but I have only got to get him with his back to the wall, and just say to him quietly: \u2018Very well, vote for me, will you?\u2019 and he will be obliged to do it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Prince von Faffenheim was no simpleton. He was what Dr. Cottard would have called \u2018a fine diplomat\u2019 and he knew that M. de Norpois was no less fine a one than himself, nor a man who would have failed to realise without needing to be told that he could confer a favour on a candidate by voting for him. The Prince, in his Embassies and as Foreign Minister, had conducted, on his country\u2019s behalf instead of, as in the present instance, his own, many of those conversations in which one knows beforehand just bow far one is prepared to go and at what point one will decline to commit oneself. He was not unaware that, in this diplomatic language, to talk meant to offer. And it was for this reason that he had arranged for M. de Norpois to receive the Cordon of Saint Andrew. But if he had had to report to his Government the conversation which he had subsequently had with M. de Norpois, he would have stated in his dispatch: \u201cI realised that I had gone the wrong way to work.\u201d For as soon as he had returned to the subject of the Institute, M. de Norpois had repeated:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should like nothing better; nothing could be better, for my colleagues. They ought, I consider, to feel genuinely honoured that you should have thought of them. It is a really interesting candidature, a little outside our ordinary course. As you know, the Academy is very conventional, it takes fright at everything which has at all a novel sound. Personally, I deplore this. How often have I had occasion to say as much to my colleagues! I cannot be sure, God forgive me, that I did not even once let the word \u2018hidebound\u2019 escape me,\u201d he added, in an undertone, with a scandalised smile, almost aside, as in a scene on the stage, casting at the Prince a rapid, sidelong glance from his blue eyes, like a veteran actor studying the effect on his audience. \u201cYou understand, Prince, that I should not care to allow a personality so eminent as yourself to embark on a venture which was hopeless from the start. So long as my colleagues\u2019 ideas linger so far behind the times, I consider that the wiser course will be to abstain. But you may rest assured that if I were ever to discern a mind that was a little more modern, a little more alive, shewing itself in that college, which is tending to become a mausoleum, if I could reckon upon any possible chance of your success, I should be the first to inform you of it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Cordon was a mistake,\u201d thought the Prince; \u201cthe negotiations have not advanced in the least; that is not what he wanted. I have not yet laid my hand on the right key.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was a kind of reasoning of which M. de Norpois, formed in the same school as the Prince, would also have been capable. One may mock at the Pedantic silliness with which diplomats of the Norpois type go into ecstasies over some piece of official wording which is, for all practical purposes, meaningless. But their childishness has this compensation; diplomats know that, in the loaded scales which assure that European or other equilibrium which we call peace, good feeling, sounding speeches, earnest entreaties weigh very little; and that the heavy weight, the true determinant consists in something else, in the possibility which the adversary does (if he is strong enough) or does not enjoy of satisfying, in exchange for what one oneself wants, a desire. With this order of truths, which an entirely disinterested person, such as my grandmother for instance, would not have understood M. de Norpois and Prince von Faffenheim had frequently had to deal. Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires in countries with which we had been within an ace of going to war, M. de Norpois, in his anxiety as to the turn which events were about to take, knew very well that it was not by the word \u2018Peace,\u2019 nor by the word \u2018War\u2019 that it would be revealed to him, but by some other, apparently commonplace word, a word of terror or blessing, which the diplomat, by the aid of his cipher, would immediately read and to which, to safeguard the honour of France, he would respond in another word, quite as commonplace, but one beneath which the Minister of the enemy nation would at once see written: \u2018War.\u2019 Moreover, in accordance with a time-honoured custom, analogous to that which gave to the first meeting between two young people promised to one another in marriage the form of a chance encounter at a performance in the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase, the dialogue in the course of which destiny was to dictate the word \u2018War\u2019 or the word \u2018Peace\u2019 was held, as a rule, not in the ministerial sanctum but on a bench in a Kurgarten where the Minister and M. de Norpois went independently to a thermal spring to drink at its source their little tumblers of some curative water. By a sort of tacit convention they met at the hour appointed for their cure, began by taking together a short stroll which, beneath its innocent appearance, each of the speakers knew to be as tragic as an order for mobilisation. And so, in a private matter like this nomination for election to the Institute, the Prince had employed the same system of induction which had served him in his public career, the same method of reading beneath superimposed symbols\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And certainly it would be wrong to pretend that my grandmother and the few who resembled her would have been alone in their failure to understand this kind of calculation. For one thing, the average human being, practising a profession the lines of which have been laid down for him from the start, comes near, by his want of intuition, to the ignorance which my grandmother owed to her lofty disinterestedness. Often one has to come down to \u2018kept\u2019 persons, male or female, before one finds the hidden spring of actions or words apparently of the most innocent nature in self-interest, in the bare necessity to keep alive. What man does not know that when a woman whom he is going to pay says to him: \u201cDon\u2019t let\u2019s talk about money,\u201d the speech must be regarded as what is called in music \u2018a silent beat\u2019 and that if, later on, she declares: \u201cYou are far too much trouble; you are always keeping things from me; I\u2019ve done with you,\u201d he must interpret this as: \u201cSome one else has been offering me more.\u201d And yet this is only the language of a lady of easy virtue, not so far removed from the ladies in society. The apache furnishes more striking examples. But M. as Norpois and the German Prince, if apaches and their ways were unknown to them, had been accustomed to living on the same plane as nations, which are also, despite their greatness, creatures of selfishness and cunning, kept in order only by force, by consideration of their material interests which may drive them to murder, a murder that is often symbolic also, since its mere hesitation or refusal to fight may spell for a nation the word \u2018Perish. But inasmuch as all this is not set forth in Yellow and otherwise coloured Books, the people as a whole are naturally pacific; should they be warlike, it is instinctively, from hatred, from a sense of injury, not for the reasons which have made up the mind of their ruler, on the advice of his Norpois\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The following winter the Prince was seriously ill; he recovered, but his heart was permanently affected\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe devil!\u201d he said to himself, \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose any time over the Institute. If I wait too long, I may be dead before they elect me. That really would be unpleasant.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He composed, on the foreign politics of the last twenty years, an essay for the Revue des Deux Mondes, in which he referred more than once, and in the most flattering terms, to M. de Norpois. The French diplomat called upon him to thank him. He added that he did not know how to express his gratitude. The Prince said to himself, like a man who has been trying to fit various keys into a stubborn lock: \u201cStill not the right one!\u201d and, feeling somewhat out of breath as he shewed M. de Norpois to the door, thought: \u201cDamn it, these fellows will see me in my grave before letting me in. We must hurry up.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That evening, he met M. de Norpois again at the Opera\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy dear Ambassador,\u201d he began to him, \u201cyou told me to-day that you did not know what you could do to prove your gratitude; it was a great exaggeration, for you owe me none, but I am going to be so indelicate as to take you at your word.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Norpois had no less high an esteem for the Prince\u2019s tact than the Prince had for his. He understood at once that it was not a request that Prince von Faffenheim was about to present to him, but an offer, and with a radiant affability made ready to hear it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell now, you will think me highly indiscreet. There are two people to whom I am greatly attached \u2014 in quite different ways, as you will understand in a moment \u2014 two people both of whom have recently settled in Paris, where they intend to remain for the future: my wife, and the Grand Duchess John. They are thinking of giving a few dinners, chiefly in honour of the King and Queen of England, and what they would have liked more than anything in the world would have been to be able to offer their guests the company of a person for whom, without knowing her, they both of them feel a great admiration. I confess that I did not know how I was going to gratify their wish when I learned just now, by the most extraordinary accident, that you were a friend of this person. I know that she lives a most retired life, and sees only a very few people \u2014\u2018happy few,\u2019 as Stendhal would say \u2014 but if you were to give me your backing, with the generosity that you have always shewn me, I am sure that she would allow you to present me to her and to convey to her the wishes of both the Grand Duchess and the Princess. Perhaps she would consent to dine with us, when the Queen of England comes, and then (one never knows) if we don\u2019t bore her too much, to spend the Easter holidays with us at Beaulieu, at the Grand Duchess John\u2019s. The person I allude to is called the Marquise de Villeparisis. I confess that the hope of becoming one of the frequenters of such a school of wit would console me, would make me contemplate without regret the abandoning of my attempt at the Institute. For in her house, too, I understand, there is a regular flow of intellect and brilliant talk.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With an inexpressible sense of pleasure the Prince felt that the lock no longer resisted, and that at last the key was turning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSuch an alternative is wholly unnecessary, my dear Prince,\u201d replied M. de Norpois; \u201cnothing is more in harmony with the Institute than the house you speak of, which is a regular hotbed of Academicians. I shall convey your request to Mme. la Marquise de Villeparisis: she will undoubtedly be flattered. As for her dining with you, she goes out very little and that will perhaps be more difficult to arrange. But I shall present you to her and you can plead your cause in person. You must on no account give up the Academy; to-morrow fortnight, as it happens, I shall be having luncheon, before going on with him to an important meeting, at Leroy-Beaulieu\u2019s, without whom nobody can be elected; I had already allowed myself in conversation with him to let fall your name, with which, naturally, he was perfectly familiar. He raised certain objections. But it so happens that he requires the support of my group at the next election, and I fully intend to return to the charge; I shall tell him quite openly of the wholly cordial ties that unite us, I shall not conceal from him that, if you were to stand, I should ask all my friends to vote for you,\u201d (here the Prince breathed a deep sigh of relief) \u201cand he knows that I have friends. I consider that if I were to succeed in obtaining his assistance your chances would become very strong. Come that evening, at six, to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s; I will introduce you to her and I can give you an account then of my conversation with him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus it was that Prince von Faffenheim had been led to call upon Mme. de Villeparisis. My profound disillusionment occurred when he spoke. It had never struck me that, if an epoch in history has features both particular and general which are stronger than those of a nationality, so that in a biographical dictionary with illustrations, which go so far as to include an authentic portrait of Minerva, Leibniz with his wig and ruff differs little from Marivaux or Samuel Bernard, a nationality has particular features stronger than those of a caste. In the present instance these were rendered before me not by a discourse in which I had expected, before I saw him, to hear the rustling of the elves and the dance of the kobolds, but by a transposition which certified no less plainly that poetic origin: the fact that, as he bowed, short, red, corpulent, over the hand of Mme. de Villeparisis, the Rheingraf said to her: \u201cAow to you too, Matame la Marquise,\u201d in the accent of an Alsatian porter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWon\u2019t you let me give you a cup of tea or a little of this cake; it is so good?\u201d Mme. de Guermantes asked me, anxious to have shewn herself as friendly as possible. \u201cI do the honours in this house just as if it was mine,\u201d she explained in an ironical tone which gave a slightly guttural sound to her voice, as though she were trying to stifle a hoarse laugh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir,\u201d said Mme. de Villeparisis to M. de Norpois, \u201cyou won\u2019t forget that you have something to say to the Prince about the Academy?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Guermantes lowered her eyes and gave a semicircular turn to her wrist to look at the time\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGracious! I must fly at once if I\u2019m to get to Mme. de Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol\u2019s, and I\u2019m dining with Mme. Leroi.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she rose without bidding me good-bye. She had just caught sight of Mme. Swann, who appeared considerably embarrassed at finding me in the room. She remembered, doubtless, that she had been the first to assure me that she was convinced of Dreyfus\u2019s innocence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t want my mother to introduce me to Mme. Swann,\u201d Saint-Loup said to me. \u201cShe\u2019s an ex-whore. Her husband\u2019s a Jew, and she comes here to pose as a Nationalist. Hallo, here\u2019s Uncle Palam\u00e8de.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The arrival of Mme. Swann had a special interest for me, due to an incident which had occurred a few days earlier and which I am obliged to record on account of the consequences which it was to have at a much later date, as the reader will learn in due course. Well, a few days before this visit to Mme. de Villeparisis, I had myself received a visitor whom I little expected, namely Charles Morel, the son (though I had never heard of his existence) of my great-uncle\u2019s old servant. This great-uncle (he in whose house I had met the lady in pink) had died the year before. His servant had more than once expressed his intention of coming to see me; I had no idea of the object of his visit, but should have been glad to see him for I had learned from Fran\u00e7oise that he had a genuine veneration for my uncle\u2019s memory and made a pilgrimage regularly to the cemetery in which he was buried. But, being obliged, for reasons of health, to retire to his home in the country, where he expected to remain for some time, he delegated the duty to his son. I was surprised to see come into my room a handsome young fellow of eighteen, dressed with expensive rather than good taste, but looking, all the same, like anything in the world except the son of a gentleman\u2019s servant. He made a point, moreover, at the start of our conversation, of severing all connexion with the domestic class from which he sprang, by informing me, with a smile of satisfaction, that he had won the first prize at the Conservatoire. The object of his visit to me was as follows: his father, when going through the effects of my uncle Adolphe, had set aside some which, he felt, could not very well be sent to my parents but were at the same time of a nature likely to interest a young man of my age. These were the photographs of the famous actresses, the notorious courtesans whom my uncle had known, the last fading pictures of that gay life of a man about town which he divided by a watertight compartment from his family life. While young Morel was shewing them to me, I noticed that he addressed me as though he were speaking to an equal. He derived from saying \u2018you\u2019 to me as often, and \u2018sir\u2019 as seldom, as possible the pleasure natural in one whose father had never ventured, when addressing my parents, upon anything but the third person. Almost all these photographs bore an inscription such as: \u201cTo my best friend.\u201d One actress, less grateful and more circumspect than the rest, had written: \u201cTo the best of friends,\u201d which enabled her (so I was assured) to say afterwards that my uncle was in no sense and had never been her best friend but was merely the friend who had done the most little services for her, the friend she made use of, a good, kind man, in other words an old fool. In vain might young Morel seek to divest himself of his lowly origin, one felt that the shade of my uncle Adolphe, venerable and gigantic in the eyes of the old servant, had never ceased to hover, almost a holy vision, over the childhood and boyhood of the son. While I was turning over the photographs Charles Morel examined my room. And as I was looking for some place in which I might keep them, \u201cHow is it,\u201d he asked me (in a tone in which the reproach had no need to find expression, so im, plicit was it in the words themselves), \u201cthat I don\u2019t see a single photograph of your uncle in your room?\u201d I felt the blood rise to my cheeks and stammered: \u201cWhy, I don\u2019t believe I have such a thing.\u201d \u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t one photograph of your uncle Adolphe, who was so devoted to you! I\u2014 will send you one of my governor\u2019s \u2014 he has quantities of them \u2014 and I hope you will set it up in the place of honour above that chest of drawers, which came to you from your uncle.\u201d It is true that, as I had not even a photograph of my father or mother in my room, there was nothing so very shocking in there not being one of my uncle Adolphe. But it was easy enough to see that for old Morel, who had trained his son in the same way of thinking, my uncle was the important person in the family, my parents only reflecting a diminished light from his. I was in higher favour, because my uncle used constantly to say that I was going to turn out a sort of Racine, or Vaulabelle, and Morel regarded me almost as an adopted son, as a child by election of my uncle. I soon discovered that this young man was extremely \u2018pushing.\u2019 Thus at this first meeting he asked me, being something of a composer as well and capable of setting short poems to music, whether I knew any poet who had a good position in society. I mentioned one. He did not know the work of this poet and had never heard his name, of which he made a note. Well, I found out that shortly afterwards he wrote to the poet telling him that, a fanatical admirer of his work, he, Morel, had composed a musical setting for one of his sonnets and would be grateful if the author would arrange for its performance at the Comtesse So-and-So\u2019s. This was going a little too fast, and exposing his hand. The poet, taking offence, made no reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the rest, Charles Morel seemed to have, besides his ambition, a strong leaning towards more concrete realities. He had noticed, as he came through the courtyard, Jupien\u2019s niece at work upon a waistcoat, and although he explained to me only that he happened to want a fancy waistcoat at that very moment, I felt that the girl had made a vivid impression on him. He had no hesitation about asking me to come downstairs and introduce him to her, \u201cbut not as a connexion of your family, you follow me, I rely on your discretion not to drag in my father, say just a distinguished artist of your acquaintance, you know how important it is to make a good impression on tradespeople.\u201d Albeit he had suggested to me that, not knowing him well enough to call him, he quite realised,\u2018dear friend,\u2019 I might address him, before the girl, in some such terms as \u201cnot dear master, of course,.. although . . . well, if you like, dear distinguished artist,\u201d once in the shop, I avoided \u2018qualifying\u2019 him, as Saint-Simon would have expressed it, and contented myself with reiterating his \u2018you.\u2019 He picked out from several patterns of velvet one of the brightest red imaginable and so loud that, for all his bad taste, he was never able to wear the waistcoat when it was made. The girl settled down to work again with her two \u2018apprentices,\u2019 but it struck me that the impression had been mutual, and that Charles Morel, whom she regarded as of her own \u2018station\u2019 (only smarter and richer), had proved singularly attractive to her. As I had been greatly surprised to find among the photographs which his father had sent me one of the portrait of Miss Sacripant (otherwise Odette) by Elstir, I said to Charles Morel as I went with him to the outer gate: \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you can tell me, but did my uncle know this lady well? I don\u2019t see at what stage in his life I can fit her in exactly; and it interests me, because of M. Swann . . . \u201d \u201cWhy, if I wasn\u2019t forgetting to tell you that my father asked me specially to draw your attention to that lady\u2019s picture. As a matter of fact, she was \u2018lunching\u2019 with your uncle the last time you ever saw him. My father was in two minds whether to let you in. It seems you made a great impression on the wench, and she hoped to see more of you. But just at that time there was some trouble in the family, by what my father tells me, and you never set eyes on your uncle again.\u201d He broke off with a smile of farewell, across the courtyard, at Jupien\u2019s niece. She was watching him and admiring, no doubt, his thin face and regular features, his fair hair and sparkling eyes. I, as I gave him my hand, was thinking of Mme. Swann and saying to myself with amazement, so far apart, so different were they in my memory, that I should have henceforth to identify her with the \u2018Lady in pink.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus was not long in taking his place by the side of Mme. Swann. At every social gathering at which he appeared and, contemptuous towards the men, courted by the women, promptly attached himself to the smartest of the latter, whose garments he seemed almost to put on as an ornament to his own, the Baron\u2019s frock coat or swallowtails made one think of a portrait by some great painter of a man dressed in black but having by his side, thrown over a chair, the brilliantly coloured cloak which he is about to wear at some costume ball. This partnership, generally with some royal lady, secured for M. de Charlus various privileges which he liked to enjoy. For instance, one result of it was that his hostesses, at theatricals or concerts, allowed the Baron alone to have a front seat, in a row of ladies, while the rest of the men were crowded together at the back of the room. And then besides, completely absorbed, it seemed, in repeating, at the top of his voice, amusing stories to the enraptured lady, M. de Charlus was dispensed from the necessity of going to shake hands with any of the others, was set free, in other words, from all social duties. Behind the scented barrier in which the beauty of his choice enclosed him, he was isolated amid a crowded drawing-room, as, in a crowded theatre or concert-hall, behind the rampart of a box; and when anyone came up to greet him, through, so to speak, the beauty of his companion, it was permissible for him to reply quite curtly and without interrupting his business of conversation with a lady. Certainly Mme. Swann was scarcely of the rank of the people with whom he liked thus to flaunt himself. But he professed admiration for her, friendship for Swann, he knew that she would be flattered by his attentions and was himself flattered at being compromised by the prettiest woman in the room\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis meanwhile was not too well pleased to receive a visit from M. de Charlus. He, while admitting serious defects in his aunt\u2019s character, was genuinely fond of her. But every now and then, carried away by anger, by an imaginary grievance, he would sit down and write to her without making any attempt to resist his impulse, letters full of the most violent abuse, in which in made the most of trifling incidents which until then he seemed never even to have noticed. Among other examples I may instance the following, which my stay at Balbec brought to my knowledge-Mme. de Villeparisis, fearing that she had not brought enough money with her to Balbec to enable her to prolong her holiday there, and not caring since she was of a thrifty disposition and shrank from unnecessary expenditure, to have money sent to her from Paris, had borrowed three thousand francs from M. de Charlus. A month later, annoyed, for some trivial reason, with his aunt, he asked her to repay him this sum by telegraph. He received two thousand nine hundred and ninety-odd francs. Meeting his aunt a few days later in Paris, in the course of a friendly conversation, he drew her attention, with the utmost politeness, to the mistake that her banker had made when sending the money. \u201cBut there was no mistake,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis, \u201cthe money order cost six francs seventy-five.\u201d \u201cOh, of course, if it was intentional, it is all right,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cI mentioned it only in case you didn\u2019t know, because in that case, if the bank had done the same thing with anyone who didn\u2019t know you as well as I do, it might have led to unpleasantness.\u201d \u201cNo, no, there was no mistake.\u201d \u201cAfter all, you were quite right,\u201d M. de Charlus concluded easily, stooping to kiss his aunt\u2019s hand. And in fact he bore no resentment and was only amused at this little instance of her thrift. But some time afterwards, imagining that, in a family matter, his aunt had been trying to get the better of him and had \u2018worked up a regular conspiracy\u2019 against him, as she took shelter, foolishly enough, behind the lawyers with whom he suspected her of having plotted to undo him, he had written her a letter boiling over with insolence and rage. \u201cI shall not be satisfied with having my revenge,\u201d he added as a postscript; \u201cI shall take care to make you a laughing-stock. Tomorrow I shall tell everyone the story of the money order and the six francs seventy-five you kept back from me out of the three thousand I lent you; I shall disgrace you publicly.\u201d Instead of so doing, he had gone to his aunt the next day to beg her pardon, having already regretted a letter in which he had used some really terrible language. But apart from this, to whom could he have told the story of the money order? Seeking no longer vengeance but a sincere reconciliation, now was the time for him to keep silence. But already he had repeated the story everywhere, while still on the best of terms with his aunt; he had told it without any malice, as a joke, and because he was the soul of indiscretion. He had repeated the story, but without Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s knowledge. With the result that, having learned from his letter that he intended to disgrace her by making public a transaction in which he had told her with his own lips that she had acted rightly, she concluded that he had been deceiving her from the first, and had lied when he pretended to be fond of her. This storm had now died down, but neither of them knew what opinion exactly the other had of her or him. This sort of intermittent quarrel is of course somewhat exceptional. Of a different order were the quarrels of Bloch and his friends. Of a dif \u2014 ferent order again were those of M. de Charlus, as we shall presently see, with people wholly unlike Mme. de Villeparisis. In spite of which we must bear in mind that the opinions which we hold of one another, our relations with friends and kinsfolk, are in no sense permanent, save in appearance, but are as eternally fluid as the sea itself. Whence all the rumours of divorce between couples who have always seemed so perfectly united and will soon afterwards speak of one another with affection, hence all the terrible things said by one friend of another from whom we supposed him to be inseparable and with whom we shall find him once more reconciled before we have had time to recover from our surprise; all the ruptures of alliances, after so short a time, between nations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI say, my uncle and Mme. Swann are getting warm over there!\u201d remarked Saint-Loup. \u201cAnd look at Mamma in the innocence of her heart going across to disturb them. To the pure all things are pure, I suppose!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I studied M. de Charlus. The tuft of his grey hair, his eye, the brow of which was raised by his monocle to emit a smile, the red flowers in his buttonhole formed, so to speak, the three mobile apices of a convulsive and striking triangle. I had not ventured to bow to him, for he had given me no sign of recognition. And yet, albeit he had not turned his head in my direction, I was convinced that he had seen me; while he repeated some story to Mme. Swann, whose sumptuous, pansy-coloured cloak floated actually over the Baron\u2019s knee, his roving eye, like that of a street hawker who is watching all the time for the \u2018tecs\u2019 to appear, had certainly explored every corner of the room and taken note of all the people who were in it. M. de Ch\u00e2tellerault came up to bid him good day without any indication on M. de Charlus\u2019s face that he had seen the young Duke until he was actually standing in front of him. In this way, in fairly numerous gatherings such as this, M. de Charlus kept almost continuously on show a smile without any definite direction or particular object, which, pre-existing before the greetings of new arrivals, found itself, when these entered its zone, devoid of any indication of friendliness towards them. Nevertheless, it was obviously my duty to go across and speak to Mme. Swann. But as she was not certain whether I already knew Mme. de Marsantes and M. de Charlus, she was distinctly cold, fearing no doubt that I might ask her to introduce me to them. I then made my way to M. de Charlus, and at once regretted it, for though he could not have helped seeing me he shewed no sign whatsoever. As I stood before him and bowed I found standing out from his body, which it prevented me from approaching by the full length of his outstretched arm, a finger widowed, one would have said, of an episcopal ring, of which he appeared to be offering, for the kiss of the faithful, the consecrated site, and I was made to appear to have penetrated, without leave from the Baron and by an act of trespass for which he would hold me permanently responsible, the anonymous and vacant dispersion of his smile. This coldness was hardly of a kind to encourage Mme. Swann to melt from hers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHow tired and worried you look,\u201d said Mme. de Marsantes to her son who had come up to greet M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And indeed the expression in Robert\u2019s eyes seemed every minute to reach a depth from which it rose at once like a diver who has touched bottom This bottom which hurt Robert so when he touched it that he left it at once, to return to it a moment later, was the thought that he had quarrelled with his mistress\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNever mind,\u201d his mother went on, stroking his cheek, \u201cnever mind; it\u2019s good to see my little boy again.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this show of affection seeming to irritate Robert, Mme. de Marsantes led her son away to the other end of the room where in an alcove hung with yellow silk a group of Beauvais armchairs massed their violet-hued tapestries like purple irises in a field of buttercups. Mme. Swann, finding herself alone and having realised that I was a friend of Saint-Loup, beckoned to me to come and sit beside her. Not having seen her for so long I did not know what to talk to her about. I was keeping an eye on my hat, among the crowd of hats that littered the carpet, and I asked myself with a vague curiosity to whom one of them could belong which was not that of the Duc de Guermantes and yet in the lining of which a capital \u2018G\u2019 was surmounted by a ducal coronet. I knew who everyone in the room was, and could not think of anyone whose hat this could possibly be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat a pleasant man M. de Norpois is,\u201d I said to Mme. Swann, looking at the Ambassador. \u201cIt is true, Robert de Saint-Loup says he\u2019s a pest, but . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHe is quite right,\u201d she replied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeing from her face that she was thinking of something which she was keeping from me, I plied her with questions. For the satisfaction of appearing to be greatly taken up by some one in this room where she knew hardly anyone, she took me into a corner\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sure this is what M. de Saint-Loup meant,\u201d she began, \u201cbut you must never tell him I said so, for he would think me indiscreet, and I value his esteem very highly; I am an \u2018honest Injun,\u2019 don\u2019t you know. The other day, Charlus was dining at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019s; I don\u2019t know how it was, but your name was mentioned. M. de Norpois seems to have told them \u2014 it\u2019s all too silly for words, don\u2019t go and worry yourself to death over it, nobody paid any attention, they all knew only too well the mischievous tongue that said it \u2014 that you were a hypocritical little flatterer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have recorded a long way back my stupefaction at the discovery that a friend of my father, such as M. de Norpois was, could have expressed himself thus in speaking of me. I was even more astonished to learn that my emotion on that evening long ago when I had asked him about Mme. Swann and Gilberte was known to the Princesse de Guermantes, whom I imagined never to have heard of my existence. Each of our actions, our words, our attitudes is cut off from the \u2018world,\u2019 from the people who have not directly perceived it, by a medium the permeability of which is of infinite variation and remains unknown to ourselves; having learned by experience that some important utterance which we eagerly hoped would be disseminated (such as those so enthusiastic speeches which I used at one time to make to all comers and on every occasion on the subject of Mme. Swann) has found itself, often simply on account of our anxiety, immediately hidden under a bushel, how immeasurably less do we suppose that some tiny word, which we ourselves have forgotten, or else a word never ottered by us but formed on its course by the imperfect refraction of a different word, can be transported without ever halting for any obstacle to infinite distances \u2014 in the present instance to the Princesse de Guermantes \u2014 and succeed in diverting at our expense the banquet of the gods. What we actually recall of our conduct remains unknown to our nearest neighbour; what we have forgotten that we ever said, or indeed what we never did say, flies to provoke hilarity even in another planet, and the image that other people form of our actions and behaviour is no more like that which we form of them ourselves, than is like an original drawing a spoiled copy in which, at one point, for a black line, we find an empty gap, and for a blank space an unaccountable contour. It may be, all the same, that what has not been transcribed is some non-existent feature which we behold merely in our purblind self-esteem, and that what seems to us added is indeed a part of ourselves, but so essential a part as to have escaped our notice. So that this strange print which seems to us to have so little resemblance to ourselves bears sometimes the same stamp of truth, scarcely flattering, indeed, but profound and useful, as a photograph taken by X-rays. Not that that is any reason why we should recognise ourselves in it. A man who is in the habit of smiling in the glass at his handsome face and stalwart figure, if you shew him their radiograph, will have, face to face with that rosary of bones, labelled as being the image of himself, the same suspicion of error as the visitor to an art gallery who, on coming to the portrait of a girl, reads in his catalogue: \u201cDromedary resting.\u201d Later on, this discrepancy between our portraits, according as it was our own hand that drew them or another, I was to register in the case of others than myself, living placidly in the midst of a collection of photographs which they themselves had taken while round about them grinned frightful faces, invisible to them as a rule, but plunging them in stupor if an accident were to reveal them with the warning: \u201cThis is you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few years earlier I should have been only too glad to tell Mme. Swann in what connexion I had fawned upon M. de Norpois, since the connexion had been my desire to know her. But I no longer felt this desire, I was no longer in love with Gilberte. On the other hand I had not succeeded in identifying Mme. Swann with the lady in pink of my childhood. Accordingly I spoke of the woman who was on my mind at the moment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDid you see the Duchesse de Guermantes just now?\u201d I asked Mme. Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But since the Duchess did not bow to Mme. Swann when they met, the latter chose to appear to regard her as a person of no importance, whose presence in a room one did not even remark\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t know; I didn\u2019t realise her,\u201d she replied sourly, using an expression borrowed from England\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was anxious nevertheless for information with regard not only to Mme. de Guermantes but to all the people who came in contact with her, and (for all the world like Bloch), with the tactlessness of people who seek in their conversation not to give pleasure to others but to elucidate, from sheer egoism, facts that are interesting to themselves, in my effort to form an exact idea of the life of Mme. de Guermantes I questioned Mme de Villeparisis about Mme. Leroi\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, yes, I know who\u2019 you mean,\u201d she replied with an affectation of contempt, \u201cthe daughter of those rich timber people. I\u2019ve heard that she\u2019s begun to go about quite a lot lately, but I must explain to you that I am rather old now to make new acquaintances. I have known such interesting such delightful people in my time that really I do not believe Mme. Lerol would be any addition to what I already have.\u201d Mme. de Marsantes, who was playing lady in waiting to the Marquise, presented me to the Prince and, while she was still doing so, M. de Norpois also presented me in the most glowing terms. Perhaps he found it convenient to do me a courtesy which could in no way damage his credit since I had just been presented, perhaps it was because he thought that a foreigner, even so distinguished a foreigner, was unfamiliar with French society and might think that he was having introduced to him a young man of fashion, perhaps to exercise one of his prerogatives, that of adding the weight of his personal recommendation as an Ambassador, or in his taste for the archaic to revive in the Prince\u2019s honour the old custom, flattering to his rank, that two sponsors were necessary if one wished to be presented\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis appealed to M. de Norpois, feeling it imperative that I should have his assurance that she had nothing to regret in not knowing Mme. Leroi\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAm I not right, M. l\u2019Ambassadeur, Mme. Leroi is quite uninteresting, isn\u2019t she, quite out of keeping with the people who come here; I was quite right not to make friends with her, wasn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether from independence or because he was tired, M. de Norpois replied merely in a bow full of respect but devoid of meaning\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSir,\u201d went on Mme. de Villeparisis with a laugh, \u201cthere are some absurd people in the world. Would you believe that I had a visit this afternoon from a gentleman who tried to persuade me that he found more pleasure in kissing my hand than a young woman\u2019s?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I guessed at once that this was Legrandin. M. de Norpois smiled with a slight quiver of the eyelid, as though such a remark had been prompted by a concupiscence so natural that one could not find fault with the person who had uttered it, almost as though it were the beginning of a romance which he was prepared to forgive, if not to encourage, with the perverse indulgence of a Voisenon or the younger Cr\u00e9billon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMany young women\u2019s hands would be incapable of doing what I see there,\u201d said the Prince, pointing to Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s unfinished water-colours. And he asked her whether she had seen the flower paintings by Fantin-Latour which had recently been exhibited\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey are of the first order, and indicate, as people say nowadays, a fine painter, one of the masters of the palette,\u201d declared M. de Norpois; \u201cI consider, all the same, that they stand no comparison with these, in which I find it easier to recognise the colouring of the flower.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even supposing that the partiality of an old lover, the habit of flattering people, the critical standard admissible in a small circle, had dictated this speech to the ex-Ambassador, it proved upon what an absolute vacuum of true taste the judgment of people in society is based, so arbitrary that the smallest trifle can make it rush to the wildest absurdities, on the way to which it is stopped, held up by no genuinely felt impression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI claim no credit for knowing about flowers, I\u2019ve lived all my life among the fields,\u201d replied Mme. de Villeparisis modestly. \u201cBut,\u201d she added graciously, turning to the Prince, \u201cif I did, when I was quite a girl, form a rather more serious idea of them than children generally do in the country, I owe that to a distinguished fellow-countryman of yours, Herr von Schlegel. I met him at Broglie, when I was staying there once with my aunt Cordelia (Marshal de Castellane\u2019s wife, don\u2019t you know?). I remember so well M. Lebrun, M. de Salvandy, M. Doudan, getting him to talk about flowers. I was only a little girl, I wasn\u2019t able to follow all he said. But he liked playing with me, and when he went back to your country he sent me a beautiful botany book to remind me of a drive we took together in a phaeton to the Val Richer, when I fell asleep on his knee. I have got the book still, and it taught me to observe many things about flowers which I should not have noticed otherwise. When Mme. de Barante published some of Mme. de Broglie\u2019s letters, charming and affected like herself, I hoped to find among them some record of those conversations with Herr von Schlegel. But she was a woman who looked for nothing from nature but arguments in support of religion.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert called me away to the far end of the room where he and his mother were\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou have been good to me,\u201d I said, \u201chow can I thank you? Can we dine together to-morrow?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo-morrow? Yes, if you like, but it will have to be with Bloch. I met him just now on the doorstep; he was rather stiff with me at first because I had quite forgotten to answer his last two letters. (At least, he didn\u2019t tell me that that was what had annoyed him, but I guessed it.) But after that he was so friendly to me that I simply can\u2019t disappoint him. Between ourselves, on his side at least, I can feel it\u2019s a life and death friendship.\u201d Nor do I consider that Robert was altogether mistaken. Furious detraction was often, with Bloch, the effect of a keen affection which he had supposed to be unreturned. And as he had little power of imagining the lives of other people, and never dreamed that one might have been ill, or away from home, or otherwise occupied, a week\u2019s silence was at once interpreted by him as meaning a deliberate coldness. And so I have never believed that his most violent outbursts as a friend, or in later years as a writer, went very deep. They rose to a paroxysm if one replied to them with an icy dignity, or by a platitude which encouraged him to redouble his onslaught, but yielded often to a warmly sympathetic attitude. \u201cAs for being good,\u201d went on Saint-Loup, \u201cyou say I have been to you, but I haven\u2019t been good at all, my aunt tells me that it\u2019s you who avoid her, that you never said a word to her. She wondered whether you had anything against her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately for myself, if I had been taken in by this speech, our departure, which I believed to be imminent, for Balbec would have prevented my making any attempt to see Mme. Guermantes again, to assure her that I had nothing against her, and so to put her under the necessity of proving that it was she who had something against me. But I had only to remind myself that she had not even offered to let me see her Elstirs. Besides, this was not a disappointment; I had never expected her to begin talking to me about them; I knew that I did not appeal to her, that I need have no hope of ever making her like me; the most that I had been able to look forward to was that, thanks to her kindness, I might there and then receive, since I should not be seeing her again before I left Paris, an entirely pleasing impression, which I could take with me to Balbec indefinitely prolonged, intact, instead of a memory broken by anxiety and sorrow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Marsantes kept on interrupting her conversation with Robert to tell me how often he had spoken to her about me, how fond he was of me; she treated me with a deference which almost hurt me because I felt it to be prompted by her fear of being embroiled, on my account, with this son whom she had not seen all day, with whom she was eager to be alone, and over whom she must accordingly have supposed that the influence which she wielded was not equal to and must conciliate mine. Having heard me, earlier in the afternoon, make some reference to Bloch\u2019s uncle, M. Nissim Bernard, Mme. de Marsantes inquired whether it was he who had at one time lived at Nice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIn that case, he knew M. de Marsantes there before our marriage,\u201d she told me. \u201cMy husband used often to speak of him as an excellent man, with such a delicate, generous nature.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cTo think that for once in his life he wasn\u2019t lying! It\u2019s incredible,\u201d would have been Bloch\u2019s comment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All this time I should have liked to explain to Mme. de Marsantes that Robert felt infinitely more affection for her than for myself, and that had she shewn any hostility towards me it was not in my nature to attempt to set him against her, to detach him from her. But now that Mme. de Guermantes had left the room, I had more leisure to observe Robert, and I noticed then for the first time that, once again, a sort of flood of anger seemed to be coursing through him, rising to the surface of his stern and sombre features. I was afraid lest, remembering the scene in the theatre that afternoon, he might be feeling humiliated in my presence at having allowed himself to be treated so harshly by his mistress without making any rejoinder\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suddenly he broke away from his mother, who had put her arm round his neck, and, coming towards me, led me behind the little flower-strewn counter at which Mme. de Villeparisis had resumed her seat, making a sign to me to follow him into the smaller room. I was hurrying after him when M. de Charlus, who must have supposed that I was leaving the house, turned abruptly from Prince von Faffenheim, to whom he had been talking, and made a rapid circuit which brought him face to face with me. I saw with alarm that he had taken the hat in the lining of which were a capital \u2018G\u2019 and a ducal coronet. In the doorway into the little room he said, without looking at me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAs I see that you have taken to going into society, you must do me the pleasure of coming to see me. But it\u2019s a little complicated,\u201d he went on with a distracted, calculating air, as if the pleasure had been one that he was afraid of not securing again once he had let slip the opportunity of arranging with me the means by which it might be realised. \u201cI am very seldom at home; you will have to write to me. But I should prefer to explain things to you more quietly. I am just going. Will you walk a short way with me? I shall only keep you a moment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019d better take care, sir,\u201d I warned him; \u201cyou have picked up the wrong hat by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cDo you want to stop me taking my own hat?\u201d I assumed, a similar mishap having recently occurred to myself, that someone else having taken his hat he had seized upon one at random, so as not to go home bare-headed, and that I had placed him in a difficulty by exposing his stratagem. I told him that I must say a few words to Saint-Loup. \u201cHe is still talking to that idiot the Duc de Guermantes,\u201d I added. \u201cThat really is charming; I shall tell my brother.\u201d \u201cOh! you think that would interest M. de Charlus?\u201d (I imagined that, if he had a brother, that brother must be called Charlus also. Saint-Loup had indeed explained his family tree to me at Balbec, but I had forgotten the details.) \u201cWho has been talking to you about M. de Charlus?\u201d replied the Baron in an arrogant tone. \u201cGo to Robert.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI hear,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat you took part this morning in one of those orgies that he has with a woman who is disgracing him. You would do well to use your influence with him to make him realise the pain he is causing his poor mother, and all of us, by dragging our name in the dirt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I should have liked to reply that at this degrading luncheon the conversation had been entirely about Emerson, Ibsen and Tolstoy, and that the young woman had lectured Robert to make him drink nothing but water. In the hope of bringing some balm to Robert, whose pride had, I felt, been wounded, I sought to find an excuse for his mistress. I did not know that at that moment, in spite of his anger with her, it was on himself that he was heaping reproaches. But it always happens, even in quarrels between a good man and a worthless woman, and when the right is all on one side, that some trifle crops up which enables the woman to appear not to have been in the wrong on one point. And as she ignores all the other points, the moment the man begins to feel the need of her company, or is demoralised by separation from her, his weakness will make his conscience more exacting, he will remember the absurd reproaches that have been flung at him and will ask himself whether they have not some foundation in fact\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve come to the conclusion I was wrong about that matter of the necklace,\u201d Robert said to me. \u201cOf course, I never meant for a moment to do anything wrong, but, I know very well, other people don\u2019t look at things in the same way as oneself. She had a very hard time when she was young. In her eyes, I was bound to appear just the rich man who thinks he can get anything he wants with his money, and with whom a poor person cannot compete, whether in trying to influence Boucheron or in a lawsuit. Of course she has been horribly cruel to me, when I have never thought of anything but her good. But I do see clearly, she believes that I wanted to make her feel that one could keep a hold on her with money, and that\u2019s not true. And she\u2019s so fond of me; what must she be thinking of me? Poor darling, if you only knew, she has such charming ways, I simply can\u2019t tell you, she has often done the most adorable things for me. How wretched she must be feeling now! In any case, whatever happens in the long run, I don\u2019t want to let her think me a cad; I shall dash off to Boucheron\u2019s and get the necklace. You never know; very likely when she sees me with it, she will admit that she\u2019s been in the wrong. Don\u2019t you see, it\u2019s the idea that she is suffering at this moment that I can\u2019t bear. What one suffers oneself one knows; that\u2019s nothing. But with her \u2014 to say to oneself that she\u2019s suffering and not to be able to form any idea of what she feels \u2014 I think I shall go mad in a minute \u2014 I\u2019d much rather never see her again than let her suffer. She can be happy without me, if she must; that\u2019s all I ask. Listen; you know, to me everything that concerns her is enormously important, it becomes something cosmic; I shall run to the jeweller\u2019s and then go and ask her to forgive me. But until I get down there what will she be thinking of me? If she could only know that I was on my way! What about your going down there and telling her? For all we know, that might settle the whole business. Perhaps,\u201d he went on with a smile, as though he hardly ventured to believe in so idyllic a possibility, \u201cwe can all three dine together in the country. But we can\u2019t tell yet. I never know how to handle her. Poor child. I shall perhaps only hurt her more than ever. Besides, her decision may be irrevocable.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert swept me back to his mother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cGood-bye,\u201d he said to her. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now. I don\u2019t know when I shall get leave again. Probably not for a month. I shall write as soon as I know myself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly Robert was not in the least of the type of son who, when he goes out with his mother, feels that an attitude of exasperation towards her ought to balance the smiles and bows which he bestows on strangers. Nothing is more common than this odious form of vengeance on the part of those who appear to believe that rudeness to one\u2019s own family is the natural complement to one\u2019s ceremonial behaviour. Whatever the wretched mother may say, her son, as though he had been taken to the house against his will and wished to make her pay dearly for his presence, refutes immediately, with an ironical, precise, cruel contradiction, the timidly ventured assertion; the mother at once conforms, though without thereby disarming him, to the opinion of this superior being of whom she will continue to boast to everyone, when he is not present, as having a charming nature, and who all the same spares her none of his keenest thrusts. Saint-Loup was not at all like this; but the anguish which Rachel\u2019s absence provoked in him brought it about that, for different reasons, he was no less harsh with his mother than the sons I have been describing are with theirs. And as she listened to him I saw the same throb, like that of a mighty wing, which Mme. de Marsantes had been unable to repress when her son first entered the room, convulse her whole body once again; but this time it was an anxious face, eyes wide with grief that she fastened on him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat, Robert, you\u2019re going away? Seriously? My little son! The one day I\u2019ve seen anything of you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then quite softly, in the most natural tone, in a voice from which she strove to banish all sadness so as not to inspire her son with a pity which would perhaps have been painful to him, or else useless and might serve only to irritate him, like an argument prompted by plain common sense she added:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not at all nice of you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to this simplicity she added so much timidity, to shew him that she was not trespassing on his freedom, so much affection, so that he should not reproach her with spoiling his pleasures, that Saint-Loup could not fail to observe in himself as it were the possibility of a similar wave of affection, that was to say an obstacle to his spending the evening with his lady. And so he grew angry\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but, nice or not, that\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he heaped on his mother the reproaches which no doubt he felt that he himself perhaps deserved; thus it is that egoists have always the last word; having laid down at the start that their determination is unshakeable, the more the sentiment in them to which one appeals to make them abandon it is touched, the more fault they find, not with themselves who resist the appeal but with those persons who put them under the necessity of resisting it, with the result that their own firmness may be carried to the utmost degree of cruelty, which only aggravates all the more in their eyes the culpability of the person who is so indelicate as to be hurt, to be in the right, and to cause them thus treacherously the pain of acting against their natural instinct of pity. But of her own accord Mme. de Marsantes ceased to insist, for she felt that she would not be able to keep him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI shall leave you here,\u201d he said to me, \u201cbut you\u2019re not to keep him long, Mamma, because he\u2019s got to go somewhere else in a minute.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was fully aware that my company could not afford any pleasure to Mme. de Marsantes, but I preferred, by not going with Robert, not to let her suppose that I was involved in these pleasures which deprived her of him. I should have liked to find some excuse for her son\u2019s conduct, less from affection for him than from pity tor her. But it was she who spoke first\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPoor boy,\u201d she began, \u201cI am sure I must have hurt him dreadfully. You see, Sir, mothers are such selfish creatures, after all he hasn\u2019t many pleasures, he comes so little to Paris. Oh, dear, if he hadn\u2019t gone already I should have liked to stop him, not to keep him of course, but just to tell him that I\u2019m not vexed with him, that I think he was quite right. Will you excuse me if I go and look over the staircase?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I accompanied her there\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cRobert! Robert!\u201d she called. \u201cNo; he\u2019s gone; we are too late.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At that moment I would as gladly have undertaken a mission to make Robert break with his mistress as, a few hours earlier, to make him go and live with her altogether. In one case Saint-Loup would have regarded me as a false friend, in the other his family would have called me his evil genius. Yet I was the same man, at an interval of a few hours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We returned to the drawing-room. Seeing that Saint-Loup was not with us, Mme. de Villeparisis exchanged with M. de Norpois that dubious, derisive and not too pitying glance with which people point out to one another an over-jealous wife or an over-loving mother (spectacles which to outsiders are amusing), as much as to say: \u201cThere now, there\u2019s been trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert went to his mistress, taking with him the splendid ornament which, after what had been said on both sides, he ought not to have given her. But it came to the same thing, for she would not look at it, and even after their reconciliation he could never persuade her to accept it. Certain of Robert\u2019s friends thought that these proofs of disinterestedness which she furnished were deliberately planned to draw him closer to her. And yet she was not greedy about money, except perhaps to be able to spend it without thought. I have seen her bestow recklessly on people whom she believed to be in need the most insensate charity. \u201cAt this moment,\u201d Robert\u2019s friends would say to him, seeking to balance by their malicious words a disinterested action on Rachel\u2019s part, \u201cat this moment she will be in the promenade at the Folies-Berg\u00e8res. She\u2019s an enigma, that girl is, a regular sphinx.\u201d After all, how many women who are not disinterested, since they are kept by men, have we not seen, with a delicacy that flowers from their sordid existence, set with their own hands a thousand little limits to the generosity of their lovers?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert knew of scarcely any of the infidelities of his mistress, and tortured his mind over what were mere nothings compared with the real life of Rachel, a life which began every day only after he had left her. He knew of scarcely any of these infidelities. One could have told him of them without shaking his confidence in Rachel. For it is a charming law of nature which manifests itself in the heart of the most complex social organisms, that we live in perfect ignorance of those we love. On one side of the mirror the lover says to himself: \u201cShe is an angel, she will never yield herself to me, I may as well die \u2014 and yet she does care for me; she cares so much that perhaps \u2014 but no, it can never possibly happen.\u201d And in the exaltation of his desire, in the anguish of waiting, what jewels he flings at the feet of this woman, how he runs to borrow money to save her from inconvenience; meanwhile, on the other side of the screen, through which their conversation will no more carry than that which visitors exchange outside the glass wall of an aquarium, the public are saying: \u201cYou don\u2019t know her? I congratulate you, she has robbed, in fact ruined I don\u2019t know how many men. There isn\u2019t a worse girl in Paris. She\u2019s a common swindler. And cunning isn\u2019t the word!\u201d And perhaps the public are not entirely wrong in their use of the last epithet, for indeed the sceptical man who is not really in love with the woman and whom she merely attracts says to his friends: \u201cNo, no, my dear fellow, she is not in the least a prostitute; I don\u2019t say she hasn\u2019t had an adventure or two in her time, but she\u2019s not a woman one pays, she\u2019d be a damned sight too expensive if she was. With her it\u2019s fifty thousand francs or nothing.\u201d Well, he has spent fifty thousand francs on her, he has had her once, but she (finding, moreover, a willing accomplice in the man himself) has managed to persuade him that he is one of those who have had her for nothing. Such is society, in which every one of us has two aspects, in which the most obvious, the most notorious faults will never be known by a certain other person save embedded in, under the protection of a shell, a smooth cocoon, a delicious curiosity of nature. There were in Paris two thoroughly respectable men to whom Saint-Loup no longer bowed, and could not refer without a tremor in his voice, calling them exploiters of women: this was because they had both been ruined by Rachel\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI blame myself for one thing only,\u201d Mme. de Marsantes murmured in my ear, \u201cand that was my telling him that he wasn\u2019t nice to me. He, such an adorable, unique son, there\u2019s no one else like him in the world, the only time I see him, to have told him he wasn\u2019t nice to me, I would far rather he\u2019d beaten me, because I am sure that whatever pleasure he may be having this evening, and he hasn\u2019t many, will be spoiled for him by that unfair word. But, Sir, I mustn\u2019t keep you, since you\u2019re in a hurry.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anxiously, Mme. de Marsantes bade me good-bye. These sentiments bore upon Robert; she was sincere. But she ceased to be, to become a great lady once more\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have been so interested, so glad to have this little talk with you. Thank you! Thank you!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And with a humble air she fastened on me a look of gratitude, of exhilaration, as though my conversation were one of the keenest pleasures that she had experienced in her life. These charming glances went very well with the black flowers on her white skirt; they were those of a great lady who knew her business\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I am in no hurry,\u201d I replied; \u201cbesides, I must wait for M. de Charlus; I am going with him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis overheard these last words. They appeared to vex her. Had the matter in question not been one which could not possibly give rise to such a sentiment, it might have struck me that what seemed to be at that moment alarmed in Mme. de Villeparisis was her modesty. But this hypothesis never even entered my mind. I was delighted with Mme. de Guermantes, with Saint-Loup, with Mme. de Marsantes, with M. de Charlus, with Mme. de Villeparisis; I did not stop to reflect, and I spoke light-heartedly and at random\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re going from here with my nephew Palam\u00e8de?\u201d she asked me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thinking that it might produce a highly favourable impression on Mme. de Villeparisis if she learned that I was on intimate terms with a nephew whom she esteemed so greatly, \u201cHe has asked me to go home with him,\u201d I answered blithely. \u201cI am so glad. Besides, we are greater friends than you think, and I\u2019ve quite made up my mind that we\u2019re going to be better friends still.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From being vexed, Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to have grown anxious. \u201cDon\u2019t wait for him,\u201d she said to me, with a preoccupied air. \u201cHe is talking to M. de Faffenheim. He\u2019s certain to have forgotten what he said to you. You\u2019d much better go, now, quickly, while his back is turned.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first emotion shewn by Mme. de Villeparisis would have suggested, but for the circumstances, offended modesty. Her insistence, her opposition might well, if one had studied her face alone, have appeared to be dictated by virtue. I was not, myself, in any hurry to join Robert and his mistress. But Mme. de Villeparisis seemed to make such a point of my going that, thinking perhaps that she had some important business to discuss with her nephew, I bade her good-bye. Next to her M. de Guermantes, superb and Olympian, was ponderously seated. One would have said that the notion omnipresent in all his members, of his vast riches gave him a particular high density, as though they had been melted in a crucible into a single human ingot to form this man whose value was so immense. At the moment of my saying good-bye to him he rose politely from his seat, and I could feel the dead weight of thirty millions which his old-fashioned French breeding set in motion, raised, until it stood before me. I seemed to be looking at that statue of Olympian Zeus which Phidias is said to have cast in solid gold. Such was the power that good breeding had over M. de Guermantes over the body of M. de Guermantes at least, for it had not an equal mastery over the ducal mind. M. de Guermantes laughed at his own jokes, but did not unbend to other people\u2019s\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I went downstairs I heard behind me a voice calling out to me:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo this is how you wait for me, is it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was M. de Charlus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if we go a little way on foot?\u201d he asked dryly, when we were in the courtyard. \u201cWe can walk until I find a cab that suits me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wished to speak to me about something, Sir?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh yes, as a matter of fact there were some things I wished to say to you, but I am not so sure now whether I shall. As far as you are concerned, I am sure that they might be the starting-point which would lead you to inestimable benefits. But I can see also that they would bring into my existence, at an age when one begins to value tranquillity, a great loss of time, great inconvenience. I ask myself whether you are worth all the pains that I should have to take with you, and I have not the pleasure of knowing you well enough to be able to say. Perhaps also to you yourself what I could do for you does not appear sufficiently attractive for me to give, myself so much trouble, for I repeat quite frankly that for me it can only be trouble.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I protested that, in that case, he must not dream of it. This summary end to the discussion did not seem to be to his liking\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat sort of politeness means nothing,\u201d he rebuked me coldly. \u201cThere is nothing so pleasant as to give oneself trouble for a person who is worth one\u2019s while. For the best of us, the study of the arts, a taste for old things, collections, gardens are all mere ersatz, succedanea, alibis. In the heart of our tub, like Diogenes, we cry out for a man. We cultivate begonias, we trim yews, as a last resort, because yews and begonias submit to treatment. But we should like to give our time to a plant of human growth, if we were sure that he was worth the trouble. That is the whole question: you must know something about yourself. Are you worth my trouble or not?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI would not for anything in the world, Sir, be a cause of anxiety to you,\u201d I said to him, \u201cbut so far as I am concerned you may be sure that everything which comes to me from you will be a very great pleasure to me. I am deeply touched that you should be so kind as to take notice of me in this way and try to help me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Greatly to my surprise, it was almost with effusion that he thanked me for this speech, slipping his arm through mine with that intermittent familiarity which had already struck me at Balbec, and was in such contrast to the coldness of his tone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWith the want of consideration common at your age,\u201d he told me, \u201cyou are liable to say things at times which would open an unbridgeable gulf between us. What you have said just now, on the other hand, is exactly the sort of thing that touches me, and makes me want to do a great deal for you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As he walked arm in arm with me and uttered these words, which, albeit tinged with contempt, were so affectionate, M. de Charlus now fastened his gaze on me with that intense fixity which had struck me the first morning, when I saw him outside the casino at Balbec, and indeed many years before that, through the pink hawthorns, standing beside Mme. Swann, whom I supposed then to be his mistress, in the park at Tansonville; now let it stray around him and examine the cabs which at this time of the day were passing in considerable numbers on the way to their stables, looking so determinedly at them that several stopped, the drivers supposing that he wished to engage them. But M. de Charlus immediately dismissed them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re not what I want,\u201d he explained to me, \u201cit\u2019s all a question of the colour of their lamps, and the direction they\u2019re going in. I hope, Sir,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat you will not in any way misinterpret the purely disinterested and charitable nature of the proposal which I am going to make to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was struck by the similarity of his diction to Swann\u2019s, closer now than at Balbec\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou have enough intelligence, I suppose, not to imagine that it is from want of society, from any fear of solitude and boredom that I have recourse to you. I do not, as a rule, care to talk about myself, but you may possibly have heard \u2014 it was alluded to in a leading article in The Times, which made a considerable impression \u2014 that the Emperor of Austria, who has always honoured me with his friendship, and is good enough to insist on keeping up terms of cousinship with me, declared the other day in an interview which was made public that if the Comte de Chambord had had by his side a man as thoroughly conversant with the undercurrents of European politics as myself he would be King of France to-day. I have often thought, Sir, that there was in me, thanks not to my own humble talents but to circumstances which you may one day have occasion to learn, a sort of secret record of incalculable value, of which I have not felt myself at liberty to make use, personally, but which would be a priceless acquisition to a young man to whom I would hand over in a few months what it has taken me more than thirty years to collect, what I am perhaps alone in possessing. I do not speak of the intellectual enjoyment which you would find in learning certain secrets which a Michelet of our day would give years of his life to know, and in the light of which certain events would assume for him an entirely different aspect. And I do not speak only of events that have already occurred, but of the chain of circumstances.\u201d (This was a favourite expression with M. de Charlus, and often, when he used it, he joined his hands as if in prayer, but with his fingers stiffened, as though to illustrate by their complexity the said circumstances, which he did not specify, and the chain that linked them.) \u201cI could give you an explanation that no one has dreamed of, not only of the past but of the future.\u201d M. de Charlus broke off to question me about Bloch, whom he had heard discussed, though without appearing to be listening, in his aunt\u2019s drawing-room. And with that ironical accent he so skilfully detached what he was saying that he seemed to be thinking of something else altogether and to be speaking mechanically, simply out of politeness. He asked if my friend was young, good looking and so forth. Bloch, if he had heard him would have been more puzzled even than with M. de Norpois, but for very different reasons, to know whether M. de Charlus was for or against Drey, fus. \u201cIt is not a bad idea, if you wish to learn about life,\u201d went on M. de Charlus when he had finished questioning me, \u201cto include among your friends an occasional foreigner.\u201d I replied that Bloch was French. \u201cIndeed,\u201d said M. de Charlus, \u201cI took him to be a Jew.\u201d His assertion of this incompatibility made me suppose that M. de Charlus was more anti-Dreyfusard than anyone I had met. He protested, however, against the charge of treason levelled against Dreyfus. But his protest took this form: \u201cI understand the newspapers to say that Dreyfus has committed a crime against his country \u2014 so I understand, I pay no attention to the newspapers, I read them as I wash my hands, without finding that it is worth my while to take any interest in what I am doing. In any case, the crime is non-existent, your friend\u2019s compatriot would have committed a crime if he had betrayed Judaea, but what has he to do with France?\u201d I pointed out that if there should be a war the Jews would be mobilised just as much as anyone else. \u201cPerhaps so, and I am not sure that it would not be an imprudence. If we bring over Senegalese and Malagasies, I hardly suppose that their hearts will be in the task of defending France, which is only natural. Your Dreyfus might rather be convicted of a breach of the laws of hospitality. But we need not discuss that. Perhaps you could ask your friend to allow me to be present at some great festival in the Temple, at a circumcision, with Jewish chants. He might perhaps take a hall, and give me some biblical entertainment, as the young ladies of Saint-Cyr performed scenes taken from the Psalms by Racine, to amuse Louis XIV. You might even arrange parties to give us a good laugh. For instance a battle between your friend and his father, in which he would smite him as David smote Goliath. That would make quite an amusing farce. He might even, while he was about it, deal some stout blows at his hag (or, as my old nurse would say, his \u2018haggart\u2019) of a mother. That would be an excellent show, and would not be unpleasing to us, eh, my young friend, since we like exotic spectacles, and to thrash that non-European creature would be giving a well-earned punishment to an old camel.\u201d As he poured out this terrible, almost insane language, M. de Charlus squeezed my arm until it ached. I reminded myself of all that his family had told me of his wonderful kindness to this old nurse, whose Moli\u00e8resque vocabulary he had just quoted, and thought to myself that the connexions, hitherto, I felt, little studied, between goodness and wickedness in the same heart, various as they might be, would be an interesting subject for research\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I warned him that, anyhow, Mme. Bloch no longer existed, while as for M. Bloch, I questioned to what extent he would enjoy a sport which might easily result in his being blinded. M. de Charlus seemed annoyed. \u201cThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis a woman who made a great mistake in dying. As for blinding him, surely the Synagogue is blind, it does not perceive the truth of the Gospel. In any case, think, at this moment, when all these unhappy Jews are trembling before the stupid fury of the Christians, what an honour it would be for him to see a man like myself condescend to be amused by their sports.\u201d At this point I caught sight of M. Bloch senior, who was coming towards us, probably on his way to meet his son. He did not see us but I offered to introduce him to M. de Charlus. I had no conception of the torrent of rage which my words were to let loose. \u201cIntroduce him to me! But you must have singularly little idea of social values! People do not get to know me as easily as that. In the present instance, the awkwardness would be twofold, on account of the youth of the introducer and the unworthiness of the person introduced. At the most, if I am ever permitted to enjoy the Asiatic spectacle which I suggested to you, I might address to the horrible creature a few words indicative of generous feeling. But on condition that he allows himself to be thoroughly thrashed by his son, I might go so far as to express my satisfaction.\u201d As it happened, M. Bloch paid no attention to us. He was occupied in greeting Mme. Sazerat with a series of sweeping bows, which were very favourably received. I was surprised at this, for in the old days at Combray she had been indignant at my parents for having young Bloch in the house, so anti-semitic was she then. But Dreyfusism, like a strong gust of wind, had, a few days before this, wafted M. Bloch to her feet. My father\u2019s friend had found Mme. Sazerat charming and was particularly gratified by the anti-semitism of the lady, which he regarded as a proof of the sincerity of her faith and the soundness of her Dreyfusard opinions, and also as enhancing the value of the call which she had authorised him to pay her. He had not even been offended when she had said to him stolidly: \u201cM. Drumont has the impudence to put the Revisionists in the same bag as the Protestants and the Jews. A delightful promiscuity!\u201d \u201cBernard,\u201d he had said with pride, on reaching home, to M. Nissim Bernard, \u201cyou know, she has that prejudice!\u201d But M. Nissim Bernard had said nothing, only raising his eyes to heaven in an angelic gaze. Saddened by the misfortunes of the Jews, remembering his old friendships with Christians, grown mannered and precious with increasing years, for reasons which the reader will learn in due course, he had now the air of a pre-Raphaelite ghost on to which hair had been incongruously grafted, like threads in the heart of an opal. \u201cAll this Dreyfus business,\u201d went on the Baron, still clasping me by the arm, \u201chas only one drawback. It destroys society (I do not say polite society; society has long ceased to deserve that laudatory epithet) by the influx of Mr. and Mrs. Camels and Camelfies and Camelyards, astonishing creatures whom I find even in the houses of my own cousins, because they belong to the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise, or the Anti-Jewish, or some such league, as if a political opinion entitled one to any social qualification.\u201d This frivolity in M. de Charlus brought out his family likeness to the Duchesse de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I remarked to him on the resemblance. As he appeared to think that I did not know her, I reminded him of the evening at the Opera when he had seemed to be trying to avoid me. He assured me with such insistence that he had never even seen me there that I should have begun to believe him, if presently a trifling incident had not led me to think that M. de Charlus, in his excessive pride perhaps, did not care to be seen with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cLet us return to yourself,\u201d he said, \u201cand my plans for you. There exists among certain men, Sir, a freemasonry of which I cannot now say more than that it numbers in its ranks four of the reigning sovereigns of Europe Now, the courtiers of one of these are trying to cure him of his fancy. That is a very serious matter, and may bring us to war. Yes, Sir, that is a fact You remember the story of the man who believed that he had the Princess of China shut up in a bottle. It was a form of insanity. He was cured of it, But as soon as he ceased to be mad he became merely stupid. There are maladies which we must not seek to cure because they alone protect us from others that are more serious. A cousin of mine had trouble with his stomach; he could not digest anything. The most learned specialists on the stomach treated him, with no effect. I took him to a certain doctor (another highly interesting man, by the way, of whom I could tell you a great deal). He guessed at once that the trouble was nervousness; he persuaded his patient, ordered him to eat whatever he liked quite boldly and assured him that his digestion would stand it. But my cousin had nephritis also. What the stomach can digest perfectly well the kidneys cease, after a time, to eliminate, and my cousin, instead of living to a good old age with an imaginary disease of the stomach which obliged him to keep to a diet, died at forty with his stomach cured but his kidneys ruined. Given a very considerable advantage over people of your age, for all one knows, you will perhaps become what some eminent man of the past might have been if a good angel had revealed to him, in the midst of a humanity that knew nothing of them, the secrets of steam and electricity. Do not be foolish, do not refuse from discretion. Understand that, if I do you a great service, I expect my reward from you to be no less great. It is many years now since people in society ceased to interest me. I have but one passion left, to seek to redeem the mistakes of my life by conferring the benefit of my knowledge on a soul that is still virgin and capable of being inflamed by virtue. I have had great sorrows, Sir, of which I may tell you perhaps some day; I have lost my wife, who was the loveliest, the noblest, the most perfect creature that one could dream of seeing. I have young relatives who are not \u2014 I do not say worthy, but who are not capable of accepting the moral heritage of which I have been speaking. For all I know, you may be he into whose hands it is to pass, he whose life I shall be able to direct and to raise to so lofty a plane. My own would gain in return. Perhaps in teaching you the great secrets of diplomacy I might recover a taste for them myself, and begin at last to do things of real interest in which you would have an equal share. But before I can tell I must see you often, very often, every day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was thinking of taking advantage of this unexpected kindness on M. de Charlus\u2019s part to ask him whether he could not arrange for me to meet his sister-in-law when, suddenly, I felt my arm violently jerked, as though by an electric shock. It was M. de Charlus who had hurriedly withdrawn his arm from mine. Although as he talked he had allowed his eyes to wander in all directions he had only just caught sight of M. d\u2019Argencourt, who was coming towards us from a side street. On seeing us, M. d\u2019Argencourt appeared worried, cast at me a look of distrust, almost that look intended for a creature of another race than one\u2019s own with which Mme. de Guermantes had quizzed Bloch, and tried to avoid us. But one would have said that M. de Charlus was determined to shew him that he was not at all anxious not to be seen by him, for he called to him, simply to tell him something that was of no importance. And fearing perhaps that M. d\u2019Argencourt had not recognised me, M. de Charlus informed him that I was a great friend of Mme. de Villeparisis, of the Duchesse de Guermantes, of Robert de Saint-Loup, and that he himself, Charlus, was an old friend of my grandmother, and glad to be able to shew her grandson a little of the affection that he felt for her. Nevertheless I observed that M. d\u2019Argencourt, albeit I had barely been introduced to him at Mme. de Villeparisis\u2019s, and M. de Charlus had now spoken to him at great length about my family, was distinctly colder to me than he had been in the afternoon; and for a long time he shewed the same aloofness whenever we met. He watched me now with a curiosity in which there was no sign of friendliness, and seemed even to have to overcome an instinctive repulsion when, on leaving us, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, he held out a hand to me which he at once withdrew\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI am sorry about that,\u201d said M. de Charlus. \u201cThat fellow Argencourt, well born but ill bred, more than feeble as a diplomat, an impossible husband, always running after women like a person in a play, is one of those men who are incapable of understanding but perfectly capable of destroying the things in life that are really great. I hope that our friendship will be one of them, if it is ever to be formed, and I hope also that you will honour me by keeping it \u2014 as I shall \u2014 well clear of the heels of any of those donkeys who, from idleness or clumsiness or deliberate wickedness trample upon what would seem to have been made to endure. Unfortunately, that is the mould in which most of the men one meets have been cast.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThe Duchesse de Guermantes seems to be very clever. We were talking this afternoon about the possibility of war. It appears that she is specially well informed on that subject.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cShe is nothing of the sort,\u201d replied M. de Charlus tartly. \u201cWomen, and most men, for that matter, understand nothing of what I was going to tell you. My sister-in-law is a charming woman who imagines that we are still living in the days of Balzac\u2019s novels, when women had an influence on Politics. Going to her house could at present have only a bad effect on you, as for that matter going anywhere. That was one of the very things I was just going to tell you when that fool interrupted me. The first sacrifice that you must make for me \u2014 I shall claim them from you in proportion to the gifts I bestow on you \u2014 is to give up going into society. It distressed me this afternoon to see you at that idiotic tea-party. You may remind me that I Was there myself, but for me it was not a social gathering, it was simply a family visit. Later on, when you have established your position, if it amuses you to step down for a little into that sort of thing, it may perhaps, do no harm. And then, I need not point out how invaluable I can be to you. The \u2018Open Sesame\u2019 to the Guermantes house and any others that it is worth while throwing open the doors of to you, rests with me I shall be the judge, and intend to remain master of the situation.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I thought I would take advantage of what M. de Charlus had said about my call on Mme. de Villeparisis to try to find out what position exactly she occupied in society, but the question took another form on my lips than I had intended, and I asked him instead what the Villeparisis family was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThat is absolutely as though you had asked me what the Nobody family was,\u201d replied M. de Charlus. \u201cMy aunt married, for love, a M Thirion, who was extremely rich, for that matter, and whose sisters had married surprisingly well; and from that day onwards he called himself Marquis de Villeparisis. It did no harm to anyone, at the most a little to himself, and very little! What his reason was I cannot tell; I suppose he was actually a \u2018Monsieur de Villeparisis,\u2019 a gentleman born at Villeparisis, which as you know is the name of a little place outside Paris. My aunt tried to make out that there was such a Marquisate in the family, she wanted to put things on a proper footing; I can\u2019t tell you why. When one takes a name to which one has no right it is better not to copy the regular forms.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Villeparisis being merely Mme. Thirion completed the fall which had begun in my estimation of her when I had seen the composite nature of her party. I felt it to be unfair that a woman whose title and name were of quite recent origin should be able thus to impose upon her contemporaries, with the prospect of similarly imposing upon posterity, by virtue of her friendships with royal personages. Now that she had become once again what I had supposed her to be in my childhood, a person who had nothing aristocratic about her, these distinguished kinsfolk who gathered round her seemed to remain alien to her. She did not cease to be charming to us all. I went occasionally to see her and she sent me little presents from time to time. But I had never any impression that she belonged to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, and if I had wanted any information about it she would have been one of the last people to whom I should have applied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt present,\u201d went on M. de Charlus, \u201cby going into society, you will only damage your position, warp your intellect and character. Also, you must be particularly careful in choosing your friends. Keep mistresses, if your family have no objection, that doesn\u2019t concern me, indeed I can only advise it, you young rascal, young rascal who will soon have to start shaving,\u201d he rallied me, passing his fingers over my chin. \u201cBut the choice of your men friends is more important. Eight out of ten young men are little scoundrels, little wretches capable of doing you an injury which you will never be able to repair. Wait, now, my nephew Saint-Loup is quite a suitable companion for you, at a pinch. As far as your future is concerned, he can be of no possible use to you, but for that I am sufficient. And really when all\u2019s said and done, as a person to go about with, at times when you have had enough of me, he does not seem to present any serious drawback that I know of. At any rate he is a man, not one of those effeminate creatures one sees so many of nowadays, who look like little renters, and at any moment may bring their innocent victims to the gallows.\u201d I did not know the meaning of this slang word \u2018renter\u2019; anyone who had known it would have been as greatly surprised by his use of it as myself. People in society always like talking slang, and people against whom certain things may be hinted like to shew that they are not afraid to mention them. A proof of innocence in their eyes. But they have lost their sense of proportion, they are no longer capable of realising the point at which a certain pleasantry will become too technical, too shocking, will be a proof rather of corruption than of simplicity. \u201cHe is not like the rest of them; he has nice manners; he is really serious.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I could not help smiling at this epithet \u2018serious,\u2019 to which the intonation that M. de Charlus gave to it seemed to impart the sense of \u2018virtuous,\u2019 of \u2018steady,\u2019 as one says of a little shop-girl that she is \u2018serious.\u2019 At this moment a cab passed, zigzagging along the street; a young cabman, who had deserted his box, was driving it from inside, where he lay sprawling upon the cushions, apparently half drunk. M. de Charlus instantly stopped him. The driver began to argue\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhich way are you going?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYours.\u201d This surprised me, for M. de Charlus had already refused several cabs with similarly coloured lamps\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to get up on the box. D\u2019you mind if I stay down here?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo; but you must put down the hood. Well, think over my proposal,\u201d said M. de Charlus, preparing to leave me, \u201cI give you a few days to consider my offer; write to me. I repeat, I shall need to see you every day, and to receive from you guarantees of loyalty, of discretion which, for that matter, you do appear, I must say, to furnish. But in the course of my life I have been so often taken in by appearances that I never wish to trust them again. Damn it, it\u2019s the least you can expect that before giving up a treasure I should know into what hands it is going to pass. Very well, bear in mind what I\u2019m offering you; you are like Hercules\u2019 (though, unfortunately for yourself, you do not appear to me to have quite his muscular development) at the parting of the ways. Try not to have to regret all your life not having chosen the way that leads to virtue. Hallo!\u201d he turned to the cabman, \u201chaven\u2019t you put the hood down? I\u2019ll do it myself. I think, too, I\u2019d better drive, seeing the state you appear to be in.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He jumped in beside the cabman, took the reins, and the horse trotted off\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for myself, no sooner had I turned in at our gate than I found the pendant to the conversation which I had heard exchanged that afternoon between Bloch and M. de Norpois, but in another form, brief, inverted and cruel. This was a dispute between our butler, who believed in Dreyfus, and the Guermantes\u2019, who was an anti-Dreyfusard. The truths and counter-truths which came in conflict above ground, among the intellectuals of the rival Leagues, the Patrie Fran\u00e7aise and the Droits de l\u2019Homme, were fast spreading downwards into the subsoil of popular opinion. M. Reinach was manipulating, by appeals to sentiment, people whom he had never seen, while for himself the Dreyfus case simply presented itself to his reason as an incontrovertible theory which he proved in the sequel by the most astonishing victory for rational policy (a victory against France, according to some) that the world has ever seen. In two years he replaced a Billot by a Clemenceau Ministry, revolutionised public opinion from top to bottom, took Picquart from his prison to install him, ungrateful, in the Ministry of War. Perhaps this rationalist manipulator of crowds was himself the puppet of his ancestry. When we find that the systems of philosophy which contain the most truths were dictated to their authors, in the last analysis, by reasons of sentiment, how are we to suppose that in a simple affair of politics like the Dreyfus case reasons of this order may not, unknown to the reasoner, have controlled his reason. Bloch believed himself to have been led by a logical sequence to choose Dreyfusism, yet he knew that his nose, skin and hair had been imposed on him by his race. Doubtless the reason enjoys more freedom; yet it obeys certain laws which it has not prescribed for itself. The case of the Guermantes\u2019 butler and our own was peculiar. The waves of the two currents of Dreyfusism and anti-Dreyfusism which now divided France from end to end were, on the whole, silent, but the occasional echoes which they emitted were sincere. When you heard anyone in the middle of a conversation which was being deliberately kept off the Case announce furtively some piece of political news, generally false, but always with a hopefulness of its truth, you could induce from the nature of his predictions where his heart lay. Thus there came into conflict on certain points, on one side a timid apostolate, on the other a righteous indignation. The two butlers whom I heard arguing as I came in furnished an exception to the rule. Ours let it be understood that Dreyfus was guilty, the Guermantes\u2019 butler that he was innocent. This was done not to conceal their personal convictions, but from cunning, and in the keenness of their rivalry. Our butler, being uncertain whether the fresh trial would be ordered, wished beforehand, in the event of failure, to deprive the Duke\u2019s butler of the joy of seeing a just cause vanquished. The Duke\u2019s butler thought that, in the event of a refusal, ours would be more indignant at the detention on the Devil\u2019s Isle of an innocent man. The porter looked on. I had the impression that it was not he who was the cause of dissension in the Guermantes household\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went upstairs, and found my grandmother not so well. For some time past, without knowing exactly what was wrong, she had been complaining of her health. It is in moments of illness that we are compelled to recognise that we live not alone but chained to a creature of a different kingdom, whole worlds apart, who has no knowledge of us and by whom it is impossible to make ourselves understood: our body. Say that we met a brigand by the way; we might yet convince him by an appeal to his personal interest, if not to our own plight. But to ask pity of our body is like discoursing before an octopus, for which our words can have no more meaning than the sound of the tides, and with which we should be appalled to find ourselves condemned to live. My grandmother\u2019s attacks passed, often enough-unnoticed by the attention which she kept always diverted to ourselves. When the pain was severe, in the hope of curing it, she would try in vain to understand what the trouble was. If the morbid phenomena of which her body was the theatre remained obscure and beyond the reach of her mind, they were clear and intelligible to certain creatures belonging to the same natural kingdom as themselves, creatures to which the human mind has learned gradually to have recourse in order to understand what the body is saying to it, as when a foreigner accosts us we try to find some one belonging to his country who will act as interpreter. These can talk to our body, and tell us if its anger is serious or will soon be appeased. Cottard, whom we had called in to see my grandmother, and who had infuriated us by asking with a dry smile, the moment we told him that she was ill: \u201cIll? You\u2019re sure it\u2019s not what they call a diplomatic illness?\u201d He tried to soothe his patient\u2019s restlessness by a milk diet. But incessant bowls of milk soup gave her no relief, because my grandmother sprinkled them liberally with salt (the toxic effects of which were as yet, Widal not having made his discoveries, unknown). For, medicine being a compendium of the successive and contradictory mistakes of medical practioners, when we summon the wisest of them to our aid, the chances are that we may be relying on a scientific truth the error of which will be recognised in a few years\u2019 time. So that to believe in medicine would be the height of folly, if not to believe in it were not greater folly still, for from this mass of errors there have emerged in the course of time many truths. Cottard had told us to take her temperature. A thermometer was fetched. Throughout almost all its length it was clear of mercury. Scarcely could one make out, crouching at the foot of the tube, in its little cell, the silver salamander. It seemed dead. The glass reed was slipped into my grandmother\u2019s mouth. We had no need to leave it there for long; the little sorceress had not been slow in casting her horoscope. We found her motionless, perched half-way up her tower, and declining to move, shewing us with precision the figure that we had asked of her, a figure with which all the most careful examination that my grandmother\u2019s mind could have devoted to herself would have been incapable of furnishing her: 101 degrees. For the first time we felt some anxiety. We shook the thermometer well, to erase the ominous line, as though we were able thus to reduce the patient\u2019s fever simultaneously with the figure shewn on the scale. Alas, it was only too clear that the little sibyl, unreasoning as she was, had not pronounced judgment arbitrarily, for the next day, scarcely had the thermometer been inserted between my grandmother\u2019s lips when almost at once, as though with a single bound, exulting in her certainty and in her intuition of a fact that to us was imperceptible, the little prophetess had come to a halt at the same point, in an implacable immobility, and pointed once again to that figure 101 with the tip of her gleaming wand. Nothing more did she tell us; in vain might we long, seek, pray, she was deaf to our entreaties; it seemed as though this were her final utterance, a warning and a menace. Then, in an attempt to constrain her to modify her response, we had recourse to another creature of the same kingdom, but more potent, which is not content with questioning the body but can command it, a febrifuge of the same order as the modern aspirin, which had not then come into use. We had not shaken the thermometer down below 99.5, and hoped that it would not have to rise from there. We made my grandmother swallow this drug and then replaced the thermometer in her mouth. Like an implacable warder to whom one presents a permit signed by a higher authority whose protecting influence one has sought and who, finding it to be in order, replies: \u201cVery well; I have nothing to say; if it\u2019s like that you may pass,\u201d this time the watcher in the tower dirt not move. But sullenly she seemed to be saying: \u201cWhat use will that be to you? Since you are friends with quinine, she may give me the order not to go up, once, ten times, twenty times. And then she will grow tired of telling me, I know her; get along with you. This won\u2019t last for ever. And then you\u2019ll be a lot better off.\u201d Thereupon my grandmother felt the presence within her of a creature which knew the human body better than herself, the presence of a contemporary of the races that have vanished from the earth, the presence of earth\u2019s first inhabitant \u2014 long anterior to the creation of thinking man \u2014 she felt that aeonial ally who was sounding her, a little roughly even, in the head, the heart, the elbow; he found out the weak places, organised everything for the prehistoric combat which began at once to be fought. In a moment a trampled Python, the fever, was vanquished by the potent chemical substance to which my grandmother, across the series of kingdoms, reaching out beyond all animal and vegetable life, would fain have been able to give thanks. And she remained moved by this glimpse which she had caught, through the mists of so many centuries, of a climate anterior to the creation even of plants. Meanwhile the thermometer, like a Weird Sister momentarily vanquished by some more ancient god, held motionless her silver spindle. Alas! other inferior creatures which man has trained to the chase of the mysterious quarry which he cannot pursue within the pathless forest of himself, reported cruelly to us every day a certain quantity of albumen, not large, but constant enough for it also to appear to bear relation to some persistent malady which we could not detect. Bergotte had shocked that scrupulous instinct in me which made me subordinate my intellect when he spoke to me of Dr. du Boulbon as of a physician who would not bore me, who would discover methods of treatment which, however strange they might appear, would adapt themselves to the singularity of my mind. But ideas transform themselves in us, they overcome the resistance with which we at first meet them, and feed upon rich intellectual reserves which we did not know to have been prepared for them. So, as happens whenever anything we have heard said about some one whom we do not know has had the faculty of awakening in us the idea of great talent, of a sort of genius, in my inmost mind I gave Dr. du Boulbon the benefit of that unlimited confidence which he inspires in us who with an eye more penetrating than other men\u2019s perceives the truth. I knew indeed that he was more of a specialist in nervous diseases, the man to whom Charcot before his death had predicted that he would reign supreme in neurology and psychiatry. \u201cAh! I don\u2019t know about that. It\u2019s quite possible,\u201d put in Fran\u00e7oise, who was in the room and heard Charcot\u2019s name, as she heard du Boulbon\u2019s, for the first time But this in no way prevented her from saying \u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201d Her \u2018possibles,\u2019 her \u2018perhapses,\u2019 her \u2018I don\u2019t knows\u2019 were peculiarly irritating at such a moment. One wanted to say to her: \u201cNaturally you don\u2019t know, since you haven\u2019t the faintest idea of what we are talking about, how can you even say whether it\u2019s possible or not; you know nothing about it. Anyhow, you can\u2019t say now that you don\u2019t know what Charcot said to du Boulbon. You do know because we have just told you, and your \u2018perhapses\u2019 and \u2018possibles\u2019 don\u2019t come in, because it\u2019s a fact.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In spite of this more special competence in cerebral and nervous matters, as I knew that du Boulbon was a great physician, a superior man, of a profound and inventive intellect, I begged my mother to send for him, and the hope that, by a clear perception of the malady, he might perhaps cure it, carried the day finally over the fear that we had of (if we called in a specialist) alarming my grandmother. What decided my mother was the fact that, encouraged unconsciously by Cottard, my grandmother no longer went out of doors, and scarcely rose from her bed. In vain might she answer us in the words of Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9\u2018s letter on Mme. de la Fayette: \u201cEveryone said she was mad not to wish to go out. I said to these persons, so headstrong in their judgment: \u2018Mme. de la Fayette is not mad!\u2019 and I stuck to that. It has taken her death to prove that she was quite right not to go out.\u201d Du Boulbon when he came decided against \u2014 if not Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, whom we did not quote to him \u2014 my grandmother, at any rate. Instead of sounding her chest, fixing on her steadily his wonderful eyes, in which there was perhaps the illusion that he was making a profound scrutiny of his patient, or the desire to give her that illusion, which seemed spontaneous but must be mechanically produced, or else not to let her see that he was thinking of something quite different, or simply to obtain the mastery over her, he began talking about Bergotte\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI should think so, indeed, he\u2019s magnificent, you are quite right to admire him. But which of his books do you prefer? Indeed! Well, perhaps that is the best after all. In any case it is the best composed of his novels. Claire is quite charming in it; of his male characters which appeals to you most?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I supposed at first that he was making her talk like this about literature because he himself found medicine boring, perhaps also to display his breadth of mind and even, with a more therapeutic aim, to restore confidence to his patient, to shew her that he was not alarmed, to take her mind from the state of her health. But afterwards I realised that, being distinguished particularly as an alienist and by his work on the brain, he had been seeking to ascertain by these questions whether my grandmother\u2019s memory was in good order. As though reluctantly he began to inquire about her past life, fixing a stern and sombre eye on her. Then suddenly, as though catching sight of the truth and determined to reach it at all costs, with a preliminary rubbing of his hands, which he seemed to have some difficulty in wiping dry of the final hesitations which he himself might feel and of all the objections which we might have raised, looking down at my grandmother with a lucid eye, boldly and as though he were at last upon solid ground, punctuating his words in a quiet, impressive tone, every inflexion of which bore the mark of intellect, he began. (His voice, for that matter, throughout this visit remained what it naturally was, caressing. And under his bushy brows his ironical eyes were full of kindness.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou will be quite well, Madame, on the day \u2014 when it comes, and it rests entirely with you whether it comes to-day \u2014 on which you realise that there is nothing wrong with you, and resume your ordinary life. You tell me that you have not been taking your food, not going out?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I have a temperature.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He laid a finger on her wrist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot just now, at any rate. Besides, what an excuse! Don\u2019t you know that we keep out in the open air and overfeed tuberculous patients with temperatures of 102?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I have a little albumen as well.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou ought not to know anything about that. You have what I have had occasion to call \u2018mental albumen.\u2019 We have all of us had, when we have not been very well, little albuminous phases which our doctor has done his best to make permanent by calling our attention to them. For one disorder that doctors cure with drugs (as I am told that they do occasionally succeed in doing) they produce a dozen others in healthy subjects by inoculating them with that pathogenic agent a thousand times more virulent than all the microbes in the world, the idea that one is ill. A belief of that sort, which has a disturbing effect on any temperament, acts with special force on neurotic people. Tell them that a shut window is open behind their back, they will begin to sneeze; make them believe that you have put magnesia in their soup, they will be seized with colic; that their coffee is stronger than usual, they will not sleep a wink all night. Do you imagine, Madame, that I needed to do any more than look into your eyes, listen to the way in which you express yourself, look, if I may say so, at this lady, your daughter, and at your grandson, who takes so much after you, to learn what was the matter with you?\u201d \u201cYour grandmother might perhaps go and sit, if the Doctor allows it, in some quiet path in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, near that laurel shrubbery where you used to play when you were little,\u201d said my mother to me, thus indirectly consulting Dr. du Boulbon, her voice for that reason assuming a tone of timid deference which it would not have had if she had been addressing me alone. The Doctor turned to my grandmother and, being apparently as well-read in literature as in science, adjured her as follows: \u201cGo to the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Madame, to the laurel shrubbery which your grandson loves. The laurel you will find health-giving. It purifies. After he had exterminated the serpent Python, it was with a bough of laurel in his hand that Apollo made his entry into Delphi. He sought thus to guard himself from the deadly germs of the venomous monster. So you see that the laurel is the most ancient, the most venerable and, I will add \u2014 what is of therapeutic as well as of prophylactic value \u2014 the most beautiful of antiseptics.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In as much as a great part of what doctors know is taught them by the sick, they are easily led to believe that this knowledge which patients exhibit is common to them all, and they pride themselves on taking the patient of the moment by surprise with some remark picked up at a previous bedside. Thus it was with the superior smile of a Parisian who, in conversation with a peasant, might hope to surprise him by using suddenly a word of the local dialect that Dr. du Boulbon said to my grandmother: \u201cProbably a windy night will make you sleep when the strongest soporifics would have no effect.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, Sir, when the wind blows I can never sleep at all.\u201d But doctors are touchy people. \u201cAch!\u201d muttered du Boulbon, knitting his brows, as if some one had trodden on his toe, or as if my grandmother\u2019s sleeplessness on stormy nights were a personal insult to himself. He had not, however, an undue opinion of himself, and since, in his character as a \u2018superior\u2019 person, he felt himself bound not to put any faith in medicine, he quickly recovered his philosophic serenity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother, in her passionate longing for reassurance from Bergotte\u2019S friend, added in support of his verdict that a first cousin of my grandmother, who suffered from a nervous complaint, had lain for seven years cloistered in her bedroom at Combray, without leaving her bed more than once or twice a week\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou see, Madame, I didn\u2019t know that, and yet I could have told you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I am not in the least like her; on the contrary, my doctor complains that he cannot get me to stay in bed,\u201d said my grandmother, whether because she was a little annoyed by the doctor\u2019s theories, or was anxious to submit to him any objections that might be raised to them, in the hope that he would refute these and that, after he had gone, she would no longer find any doubt lurking in her own mind as to the accuracy of his encouraging diagnosis\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhy, naturally, Madame, you cannot have all the forms of \u2014 if you\u2019ll excuse my saying so \u2014 mania at once; you have others, but not that particular one. Yesterday I visited a home for neurasthenics. In the garden, I saw a man standing on a seat, motionless as a fakir, his neck bent in a position which must have been highly uncomfortable. On my asking him what he was doing there, he replied, without turning his head, or moving a muscle: \u2018You see, Doctor, I am extremely rheumatic and catch cold very easily; I have just been taking a lot of exercise, and while I was getting hot, like a fool, my neck was touching my flannels. If I move it away from my flannels now before letting myself cool down, I am certain to get a stiff neck, and possibly bronchitis.\u2019 Which he would, in fact, have done. \u2018You\u2019re a fine specimen of neurasthenia, that\u2019s what you are,\u2019 I told him. And do you know what argument he advanced to prove that I was mistaken? It was this; that while all the other patients in the place had a mania for testing their weight, so much so that the weighing machine had to be padlocked so that they should not spend the whole day on it, he had to be lifted on to it bodily, so little did he care to be weighed. He prided himself on not sharing the mania of the others without thinking that he had also one of his own, and that it was this which saved him from the other. You must not be offended by the comparison, Madame, for the man who dared not turn his neck for fear of catching a chill is the greatest poet of our day. That poor maniac is the most lofty intellect that I know. Submit to being called a neurotic. You belong to that splendid and pitiable family which is the salt of the earth. All the greatest things We know have come to us from neurotics. It is they and they only who have founded religions and created great works of art. Never will the world be conscious of how much it owes to them, nor above all of what they have suffered in order to bestow their gifts on it. We enjoy fine music, beautiful pictures, a thousand exquisite things, but we do not know what they cost those who wrought them in sleeplessness, tears, spasmodic laughter, rashes, asthma, epilepsy a terror of death which is worse than any of these, and which you perhaps have felt, Madame,\u201d he added with a smile at my grandmother, \u201cfor confess now, when I came into the room, you were not feeling very confident You thought that you were ill; dangerously ill, perhaps. Heaven only knows what the disease was of which you thought you had detected the symptoms. And you were not mistaken; they were there. Neurosis has an absolute genius for malingering. There is no illness which it cannot counterfeit perfectly. It will produce life-like imitations of the dilatations of dyspepsia, the sicknesses of pregnancy, the broken rhythm of the cardiac, the feverishness of the consumptive. If it is capable of deceiving the doctor how should it fail to deceive the patient? No, no; you mustn\u2019t think I\u2019m making fun of your sufferings. I should not undertake to heal them unless I understood them thoroughly. And, well, they say there\u2019s no good confession unless it\u2019s mutual. I have told you that without nervous trouble there can be no great artist. What is more,\u201d he added, raising a solemn forefinger, \u201cthere can be no great scientist either. I will go further, and say that, unless he himself is subject to nervous trouble, he is not, I won\u2019t say a good doctor, but I do say the right doctor to treat nervous troubles. In nervous pathology a doctor who doesn\u2019t say too many foolish things is a patient half-cured, just as a critic is a poet who has stopped writing verse and a policeman a burglar who has retired from practice. I, Madame, I do not, like you, fancy myself to be suffering from albuminuria, I have not your nervous fear of food, nor of fresh air, but I can never go to sleep without getting out of bed at least twenty times to see if my door is shut. And in that home where I found the poet yesterday who would not move his neck, I had gone to secure a room, for \u2014 this is between ourselves \u2014 I spend my holidays there looking after myself when I have increased my own trouble by wearing myself out in the attempt to cure other people.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut do you want me to take a cure like that, Sir?\u201d came to a frightened voice from my grandmother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIt is not necessary, Madame. The symptoms which you describe will vanish at my bidding. Besides, you have with you a very efficient person whom I appoint as your doctor from now onwards. That is your trouble itself, the super-activity of your nerves. Even if I knew how to cure you of that, I should take good care not to. All I need do is to control it. I see on your table there one of Bergotte\u2019s books. Cured of your neurosis you would no longer care for it. Well, I might feel it my duty to substitute for the joys that it procures for you a nervous stability which would be quite incapable of giving you those joys. But those joys themselves are a strong remedy, the strongest of all perhaps. No; I have nothing to say against your nervous energy. All I ask is that it should listen to me; I leave you in its charge. It must reverse its engines. The force which it is now using to prevent you from getting up, from taking sufficient food, let it employ in making you eat, in making you read, in making you go out, and in distracting you in every possible way. You needn\u2019t tell me that you are fatigued. Fatigue is the organic realisation of a preconceived idea. Begin by not thinking it. And if ever you have a slight indisposition, which is a thing that may happen to anyone, it will be just as if you hadn\u2019t it, for your nervous energy will have endowed you with what M. de Talleyrand, in an expression full of meaning, called \u2018imaginary health.\u2019 See, it has begun to cure you already, you have been sitting up in bed listening to me without once leaning back on your pillows; your eye is bright, your complexion is good, I have been talking to you for half an hour by the clock and you have never noticed the time. Well, Madame, I shall now bid you good-day.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, after seeing Dr. du Boulbon to the door, I returned to the room in which my mother was by herself, the oppression that had been weighing on me for the last few weeks lifted, I felt that my mother was going to break out with a cry of joy and would see my joy, I felt that inability to endure the suspense of the coming moment at which a person is going to be overcome with emotion in our presence, which in another category is a little like the thrill of fear that goes through one when one knows that somebody is going to come in and startle one by a door that is still closed; I tried to speak to Mamma but my voice broke, and, bursting into tears, I stayed for a long time, my head on her shoulder, crying, tasting, accepting, relishing my grief, now that I knew that it had departed from my life, as we like to exalt ourselves by forming virtuous plans which circumstances do not permit us to put into execution. Fran\u00e7oise annoyed me by her refusal to share in our joy. She was quite overcome because there had just been a terrible scene between the lovesick footman and the tale-bearing porter. It had required the Duchess herself, in her unfailing benevolence, to intervene, restore an apparent calm to the household and forgive the footman. For she was a good mistress, and that would have been the ideal \u2018place\u2019 if only she didn\u2019t listen to \u2018stories.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the last few days people had begun to hear of my grandmother\u2019s illness and to inquire for news of her. Saint-Loup had written to me: \u201cI do not wish to take advantage of a time when your dear grandmother is unwell to convey to you what is far more than mere reproaches, on a matter with which she has no concern. But I should not be speaking the truth were I to say to you, even out of politeness, that I shall ever forget the perfidy of your conduct, or that there can ever be any forgiveness for so scoundrelly a betrayal.\u201d But some other friends, supposing that my grandmother was not seriously ill (they may not even have known that she was ill at all), had asked me to meet them next day in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, to go with them from there to pay a call together, ending up with a dinner in the country, the thought of which appealed to me. I had no longer any reason to forego these two pleasures. When my grandmother had been told that it was now imperative, if she was to obey Dr. du Boulbon\u2019s orders, that she should go out as much as possible, she had herself at once suggested the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. It would be easy for me to escort her there; and, while she sat reading, to arrange with my friends where I should meet them later; and I should still be in time, if I made haste, to take the train with them to Ville d\u2019Avray. When the time came, my grandmother did not want to go out; she felt tired. But my mother, acting on du Boulbon\u2019s instructions, had the strength of mind to be firm and to insist on obedience. She was almost in tears at the thought that my grandmother was going to relapse again into her nervous weakness, which she might never be able to shake off. Never again would there be such a fine, warm day for an outing. The sun as it moved through the sky interspersed here and there in the broken solidity of the balcony its unsubstantial muslins, and gave to the freestone ledge a warm epidermis, an indefinite halo of gold. As Fran\u00e7oise had not had time to send a \u2018tube\u2019 to her daughter, she left us immediately after luncheon. She very kindly consented, however, to call first at Jupien\u2019s, to get a stitch put in the cloak which my grandmother was going to wear. Returning at that moment from my morning walk I accompanied her into the shop. \u201cIs it your young master who brings you here,\u201d Jupien asked Fran\u00e7oise, \u201cis it you who are bringing him to see me or is it some good wind and fortune that bring you both?\u201d For all his want of education, Jupien respected the laws of grammar as instinctively as M. de Guermantes, in spite of every effort, broke them. With Fran\u00e7oise gone and the cloak mended, it was time for my grandmother to get ready. Having obstinately refused to let Mamma stay in the room with her, she took, left to herself, an endless time over her dressing, and now that I knew her to be quite well, with that strange indifference which we feel towards our relatives so long as they are alive, which makes us put everyone else before them, I felt it to be very selfish of her to take so long, to risk making me late when she knew that I had an appointment with my friends and was dining at Ville d\u2019Avray. In my impatience I finally went downstairs without waiting for her, after I had twice been told that she was just ready. At last she joined me, without apologising to me, as she generally did, for having kept me waiting, flushed and bothered like a person who has come to a place in a hurry and has forgotten half her belongings, just as I was reaching the half-opened glass door which, without warming them with it in the least, let in the liquid, throbbing, tepid air from the street (as though the sluices of a reservoir had been opened) between the frigid walls of the passage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, dear, if you\u2019re going to meet your friends I ought to have put on another cloak. I look rather poverty-stricken in this one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was startled to see her so flushed, and supposed that having begun by making herself late she had had to hurry over her dressing. When we left the cab at the end of the Avenue Gabriel, in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, I saw my grandmother, without a word to me, turn aside and make her way to the little old pavilion with its green trellis, at the door of which I had once waited for Fran\u00e7oise. The same park-keeper who had been standing there then was still talking to Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s \u2018Marquise\u2019 when, following my grandmother who, doubtless because she was feeling sick, had her hand in front of her mouth, I climbed the steps of that little rustic theatre, erected there among the gardens. At the entrance, as in those circus booths where the clown, dressed for the ring and smothered in flour, stands at the door and takes the money himself for the seats, the \u2018Marquise,\u2019 at the receipt of custom, was still there in her place with her huge, uneven face smeared with a coarse plaster and her little bonnet of red flowers and black lace surmounting her auburn wig. But I do not suppose that she recognised me. The park-keeper, abandoning his watch over the greenery, with the colour of which his uniform had been designed to harmonise, was talking to her, on a chair by her side\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cSo you\u2019re still here?\u201d he was saying. \u201cYou don\u2019t think of retiring?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd what have I to retire for, Sir? Will you kindly tell me where I shall be better off than here, where I should live more at my ease, and with every comfort? And then there\u2019s all the coming and going, plenty of distraction; my little Paris, I call it; my customers keep me in touch with everything that\u2019s going on. Just to give you an example, there\u2019s one of them who went out not more than five minutes ago; he\u2019s a magistrate, in the very highest position there is. Very well, Sir,\u201d she cried with ardour, as though prepared to maintain the truth of this assertion by violence, should the agent of civic authority shew any sign of challenging its accuracy, \u201cfor the last eight years, do you follow me, every day God has made, regularly on the stroke of three he\u2019s been here, always polite, never saying one word louder than another, never making any mess; and he stays half an hour and more to read his papers and do his little jobs. There was one day he didn\u2019t come. I never noticed it at the time, but that evening, all of a sudden I said to myself: \u2018Why, that gentleman never came to-day; perhaps he\u2019s dead!\u2019 And that gave me a regular turn, you know, because, of course, I get quite fond of people when they behave nicely. And so I was very glad when I saw him come in again next day, and I said to him, I did: \u2018I hope there was nothing wrong yesterday, Sir?\u2019 Then he told me that it was his wife that had died, and he\u2019d been so put out, poor gentleman, what with one thing and another, he hadn\u2019t been able to come. He had that really sad look, you know, people have when they\u2019ve been married five-and-twenty years, and then the parting, but he seemed pleased, all the same, to be back here. You could see that all his little habits had been quite upset. I did what I could to make him feel at home. I said to him: \u2018Y\u2019 mustn\u2019t let go of things, Sir. Just come here the same as before, it will be a little distraction for you in your sorrow.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u2018Marquise\u2019 resumed a gentler tone, for she had observed that the guardian of groves and lawns was listening to her complacently and with no thought of contradiction, keeping harmlessly in its scabbard a sword which looked more like a horticultural implement or some symbol of a garden-god\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAnd besides,\u201d she went on, \u201cI choose my customers, I don\u2019t let everyone into my little parlours, as I call them. And doesn\u2019t the place just look like a parlour with all my flowers? Such friendly customers I have; there\u2019s always some one or other brings me a spray of nice lilac, or jessamine or roses; my favourite flowers, roses are.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thought that we were perhaps despised by this lady because we never brought any sprays of lilac or fine roses to her bower made me redden, and in the hope of making a bodily escape \u2014 or of being condemned only by default \u2014 from an adverse judgment, I moved towards the exit. But it is not always in this world the people who bring us fine roses to whom we are most friendly, for the \u2018Marquise,\u2019 thinking that I was bored, turned to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like me to open a little place for you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, on my declining:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo? You\u2019re sure you won\u2019t?\u201d she persisted, smiling. \u201cWell, just as you please. You\u2019re welcome to it, but I know quite well, not having to pay for a thing won\u2019t make you want to do it if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this moment a shabbily dressed woman hurried into the place who seemed to be feeling precisely the want in question. But she did not belong to the \u2018Marquise\u2019s\u2019 world, for the latter, with the ferocity of a snob, flung at her:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve nothing disengaged, Ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWill they be long?\u201d asked the poor lady, reddening beneath the yellow flowers in her hat\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Ma\u2019am, if you\u2019ll take my advice, you\u2019ll try somewhere else; you see, there are still these two gentlemen waiting, and I\u2019ve only one closet; the others are out of order.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNot much money there,\u201d she explained when the other had gone. \u201cIt\u2019s not the sort we want here, either; they\u2019re not clean, don\u2019t treat the place with respect, it would be your humble here that would have to spend the next hour cleaning up after her ladyship. I\u2019m not sorry to lose her penny.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally my grandmother emerged, and feeling that she probably would not seek to atone by a lavish gratuity for the indiscretion that she had shewn by remaining so long inside, I beat a retreat, so as not to have to share in the scorn which the \u2018Marquise\u2019 would no doubt heap on her, and began strolling along a path, but slowly, so that my grandmother should not have to hurry to overtake me; as presently she did. I expected her to begin: \u201cI am afraid I\u2019ve kept you waiting; I hope you\u2019ll still be in time for your friends,\u201d but she did not utter a single word, so much so that, feeling a little hurt, I was disinclined to speak first; until looking up at her I noticed that as she walked beside me she kept her face turned the other way. I was afraid that her heart might be troubling her again. I studied her more carefully and was struck by the disjointedness of her gait. Her hat was crooked, her cloak stained; she had the confused and worried look, the flushed, slightly dazed face of a person who has just been knocked down by a carriage or pulled out of a ditch\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was afraid you were feeling sick, Grandmamma; are you feeling better now?\u201d I asked her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Probably she thought that it would be impossible for her, without alarming me, not to make some answer\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI heard the whole of her conversation with the keeper,\u201d she told me. \u201cCould anything have been more typical of the Guermantes, or the Verdurins and their little circle? Heavens, what fine language she put it all in!\u201d And she quoted, with deliberate application, this sentence from her own special Marquise, Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9: \u201cAs I listened to them I thought that they were preparing for me the pleasures of a farewell.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such was the speech that she made me, a speech into which she had put all her critical delicacy, her love of quotations, her memory of the classics more thoroughly even than she would naturally have done, and as though to prove that she retained possession of all these faculties. But I guessed rather than heard what she said, so inaudible was the voice in which she muttered her sentences, clenching her teeth more than could be accounted for by the fear of being sick again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome!\u201d I said lightly, so as not to seem to be taking her illness too seriously, \u201csince your heart is bothering you, shall we go home now? I don\u2019t want to trundle a grandmother with indigestion about the Champs-Elys\u00e9es.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t like to suggest it, because of your friends,\u201d she replied. \u201cPoor boy! But if you don\u2019t mind, I think it would be wiser.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was afraid of her noticing the strange way in which she uttered these words\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCome!\u201d I said to her sharply, \u201cyou mustn\u2019t tire yourself talking; if your heart is bad, it\u2019s silly; wait till we get home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She smiled at me sorrowfully and gripped my hand. She had realised that there was no need to hide from me what I had at once guessed, that she had had a slight stroke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We made our way back along the Avenue Gabriel, through the strolling crowd. I left my grandmother to rest on a seat and went in search of a cab. She, in whose heart I always placed myself when I had to form an opinion of the most unimportant person, she was now closed to me, had become part of the world outside, and, more than from any casual passerby, I was obliged to keep from her what I thought of her condition, to say no word of my uneasiness. I could not have spoken of it to her in greater confidence than to a stranger. She had suddenly handed back to me the thoughts, the griefs which, from the days of my infancy, I had entrusted for all time to her keeping. She was not yet dead. I was already alone. And even those allusions which she had made to the Guermantes, to Mme. de S\u00e9vign\u00e9, to our conversations about the little clan, assumed an air of being without point or occasion, fantastic, because they sprang from the nullity of this very being who to-morrow possibly would have ceased to exist, for whom they would no longer have any meaning, from that nullity, incapable of conceiving them, which my grandmother would shortly be\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, Sir, I don\u2019t like to say no, but you have not made an appointment, you have no time fixed. Besides, this is not my day for seeing patients. You surely have a doctor of your own. I cannot interfere with his practice, unless he were to call me in for a consultation. It\u2019s a question of professional etiquette . . . \u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as I was signalling to a cabman, I had caught sight of the famous Professor E\u2014 \u2014 almost a friend of my father and grandfather, acquainted at any rate with them both, who lived in the Avenue Gabriel, and, with a sudden inspiration, had stopped him just as he was entering his house, thinking that he would perhaps be the very person to advise my grandmother. But he was evidently in a hurry and, after calling for his letters, seemed anxious to get rid of me, so that my only chance of speaking to him lay in going up with him in the lift, of which he begged me to allow him to work the switches himself, this being a mania with him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut, Sir, I am not asking you to see my grandmother here; you will realise from what I am trying to tell you that she is not in a fit state to come; what I am asking is that you should call at our house in half an hour\u2019s time, when I have taken her home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cCall at your house! Really, Sir, you must not expect me to do that. I am dining with the Minister of Commerce. I have a call to pay first. I must change at once, and to make matters worse I have torn my coat and my\u2019 other one has no buttonholes for my. decorations. I beg you, please, to oblige me by not touching the switches. You don\u2019t know how the lift works; one can\u2019t be too careful. Getting that buttonhole made means more delay. Well, as I am a friend of your people, if your grandmother comes here at once I will see her. But I warn you that I shall be able to give her exactly a quarter of an hour, nor a moment more.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I had started off at once, without even getting out of the lift which Professor E\u2014\u2014-had himself set in motion to take me down again, casting a suspicious glance at me as he did so\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We may, indeed, say that the hour of death is uncertain, but when we say so we represent that hour to ourselves as situated in a vague and remote expanse of time, it never occurs to us that it can have any connexion with the day that has already dawned, or may signify that death \u2014 or its first assault and partial possession of us, after which it will never leave hold of us again \u2014 may occur this very afternoon, so far from uncertain, this afternoon every hour of which has already been allotted to some occupation. You make a point of taking your drive every day so that in a month\u2019s time you will have had the full benefit of the fresh air; you have hesitated over which cloak you will take, which cabman to call, you are in the cab, the whole day lies before you, short because you have to be at home early, as a friend is coming to see you; you hope that it will be as fine again to-morrow; and you have no suspicion that death, which has been making its way towards you along another plane, shrouded in an impenetrable darkness, has chosen precisely this day of all days to make its appearance, in a few minutes\u2019 time, more or less, at the moment when the carriage has reached the Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Perhaps those who are haunted as a rule by the fear of the utter strangeness of death will find something reassuring in this kind of death \u2014 in this kind of first contact with death \u2014 because death thus assumes a known, familiar guise of everyday life. A good luncheon has preceded it, and the same outing that people take who are in perfect health. A drive home in an open carriage comes on top of its first onslaught; ill as my grandmother was, there were, after all, several people who could testify that at six o\u2019clock, as we came home from the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, they had bowed to her as she drove past in an open carriage, in perfect weather. Legrandin, making his way towards the Place de la Concorde, raised his hat to us, stopping to look after us with an air of surprise. I, who was not yet detached from life, asked my grandmother if she had acknowledged his greeting, reminding her of his readiness to take offence. My grandmother, thinking me no doubt very frivolous, raised her hand in the air as though to say: \u201cWhat does it matter? It is not of the least importance.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yes, one might have said that, a few minutes earlier, when I was looking for a cab, my grandmother was resting on a seat in the Avenue Gabriel, and that a little later she had driven past in an open carriage. But would that have been really true? The seat, for instance, to maintain its position at the side of an avenue \u2014 for all that it may be subjected also to certain conditions of equilibrium \u2014 has no need of energy. But in order that a living person may be stable, even when supported by a seat or in a carriage, there is required a tension of forces which we do not ordinarily perceive any more than we perceive (because its action is universal) atmospheric pressure. Possibly if we were to be hollowed out and then left to support the pressure of the air we might feel, in the moment that preceded our extinction, that terrible weight which there was nothing left in us to neutralise. Similarly when the abyss of sickness and death opens within us and we have no longer any resistance to offer to the tumult with which the world and our own body rush upon us, then to endure even the tension of our own muscles, the shudder that freezes us to the marrow, then even to keep ourselves motionless in what we ordinarily regard as nothing but the simple negative position of a lifeless thing requires, if we wish our head to remain erect and our eyes calm, an expense of vital energy and becomes the object of an exhausting struggle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if Legrandin had looked back at us with that astonished air, it was because to him, as to the other people who passed us then, in the cab in which my grandmother was apparently seated she had seemed to be foundering, sliding into the abyss, clinging desperately to the cushions which could barely arrest the downward plunge of her body, her hair in disorder, her eye wild, unable any longer to face the assault of the images which its pupil was not strong enough now to bear. She had appeared to them, although I was still by her side, submerged in that unknown world somewhere in which she had already received the blows, traces of which she still bore when I looked up at her a few minutes earlier in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, her hat, her face, her cloak left in disorder by the hand of the invisible angel with whom she had wrestled. I have thought, since, that this moment of her stroke cannot have altogether surprised my grandmother, that indeed she had perhaps foreseen it a long time back, had lived in expectation of it. She had not known, naturally, when this fatal moment would come, had never been certain, any more than those lovers whom a similar doubt leads alternately to found unreasonable hopes and unjustified suspicions on the fidelity of their mistresses. But it is rarely that these grave maladies, like that which now at last had struck her full in the face, do not take up their abode in the sick man for a long time before killing him, during which time they make haste, like a \u2018sociable\u2019 neighbour or tenant, to introduce themselves to him. A terrible acquaintance, not so much from the sufferings that it causes as from the strange novelty of the definite restriction which it imposes upon life. A woman sees herself dying, in these cases not at the actual moment of death but months, sometimes years before, when death has hideously come to dwell in her. The sufferer makes the acquaintance of the stranger whom she hears coming and going in her brain. She does not know him by sight, it is true, but from the sounds which she hears him regularly make she can form an idea of his habits. Is he a criminal? One morning, she can no longer hear him. He has gone. Ah! If it were only for ever! In the evening he has returned. What are his plans? Her specialist, put to the question, like an adored mistress, replies with avowals that one day are believed, another day fail to convince her. Or rather it is not the mistress\u2019s part but that of the servants one interrogates that the doctor plays. They are only third parties. The person whom we press for an answer, whom we suspect of being about to play us false, is life itself, and although we feel her to be no longer the same we believe in her still or at least remain undecided until the day on which she finally abandons us\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I helped my grandmother into Professor E\u2014\u2014\u2018s lift and a moment later he came to us and took us into his consulting room. But there, busy as he was, his bombastic manner changed, such is the force of habit; for his habit was to be friendly, that is to say lively with his patients. Since he knew that my grandmother was a great reader, and was himself one also, he devoted the first few minutes to quoting various favourite passages of poetry appropriate to the glorious summer weather. He had placed her in an armchair and himself with his back to the light so as to have a good view of her. His examination was minute and thorough, even obliging me at one moment to leave the room. He continued it after my return, then, having finished, went on, although the quarter of an hour was almost at an end, repeating various quotations to my grandmother. He even made a few jokes, which were witty enough, though I should have preferred to hear them on some other occasion, but which completely reassured me by the tone of amusement in which he uttered them. I then remembered that M. Falli\u00e8res, the President of the Senate, had, many years earlier, had a false seizure, and that to the consternation of his political rivals he had returned a few days later to his duties and had begun, it was said, his preparations for a more or less remote succession to the Presidency of the Republic. My confidence in my grandmother\u2019s prompt recovery was all the more complete in that, just as I was recalling the example of M. Falli\u00e8res, I was distracted from following up the similarity by a shout of laughter, which served as conclusion to one of the Professor\u2019s jokes. After which he took out his watch, wrinkled his brows petulantly on seeing that he was five minutes late, and while he bade us good-bye rang for his other coat to be brought to him at once. I waited until my grandmother had left the room, closed the door and asked him to tell me the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is not the slightest hope,\u201d he informed me. \u201cIt is a stroke brought on by uraemia. In itself, uraemia is not necessarily fatal, but this case seems to me desperate. I need not tell you that I hope I am mistaken. Anyhow, you have Cottard, you\u2019re in excellent hands. Excuse me,\u201d he broke off as a maid came into the room with his coat over her arm. \u201cI told you, I\u2019m dining with the Minister of Commerce, and I have a call to pay first. Ah! Life is not all a bed of roses, as one is apt to think at your age.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he graciously offered me his hand. I had shut the door behind me, and a footman was shewing us into the hall when we heard a loud shout of rage. The maid had forgotten to cut and hem the buttonhole for the decorations. This would take another ten minutes. The Professor continued to storm while I stood on the landing gazing at a grandmother for whom there was not the slightest hope. Each of us is indeed alone. We started for home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sun was sinking, it burnished an interminable wall along which our cab had to pass before reaching the street in which we lived, a wall against which the shadow cast by the setting sun of horse and carriage stood out in black on a ruddy background, like a funeral car on some Pompeian terra-cotta. At length we arrived at the house. I made the invalid sit at the foot of the staircase in the hall, and went up to warn my mother. I told her that my grandmother had come home feeling slightly unwell, after an attack of giddiness. As soon as I began to speak, my mother\u2019s face was convulsed by the paroxysm of a despair which was yet already so resigned that I realised that for many years she had been holding herself quietly in readiness for an uncalendared but final day. She asked me no question; it seemed that, just as malevolence likes to exaggerate the sufferings of other people, so in her devotion she would not admit that her mother was seriously ill, especially with a disease which might affect the brain. Mamma shuddered, her eyes wept without tears, she ran to give orders for the doctor to be fetched at once; but when Fran\u00e7oise asked who was ill she could not reply, her voice stuck in her throat. She came running downstairs with me struggling to banish from her face the sob that contracted it. My grandmother was waiting below on the sofa in the hall, but, as soon as she heard us coming, drew herself together, stood up, and waved her hand cheerfully at Mamma. I had partially wrapped her head in a white lace shawl, telling her that it was so that she should not catch cold on the stairs. I had hoped that my mother would not notice the change in her face, the distortion of her mouth; my precaution proved unnecessary; my mother went up to my grandmother, kissed her hand as though it were that of her God, raised her up, carried her to the lift with infinite precautions in which there was, with the fear of hurting her by any clumsy movement, the humility of one who felt herself unworthy to touch the most precious thing, to her, in the world, but never once did she raise her eyes, nor look at the sufferer\u2019s face. Perhaps this was in order that my grandmother might not be saddened by the thought that the sight of her could alarm her daughter. Perhaps from fear of a grief so piercing that she dared not face it. Perhaps from reverence, because she did not feel it permissible to herself, without impiety, to remark the trace of any mental weakening on those venerated features. Perhaps to be better able to preserve intact in her memory the image of the true face of my grandmother, radiant with wisdom and goodness. So they went up side by side, my grandmother half hidden by her shawl, my mother turning away her eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile there was one person who never took hers from what could be made out of my grandmother\u2019s altered features, at which her daughter dared not look, a person who fastened on them a gaze wondering, indiscreet and of evil omen: this was Fran\u00e7oise. Not that she was not sincerely attached to my grandmother (indeed she had been disappointed and almost scandalised by the coldness shewn by Mamma, whom she would have liked to see fling herself weeping into her mother\u2019s arms), but she had a certain tendency always to look at the worse side of things, she had retained from her childhood two peculiarities which would seem to be mutually exclusive, but which when combined strengthened one another: the want of restraint common among people of humble origin who make no attempt to conceal the impression, in other words the painful alarm, aroused in them by the sight of a physical change which it would be in better taste to appear not to notice, and the unfeeling coarseness of the peasant who begins by tearing the wings off dragon-flies until she is allowed to wring the necks of chickens, and lacks that modesty which would make her conceal the interest that she feels in the sight of suffering flesh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When, thanks to the faultless ministrations of Fran\u00e7oise, my grandmother had been put to bed, she discovered that she could speak much more easily, the little rupture or obstruction of a blood-vessel which had produced the uraemia having apparently been quite slight. And at once she was anxious not to fail Mamma in her hour of need, to assist her in the most cruel moments through which she had yet had to pass\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWell, my child,\u201d she began, taking my mother\u2019s hand in one of her own, and keeping the other in front of her lips, so as to account for the slight difficulty which she still found in uttering certain words. \u201cSo this is all the pity you shew your mother! You look as if you thought that indigestion was quite a pleasant thing!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then for the first time my mother\u2019s eyes gazed passionately into those of my grandmother, not wishing to see the rest of her face, and she replied, beginning the list of those false promises which we swear but are unable to fulfil:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMamma, you will soon be quite well again, your daughter will see to that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And embodying all her dearest love, all her determination that her mother should recover, in a kiss to which she entrusted them, and which she followed with her mind, with her whole being until it flowered upon her lips, she bent down to lay it humbly, reverently upon the precious brow. My grandmother complained of a sort of alluvial deposit of bedclothes which kept gathering all the time in the same place, over her left leg, and from which she could never manage to free herself. But she did not realise that she was herself the cause of this (so that day after day she accused Fran\u00e7oise unjustly of not \u2018doing\u2019 her bed properly). By a convulsive movement she kept flinging to that side the whole flood of those billowing blankets of fine wool, which gathered there like the sand in a bay which is very soon transformed into a beach (unless the inhabitants construct a breakwater) by the successive deposits of the tide\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother and I (whose falsehood was exposed before we spoke by the obnoxious perspicacity of Fran\u00e7oise) would not even admit that my grandmother was seriously ill, as though such an admission might give pleasure to her enemies (not that she had any) and it was more loving to feel that she was not so bad as all that, in short from the same instinctive sentiment which had led me to suppose that Andr\u00e9e was too sorry for Al-bertine to be really fond of her. The same individual phenomena are reproduced in the mass, in great crises. In a war, the man who does not love his country says nothing against it, but regards it as lost, commiserates it, sees everything in the darkest colours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise was of infinite value to us owing to her faculty of doing without sleep, of performing the most arduous tasks. And if, when she had gone to bed after several nights spent in the sick-room, we were obliged to call her a quarter of an hour after she had fallen asleep, she was so happy to be able to do the most tiring duties as if they had been the simplest things in the world that, so far from looking cross, her face would light up with a satisfaction tinged with modesty. Only when the time came for mass, or for breakfast, then, had my grandmother been in her death agony, still Fran\u00e7oise would have quietly slipped away so as not to make herself late. She neither could nor would let her place be taken by her young footman. It was true that she had brought from Combray an extremely exalted idea of everyone\u2019s duty towards ourselves; she would not have tolerated that any of our servants should \u2018fail\u2019 us. This doctrine had made her so noble, so imperious, so efficient an instructor that there had never come to our house any servants, however corrupted who had not speedily modified, purified their conception of life so far as to refuse to touch the usual commissions from tradesmen and to come rushing \u2014 however little they might previously have sought to oblige \u2014 to take from my hands and not let me tire myself by carrying the smallest package. But at Combray Fran\u00e7oise had contracted also \u2014 and had brought with her to Paris \u2014 the habit of not being able to put up with any assistance in her work. The sight of anyone coming to help her seemed to her like receiving a deadly insult, and servants had remained for weeks in the house without receiving from her any response to their morning greeting, had even gone off on their holidays without her bidding them good-bye or their guessing her reason, which was simply and solely that they had offered to do a share of her work on some day when she had not been well. And at this moment when my grandmother was so ill Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s duties seemed to her peculiarly her own. She would not allow herself, she, the official incumbent, to be done out of her part in the ritual of these festal days. And so her young footman, sent packing by her, did not know what to do with himself, and not content with having copied the butler\u2019s example and supplied himself with note-paper from my desk had begun as well to borrow volumes of poetry from my bookshelves. He sat reading them for a good half of the day, out of admiration for the poets who had written them, but also so as, during the rest of his time, to begem with quotations the letters which he wrote to his friends in his native village. Naturally he expected these to dazzle them. But as there was little sequence in his ideas he had formed the notion that these poems, picked out at random from my shelves, were matters of common knowledge, to which it was customary to refer. So much so that in writing to these peasants, whose stupefaction he discounted, he interspersed his own reflexions with lines from Lamartine, just as he might have said \u201cWho laughs last, laughs longest!\u201d or merely \u201cHow are you keeping?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To ease her pain my grandmother was given morphine. Unfortunately, if this relieved her in other ways, it increased the quantity of albumen. The blows which we aimed at the wicked ogre who had taken up his abode in my grandmother were always wide of the mark, and it was she, her poor interposed body that had to bear them, without her ever uttering more than a faint groan by way of complaint. And the pain that we caused her found no compensation in a benefit which we were unable to give her. The savage ogre whom we were anxious to exterminate we barely succeeded in touching, and all we did was to enrage him still further, and possibly hasten the moment at which he would devour his luckless captive. On certain days when the discharge of albumen had been excessive Cottard, after some hesitation, stopped the morphine. In this man, so insignificant, so common, there was, in these brief moments in which he deliberated, in which the relative dangers of one and another course of treatment presented themselves alternately to his mind until he arrived at a decision, the same sort of greatness as in a general who, vulgar in all the rest of his life, is a great strategist, and in an hour of peril, after a moment\u2019s reflexion, decides upon what is from the military point of view the wisest course, and gives the order: \u201cAdvance eastwards.\u201d Medically, however little hope there might be of setting any limit to this attack of uraemia, it did not do to tire the kidneys. But, on the other hand, when my grandmother did not have morphine, her pain became unbearable; she perpetually attempted a certain movement which it was difficult for her to perform without groaning. To a great extent, suffering is a sort of need felt by the organism to make itself familiar with a new state, which makes it uneasy, to adapt its sensibility to that state. We can discern this origin of pain in the case of certain inconveniences which are not such for everyone. Into a room filled with a pungent smoke two men of a coarse fibre will come and attend to their business; a third, more highly strung, will betray an incessant discomfort. His nostrils will continue to sniff anxiously the odour he ought, one would say, to try not to notice but will keep on attempting to attach, by a more exact apprehension of it, to his troubled sense of smell. One consequence of which may well be that his intense preoccupation will prevent him from complaining of a toothache. When my grandmother was in pain the sweat trickled over the pink expanse of her brow, glueing to it her white locks, and if she thought that none of us was in the room she would cry out: \u201cOh, it\u2019s dreadful!\u201d but if she caught sight of my mother, at once she employed all her energy in banishing from her face every sign of pain, or \u2014 an alternative stratagem \u2014 repeated the same plaints, accompanying them with explanations which gave a different sense, retrospectively, to those which my mother might have overheard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh! My dear, it\u2019s dreadful to have to stay in bed on a beautiful sunny day like this when one wants to be out in the air; I am crying with rage at your orders.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she could not get rid of the look of anguish in her eyes, the sweat on her brow, the convulsive start, checked at once, of her limbs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cThere is nothing wrong. I\u2019m complaining because I\u2019m not lying very comfortably. I feel my hair is untidy, my heart is bad, I knocked myself against the wall.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And my mother, at the foot of the bed, riveted to that suffering form, as though, by dint of piercing with her gaze that pain-bedewed brow, that body which hid the evil thing within it, she could have succeeded in reaching that evil thing and carrying it away, my mother said:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo, no, Mamma dear, we won\u2019t let you suffer like that, we will find something to take it away, have patience just for a moment; let me give you a kiss, darling \u2014 no, you\u2019re not to move.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And stooping over the bed, with bended knees, almost kneeling on the ground, as though by an exercise of humility she would have a better chance of making acceptable the impassioned gift of herself, she lowered towards my grandmother her whole life contained in her face as in a ciborium which she extended over her, adorned in relief with dimples and folds so passionate, so sorrowful, so sweet that one knew not whether they had been carved by the chisel of a kiss, a sob or a smile. My grandmother also, tried to lift up her face to Mamma\u2019s. It was so altered that probably\u2019 had she been strong enough to go out, she would have been recognised only by the feather in her hat. Her features, like the clay in a sculptor\u2019s hands seemed to be straining, with an effort which distracted her from everything else, to conform to some particular model which we failed to identify. This business of modelling was now almost finished, and if my grandmother\u2019s face had shrunk in the process it had at the same time hardened. The veins that ran beneath its surface seemed those not of a piece of marble but of some more rugged stone. Constantly thrust forwards by the difficulty that she found in breathing and as constantly forced back on to her pillow by exhaustion, her face, worn, diminished, terribly expressive, seemed like, in a primitive, almost prehistoric carving, the rude, flushed, purplish, desperate face of some savage guardian of a tomb. But the whole task was not yet accomplished. Next, her resistance must be overcome, and that tomb, the entrance to which she had so painfully guarded, with that tense contraction, entered\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In one of those moments in which, as the saying goes, one does not know what saint to invoke, as my grandmother was coughing and sneezing a good deal, we took the advice of a relative who assured us that if we sent for the specialist X \u2014\u2014-he would get rid of all that in a couple of days. People say that sort of thing about their own doctors, and their friends believe them just as Fran\u00e7oise always believed the advertisements in the newspapers. The specialist came with his bag packed with all the colds and coughs of his other patients, like Aeolus\u2019s bottle. My grandmother refused point-blank to let herself be examined. And we, out of consideration for the doctor, who had had his trouble for nothing, deferred to the desire that he expressed to inspect each of our noses in turn, albeit there was nothing the matter with any of them. According to him, however, there was; everything, whether headache or colic, heart-disease or diabetes, was a disease of the nose that had been wrongly diagnosed. To each of us he said: \u201cI should like to have another look at that little cornea. Don\u2019t put it off too long. I can soon get rid of it for you with a hot needle.\u201d We were, of course, thinking of something quite different. And yet we asked ourselves: \u201cGet rid of what?\u201d In a word, every one of our noses was diseased; his mistake lay only in his use of the present tense. For by the following day his examination and provisional treatment had taken effect. Each of us had his or her catarrh. And when in the street he ran into my father doubled up with a cough, he smiled to think that an ignorant layman might suppose the attack to be due to his intervention. He had examined us at a moment when we were already ill\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother\u2019s illness gave occasion to various people to manifest an excess or deficiency of sympathy which surprised us quite as much as the sort of chance which led one or another of them to reveal to us connecting links of circumstances, or of friendship for that matter, which we had never suspected. And the signs of interest shewn by the people who called incessantly at the house to inquire revealed to us the gravity of an illness which, until then, we had not sufficiently detached from the countless painful impressions that we received in my grandmother\u2019s room. Summoned by telegram, her sisters declined to leave Combray. They had discovered a musician there who gave them excellent chamber concerts, in listening to which they thought that they could find, better than by the invalid\u2019s bedside, food for thought, a melancholy exaltation the form of which was, to say the least of it, unusual. Mme. Sazerat wrote to Mamma, but in the tone of a person whom the sudden breaking off of a betrothal (the cause of the rupture being her Dreyfusism) has parted from one for ever. Bergotte, on the other hand, came every day and spent several hours with me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had always made a habit of going regularly for some time to the same house, where, accordingly, he need not stand on ceremony. But formerly it had been in order that he might talk without being interrupted; now it was so that he might sit for as long as he chose in silence, without being expected to talk. For he was very ill, some people said with albuminuria, like my grandmother. According to another version, he had a tumour. He grew steadily weaker; it was with difficulty that he came up our staircase, with greater difficulty still that he went down it. Even though he held on to the banisters he often stumbled, and he would, I believe, have stayed at home had he not been afraid of losing altogether the habit of going out, the capacity to go out, he, the \u2018man with the little beard\u2019 whom I had seen so alert, not very long since. He was now quite blind and even his speech was frequently obstructed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at the same time, by a directly opposite process, the body of his work, known only to a few literary people at the period when Mme. Swann used to patronise their timid efforts to disseminate it, now grown in stature and strength before the eyes of all, had acquired an extraordinary power of expansion among the general public. The general rule is, no doubt, that only after his death does a writer become famous. But it was while he still lived, and during his slow progress towards a death that he had not yet reached that this writer was able to watch the progress of his works towards Renown. A dead writer can at least be illustrious without any strain on himself. The effulgence of his name is stopped short by the stone upon his grave. In the deafness of the eternal sleep he is not importuned by Glory. But for Bergotte the antithesis was still incomplete. He existed still sufficiently to suffer from the tumult. He was moving still, though with difficulty, while his books, bounding about him, like daughters whom one loves but whose impetuous youthfulness and noisy pleasures tire one, brought day after day, to his very bedside, a crowd of fresh admirers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The visits which he now began to pay us came for me several years too late, for I had no longer the same admiration for him as of old. Which is not in any sense incompatible with the growth of his reputation. A man\u2019s work seldom becomes completely understood and successful before that of another writer, still obscure, has begun in the minds of certain people more difficult to please to substitute a fresh cult for one that has almost ceased to command observance. In the books of Bergotte which I constantly reread, his sentences stood out as clearly before my eyes as my own thoughts the furniture in my room and the carriages in the street. All the details were quite easily seen, not perhaps precisely as one had always seen them but at any rate as one was accustomed to see them now. But a new writer had recently begun to publish work in which the relations between things were so different from those that connected them for me that I could understand hardly anything of what he wrote. He would say, for instance: \u201cThe hose-pipes admired the smart upkeep of the roads\u201d (and so far it was simple, I followed him smoothly along those roads) \u201cwhich started every five minutes from Briand and Claudel.\u201d At that point I ceased to understand, because I had expected the name of a place and was given that of a person instead. Only I felt that it was not the sentence that was badly constructed but I myself that lacked the strength and ability necessary to reach the end. I would start afresh striving tooth and nail to climb to the pinnacle from which I would see things in their novel relations. And each time, after I had got about halfway through the sentence, I would fall back again, as later on, when I joined the Army, in my attempts at the exercise known as the \u2018bridge-ladder.\u2019 I felt nevertheless for the new writer the admiration which an awkward boy who never receives any marks for gymnastics feels when he watches another more nimble. And from then onwards I felt less admiration for Bergotte, whose limpidity began to strike me as insufficient. There was a time at which people recognised things quite easily in pictures when it was Fromentin who had painted them, and could not recognise them at all when it was Renoir\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People of taste and refinement tell us nowadays that Renoir is one of the great painters of the last century. But in so saying they forget the element of Time, and that it took a great deal of time, well into the present century, before Renoir was hailed as a great artist. To succeed thus in gaining recognition, the original painter, the original writer proceeds on the lines adopted by oculists. The course of treatment they give us by their painting or by their prose is not always agreeable to us. When it is at an end the operator says to us: \u201cNow look!\u201d And, lo and behold, the world around us (which was not created once and for all, but is created afresh as often as an original artist is born) appears to us entirely different from the; old world, but perfectly clear. Women pass in the street, different from what they used to be, because they are Renoirs, those Renoir types which we persistently refused to see as women. The carriages, too, are Renoirs, and the water, and the sky: we feel tempted to go for a walk in the forest which reminds us of that other which when we first saw it looked like anything in the world except a forest, like for instance a tapestry of innumerable shades but lacking precisely the shades proper to forests. Such is the new and perishable universe which has just been created. It will last until the next geological catastrophe is precipitated by a new painter or writer of original talent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This writer who had taken Bergotte\u2019s place in my affections wearied me not by the incoherence but by the novelty of associations \u2014 perfectly coherent \u2014 which my mind was not trained to follow. The fact that it was always at the same point that I felt myself relinquish my grasp pointed to a common character in the efforts that I had always to make. Moreover, when once in a thousand times I did succeed in following the writer to the end of his sentence, what I saw there was always of a humour, a truth, a charm similar to those which I had found long ago in reading Bergotte, only more delightful. I reflected that it was not so many years since a similar reconstruction of the world, like that which I was waiting now for his successor to produce, had been wrought for me by Bergotte himself. Until I was led to ask myself whether there was indeed any truth in the distinction which we are always making between art, which is no more advanced now than in Homer\u2019s day, and science with its continuous progress. Perhaps, on the contrary, art was in this respect like science; each new writer seemed to me to have advanced beyond the stage of his immediate predecessor; and how was I to know that in twenty years\u2019 time, when I should be able to accompany without strain or effort the newcomer of to-day, another might not appear at whose approach he in turn would be packed off to the limbo to which his own coming would have consigned Bergotte?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I spoke to the latter of the new writer. He gave me a distaste for him not so much when he said that his art was uncouth, easy and vacuous, as when he told me that he had seen him, and had almost mistaken him (so strong was the likeness) for Bloch. From that moment my friend\u2019s features outlined themselves on the printed pages, and I no longer felt any obligation to make the effort necessary to understand them. If Bergotte had decried him to me it was less, I fancy, out of jealousy for a success that was yet to come than out of ignorance of his work. He read scarcely anything. The bulk of his thought had long since passed from his brain into his books. He had grown thin, as though they had been extracted from him by surgical operations. His reproductive instinct no longer impelled him to any activity, now that he had given an independent existence to almost all his thoughts. He led the vegetative life of a convalescent, of a woman after childbirth; his fine eyes remained motionless, vaguely dazed, like the eyes of a man who lies on the seashore and in a vague daydream sees only each little breaking wave. However, if it was less interesting to talk to him now than I should once have found it, I felt no compunction for that. He was so far a creature of habit that the simplest habits, like the most elaborate, once he had formed them, became indispensable to him for a certain length of time. I do not know what made him come to our house first of all, but after that every day it was simply because he had been there the day before. He would come to the house as he might have gone to a caf\u00e9, so that no one should talk to him, so that he might \u2014 very rarely \u2014 talk himself; one might in short have found in his conduct a sign that he was moved to sympathise with us in our anxiety, or that he enjoyed my company, had one sought to draw any conclusion from such an assiduity in calling. It did not fail to impress my mother, sensitive to everything that might be regarded as an act of homage to her invalid. And every day she reminded me: \u201cSee that you don\u2019t forget to thank him nicely.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We had also \u2014 a discreet feminine attention like the refreshments that are brought to us in the studio, between sittings, by a painter\u2019s mistress \u2014 a courteous supplement to those which her husband paid us professionally, a visit from Mme. Cottard. She came to offer us her \u2018waiting-woman,\u2019 or, if we preferred the services of a man, she would \u2018scour the country\u2019 for one, and, best of all, on our declining, said that she did hope this was not just a \u2018put-off on our part, a word which in her world signifies a false pretext for not accepting an invitation. She assured us that the Professor, who never referred to his patients when he was at home, was as sad about it as if it had been she herself who was ill. We shall see in due course that even if this had been true it would have been at once a very small and a considerable admission on the part of the most faithless and the most attentive of husbands\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Offers as helpful and infinitely more touching owing to the form in which they were couched (which was a blend of the highest intelligence, the warmest sympathy, and a rare felicity of expression) were addressed to me by the Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg. I had met him at Balbec where he had come on a visit to one of his aunts, the Princesse de Luxembourg, being himself at that time merely Comte de Nassau. He had married, some months later, the charming daughter of another Luxembourg Princess, extremely rich, because she was the only daughter of a Prince who was the proprietor of an immense flour-mill. Whereupon the Grand Duke of Luxembourg, who had no children of his own and was devoted to his nephew Nassau, had obtained the approval of his Chamber to his declaring the young man his heir. As with all marriages of this nature, the origin of the bride\u2019s fortune was the obstacle as it was also the deciding factor. I remembered this Comte de Nassau as one of the most striking young men I had ever met, already devoured, at that time, by a dark and blazing passion for his betrothed. I was deeply touched by the letters which he wrote me, day after day, during my grandmother\u2019s illness, and Mamma herself, in her emotion, quoted sadly one of her mother\u2019s expressions: \u201cS\u00e9vign\u00e9 would not have put it better.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the sixth day Mamma, yielding to my grandmother\u2019s entreaties, left her for a little and pretended to go and lie down. I should have liked (so that my grandmother might go to sleep) Fran\u00e7oise to sit quite still and not disturb her by moving. In spite of my supplications, she got up and left the room; she was genuinely devoted to my grandmother; with her uncanny insight and her natural pessimism she regarded her as doomed. She would therefore have liked to pay her every possible attention. But word had just come that an electrician was in the house, one of the oldest servants of his firm, the head of which was his brother-in-law, highly esteemed throughout the building, where he had worked for many years, and especially by Jupien. This man had been ordered to come before my grandmother\u2019s illness. It seemed to me that he might have been sent away again, or told to wait. But Franchise\u2019s code of manners would not permit of this; it would have been a want of courtesy towards this worthy man; my grandmother\u2019s condition ceased at once to matter. When, after waiting a quarter of an hour, I lost my patience and went to look for her in the kitchen, I found her talking to him on the landing of the back staircase, the door of which stood open, a device which had the advantage, should any of us come on the scene, of letting it be thought that they were just saying goodbye, but had also the drawback of sending a terrible draught through the house. Fran\u00e7oise tore herself from the workman, not without turning to shout down after him various greetings, forgotten in her haste, to his wife and brother-in-law. A typical Combray scruple, not to be found wanting in politeness, which Fran\u00e7oise extended even to foreign politics. People foolishly imagine that the vast dimensions of social phenomena afford them an excellent opportunity to penetrate farther into the human soul; they ought, on the contrary, to realise that it is by plumbing the depths of a single personality that they might have a chance of understanding those phenomena. A thousand times over Fran\u00e7oise told the gardener at Combray that war was the most senseless of crimes, that life was the only thing that mattered. Yet, when the Russo-Japanese war broke out, she was quite ashamed, when she thought of the Tsar, that we had not gone to war also to help the \u2018poor Russians,\u2019 \u201csince,\u201d she reminded us, \u201cwe\u2019re allianced to them.\u201d She felt this abstention to be not quite polite to Nicholas II, who had always \u201csaid such nice things about us\u201d; it was a corollary of the same code which would have prevented her from refusing a glass of brandy from Jupien, knowing that it would \u2018upset\u2019 her digestion, and which brought it about that now, with my grandmother lying at death\u2019s door, the same meanness of which she considered France guilty in remaining neutral with regard to Japan she would have had to admit in herself, had she not gone in person to make her apologies to this good electrician who had been put to so much trouble\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Luckily for ourselves, we were soon rid of Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s daughter, who was obliged to be away for some weeks. To the regular stock of advice which people at Combray gave to the family of an invalid: \u201cYou haven\u2019t tried taking him away for a little . . . the change of air, you know . . . pick up an appetite . . . etc?\u201d she had added the almost unique idea, which she had specially created in her own imagination, and repeated accordingly whenever we saw her, without fail, as though hoping by dint of reiteration to force it through the thickness of people\u2019s heads: \u201cShe ought to have taken herself in hand radically from the first.\u201d She did not recommend any one cure rather than another, provided that it were \u2018radical.\u2019 As for Fran\u00e7oise herself, she noticed that we were not giving my grandmother many medicines. Since, according to her, they only destroyed the stomach, she was quite glad of this, but at the same time even more humiliated. She had, in the South of France, some cousins \u2014 relatively well-to-do \u2014 whose daughter, after falling ill just as she was growing up, had died at twenty-three; for several years the father and mother had ruined themselves on drugs, on different doctors, on pilgrimages from one watering-place to another, until her decease. Now all this seemed to Fran\u00e7oise, for the parents in question, a kind of luxury, as though they had owned racehorses, or a Place in the country. They themselves, in the midst of their affliction, derived a certain gratification from the thought of such lavish expenditure. They had now nothing left, least of all their most precious possession, their child, but they did enjoy telling people how they had done as much for her and more than the richest in the land. The ultra-violet rays to the action of which, several times a day for months on end, the poor girl had been subjected, delighted them more than anything. The father, elated in his grief by the glory of it all, was led to speak of his daughter at times as of an operatic star for whose sake he had ruined himself. Fran\u00e7oise was not unmoved by this wealth of scenic effect; that which framed my grandmother\u2019s sickbed seemed to her a trifle meagre, suited rather to an illness on the stage of a small provincial theatre\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There came a time when her uraemic trouble affected my grandmother\u2019s eyes. For some days she could not see at all. Her eyes were not at all like those of a blind person, but remained just the same as before. And I gathered that she could see nothing only from the strangeness of a certain smile of welcome which she assumed the moment one opened the door, until one had come up to her and taken her hand, a smile which began too soon and remained stereotyped on her lips, fixed, but always full-faced, and endeavouring to be visible from all points, because she could no longer rely upon her sight to regulate it, to indicate the right moment, the proper direction, to bring it to the point, to make it vary according to the change of position or of facial expression of the person who had come in; because it was left isolated, without the accompanying smile in her eyes which would have distracted a little from it the attention of the visitor, it assumed in its awkwardness an undue importance, giving one the impression of an exaggerated friendliness. Then her sight was completely restored; from her eyes the wandering affliction passed to her ears. For several days my grandmother was deaf. And as she was afraid of being taken by surprise by the sudden entry of some one whom she would not have heard come in, all day long, albeit she was lying with her face to the wall, she kept turning her head sharply towards the door. But the movement of her neck was clumsy, for one cannot adapt oneself in a few days to this transposition of faculties, so as, if not actually to see sounds, to listen with one\u2019s eyes. Finally her pain grew less, but the impediment of her speech increased. We were obliged to ask her to repeat almost everything that she said\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And now my grandmother, realising that we could no longer understand her, gave up altogether the attempt to speak and lay perfectly still. When she caught sight of me she gave a sort of convulsive start like a person who suddenly finds himself unable to breathe, but could make no intelligible sound. Then, overcome by her sheer powerlessness, she let her head drop on to the pillows, stretched herself out flat in her bed, her face grave, like a face of marble, her hands motionless on the sheet or occupied in some purely physical action such as that of wiping her fingers with her handkerchief. She made no effort to think. Then came a state of perpetual agitation. She was incessantly trying to get up. But we restrained her so far as we could from doing so, for fear of her discovering how paralysed she was. One day when she had been left alone for a moment I found her standing on the floor in her nightgown trying to open the window\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At Balbec, once, when a widow who had jumped into the sea had been rescued against her will, my grandmother had told me (moved perhaps by one of those presentiments which we discern at times in the mystery \u2014 so obscure, for all that \u2014 of the organic life around us, in which nevertheless it seems that our own future is foreshadowed) that she could think of nothing so cruel as to tear a poor wretch from the death that she had deliberately sought and restore her to her living martyrdom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We were just in time to catch my grandmother, she put up an almost violent resistance to my mother, then, overpowered, seated forcibly in an armchair, she ceased to wish for death, to regret being alive, her face resumed its impassivity and she began laboriously to pick off the hairs that had been left on her nightgown by a fur cloak which somebody had thrown over her shoulders\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The look in her eyes changed completely; often uneasy, plaintive, haggard, it was no longer the look we knew, it was the sullen expression of a doddering old woman. . . \n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By dint of repeatedly asking her whether she would not like her hair done, Fran\u00e7oise managed to persuade herself that the request had come from my grandmother. She armed herself with brushes, combs, eau de Cologne, a wrapper. \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt Madame Am\u00e9d\u00e9e,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cif I just comb her; nobody\u2019s ever too ill for a good combing.\u201d In other words, one was never too weak for another person to be able, for her own satisfaction, to comb one. But when I came into the room I saw between the cruel hands of Fran\u00e7oise, as blissfully happy as though she were in the act of restoring my grandmother to health, beneath a thin rain of aged tresses which had not the strength to resist the action of the comb, a head which, incapable of maintaining the position into which it had been forced, was rolling to and fro with a ceaseless swirling motion in which sheer debility alternated with spasms of pain. I felt that the moment at which Fran\u00e7oise would have finished her task was approaching, and I dared not hasten it by suggesting to her: \u201cThat is enough,\u201d for fear of her disobeying me. But I did forcibly intervene when, in order that my grandmother might see whether her hair had been done to her liking, Fran\u00e7oise, with innocent savagery, brought her a glass. I was glad for the moment that I had managed to snatch it from her in time, before my grandmother, whom we had carefully kept without a mirror, could catch even a stray glimpse of a face unlike anything she could have imagined. But, alas, when, a moment later, I leaned over her to kiss that dear forehead which had been so harshly treated, she looked up at me with a puzzled, distrustful, shocked expression: she did not know me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to our doctor, this was a symptom that the congestion of her brain was increasing. It must be relieved in some way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cottard was in two minds. Fran\u00e7oise hoped at first that they were going to apply \u2018clarified cups.\u2019 She looked for the effects of this treatment in my dictionary, but could find no reference to it. Even if she had said \u2018scarified\u2019 instead of \u2018clarified\u2019 she still would not have found any reference to this adjective, since she did not look any more for it under \u2018S\u2019 than under \u2018C\u2019; she did indeed say \u2018clarified\u2019 but she wrote (and consequently assumed that the printed word was) \u2018esclarified.\u2019 Cottard, to her disappointment, gave the preference, though without much hope, to leeches. When, a few hours later, I went into my grandmother\u2019s room, fastened to her neck, her temples, her ears, the tiny black serpents were writhing among her bloodstained locks, as on the head of Medusa. But in her pale and peaceful entirely motionless face I saw wide open, luminous and calm, her own beautiful eyes, as in days gone by (perhaps even more charged with the light of intelligence than they had been before her illness, since, as she could not speak and must not move, it was to her eyes alone that she entrusted her thought, that thought which at one time occupies an immense place in us, offering us undreamed-of treasures, at another time seems reduced to nothing, then may be reborn, as though by spontaneous generation, by the withdrawal of a few drops of blood), her eyes, soft and liquid like two pools of oil in which the rekindled fire that was now burning lighted before the face of the invalid a reconquered universe. Her calm was no longer the wisdom of despair, but that of hope. She realised that she was better, wished to be careful, not to move, and made me the present only of a charming smile so that I should know that she was feeling better, as she gently pressed my hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I knew the disgust that my grandmother felt at the sight of certain animals, let alone being touched by them. I knew that it was in consideration of a higher utility that she was enduring the leeches. And so it infuriated me to hear Fran\u00e7oise repeating to her with that laugh which people use to a baby, to make it crow: \u201cOh, look at the little beasties running about on Madame.\u201d This was, moreover, treating our patient with a want of respect, as though she were in her second childhood. But my grandmother, whose face had assumed the calm fortitude of a stoic, did not seem even to hear her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alas! No sooner had the leeches been taken off than the congestion returned and grew steadily worse. I was surprised to find that at this stage, when my grandmother was so ill, Fran\u00e7oise was constantly disappearing. The fact was that she had ordered herself a mourning dress, and did not wish to keep her dressmaker waiting. In the lives of most women, everything, even the greatest sorrow, resolves itself into a question of \u2018trying-on.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few days later, when I was in bed and sleeping, my mother came to call me in the early hours of the morning. With that tender consideration which, in great crises, people who are crushed by grief shew even for the slightest discomfort of others:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cForgive me for disturbing your sleep,\u201d she said to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI was not asleep,\u201d I answered as I awoke\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I said this in good faith. The great modification which the act of awakening effects in us is not so much that of introducing us to the clear life of consciousness, as that of making us lose all memory of that other, rather more diffused light in which our mind has been resting, as in the opaline depths of the sea. The tide of thought, half veiled from our perception, over which we were drifting still a moment ago, kept us in a state of motion perfectly sufficient to enable us to refer to it by the name of wakefulness. But then our actual awakenings produce an interruption of memory. A little later we describe these states as sleep because we no longer remember them. And when shines that bright star which at the moment of waking illuminates behind the sleeper the whole expanse of his sleep, it makes him imagine for a few moments that this was not a sleeping but a waking state; a shooting star, it must be added, which blots out with the fading of its light not only the false existence but the very appearance of our dream, and merely enables him who has awoken to say to himself: \u201cI was asleep.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a voice so gentle that she seemed to be afraid of hurting me, my mother asked whether it would tire me too much to get out of bed, and, stroking my hands, went on:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy poor boy, you have only your Papa and Mamma to help you now.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We went into the sickroom. Bent in a semicircle on the bed a creature other than my grandmother, a sort of wild beast which was coated with her hair and couched amid her bedclothes lay panting, groaning, making the blankets heave with its convulsions. The eyelids were closed, and it was because the one nearer me did not shut properly, rather than because it opened at all that it left visible a chink of eye, misty, filmed, reflecting the dimness both of an organic sense of vision and of a hidden, internal pain. All this agitation was not addressed to us, whom she neither saw nor knew. But if this was only a beast that was stirring there, where coulel my grandmother be? Yes, I could recognise the shape of her nose, which bore no relation now to the rest of her face, but to the corner of which a beauty spot still adhered, and the hand that kept thrusting the blankets aside with a gesture which formerly would have meant that those blankets were pressing upon her, but now meant nothing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mamma asked me to go for a little vinegar and water with which to sponge my grandmother\u2019s forehead. It was the only thing that refreshed her, thought Mamma, who saw that she was trying to push back her hair. But now one of the servants was signalling to me from the doorway. The news that my grandmother was in the last throes had spread like wildfire through the house. One of those \u2018extra helps\u2019 whom people engage at exceptional times to relieve the strain on their servants (a practice which gives deathbeds an air of being social functions) had just opened the front door to the Duc de Guermantes, who was now waiting in the hall and had asked for me: I could not escape him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cI have just, my dear Sir, heard your tragic news. I should like, as a mark of sympathy, to shake hands with your father.\u201d I made the excuse that I could not very well disturb him at the moment. M. de Guermantes was like a caller who turns up just as one is about to start on a journey. But he felt so intensely the importance of the courtesy he was shewing us that it blinded him to all else, and he insisted upon being taken into the drawing-room. As a general rule, he made a point of going resolutely through the formalities with which he had decided to honour anyone, and took little heed that the trunks were packed or the coffin ready\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cHave you sent for Dieulafoy? No? That was a great mistake. And if you had only asked me, I would have got him to come, he never refuses me anything, although he has refused the Duchesse de Chartres before now. You see, I set myself above a Princess of the Blood. However, in the presence of death we are all equal,\u201d he added, not that he meant to suggest that my grandmother was becoming his equal, but probably because he felt that a prolonged discussion of his power over Dieulafoy and his pre-eminence over the Duchesse de Chartres would not be in very good taste\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This advice did not in the least surprise me. I knew that, in the Guermantes set, the name of Dieulafoy was regularly quoted (only with slightly more respect) among those of other tradesmen who were \u2018quite the best\u2019 in their respective lines. And the old Duchesse de Mortemart n\u00e9eGuermantes (I never could understand, by the way, why, the moment one speaks of a Duchess, one almost invariably says: \u201cThe old Duchess of So-and-so\u201d or, alternatively, in a delicate Watteau tone, if she is still young: \u201cThe little Duchess of So-and-so,\u201d) would prescribe almost automatically, with a droop of the eyelid, in serious cases: \u201cDieulafoy, Dieulafoy!\u201d as, if one wanted a place for ices, she would advise: \u2018Poir\u00e9 Blanche,\u2019 or for small pastry \u2018Rebattet, Rebattet.\u2019 But I was not aware that my father had, as a matter of fact, just sent for Dieulafoy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point my mother, who was waiting impatiently for some cylinders of oxygen which would help my grandmother to breathe more easily, came out herself to the hall where she little expected to find M. de Guermantes. I should have liked to conceal him, had that been possible. But convinced in his own mind that nothing was more essential, could be more gratifying to her or more indispensable to the maintenance of his reputation as a perfect gentleman, he seized me violently by the arm and, although I defended myself as against an assault with repeated protestations of \u201cSir, Sir, Sir,\u201d dragged me across to Mamma, saying: \u201cWill you do me the great honour of presenting me to your mother?\u201d letting go a little as he came to the last word. And it was so plain to him that the honour was hers that he could not help smiling at her even while he was composing a grave face. There was nothing for it but to mention his name, the sound of which at once started him bowing and scraping, and he was just going to begin the complete ritual of salutation. He apparently proposed to enter into conversation, but my mother, overwhelmed by her grief, told me to come at once and did not reply to the speeches of M. de Guermantes who, expecting to be received as a visitor and finding himself instead left alone in the hall, would have been obliged to retire had he not at that moment caught sight of Saint-Loup who had arrived in Paris that morning and had come to us in haste to inquire for news. \u201cI say, this is a piece of luck!\u201d cried the Duke joyfully, catching his nephew by the sleeve, which he nearly tore off, regardless of the presence of my mother who was again crossing the hall. Saint-Loup was not sorry, I fancy, despite his genuine sympathy, at having missed seeing me, considering his attitude towards myself. He left the house, carried off by his uncle who \u2014 having had something very important to say to him and having very nearly gone down to Donci\u00e8res on purpose to say it, was beside himself with joy at being able to save himself so much exertion. \u201cUpon my soul, if anybody had told me I had only to cross the courtyard and I should find you here, I should have thought it a huge joke; as your friend M. Bloch would say, it\u2019s a regular farce.\u201d And as he disappeared down the stairs with Robert whom he held by the shoulder: \u201cAll the same,\u201d he went on, \u201cit\u2019s quite clear I must have touched the hangman\u2019s rope or something; I do have the most astounding luck.\u201d Not that the Duc de Guermantes was ill-bred; far from it. But he was one of those men who are incapable of putting themselves in the place of other people, who resemble in that respect undertakers and the majority of doctors, and who, after composing their faces and saying: \u201cThis is a very painful occasion,\u201d after, if need be, embracing you and advising you to rest, cease to regard a deathbed or a funeral as anything but a social gathering of a more or less restricted kind at which, with a joviality that has been checked for a moment only, they scan the room in search of the person whom they can tell about their own little affairs, or ask to introduce them to some one else, or offer a \u2018lift\u2019 in their carriage when it is time to go home. The Duc de Guermantes, while congratulating himself on the \u2018good wind\u2019 that had blown him into the arms of his nephew, was still so surprised at the reception \u2014 natural as it was \u2014 that had been given him by my mother, that he declared later on that she was as disagreeable as my father was civil, that she had \u2018absent fits\u2019 during which she seemed literally not to hear a word you said to her, and that in his opinion she had no self-possession and perhaps even was not quite \u2018all there.\u2019 At the same time he had been quite prepared (according to what I was told) to put this state of mind down, in part at any rate, to the circumstances, and declared that my mother had seemed to him greatly \u2018affected\u2019 by the sad event. But he had still stored up in his limbs all the residue of bows and reverences which he had been prevented from using up, and had so little idea of the real nature of Mamma\u2019s sorrow that he asked me, the day before the funeral, if I was not doing anything to distract her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A half-brother of my grandmother, who was in religion, and whom I had never seen, had telegraphed to Austria, where the head of his Order was, and having as a special privilege obtained leave, arrived that day. Bowed down with grief, he sat by the bedside reading prayers and meditations from a book, without, however, taking his gimlet eyes from the invalid\u2019s face. At one point, when my grandmother was unconscious, the sight of this cleric\u2019s grief began to upset me, and I looked at him tenderly. He appeared surprised by my pity, and then an odd thing happened. He joined his hands in front of his face, like a man absorbed in painful meditation, but, on the assumption that I would then cease to watch him, left, as I observed, a tiny chink between his fingers. And at the moment when my gaze left his face, I saw his sharp eye, which had been making use of its vantage-point behind his hands to observe whether my sympathy were sincere. He was hidden there as in the darkness of a confessional. He saw that I was still looking and at once shut tight the lattice which he had left ajar. I have met him again since then, but never has any reference been made by either of us to that minute. It was tacitly agreed that I had not noticed that he was spying on me. In the priest as in the alienist, there is always an element of the examining magistrate. Besides, what friend is there, however cherished, in whose and our common past there has not been some such episode which we find it convenient to believe that he must have forgotten?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doctor gave my grandmother an injection of morphine, and to make her breathing less troublesome ordered cylinders of oxygen. My mother, the doctor, the nursing sister held these in their hands; as soon as one was exhausted another was put in its place. I had left the room for a few minutes. When I returned I found myself face to face with a miracle. Accompanied on a muted instrument by an incessant murmur, my grandmother seemed to be greeting us with a long and blissful chant, which filled the room, rapid and musical. I soon realized that this was scarcely less unconscious, that it was as purely mechanical as the hoarse rattle that I had heard before leaving the room. Perhaps to a slight extent it reflected some improvement brought about by the morphine. Principally it was the result (the air not passing quite in the same way through the bronchial tubes) of a change in the register of her breathing. Released by the twofold action of the oxygen and the morphine, my grandmother\u2019s breath no longer laboured, panted, groaned, but, swift and light, shot like a skater along the delicious stream. Perhaps with her breath, unconscious like that of the wind in the hollow stem of a reed, there were blended in this chant some of those more human sighs which, liberated at the approach of death, make us imagine impressions of suffering or happiness in minds which already have ceased to feel, and these sighs came now to add a more melodious accent, but without changing its rhythm, to that long phrase which rose, mounted still higher, then declined, to start forth afresh, from her unburdened bosom in quest of the oxygen. Then, having risen to so high a pitch, having been sustained with so much vigour, the chant, mingled with a murmur of supplication from the midst of her ecstasy, seemed at times to stop altogether like a spring that has ceased to flow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fran\u00e7oise, in any great sorrow, felt the need but did not possess the art \u2014 as simple as that need was futile \u2014 of giving it expression. Regarding my grandmother\u2019s case as quite hopeless, it was her own personal impressions that she was impelled to communicate to us. And all that she could do was to repeat: \u201cIt makes me feel all queer,\u201d in the same tone in which she would say, when she had taken too large a plateful of cabbage broth: \u201cIt\u2019s like a load on my stomach,\u201d sensations both of which were more natural than she seemed to think. Though so feebly expressed, her grief was nevertheless very great, and was aggravated moreover by her annoyance that her daughter, detained at Combray (to which this young Parisian now referred as \u2018the Cambrousse\u2019 and where she felt herself growing \u2018p\u00e9trousse,\u2019 in other words fossilised), would not, presumably, be able to return in time for the funeral ceremony, which was certain, Fran\u00e7oise felt, to be a superb spectacle. Knowing that we were not inclined to be expansive, she made Jupien promise at all costs to keep every evening in the week free. She knew that he would be engaged elsewhere at the hour of the funeral. She was determined at least to \u2018go over it all\u2019 with him on his return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For several nights now my father, my grandfather and one of our cousins had been sitting up, and never left the house during the day. Their continuous devotion ended by assuming a mask of indifference, and their interminable leisure round the deathbed made them indulge in that small talk which is an inseparable accompaniment of prolonged confinement in a railway carriage. Anyhow this cousin (a nephew of my great-aunt) aroused in me an antipathy as strong as the esteem which he deserved and generally enjoyed. He was always \u2018sent for\u2019 in times of great trouble, and was so assiduous in his attentions to the dying that their mourning families, on the pretext that he was in delicate health, despite his robust appearance, his bass voice and bristling beard, invariably besought him, with the customary euphemisms, not to come to the cemetery. I could tell already that Mamma, who thought of others in the midst of the most crushing grief, would soon be saying to him, in a very different form of words, what he was in the habit of hearing said on all such occasions:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cPromise me that you won\u2019t come \u2018to-morrow.\u2019 Please, for \u2018her sake.\u2019 At any rate, you won\u2019t go \u2018all the way.\u2019 It\u2019s what she would have wished.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there was nothing for it; he was always the first to arrive \u2018at the house,\u2019 by reason of which he had been given, among another set, the nickname (unknown to us) of \u2018No flowers by request.\u2019 And before attending everything he had always \u2018attended to everything,\u2019 which entitled him to the formula: \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d came in a loud voice from my grandfather, who had grown rather deaf and had failed to catch something which our cousin had just said to my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNothing,\u201d answered the cousin. \u201cI was just saying that I\u2019d heard from Combray this morning. The weather is appalling down there, and here we\u2019ve got too much sun.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYet the barometer is very low,\u201d put in my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cWhere did you say the weather was bad?\u201d asked my grandfather\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAt Combray.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cAh! I\u2019m not surprised; whenever it\u2019s bad here it\u2019s fine at Combray, and vice versa. Good gracious! Talking of Combray, has anyone remembered to tell Legrandin?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, don\u2019t worry about that, it\u2019s been done,\u201d said my cousin, whose cheeks, bronzed by an irrepressible growth of beard, dimpled faintly with the satisfaction of having \u2018remembered\u2019 it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this point my father hurried from the room. I supposed that a sudden change, for better or worse, had occurred. It was simply that Dr. Dieulafoy had just arrived. My father went to receive him in the drawing-room, like the actor who is to come next on the stage. We had sent for him not to cure but to certify, in almost a legal capacity. Dr. Dieulafoy might indeed be a great physician, a marvellous professor; to these several parts, in which he excelled, he added a third, in which he remained for forty years without a rival, a part as original as that of the arguer, the scaramouch or the noble father, which consisted in coming to certify an agony or a death. The mere sound of his name foreshadowed the dignity with which he would sustain the part, and when the servant announced: \u201cM. Dieulafoy,\u201d one imagined oneself at a play by Moli\u00e8re. To the dignity of his attitude was added, without being conspicuous, the suppleness of a perfect figure. A face in itself too good-looking was toned down by the convention due to distressing circumstances. In the sable majesty of his frock coat the Professor entered the room, melancholy without affectation, uttered not the least word of condolence, which might have been thought insincere, nor was he guilty of the slightest infringement of the rules of tact. At the foot of a deathbed it was he and not the Duc de Guermantes who was the great gentleman Having examined my grandmother, but not so as to tire her, and with ari excess of reserve which was an act of courtesy to the doctor who was treating the case, he murmured a few words to my father, bowed respectfully to my mother to whom I felt that my father had positively to restrain himself from saying: \u201cProfessor Dieulafoy.\u201d But already our visitor had turned away, not wishing to seem to be soliciting an introduction, and left the room in the most polished manner conceivable, simply taking with him the sealed envelope that was slipped into his hand. He had not appeared to see it, and we ourselves were left wondering for a moment whether we had really given it to him, such a conjurer\u2019s nimbleness had he put into the act of making it vanish without thereby losing anything of the gravity \u2014 which was increased rather \u2014 of the great consultant in his long frock coat with its silken lapels, and his handsome head full of a noble commiseration. The slowness and vivacity of his movements shewed that, even if he had a hundred other visits to pay and patients waiting, he refused to appear hurried. For he was the embodiment of tact, intelligence and kindness. That eminent man is no longer with us. Other physicians, other professors may have rivalled, may indeed have surpassed him. But the \u2018capacity\u2019 in which his knowledge, his physical endowments, his distinguished manners made him triumph exists no longer for want of any successor capable of taking his place. Mamma had not even noticed M. Dieulafoy, everything that was not my grandmother having no existence for her. I remember (and here I anticipate) that at the cemetery, where we saw her, like a supernatural apparition, go up timidly to the grave and seem to be gazing in the wake of a flying form that was already far away, my father having remarked to her: \u201cOld Norpois came to the house and to the church and on here; he gave up a most important committee meeting to come; you ought really to say a word to him, he\u2019ll be so gratified if you do,\u201d my mother, when the Ambassador stood before her and bowed, could do no more than gently incline a face that shewed no tears. A couple of days earlier \u2014 to anticipate once again before returning to where we were just now by the bed on which my grandmother lay dying \u2014 while they were watching by the body, Fran\u00e7oise, who, not disbelieving entirely in ghosts, was terrified by the least sound, had said: \u201cI believe that\u2019s her.\u201d But in place of fear it was an ineffable sweetness that her words aroused in my mother, who would have been so glad that the dead should return, to have her mother with her sometimes still\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To return now to those last hours, \u201cYou heard about the telegram her sisters sent us?\u201d my grandfather asked the cousin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cYes, Beethoven, they told me about it, it\u2019s worth framing; still, I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cMy poor wife, who was so fond of them, too,\u201d said my grandfather, wiping away a tear. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t blame them. They\u2019re stark mad, both of them, as I\u2019ve always said. What\u2019s the matter now; aren\u2019t you going on with the oxygen?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mother spoke: \u201cOh, but then Mamma will be having more trouble with her breathing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The doctor reassured her: \u201cOh, no! The effect of the oxygen will last a good while yet; we can begin it again presently.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to me that he would not have said this of a dying woman, that if this good effect were to last it meant that we could still do something to keep her alive. The hiss of the oxygen ceased for a few moments, But the happy plaint of her breathing poured out steadily, light, troubled, unfinished, without end, beginning afresh. Now and then it seemed that all was over, her breath stopped, whether owing to one of those transpositions to another octave that occur in the breathing of a sleeper, or else from a natural interruption, an effect of unconsciousness, the progress of asphyxia, some failure of the heart. The doctor stooped to feel my grandmother\u2019s pulse, but already, as if a tributary were pouring its current into the dried river-bed, a fresh chant broke out from the interrupted measure. And the first was resumed in another pitch with the same inexhaustible force. Who knows whether, without indeed my grandmother\u2019s being conscious of them, a countless throng of happy and tender memories compressed by suffering were not escaping from her now, like those lighter gases which had long been compressed in the cylinders? One would have said that everything thai she had to tell us was pouring out, that it was to us that she was addressing herself with this prolixity, this earnestness, this effusion. At the foot of the bed, convulsed by every gasp of this agony, not weeping but now and then drenched with tears, my mother presented the unreasoning desolation of a leaf which the rain lashes and the wind twirls on its stem. They made me dry my eyes before I went up to kiss my grandmother\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cBut I thought she couldn\u2019t see anything now?\u201d said my father\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOne can never be sure,\u201d replied the doctor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When my lips touched her face, my grandmother\u2019s hands quivered, a long shudder ran through her whole body, reflex perhaps, perhaps because certain affections have their hyperaesthesia which recognises through the veil of unconsciousness what they barely need senses to enable them to love. Suddenly my grandmother half rose, made a violent effort, as though struggling to resist an attempt on her life. Fran\u00e7oise could not endure this sight and burst out sobbing. Remembering what the doctor had just said I tried to make her leave the room. At that moment my grandmother opened her eyes. I thrust myself hurriedly in front of Fran\u00e7oise to hide her tears, while my parents were speaking to the sufferer. The sound of the oxygen had ceased; the doctor moved away from the bedside. My grandmother was dead\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An hour or two later Fran\u00e7oise was able for the last time, and without causing them any pain, to comb those beautiful tresses which had only begun to turn grey and hitherto had seemed not so old as my grandmother herself. But now on the contrary it was they alone that set the crown of age on a face grown young again, from which had vanished the wrinkles, the contractions, the swellings, the strains, the hollows which in the long course of years had been carved on it by suffering. As at the far-off time when her parents had chosen for her a bridegroom, she had the features delicately traced by purity and submission, the cheeks glowing with a chaste expectation, with a vision of happiness, with an innocent gaiety even which the years had gradually destroyed. Life in withdrawing from her had taken with it the disillusionments of life. A smile seemed to be hovering on my grandmother\u2019s lips. On that funeral couch, death, like a sculptor of the middle ages, had laid her in the form of a young maidenEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/5969893",

His eyes were so big.\n*Kenny fast-forwards the video*\n\nNeo-Nazi: Such a bitch. He won't quit.\n\nJesse: *on video recording* Then we turn around and there is this kid on a dirt bike looking at us. Drew Sharp, that kid that went missing up in Whitehorse. And then out of nowhere, Todd, that Opie, dead-eyed piece of shit, pulls out a gun and shoots the kid.\n\nHank: *on video recording* And this is Todd Alquist we're talking about? He killed Drew Sharp?\n\nJesse: *on video recording* Boom. Like it was nothing.\n\n*Kenny pauses the tape. Todd looks over with a big smile on his face. Jack leaves the house upset with a gun in his hand*\n\nTodd: Uncle Jack. Hold up. Now, I think we should keep him for a while and get a couple cooks under our belt.\n\nJack: You seriously giving me this turn-the-other-cheek crap? He ratted you out, personally.\n\nTodd: Well, we've still got 600 gallons of methylamine.\n\nJack: Meth? Who gives a shit about meth? We won the lottery here. We've got all the money in the world. You're talking to me about selling crank?\n\nTodd: Well, this is millions, Uncle Jack. No matter how much you got, how do you turn your back on more?\n\nJack: You little son of a bitch.\n\n*Jack grabs Todd playfully, laughing*\n\nJack: It's that Lydia woman, you're sweet on her, you little bastard. Hey, Kenny, you believe this?\n\nKenny: Hey, it's all about this right here, huh? *laughs*\n\nJack: Come on, you can do better! I mean, that one's so uptight she's probably got a wood-chipper for a coochie. Stick in down there you're pulling back a stump. *laughs* Aw, what the hell. The heart wants what the heart wants, right? Let's go watch some more of that cry baby rat, huh?\n\n*They all go back into the house. Jesse is sitting in the pit holding the picture of Andrea and Brock. He pulls off the paperclip and uses it to try to break free of his handcuffs*\n\nThe extractor: How thick is it? This is mild steel? Uh huh. No, this would be cash.\n\n*Walt is writing on a notepad while Saul stares at him. Walt takes a break to rub his injured hand. He looks over at Saul*\n\nWalt: What?\n\nSaul: Nothing.\n\nWalt: Look, you know what. Make yourself useful. Give me a list of hitters, mercenaries. Yes, yes, I remember, you've got concerns. Don't worry, we'll take the time to vet them. Make sure there are no undercover cops on the team. Five should do it, providing they are the right men for the job.\n\nSaul: I'm gonna hate myself for asking, but, uh, who are we hitting?\n\nWalt: Jack Welker and his men. They murdered Hank, they stole my life's work.\n\nSaul: I don't know any hitmen.\n\nWalt: You know a guy who knows a guy. Just get me the contacts, anybody in that world. I'm paying top dollar, we'll find them.\n\nSaul: You mind if I give you a nickel's worth of advice just for old time's sake? You're worried about your wife and kids. Don't leave. The way things are right now, some people, not me, mind you, but some people might say you're leaving her high and dry.\n\nWalt: Some people would be ignorant on the facts. Some people wouldn't know that as far as the police are concerned, Skyler is a blameless victim.\n\n*Saul sits back down, waving Walt off*\n\nWalt: No, no, no, go ahead. Get it off your chest. Go on.\n\nSaul: The phone call was a smart move, kudos to you. Odds are, it was recorded, it's gonna play great for a jury, it might even buy her a mistrial. In a year and a half. Until then, if they don't have you, they're going after her.\n\nWalt: There's no point. She knows nothing.\n\nSaul: Well, too bad for her then. She's got nothing to trade. I hate to be a downer here, but there are two DEA agents missing, presumed dead. You think the feds are gonna just let that go because you hit the ejector seat? First thing they're gonna do is they'll RICO your wife and kids out of the house. That condo is gone. Your bank account is frozen. Her picture's probably on TV right now next to yours. Who's gonna hire her?\n\nWalt: Money's no problem.\n\nSaul: Well, I don't mean to contradict you, but getting it to her? Impossible. The feds are just praying that she'll make contact. The Internet, the phones, it's all tapped. Hey, Mike was no dummy. But every time he tried to get his nest egg to his granddaughter, it ended up in Uncle Sam's pockets.\n\nWalt: So you propose what?\n\nSaul: Stay. Face the music. Hey, I mean how much time do you got left? You walk in with your head held high, you'll be the John Dillinger of the Metropolitan Detention Center. How bad is that? And you bring a barrel full of drug money? Maybe that soothes some troubled waters. Maybe they let your family stay in the house. After all, the house predates the criminal enterprise.\n\nWalt: You think I wanna run?! This is the last thing that I want! This, this changes nothing. What I do, I do for my family. My money goes to my children. Not just this barrel, all of it! I'm going to kill Jack and his entire crew. And I'm going to take back what is mine and give it to my children and then AND ONLY THEN am I through. Do you understand?\n\n*The extractor opens the door and walks in*\n\nThe extractor: Everything good?\n\nSaul: Define good.\n\nThe extractor: *to Saul* You're set, time to go. *to Walt* You'll be a little longer, still workin' on transportation.\n\nWalt: Change of plans. He's coming with me.\n\nSaul: No. No, that's not.\n\nWalt: We're going together. I can use him.\n\nThe extractor: I'll give you two a minute.\n\nSaul: Hey, I'm a civilian. I'm not your lawyer anymore, I'm nobody's lawyer, the fun's over. From here on out, I'm mister low profile. Just another douchebag with a job and three pairs of Dockers. If I'm lucky, three months from now, best case scenario, I'm managing a Cinnabon in Omaha.\n\nWalt: You're still part of this whether you like it or not.\n\nSaul: I'm sorry, I don't think so.\n\n*Walt stares at Saul and starts walking him back into the wall*\n\nWalt: You remember what I told you? It's not over...unti-\n\n*Walt begins coughing and falls onto the bed. Saul looks down at him*\nSaul: It's over.\n\n*Saul walks away as Walt continues to cough. Saul grabs his suitcases and leaves*\n\n*There is a loud, screeching noise playing as Skyler sits at a desk with attorneys and stares forward. They're talking about Skyler's situation but she's seemingly not listening*\n\nAttorney: Is she even listening? *to Skyler* Mrs. White. Are you following all this? Do you understand what's happening here?\n\nSkyler: Yes. I understand. I understand I'm in terrible trouble. I understand that you will use everything in your power against me and my children unless, unless I give you Walt. But the truth is, I can't give you what you want. I don't know where he is.\n\nAttorney: Alright, go and discuss this with your lawyer here. Rack your brain and hope you can come up with something we can use.\n\n*Two officers are sitting in a car outside the White residence*\n\nWoman on radio: 417.\n\nOfficer: 417, no activity.\n\n*Skyler sits on the couch staring out the window while she smokes a cigarette and holds a drink in her hand. Holly cries out in the distance. Skyler walks towards the bedroom. Inside are three masked Neo-Nazis. One runs to cover her mouth*\n\nTodd: *to Skyler* Ma'am, is there anybody else in the house? What about your son. If I go look in his room, am I gonna see him? He's not gonna pop out and surprise me? If this guy takes his hand away, are you gonna scream?\n\nSkyler: *breathing heavily* He's at his friend's house. He's been there all week. Please. Please, don't hurt my baby. Please.\n\nTodd: Ma'am.\n\nSkyler: Please.\n\nTodd: We got a lot of respect for your husband. It's just something we gotta straighten out. Look, we know you've been talking to the police and that's okay, you gotta do that. But you've seen some people. Like the lady who came into the car wash? The one with the black hair. Have you said anything about her? You sure about that?\n\nSkyler: I didn't.\n\nTodd: The police don't need to know anything about her.\n\n*Skyler shakes her head*\n\nTodd: Ma'am, I'm gonna need you to say it.\n\nSkyler: I will not say anything about her, ever. I swear.\n\nTodd: Okay. When we leave, you're not gonna go running to those police officers out front?\n\nSkyler: No.\n\nTodd: Okay. Okay. I just really don't want us coming back here.\n\n*Todd looks at her one last time with his hand on her shoulder. He nods, then leaves with the other two Neo-Nazis. Skyler runs to Holly's crib where she's now crying*\n\n*Todd takes a sip from his cup. Lydia walks into the restaurant and past him and sits behind him. Todd goes to get up*\n\nLydia: Don't. Stay where you are. We'll talk like this.\n\nTodd: Okay. So that thing that we talked about, I went to Mr. and Mrs. White's house-\n\nLyda: You don't have to say the name.\n\nTodd: Sure, and it went really good. The message was received loud and clear.\n\nLydia: The message? Yeah. Look. I know you did your best, I just think-\n\nWaitress: Hi. What can I get you?\n\nLydia: Chamomile tea with soy milk, please. And I'll need more Stevia.\n\nWaitress: Sure.\n\nLydia: *to Todd* The person we're discussing saw my face. You're not Western Union, Todd, we can't just settle with you sending messages.\n\nTodd: Really, if you'd been there, I think you'd see it different. We threw a real scare into her. She seems like a nice lady watching out for her kids. So, you're not going to have a problem with her, I can pretty much guarantee it.\n\nLydia: I wish I had your certainty, but I'm not like you and your uncle. I'm just, I'm not used to this sort of risk. We're gonna have to take a break.\n\n*Lydia grabs her purse and begins searching through it*\n\nTodd: I have fifty pounds vacuum-packed and ready to go.\n\nLydia: And I wish you all the luck in the world with it.\n\nTodd: It's 92%.\n\nLydia: I'm sorry?\n\nTodd: 92%.\n\nLydia: Truly?\n\nTodd: Tested it twice and it's blue just like before.\n\nLydia: 92? That's Heisenberg level. He's not with you?\n\nTodd: Next best thing, Pinkman.\n\nLydia: They're looking for Pinkman.\n\nTodd: Well, they're not gonna find him, he's with us and he's not going anywhere. Ms. Quayle, this is what your guys in Europe have been begging for, right? I just think we work together...good. We make a good team. I think it's kind of mutually good.\nLydia: 92%.\n*Todd reaches forward and picks something off Lydia's back*\n\n*Walt stumbles out of the propane truck*\n\nThe extractor: Mr. Lambert. Welcome to New Hampshire.\n\n*Walt wheels his barrel of money into his new lodge*\n\nWalt: Alright, let's have a look at this place.\n\nThe extractor: You got about a month's worth of food on hand. Most of it's canned goods, but there's steaks in the freezer. You got a generator outside, works on LP. Oughta be enough in the tank to last out the winter. It's only fifteen amps, but that oughta do for the lights, TV, and the freezer. That's a woodburner, oughta warm the place up pretty good, plus you can cook on it. On the TV front, the reception is pretty much nil. You've got some mountains in the way. Weather's right you might be able to catch Montreal, but mostly you'll be limited to DVDs.\n\nWalt: *looking through the DVDs* Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium. Two copies.\n\nThe extractor: I'm not much of a movie guy. I'll make a supply run next month, you want something else to watch, put it on the list.\n\nWalt: Supply run. $50,000 for a trip to Costco.\n\nThe extractor: It's risk. And risk is what you're paying me for, not toilet paper. Risk and a 4400-mile round-trip. Mr. Lambert, my clients and I don't usually have an ongoing relationship. Normally, you and I would've gone our separate ways, but you're you.\n\nWalt: Where's the phone?\n\nThe extractor: No phone. Up here, ice storms equal service calls equal you in cuffs.\n\nWalt: Internet?\n\nThe extractor: Same deal. Also, satellite, cable TV, drop phone, car. You want news, I'll bring the Albuquerque papers. Whatever you need, just\n\n*Walt and the extractor at the same time* Put it on the list.\n\nWalt: Yeah. Look, I have business to conduct.\n\nThe extractor: Your business is your business. My business is keeping you out of custody. You are the target of a nationwide manhunt. Your face is all over TV. You are the hottest client I've ever had by far. That stands to reason, you've gotta keep out of sight.\n\nWalt: And what's keeping me from walking out that gate?\n\nThe extractor: Nothing. There's a little one-horse town eight miles down the hill. There's not a thing on God's green earth that I could do to stop you from going down there. All I'm saying is, if you leave this place, you will get caught. And I gotta tell you. If I found out you've left the reservation, I won't be coming back. That is for my own safety, you understand?\n\nWalt: Sure.\n\nThe extractor: You know how to work the stove? The flue can be tricky.\n\nWalt: Yeah, I've got it.\n\nThe extractor: You paid good money for this. You've got two acres up here, lots of wood, nice, warm place. Seems to me just the spot for a man to rest up. Think on things. If you look around, it's kind of beautiful.\n\nWalt: You're very helpful. Thank you.\n\n*Walt walks away as the extractor gets into his propane truck*\n\nThe extractor: See you in a month.\n\n*Walt opens up his barrel of money. He grabs a few handfuls and stuffs them into his coat pockets. He puts the top back on and looks at a black duffel bag. He reaches inside and pulls out his Heisenberg hat. Music begins playing as he puts it on and heads outside. He walks along the path to the front gate and opens it. He stares down the road for a bit then starts coughing. He closes the gate*\n\nWalt: Tomorrow. Tomorrow.\n\n*He walks back to the house. Inside the house, he lights a match, starts the wood burning stove, and warms up*\n\n*Jesse is standing on a bucket, which is on top of his other things in an attempt to reach the bars up top and escape*\n\nNeo-Nazi: Oh, so you're just too good to eat with the rest of us, huh?\n\nTodd: It's not for me.\n\n*Jesse jumps down off the bucket*\n\nNeo-Nazi: Damn, man, seriously? It's not my chocolate-chip, is it? You're gonna spoil him!\n\n*Todd removes the tarp*\n\nTodd: *to Jesse* Hey, you awake?\n\nJesse: Huh? Yeah.\n\nTodd: We had some Ben and Jerry's. There was peanut butter and AmeriCone Dream. I didn't know what you like, so I got you some of each.\n*Todd lowers a bucket with ice cream down to Jesse*\n\nTodd: There you go.\n\n*Jesse takes the ice cream and Todd reels the bucket back in. Todd takes out a cigarette and lights it*\n\nTodd: So, that batch that you just cooked. It was 96%. Kind of figured you deserved a little something.\n\nJesse: Thanks.\n\nTodd: Well. Better get some sleep, tomorrow's gonna be a big day. Got a whole new batch.\n\nJesse: Hey, uh, Todd.\n\nTodd: Yeah.\n\nJesse: You mind leaving the tarp off tonight?\n\nTodd: It might get cold.\n\nJesse: No, I, I don't mind, I just wanna see the stars.\n\nTodd: Sure. Okay.\n\nJesse: Thanks.\n\nTodd: Goodnight, Jesse.\n\nJesse: Goodnight.\n\n*Todd walks away and Jesse uses the paperclip to break out of his handcuffs again. He gets on top of the bucket and jumps up to the bars and manages to unlock the gate and climb out. He runs away and tries to escape. He runs past a camera and toward the gate with barbed wire. As he's climbing it, the Neo-Nazis surround him*\nJesse: Do it! Do it! Just kill me now and get it over with because there's no way I'm doing one more cook for you psycho fucks!\n*Todd walks towards Andrea's house. He rings her doorbell and Andrea answers*\n\nAndrea: Yes?\n\nTodd: Hi, ma'am, how you doing tonight? You're Andrea, right?\n\nAndrea: How can I help you?\n\nTodd: You know Jesse Pinkman, right? I'm a friend of his, my name's Todd. Sorry to bother you so late, it's nice to meet you.\n\nAndrea: How is Jesse, is he okay?\n\nTodd: Yeah, he's okay. Actually, I brought him with me.\n\nAndrea: Jesse's here?\n\nTodd: Yeah, he's right over there in that truck.\n\n*Andrea walks out onto the porch. Jesse is in the truck slamming against the door. Todd checks to make sure the coast is clear and takes out his gun*\n\nTodd: Just so you know, this isn't personal.\n\n*Todd shoots Andrea in the back of the head. Jesse screams in agony in the truck. Todd opens the door and gets back in the truck*\n\nJack: Woah. Hey! Settle down. Settle down. Hey, remember. There's still a kid.\n*Walt walks towards the gate as the extractor approaches. Walt opens the gate*\n*Inside, Walt cuts open the stack of newspapers and gets one to read*\n\nThe extractor: I brought you a couple cases of Ensure maybe to put a little weight on you.\n\nWalt: Jesus, I can barely read this.\n\nThe extractor: Almost forgot. Without a prescription, I had to take an educated guess and shotgun it, one of these oughta come close.\n\nWalt: Oh. Did you check on them? Is Skyler in a better place?\n\nThe extractor: Nah, she's still at that place off Eubank. Kids are both still with her for the moment. There's no court date yet. News was talking about a grand jury, but didn't say when. I saw her public defender on TV, looks like a deer in the headlights. I think I got socks older than him.\n\nWalt: What are they doing for money?\n\nThe extractor: She's doing taxi dispatch part-time. Leaves the baby with the neighbor when she goes in. I saw her shopping one time, she looks pretty good. And she's using her maiden name, I wouldn't take it personally under the circumstances. Those working for ya?\n\nWalt: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nThe extractor: I took a run by your old house, the auction is still pending. They put a fence up around it.\n\nWalt: They put up a fence?\n\nThe extractor: Seems like the place got to be kind of a tourist attraction. Kids breaking in. Neighbors complained, so the bank put up a fence. *holding a box* You ready?\n\nWalt: Hm? Yeah.\n\nThe extractor: Sorry about last time, should go better now. I watched a couple of YouTube videos, it's all about finding the vein.\n\nWalt: Give it to me, I'll do it.\n\n*Walt tries to insert the IV into his arm*\n\nWalt: Here, you do it.\n\nThe extractor: Make a fist, tight, there we go. Alright, let's just stick, that's it. Okay, hey, pretty good, there we go. I think I had it worse at my last physical. *gets up to leave* I will see you on, let's see. Afternoon of the fifteenth.\n\nWalt: Stay a little longer?\n\nThe extractor: Yeah, I got a long trip ahead of me.\n\nWalt: Two hours? I'll give you another $10,000. Please.\n\nThe extractor: 10,000? One hour.\n\n*Walt agrees*\n\nThe extractor: Cards? Alright, well, the game will be seven-card. I'll deal since you are...encumbered.\n\nWalt: One of these days when you come up here, I'll be dead. My money over there, what happens to it then? What if I asked you to give it to my family? Would you do it?\n\nThe extractor: If I said yes, would you believe me? You wanna cut the cards?\n\nWalt: No.\nThe extractor: A king. Two kings.\n\n*Walt is lying in his bed. He starts coughing and his wedding ring slides off his finger. He gets up and picks it up. He takes some twine and ties his ring around his neck, coughing. He looks over at the Ensure boxes and gets up. He opens one up, empties it out, and puts some money in. He takes the box full of money and walks to the gate. He unlocks the gate and hesitates to leave. He walks toward town with the box*\n\nCarmen: *over the PA* Flynn White to the principal's office, please.\n\n*Junior gets up*\n\nCarmen: *to Junior* I'm sorry to pull you out of class. It's your aunt Marie, it sounds very important. You can take it in here, okay? *into phone* Here he is.\n\nJunior: *to Carmen* Thank you. *into phone* Hey, Aunt Marie, what's going on?\n\nWoman at bar: Hold on a sec, honey.\n\n*She hands the phone off to Walt, who gives her some money. A hockey game is playing in the background*\n\nWalt: Son, it's me. Please, don't let on. Carmen's nearby, right? She cannot know. Son, are you there?\n\nJunior: Yes.\n\nWalt: It's so good to hear your voice. I, I, uh. Son, the things that they're saying about me. I did wrong, I made some terrible mistakes. But the reasons were always. Things happened that I never intended...I never intended. Listen, son, we don't have much time. Is Louis's family still at 4848 Newcomb? Son, your friend, Louis Corbett. Does his family still live in that same place up on Newcomb?\n\nJunior: Yeah, yeah.\n\nWalt: Okay, good. He's, he's a good kid, he's like you, he'll understand. I'm sending Louis a package. Now, it's addressed to Louis, but it's for you, your mother, and your sister. There's money inside. About $100,000, okay? I think. It's all that I could fit in the box. It has to be a secret. If anyone says a word, the police will take it. I wanted to give you so much more, but this is all I could do, do you understand? Son? Can you hear me? Do you understand?\n\nJunior: You want to send money.\n\nWalt: Yes. Good. Good, good. So you'll talk to Louis, right?\n\nJunior: You killed Uncle Hank! You killed him!\n\nWalt: Wait, no. Wait, son, please.\n\nJunior: What you did to Mom, you asshole.\n\nWalt: Listen to me, you've got to listen to me.\n\nJunior: Just shut up. Just stop it, stop it. I don't want anything from you. I don't give a shit.\n\nWalt: You need this money, your mother. Your mother needs this money.\n\nJunior: You killed Uncle Hank. You killed him.\n\nWalt: It can't all be for nothing! Please. Please.\n\nJunior: No, no, what you did. Shut up. Shut up. Will you just, just leave us alone. You asshole! Why are you still alive? Why don't you just, just die already, just die.\n\n*Junior hangs up the phone. Walt calls the DEA*\n\nAgent on phone: DEA, Albuquerque district office, how may I direct your call?\n\nWalt: I'd like to speak to the agent in charge of the Walter White investigation.\n\nAgent on phone: Who may I say is calling?\n\nWalt: Walter White.\n\n*Walt drops the phone and walks over to the bar*\n\nAgent on phone: Hello? Hello? Sir? Sir, are you still there?\n\nBartender: You ready for that drink now?\n\nWalt: Dimple Pinch. Neat.\n\nBartender: You got it.\n\n*Bartender pours him a glass of whiskey. Walt takes a sip while the bartender changes the channel*\n\nWalt: Would you, would you, would you go back? Please.\n\n*Bartender changes channel*\n\nWalt: There.\n\nBartender: What, this?\n\nWalt: Yeah.\n\nGretchen Schwartz: *on TV* Exactly. We're thrilled with the way things turned out.\n\nCharlie Rose: *on TV* But just yesterday, your charity, the Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz foundation, announced a twenty-eight million dollar grant for drug abuse treatment centers throughout the southwest.\n\nElliott Schwartz: *on TV* Charlie, the southwest is our home and we couldn't just ignore what's going on in our own backyard.\n\nCharlie Rose: But I'm sure you're aware there are people who suggest other motives. Andrew R. Sorkin of The New York Times wrote a column suggesting that the grant was a kind of publicity maneuver to shore up the stock price of Gray Matter Technologies because of your association with Walter White.\n\nElliott Schwartz: Well, that's not exactly what I-\n\nCharlie Rose: To cleanse yourself, so to speak, of having a methamphetamine kingpin as co-founder of your company.\n\nElliott Schwartz: Charlie, I'm glad you brought that up. I have to believe that the investing public understands that we're talking about a person who was there early on, but who had virtually nothing to do with the creation of the company and still less to do with growing it into what it is today.\n\nCharlie Rose: So, what was Walter White's contribution?\n\nElliott Schwartz: You know, to be honest. Honey?\n\nGretchen Schwartz: The company name.\n\nElliott Schwartz: The company name. We came up with it by combining our names, Schwartz means black. Black plus white makes gray.\n\nCharlie Rose: Hence Gray Matter Technologies.\n\nElliott Schwartz: Exactly. As far as I can recall, his contribution begins and ends right there.\nCharlie Rose: There are continued reports of blue methamphetamine, considered his signature product, throughout the southwest, and some evidence of reaching as far as Europe. So, my question is, is Walter White still out there?\n\nGretchen Schwartz: No, he's not.\n\nCharlie Rose: You sound very sure.\n\nGretchen Schwartz: I am. I can't speak to this Heisenberg that people refer to, but whatever he became, the sweet, kind, brilliant man that we once knew long ago. He's gone.\nCharlie Rose: But to be absolutely clear-\n*Breaking Bad theme begins playing loudly as Walt stares forward. Police arrive at the bar and head inside. The bartender is standing in the corner, Walt's glass of whiskey is sitting on the table alone*18Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1065186", "artist_names": "Don

"lyrics": "The Marriage Plot LyricsTo start with, look at all the books. There were her Edith Wharton novels, arranged not by title but date of publication; there was the complete Modern Library set of Henry James, a gift from her father on her twenty-first birthday; there were the dog-eared paperbacks assigned in her college courses, a lot of Dickens, a smidgen of Trollope, along with good helpings of Austen, George Eliot, and the redoubtable Bront\u00eb sisters.\n\nThere were a whole lot of black-and-white New Directions paperbacks, mostly poetry by people like H.D. or Denise Levertov.There were the Colette novels she read on the sly.\n\nThere was the first edition of Couples, belonging to her mother, which Madeleine had surreptitiously dipped into back in sixth grade and which she was using now to provide textual support in her English honors thesis on the marriage plot.\n\nThere was, in short, this mid-size but still portable library representing pretty much everything Madeleine had read in college, a collection of texts, seemingly chosen at random, whose focus slowly narrowed, like a personality test, a sophisticated one you couldn\u2019t trick by anticipating the implications of its questions and finally got so lost in that your only recourse was to answer the simple truth.\n\nAnd then you waited for the result, hoping for \u201cArtistic,\u201d or \u201cPassionate,\u201d thinking you could live with \u201cSensitive,\u201d secretly fearing \u201cNarcissistic\u201d and \u201cDomestic,\u201d but finally being presented with an outcome that cut both ways and made you feel different depending on the day, the hour, or the guy you happened to be dating: \u201cIncurably Romantic.\u201d\n\nThese were the books in the room where Madeleine lay, with a pillow over her head, on the morning of her college graduation. She\u2019d read each and every one, often multiple times, frequently underlining passages, but that was no help to her now.\nMadeleine was trying to ignore the room and everything in it. She was hoping to drift back down into the oblivion where she\u2019d been safely couched for the last three hours.\n\nAny higher level of wakefulness would force her to come to grips with certain disagreeable facts: for instance, the amount and variety of the alcohol she\u2019d imbibed last night, and the fact that she\u2019d gone to sleep with her contacts in.\n\nThinking about such specifics would, in turn, call to mind the reasons she\u2019d drunk so much in the first place, which she definitely didn\u2019t want to do. And so Madeleine adjusted her pillow, blocking out the early morning light, and tried to fall back to sleep.\n\nBut it was useless. Because right then, at the other end of her apartment, the doorbell began to ring.\n\nEarly June, Providence, Rhode Island, the sun up for almost two hours already, lighting up the pale bay and the smokestacks of the Narragansett Electric factory, rising like the sun on the Brown University seal emblazoned on all the pennants and banners draped up over campus, a sun with a sagacious face, representing knowledge.\n\nBut this sun\u2014the one over Providence\u2014was doing the metaphorical sun one better, because the founders of the university, in their Baptist pessimism, had chosen to depict the light of knowledge enshrouded by clouds, indicating that ignorance had not yet been dispelled from the human realm, whereas the actual sun was just now fighting its way through cloud cover, sending down splintered beams of light and giving hope to the squadrons of parents, who\u2019d been soaked and frozen all weekend, that the unseasonable weather might not ruin the day\u2019s festivities.\n\nAll over College Hill, in the geometric gardens of the Georgian mansions, the magnolia-scented front yards of Victorians, along brick sidewalks running past black iron fences like those in a Charles Addams cartoon or a Lovecraft story; outside the art studios at the Rhode Island School of Design, where one painting major, having stayed up all night to work, was blaring Patti Smith; shining off the instruments (tuba and trumpet, respectively) of the two members of the Brown marching band who had arrived early at the meeting point and were nervously looking around, wondering where everyone else was; brightening the cobblestone side streets that led downhill to the polluted river, the sun was shining on every brass doorknob, insect wing, and blade of grass.\n\nAnd, in concert with the suddenly flooding light, like a starting gun for all the activity, the doorbell in Madeleine\u2019s fourth-floor apartment began, clamorously, insistently, to ring.\n\nThe pulse reached her less as a sound than as a sensation, an electric shock shooting up her spine. In one motion Madeleine tore the pillow off her head and sat up in bed. She knew who was ringing the buzzer.\n\nIt was her parents. She\u2019d agreed to meet Alton and Phyllida for breakfast at 7:30. She\u2019d made this plan with them two months ago, in April, and now here they were, at the appointed time, in their eager, dependable way.\n\nThat Alton and Phyllida had driven up from New Jersey to see her graduate, that what they were here to celebrate today wasn\u2019t only her achievement but their own as parents, had nothing wrong or unexpected about it.\n\nThe problem was that Madeleine, for the first time in her life, wanted no part of it. She wasn\u2019t proud of herself. She was in no mood to celebrate. She\u2019d lost faith in the significance of the day and what the day represented.\n\nShe considered not answering. But she knew that if she didn\u2019t answer, one of her roommates would, and then she\u2019d have to explain where she\u2019d disappeared to last night, and with whom. Therefore, Madeleine slid out of the bed and reluctantly stood up.\nThis seemed to go well for a moment, standing up. Her head felt curiously light, as if hollowed out. But then the blood, draining from her skull like sand from an hourglass, hit a bottleneck, and the back of her head exploded in pain.\n\nIn the midst of this barrage, like the furious core from which it emanated, the buzzer erupted again.\n\nShe came out of her bedroom and stumbled in bare feet to the intercom in the hall, slapping the SPEAK button to silence the buzzer.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Didn\u2019t you hear the bell?\u201d It was Alton\u2019s voice, as deep and commanding as ever, despite the fact that it was issuing from a tiny speaker.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI was in the shower.\u201d\n\n\u201cLikely story. Will you let us in, please?\u201d\n\nMadeleine didn\u2019t want to. She needed to wash up first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming down,\u201d she said.\n\nThis time, she held down the SPEAK button too long, cutting off Alton\u2019s response. She pressed it again and said, \u201cDaddy?\u201d but while she was speaking, Alton must have been speaking, too, because when she pressed LISTEN all that came through was static.\n\nMadeleine took this pause in communications to lean her forehead against the door frame. The wood felt nice and cool.\n\nThe thought struck her that, if she could keep her face pressed against the soothing wood, she might be able to cure her headache, and if she could keep her forehead pressed against the door frame for the rest of the day, while somehow still being able to leave the apartment, she might make it through breakfast with her parents, march in the commencement procession, get a diploma, and graduate.\n\nShe lifted her face and pressed speak again.\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d\n\nBut it was Phyllida\u2019s voice that answered. \u201cMaddy? What\u2019s the matter? Let us in.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy roommates are still asleep. I\u2019m coming down. Don\u2019t ring the bell anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to see your apartment!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot now. I\u2019m coming down. Don\u2019t ring.\u201d\n\nShe took her hand from the buttons and stood back, glaring at the intercom as if daring it to make a sound. When it didn\u2019t, she started back down the hall. She was halfway to the bathroom when her roommate Abby emerged, blocking the way.\n\nShe yawned, running a hand through her big hair, and then, noticing Madeleine, smiled knowingly.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Abby said, \u201cwhere did you sneak off to last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy parents are here,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI have to go to breakfast.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. Tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to tell. I\u2019m late.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come you\u2019re wearing the same clothes, then?\u201d\n\nInstead of replying, Madeleine looked down at herself. Ten hours earlier, when she\u2019d borrowed the black Betsey Johnson dress from Olivia, Madeleine had thought it looked good on her. But now the dress felt hot and sticky, the fat leather belt looked like an S&M restraint, and there was a stain near the hem that she didn\u2019t want to identify.\n\nAbby, meanwhile, had knocked on Olivia\u2019s door and entered. \u201cSo much for Maddy\u2019s broken heart,\u201d she said. \u201cWake up! You\u2019ve got to see this.\u201d\n\nThe path to the bathroom was clear. Madeleine\u2019s need for a shower was extreme, almost medical. At a minimum, she had to brush her teeth.\n\nBut Olivia\u2019s voice was audible now. Soon Madeleine would have two roommates interrogating her. Her parents were liable to start ringing again any minute. As quietly as possible, she inched back down the hall.\n\nShe stepped into a pair of loafers left by the front door, crushing the heels flat as she caught her balance, and escaped into the outer corridor.\n\nThe elevator was waiting at the end of the floral runner. Waiting, Madeleine realized, because she\u2019d failed to close the sliding gate when she\u2019d staggered out of the thing a few hours earlier.\n\nNow she shut the gate securely and pressed the button for the lobby, and with a jolt the antique contraption began to descend through the building\u2019s interior gloom.\n\nMadeleine\u2019s building, a Neo-Romanesque castle called the Narragansett that wrapped around the plunging corner of Benefit Street and Church Street, had been built at the turn of the century.\n\nAmong its surviving period details\u2014the stained-glass skylight, the brass wall sconces, the marble lobby\u2014was the elevator. Made of curving metal bars like a giant birdcage, the elevator miraculously still functioned, but it moved slowly, and as the car dropped, Madeleine took the opportunity to make herself more presentable.\n\nShe ran her hands through her hair, finger-combing it. She polished her front teeth with her index finger. She rubbed mascara crumbs from her eyes and moistened her lips with her tongue. Finally, passing the balustrade on the second floor, she checked her reflection in the small mirror attached to the rear panel.\n\nOne of the nice things about being twenty-two, or about being Madeleine Hanna, was that three weeks of romantic anguish, followed by a night of epic drinking, didn\u2019t do much visible damage. Except for puffiness around her eyes, Madeleine looked like the same pretty, dark-haired person as usual.\n\nThe symmetries of her face\u2014the straight nose, the Katharine Hepburn\u2013ish cheekbones and jawline\u2014were almost mathematical in their precision. Only the slight furrow in her brow gave evidence of the slightly anxious person that Madeleine felt herself, intrinsically, to be.\n\nShe could see her parents waiting below. They were trapped between the lobby door and the door to the street, Alton in a seersucker jacket,\n\nPhyllida in a navy suit and matching gold-buckled purse. For a second, Madeleine had an impulse to stop the elevator and leave her parents stuck in the foyer amid all the college-town clutter\u2014the posters for New Wave bands with names like Wretched Misery or the Clits, the pornographic Egon Schiele drawings by the RISD kid on the second floor, all the clamorous Xeroxes whose subtext conveyed the message that the wholesome, patriotic values of her parents\u2019 generation were now on the ash heap of history, replaced by a nihilistic, post-punk sensibility that Madeleine herself didn\u2019t understand but was perfectly happy to scandalize her parents by pretending that she did\u2014before the elevator stopped in the lobby and she slid open the gate and stepped out to meet them.\n\nAlton was first through the door. \u201cHere she is!\u201d he said avidly. \u201cThe college graduate!\u201d In his net-charging way, he surged forward to seize her in a hug. Madeleine stiffened, worried that she smelled of alcohol or, worse, of sex.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you wouldn\u2019t let us see your apartment,\u201d Phyllida said, coming up next. \u201cI was looking forward to meeting Abby and Olivia. We\u2019d love to treat them to dinner later.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not staying for dinner,\u201d Alton reminded her.\n\n\u201cWell, we might. That depends on Maddy\u2019s schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not the plan. The plan is to see Maddy for breakfast and then leave after the ceremony.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father and his plans,\u201d Phyllida said to Madeleine. \u201cAre you wearing that dress to the ceremony?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get used to these shoulder pads all the young women are wearing. They\u2019re so mannish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Olivia\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look pretty whacked out, Mad,\u201d Alton said. \u201cBig party last night?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot really.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have anything of your own to wear?\u201d Phyllida said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have my robe on, Mummy,\u201d Madeleine said, and, to forestall further inspection, headed past them through the foyer.\n\nOutside, the sun had lost its battle with the clouds and vanished. The weather looked not much better than it had all weekend. Campus Dance, on Friday night, had been more or less rained out. The Baccalaureate service on Sunday had proceeded under a steady drizzle.\n\nNow, on Monday, the rain had stopped, but the temperature felt closer to St. Patrick\u2019s than to Memorial Day.\n\nAs she waited for her parents to join her on the sidewalk, it occurred to Madeleine that she hadn\u2019t had sex, not really. This was some consolation.\n\n\u201cYour sister sends her regrets,\u201d Phyllida said, coming out.\n\n\u201cShe has to take Richard the Lionhearted for an ultrasound today.\u201d\n\nRichard the Lionhearted was Madeleine\u2019s nine-week-old nephew. Everyone else called him Richard.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cOne of his kidneys is petite, apparently. The doctors want to keep an eye on it. If you ask me, all these ultrasounds do is find things to worry about.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of ultrasounds,\u201d Alton said, \u201cI need to get one on my knee.\u201d\n\nPhyllida paid no attention. \u201cAnyway, Allie\u2019s devastated not to see you graduate. As is Blake. But they\u2019re hoping you and your new beau might visit them this summer, on your way to the Cape.\u201d\n\nYou had to stay alert around Phyllida. Here she was, ostensibly talking about Richard the Lionhearted\u2019s petite kidney, and already she\u2019d managed to move the subject to Madeleine\u2019s new boyfriend, Leonard (whom Phyllida and Alton hadn\u2019t met), and to Cape Cod (where Madeleine had announced plans to cohabitate with him). On a normal day, when her brain was working, Madeleine would have been able to keep one step ahead of Phyllida, but this morning the best she could manage was to let the words float past her.\n\nFortunately, Alton changed the subject. \u201cSo, where do you recommend for breakfast?\u201d\n\nMadeleine turned and looked vaguely down Benefit Street. \u201cThere\u2019s a place this way.\u201d\n\nShe started shuffling along the sidewalk. Walking\u2014moving\u2014seemed like a good idea. She led them past a line of quaint, nicely maintained houses bearing historical placards, and a big apartment building with a gable roof. Providence was a corrupt town, crime-ridden and mob-controlled, but up on College Hill this was hard to see.\n\nThe sketchy downtown and dying or dead textile mills lay below, in the grim distance. Here the narrow streets, many of them cobblestone, climbed past mansions or snaked around Puritan graveyards full of headstones as narrow as heaven\u2019s door, streets with names like Prospect, Benevolent, Hope, and Meeting, all of them feeding into the arboreous campus at the top.\n\nThe sheer physical elevation suggested an intellectual one.\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t these slate sidewalks lovely,\u201d Phyllida said as she followed along.\n\n\u201cWe used to have slate sidewalks on our street.\n\nThey\u2019re much more attractive. But then the borough replaced them with concrete.\u201d\n\n\u201cAssessed us for the bill, too,\u201d\n\nAlton said. He was limping slightly, bringing up the rear. The right leg of his charcoal trousers was swelled from the knee brace he wore on and off the tennis court. Alton had been club champion in his age group for twelve years running, one of those older guys with a sweatband ringing a balding crown, a choppy forehand, and absolute murder in his eyes.\n\nMadeleine had been trying to beat Alton her entire life without success. This was even more infuriating because she was better than he was, at this point. But whenever she took a set from Alton he started intimidating her, acting mean, disputing calls, and her game fell apart.\n\nMadeleine was worried that there was something paradigmatic in this, that she was destined to go through life being cowed by less capable men.\n\nAs a result, Madeleine\u2019s tennis matches against Alton had assumed such outsize personal significance for her that she got tight whenever she played him, with predictable results.\n\nAnd Alton still gloated when he won, still got all rosy and jiggly, as if he\u2019d bested her by sheer talent.\n\nAt the corner of Benefit and Waterman, they crossed behind the white steeple of First Baptist Church. In preparation for the ceremony, loudspeakers had been set up on the lawn.\n\nA man wearing a bow tie, a dean-of-students-looking person, was tensely smoking a cigarette and inspecting a raft of balloons tied to the churchyard fence.\n\nBy now Phyllida had caught up to Madeleine, taking her arm to negotiate the uneven slate, which was pushed up by the roots of gnarled plane trees that lined the curb. As a little girl, Madeleine had thought her mother pretty, but that was a long time ago. Phyllida\u2019s face had gotten heavier over the years; her cheeks were beginning to sag like those of a camel. The conservative clothes she wore\u2014the clothes of a philanthropist or lady ambassador\u2014had a tendency to conceal her figure. Phyllida\u2019s hair was where her power resided. It was expensively set into a smooth dome, like a band shell for the presentation of that long-running act, her face. For as long as Madeleine could remember, Phyllida had never been at a loss for words or shy about a point of etiquette. Among her friends Madeleine liked to make fun of her mother\u2019s formality, but she often found herself comparing other people\u2019s manners unfavorably with Phyllida\u2019s.\n\nAnd right now Phyllida was looking at Madeleine with the proper expression for this moment: thrilled by the pomp and ceremony, eager to put intelligent questions to any of Madeleine\u2019s professors she happened to meet, or to trade pleasantries with fellow parents of graduating seniors.\n\nIn short, she was available to everyone and everything and in step with the social and academic pageantry, all of which exacerbated Madeleine\u2019s feeling of being out of step, for this day and the rest of her life.\n\nShe plunged on, however, across Waterman Street, and up the steps of Carr House, seeking refuge and coffee.\n\nThe caf\u00e9 had just opened. The guy behind the counter, who was wearing Elvis Costello glasses, was rinsing out the espresso machine.\n\nAt a table against the wall, a girl with stiff pink hair was smoking a clove cigarette and reading Invisible Cities. \u201cTainted Love\u201d played from the stereo on top of the refrigerator.\n\nPhyllida, holding her handbag protectively against her chest, had paused to peruse the student art on the walls: six paintings of small, skin-diseased dogs wearing bleach-bottle collars.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this fun?\u201d she said tolerantly.\n\n\u201cLa Boh\u00e8me,\u201d Alton said.\n\nMadeleine installed her parents at a table near the bay window, as far away from the pink-haired girl as possible, and went up to the counter. The guy took his time coming over. She ordered three coffees\u2014a large for her\u2014and bagels. While the bagels were being toasted, she brought the coffees over to her parents.\n\nAlton, who couldn\u2019t sit at the breakfast table without reading, had taken a discarded Village Voice from a nearby table and was perusing it. Phyllida was staring overtly at the girl with pink hair.\n\n\u201cDo you think that\u2019s comfortable?\u201d she inquired in a low voice.\n\nMadeleine turned to see that the girl\u2019s ragged black jeans were held together by a few hundred safety pins.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, Mummy. Why don\u2019t you go ask her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of getting poked.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to this article,\u201d Alton said, reading the Voice, \u201chomosexuality didn\u2019t exist until the nineteenth century. It was invented. In Germany.\u201d\n\nThe coffee was hot, and lifesavingly good. Sipping it, Madeleine began to feel slightly less awful.\n\nAfter a few minutes, she went up to get the bagels.\n\nThey were a little burned, but she didn\u2019t want to wait for new ones, and so brought them back to the table. After examining his with a sour expression, Alton began scraping it punitively with a plastic knife.\n\nPhyllida asked, \u201cSo, are we going to meet Leonard today?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cAnything you want us to know about?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you two still planning to live together this summer?\u201d\n\nBy this time Madeleine had taken a bite of her bagel. And since the answer to her mother\u2019s question was complicated\u2014strictly speaking, Madeleine and Leonard weren\u2019t planning on living together, because they\u2019d broken up three weeks ago; despite this fact, however, Madeleine hadn\u2019t given up hope of a reconciliation, and seeing as she\u2019d spent so much effort getting her parents used to the idea of her living with a guy, and didn\u2019t want to jeopardize that by admitting that the plan was off\u2014she was relieved to be able to point at her full mouth, which prevented her from replying.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re an adult now,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cYou can do what you like. Though, for the record, I have to say that I don\u2019t approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve already gone on record about that,\u201d Alton broke in.\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s still a bad idea!\u201d Phyllida cried. \u201cI don\u2019t mean the propriety of it. I\u2019m talking about the practical problems.\n\nIf you move in with Leonard\u2014or any young man\u2014and he\u2019s the one with the job, then you begin at a disadvantage.\n\nWhat happens if you two don\u2019t get along? Where are you then? You won\u2019t have any place to live. Or anything to do.\u201d\n\nThat her mother was correct in her analysis, that the predicament Phyllida warned Madeleine about was exactly the predicament she was already in, didn\u2019t motivate Madeleine to register agreement.\n\n\u201cYou quit your job when you met me,\u201d Alton said to Phyllida.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we change the subject?\u201d Madeleine said at last, having swallowed her food.\n\n\u201cOf course we can, sweetheart. That\u2019s the last I\u2019ll say about it. If your plans change, you can always come home. Your father and I would love to have you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me,\u201d Alton said. \u201cI don\u2019t want her. Moving back home is always a bad idea. Stay away.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe choice is yours,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cBut if you do come home, you could have the loft. That way you can come and go as you like.\u201d\n\nTo her surprise, Madeleine found herself contemplating this proposal.\n\nWhy not tell her parents everything, curl up in the backseat of the car, and let them take her home? She could move into her old bedroom, with the sleigh bed and the Madeline wallpaper.\n\nShe could become a spinster, like Emily Dickinson, writing poems full of dashes and brilliance, and never gaining weight.\n\nPhyllida brought her out of this reverie.\n\n\u201cMaddy?\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that your friend Mitchell?\u201d\n\nMadeleine wheeled in her seat. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s Mitchell. Across the street.\u201d\n\nIn the churchyard, sitting Indian-style in the freshly mown grass, Madeleine\u2019s \u201cfriend\u201d Mitchell Grammaticus was indeed there. His lips were moving, as if he was talking to himself.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you invite him to join us?\u201d Phyllida said.\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not? I\u2019d love to see Mitchell.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s probably waiting for his parents,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nPhyllida waved, despite the fact that Mitchell was too far away to notice.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing sitting on the ground?\u201d Alton asked.\n\nThe three Hannas stared across the street at Mitchell in his half-lotus.\n\n\u201cWell, if you\u2019re not going to ask him, I will,\u201d Phyllida finally said.\n\n\u201cO.K.,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll go ask him.\u201d\n\nThe day was getting warmer, but not by much. Black clouds were massing in the distance as Madeleine came down the steps of Carr House and crossed the street into the churchyard.\n\nSomeone inside the church was testing the loudspeakers, fussily repeating, \u201cSussex, Essex, and Kent. Sussex, Essex, and Kent.\u201d A banner draped over the church entrance read \u201cClass of 1982.\u201d Beneath the banner, in the grass, was Mitchell.\n\nHis lips were still moving silently, but when he noticed Madeleine approaching they abruptly stopped.\n\nMadeleine remained a few feet away.\n\n\u201cMy parents are here,\u201d she informed him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s graduation,\u201d Mitchell replied evenly. \u201cEveryone\u2019s parents are here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to say hello to you.\u201d\n\nAt this Mitchell smiled faintly. \u201cThey probably don\u2019t realize you\u2019re not speaking to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, they don\u2019t,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cAnd, anyway, I am. Now. Speaking to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder duress or as a change of policy?\u201d\n\nMadeleine shifted her weight, wrinkling her face unhappily. \u201cLook. I\u2019m really hungover. I barely slept last night. My parents have been here about ten minutes and they\u2019re already driving me crazy. So if you could just come over and say hello, that would be great.\u201d\n\nMitchell\u2019s large emotional eyes blinked twice. He was wearing a vintage gabardine shirt, dark wool pants, and beat-up wingtips. Madeleine had never seen him in shorts or tennis shoes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cAbout what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d Madeleine said, looking away. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just being my usual vile self.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo was I.\u201d\n\nThey were quiet a moment. Madeleine felt Mitchell\u2019s eyes on her, and she crossed her arms over her chest.\n\nWhat had happened was this: one night the previous December, in a state of anxiety about her romantic life, Madeleine had run into Mitchell on campus and brought him back to her apartment.\n\nShe\u2019d needed male attention and had flirted with him, without entirely admitting it to herself. In her bedroom, Mitchell had picked up a jar of deep-heating gel on her desk, asking what it was for.\n\nMadeleine had explained that people who were athletic sometimes got sore muscles. She understood that Mitchell might not have experienced this phenomenon, seeing as all he did was sit in the library, but he should take her word for it.\n\nAt that point, Mitchell had come up behind her and wiped a gob of heating gel behind her ear. Madeleine jumped up, shouting at Mitchell, and wiped the gunk off with a T-shirt. Though she was within her rights to be angry,\n\nMadeleine also knew (even at the time) that she was using the incident as a pretext for getting Mitchell out of her bedroom and for covering up the fact that she\u2019d been flirting with him in the first place.\n\nThe worst part of the incident was how stricken Mitchell had looked, as if he\u2019d been about to cry. He kept saying he was sorry, he was just joking around, but she ordered him to leave.\n\nIn the following days, replaying the incident in her mind, Madeleine had felt worse and worse about it. She\u2019d been on the verge of calling Mitchell to apologize when she\u2019d received a letter from him, a highly detailed, cogently argued, psychologically astute, quietly hostile four-page letter, in which he called her a \u201ccocktease\u201d and claimed that her behavior that night had been \u201cthe erotic equivalent of bread and circus, with just the circus.\u201d\n\nThe next time they\u2019d run into each other, Madeleine had acted as if she didn\u2019t know him, and they hadn\u2019t spoken since.\n\nNow, in the churchyard of First Baptist, Mitchell looked up at her and said, \u201cO.K. Let\u2019s go say hello to your parents.\u201d\n\nPhyllida was waving as they came up the steps. In the flirtatious voice she reserved for her favorite of Madeleine\u2019s friends, she called out, \u201cI thought that was you on the ground. You looked like a swami!\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Mitchell!\u201d Alton said, heartily shaking Mitchell\u2019s hand. \u201cBig day today. One of the milestones. A new generation takes the reins.\u201d\n\nThey invited Mitchell to sit down and asked him if he wanted anything to eat. Madeleine went back to the counter to get more coffee, glad to have Mitchell keeping her parents occupied. As she watched him, in his old man\u2019s clothes, engaging Alton and Phyllida in conversation, Madeleine thought to herself, as she\u2019d thought many times before, that Mitchell was the kind of smart, sane, parent-pleasing boy she should fall in love with and marry. That she would never fall in love with Mitchell and marry him, precisely because of this eligibility, was yet another indication, in a morning teeming with them, of just how screwed up she was in matters of the heart.\n\nWhen she returned to the table, no one acknowledged her.\n\n\u201cSo, Mitchell,\u201d Phyllida was asking, \u201cwhat are your plans after graduation?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father\u2019s been asking me the same question,\u201d Mitchell answered. \u201cFor some reason he thinks Religious Studies isn\u2019t a marketable degree.\u201d\n\nMadeleine smiled for the first time all day. \u201cSee? Mitchell doesn\u2019t have a job lined up, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I sort of do,\u201d Mitchell said.\n\n\u201cYou do not,\u201d Madeleine challenged him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m serious. I do.\u201d He explained that he and his roommate, Larry Pleshette, had come up with a plan to fight the recession. As liberal-arts degree holders matriculating into the job market at a time when unemployment was at 9.5 percent, they had decided, after much consideration, to leave the country and stay away as long as possible.\n\nAt the end of the summer, after they\u2019d saved up enough money, they were going to backpack through Europe. After they\u2019d seen everything in Europe there was to see, they were going to fly to India and stay there as long as their money held out. The whole trip would take eight or nine months, maybe as long as a year.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to India?\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be research assistants,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cFor Prof. Hughes.\u201d\n\n\u201cProf. Hughes in the theater department?\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw a program about India recently,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cIt was terribly depressing. The poverty!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a plus for me, Mrs. Hanna,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cI thrive in squalor.\u201d\n\nPhyllida, who couldn\u2019t resist this sort of mischief, gave up her solemnity, rippling with amusement. \u201cThen you\u2019re going to the right place!\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll take a trip, too,\u201d Madeleine said in a threatening tone.\n\nNo one reacted. Instead Alton asked Mitchell, \u201cWhat sort of immunizations do you need for India?\u201d\n\n\u201cCholera and typhus. Gamma globulin\u2019s optional.\u201d\n\nPhyllida shook her head. \u201cYour mother must be worried sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in the service,\u201d Alton said, \u201cthey shot us up with a million things. Didn\u2019t even tell us what the shots were for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll move to Paris,\u201d Madeleine said in a louder voice. \u201cInstead of getting a job.\u201d\n\n\u201cMitchell,\u201d Phyllida continued, \u201cwith your interest in religious studies, I\u2019d think India would be a perfect fit. They\u2019ve got everything. Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Zoroastrians, Jains, Buddhists.\n\nIt\u2019s like Baskin and Robbins! I\u2019ve always been fascinated by religion. Unlike my doubting-Thomas husband.\u201d\n\nAlton winked. \u201cI doubt that doubting Thomas existed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know Paul Moore, Bishop Moore, at the Cathedral of Saint John the Divine?\u201d\n\nPhyllida said, keeping Mitchell\u2019s attention.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great friend. You might find it interesting to meet him. We\u2019d be happy to introduce you. When we\u2019re in the city, I always go to services at the cathedral. Have you ever been there? Oh. Well. How can I describe it? It\u2019s simply\u2014well, simply divine!\u201d\n\nPhyllida held a hand to her throat with the pleasure of this bon mot, while Mitchell obligingly, even convincingly, laughed.\n\n\u201cSpeaking of religious dignitaries,\u201d\n\nAlton cut in, \u201cdid I ever tell you about the time we met the Dalai Lama?\n\nIt was at this fund-raiser at the Waldorf. We were in the receiving line. Must have been three hundred people at least. Anyway, when we finally got up to the Dalai Lama, I asked him,\n\n\u2018Are you any relation to Dolly Parton?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI was mortified!\u201d Phyllida cried. \u201cAbsolutely mortified.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaddy,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be late.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should get going if you want to get a good spot.\u201d\n\nAlton looked at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt gets really crowded,\u201d Madeleine emphasized. \u201cYou should go now.\u201d\n\nAlton and Phyllida looked at Mitchell, as if they trusted him to advise them. Under the table, Madeleine kicked him, and he alertly responded, \u201cIt does get pretty crowded.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the best place to stand?\u201d Alton asked, again addressing Mitchell.\n\n\u201cBy the Van Wickle Gates. At the top of College Street. That\u2019s where we\u2019ll come through.\u201d\n\nAlton stood up from the table. After shaking Mitchell\u2019s hand, he bent to kiss Madeleine on the cheek.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see you later. Miss Baccalaureate, 1982.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Mitchell,\u201d Phyllida said. \u201cSo nice to see you.\n\nAnd remember, when you\u2019re on your Grand Tour, be sure to send your mother loads of letters. Otherwise, she\u2019ll be frantic.\u201d\n\nTo Madeleine, she said, \u201cYou might change that dress before the march. It has a visible stain.\u201d\n\nWith that, Alton and Phyllida, in their glaring parental actuality, all seersucker and handbag, cuff links and pearls, crossed the beige-and-brick space of Carr House and went out the door.\n\nAs though to signal their departure, a new song came on: Joe Jackson\u2019s high-pitched voice swooping above a synthesized drumbeat. The guy behind the counter cranked up the volume.\n\nMadeleine laid her head on the table, her hair covering her face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never drinking again,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFamous last words.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have no idea what\u2019s been going on with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I? You haven\u2019t been speaking to me.\u201d\n\nWithout lifting her cheek from the table, Madeleine said in a pitiful voice, \u201cI\u2019m homeless. I\u2019m graduating from college and I\u2019m a homeless person.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am!\u201d Madeleine insisted. \u201cFirst I was supposed to move to New York with Abby and Olivia. Then it looked like I was moving to the Cape, though, so I told them to get another roommate. And now I\u2019m not moving to the Cape and I have nowhere to go. My mother wants me to move back home but I\u2019d rather kill myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m moving back home for the summer,\u201d\n\nMitchell said. \u201cTo Detroit. At least you\u2019re near New York.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t heard back from grad school yet and it\u2019s June,\u201d Madeleine continued.\n\n\u201cI was supposed to find out over a month ago! I could call the admissions department, but I don\u2019t because I\u2019m scared to find out that I\u2019ve been rejected. As long as I don\u2019t know, I still have hope.\u201d\n\nThere was a moment before Mitchell spoke again. \u201cYou can come to India with me,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine opened one eye to see, through a whorl in her hair, that Mitchell wasn\u2019t entirely joking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even about grad school,\u201d she said. Taking a deep breath, she confessed, \u201cLeonard and I broke up.\u201d\n\nIt felt deeply pleasurable to say this, to name her sadness, and so Madeleine was surprised by the coldness of Mitchell\u2019s reply.\n\n\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201d he said.\n\nShe lifted her head, brushing her hair out of her face. \u201cI don\u2019t know. You wanted to know what was the matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, actually. I didn\u2019t even ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you might care,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cSince you\u2019re my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Mitchell said, his voice suddenly sarcastic.\n\n\u201cOur wonderful friendship! Our \u2018friendship\u2019 isn\u2019t a real friendship because it only works on your terms.\n\nYou set the rules, Madeleine. If you decide you don\u2019t want to talk to me for three months, we don\u2019t talk. Then you decide you do want to talk to me because you need me to entertain your parents\u2014and now we\u2019re talking again. We\u2019re friends when you want to be friends, and we\u2019re never more than friends because you don\u2019t want to be. And I have to go along with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Madeleine said, feeling put-upon and blindsided. \u201cI just don\u2019t like you that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Mitchell cried. \u201cYou\u2019re not attracted to me physically. O.K., fine. But who says I was ever attracted to you mentally?\u201d\n\nMadeleine reacted as if she\u2019d been slapped. She was outraged, hurt, and defiant all at once.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a\u201d\u2014she tried to think of the worst thing to say\u2014\u201cyou\u2019re such a jerk!\u201d\n\nShe was hoping to remain imperious, but her chest was stinging, and, to her dismay, she burst into tears.\n\nMitchell reached out to touch her arm, but Madeleine shook him off. Getting to her feet, trying not to look like someone angrily weeping, she went out the door and down the steps onto Waterman Street.\n\nConfronted by the festive churchyard, she turned downhill toward the river. She wanted to get away from campus. Her headache had returned, her temples were throbbing, and as she looked up at the storm clouds massing over downtown like more bad things to come, she asked herself why everyone was being so mean to her.\n\n\n\nMadeleine\u2019s love troubles had begun at a time when the French theory she was reading deconstructed the very notion of love. Semiotics 211 was an upper-level seminar taught by a former English department renegade.\n\nMichael Zipperstein had come to Brown thirty-two years earlier as a New Critic. He\u2019d inculcated the habits of close reading and biography-free interpretation into three generations of students before taking a Road to Damascus sabbatical, in Paris, in 1975, where he\u2019d met Roland Barthes at a dinner party and been converted, over cassoulet, to the new faith.\n\nNow Zipperstein taught two courses in the newly created Program in Semiotics Studies: Introduction to Semiotic Theory in the fall and, in the spring, Semiotics 211. Hygienically bald, with a seaman\u2019s mustacheless white beard, Zipperstein favored French fisherman\u2019s sweaters and wide-wale corduroys. He buried people with his reading lists: in addition to all the semiotic big hitters\u2014Derrida, Eco, Barthes\u2014the students in Semiotics 211 had to contend with a magpie nest of reserve reading that included everything from Balzac\u2019s Sarrasine to issues of Semiotext(e) to photocopied selections from E. M. Cioran, Robert Walser, Claude Levi-Strauss, Peter Handke, and Carl Van Vechten.\n\nTo get into the seminar, you had to submit to a one-on-one interview with Zipperstein during which he asked bland personal questions, such as what your favorite food or dog breed was, and made enigmatic Warholian remarks in response. This esoteric probing, along with Zipperstein\u2019s guru\u2019s dome and beard, gave his students a sense that they\u2019d been spiritually vetted and were now\u2014for two hours on Thursday afternoons, at least\u2014part of a campus lit-crit elite.\n\nWhich was exactly what Madeleine wanted. She\u2019d become an English major for the purest and dullest of reasons: because she loved to read.\n\nThe university\u2019s \u201cBritish and American Literature Course Catalog\u201d was, for Madeleine, what its Bergdorf equivalent was for her roommates.\n\nA course listing like \u201cEnglish 274: Lyly\u2019s Euphues\u201d excited Madeleine the way a pair of Fiorucci cowboy boots did Abby. \u201cEnglish 450A:\n\nHawthorne and James\u201d filled Madeleine with an expectation of sinful hours in bed not unlike what Olivia got from wearing a Lycra skirt and leather blazer to Danceteria. Even as a girl in their house in Prettybrook, Madeleine wandered into the library, with its shelves of books rising higher than she could reach\u2014newly purchased volumes such as Love Story or Myra Breckinridgethat exuded a faintly forbidden air, as well as venerable leather-bound editions of Fielding,\n\nThackeray, and Dickens\u2014and the magisterial presence of all those potentially readable words stopped her in her tracks. She could scan book spines for as long as an hour. Her cataloging of the family\u2019s holdings rivaled the Dewey decimal system in its comprehensiveness.\n\nMadeleine knew right where everything was. The shelves near the fireplace held Alton\u2019s favorites, biographies of American presidents and British prime ministers, memoirs by warmongering secretaries of state, novels about sailing or espionage by William F. Buckley, Jr. Phyllida\u2019s books filled the left side of the bookcases leading up to the parlor, NYRB-reviewed novels and essay collections, as well as coffee-table volumes about English gardens or chinoiserie.\n\nEven now, at bed-and-breakfasts or seaside hotels, a shelf full of forlorn books always cried out to Madeleine. She ran her fingers over their salt-spotted covers. She peeled apart pages made tacky by ocean air. She had no sympathy for paperback thrillers and detective stories.\n\nIt was the abandoned hardback, the jacketless 1931 Dial Press edition ringed with many a coffee cup, that pierced Madeleine\u2019s heart. Her friends might be calling her name on the beach, the clambake already under way, but Madeleine would sit down on the bed and read for a little while to make the sad old book feel better. She had read Longfellow\u2019s \u201cHiawatha\u201d that way. She\u2019d read James Fenimore Cooper. She\u2019d read H. M. Pulham, Esquire by John P. Marquand.\n\nAnd yet sometimes she worried about what those musty old books were doing to her. Some people majored in English to prepare for law school. Others became journalists. The smartest guy in the honors program, Adam Vogel, a child of academics, was planning on getting a Ph.D. and becoming an academic himself.\n\nThat left a large contingent of people majoring in English by default. Because they weren\u2019t left-brained enough for science, because history was too dry, philosophy too difficult, geology too petroleum-oriented, and math too mathematical\u2014because they weren\u2019t musical, artistic, financially motivated, or really all that smart, these people were pursuing university degrees doing something no different from what they\u2019d done in first grade: reading stories.\n\nEnglish was what people who didn\u2019t know what to major in majored in.\n\nHer junior year, Madeleine had taken an honors seminar called The Marriage Plot: Selected Novels of Austen, Eliot, and James.\n\nThe class was taught by K. McCall Saunders. Saunders was a seventy-nine-year-old New Englander. He had a long, horsey face and a moist laugh that exposed his gaudy dental work. His pedagogical method consisted of his reading aloud lectures he\u2019d written twenty or thirty years earlier.\n\nMadeleine stayed in the class because she felt sorry for Professor Saunders and because the reading list was so good. In Saunders\u2019s opinion, the novel had reached its apogee with the marriage plot and had never recovered from its disappearance. In the days when success in life had depended on marriage, and marriage had depended on money, novelists had had a subject to write about. The great epics sang of war, the novel of marriage.\n\nSexual equality, good for women, had been bad for the novel. And divorce had undone it completely.\n\nWhat would it matter whom Emma married if she could file for separation later?\n\nHow would Isabel Archer\u2019s marriage to Gilbert Osmond have been affected by the existence of a prenup?\n\nAs far as Saunders was concerned, marriage didn\u2019t mean much anymore, and neither did the novel. Where could you find the marriage plot nowadays? You couldn\u2019t. You had to read historical fiction. You had to read non-Western novels involving traditional societies. Afghani novels, Indian novels. You had to go, literarily speaking, back in time.\n\nMadeleine\u2019s final paper for the seminar was titled \u201cThe Interrogative Mood: Marriage Proposals and the (Strictly Limited) Sphere of the Feminine.\u201d\n\nIt had impressed Saunders so much that he\u2019d asked Madeleine to come see him. In his office, which had a grandparental smell, he expressed his opinion that Madeleine might expand her paper into a senior honors thesis, along with his willingness to serve as her advisor.\n\nMadeleine smiled politely. Professor Saunders specialized in the periods she was interested in, the Regency leading into the Victorian era. He was sweet, and learned, and it was clear from his unsubscribed office hours that no one else wanted him as an advisor, and so Madeleine had said yes, she would love to work with him on her senior thesis.\n\nShe used a line from Trollope\u2019s Barchester Towers as an epigraph:\n\n\u201cThere is no happiness in love, except at the end of an English novel.\u201d\n\nHer plan was to begin with Jane Austen. After a brief examination of Pride and Prejudice, Persuasion, and Sense and Sensibility, all comedies, essentially, that ended with weddings, Madeleine was going to move on to the Victorian novel, where things got more complicated and considerably darker. Middlemarch and The Portrait of a Lady didn\u2019t end with weddings.\n\nThey began with the traditional moves of the marriage plot\u2014the suitors, the proposals, the misunderstandings\u2014but after the wedding ceremony they kept on going. These novels followed their spirited, intelligent heroines, Dorothea Brooke and Isabel Archer, into their disappointing married lives, and it was here that the marriage plot reached its greatest artistic expression.\n\nBy 1900 the marriage plot was no more. Madeleine planned to end with a brief discussion of its demise.\n\nIn Sister Carrie, Dreiser had Carrie live adulterously with Drouet, marry Hurstwood in an invalid ceremony, and then run off to become an actress\u2014and this was only in 1900! For a conclusion, Madeleine thought she might cite the wife-swapping in Updike.\n\nThat was the last vestige of the marriage plot: the persistence in calling it \u201cwife-swapping\u201d instead of \u201chusband-swapping.\u201d As if the woman were still a piece of property to be passed around.\n\nProfessor Saunders suggested that Madeleine look at historical sources. She\u2019d obediently boned up on the rise of industrialism and the nuclear family, the formation of the middle class, and the Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857. But it wasn\u2019t long before she\u2019d become bored with the thesis. Doubts about the originality of her work nagged at her.\n\nShe felt as if she was regurgitating the arguments Saunders had made in his marriage plot seminar. Her meetings with the old professor were dispiriting, consisting of Saunders shuffling the pages she\u2019d given him, pointing out various red marks he\u2019d made in the margins.\n\nThen one Sunday morning, before winter break, Abby\u2019s boyfriend, Whitney, materialized at their kitchen table, reading something called Of Grammatology.\n\nWhen Madeleine asked what the book was about, she was given to understand by Whitney that the idea of a book being \u201cabout\u201d something was exactly what this book was against, and that, if it was \u201cabout\u201d anything, then it was about the need to stop thinking of books as being about things.\n\nMadeleine said she was going to make coffee. Whitney asked if she would make him some, too.\n\nCollege wasn\u2019t like the real world. In the real world people dropped names based on their renown.\n\nIn college, people dropped names based on their obscurity. Thus, in the weeks after this exchange with Whitney, Madeleine began hearing people saying \u201cDerrida.\u201d She heard them saying \u201cLyotard\u201d and \u201cFoucault\u201d and \u201cDeleuze\u201d and \u201cBaudrillard.\u201d\n\nThat most of these people were those she instinctually disapproved of\u2014upper-middle-class kids who wore Doc Martens and anarchist symbols\u2014made Madeleine dubious about the value of their enthusiasm. But soon she noticed David Koppel, a smart and talented poet, also reading Derrida.\n\nAnd Pookie Ames, who read slush for The Paris Review and whom Madeleine liked, was taking a course with Professor Zipperstein.\n\nMadeleine had always been partial to grandiose professors, people like Sears Jayne who hammed it up in the classroom, reciting Hart Crane or\n\nAnne Sexton in a gag voice. Whitney acted as though Professor Jayne was a joke. Madeleine didn\u2019t agree. But after three solid years of taking literature courses, Madeleine had nothing like a firm critical methodology to apply to what she read.\n\nInstead she had a fuzzy, unsystematic way of talking about books. It embarrassed her to hear the things people said in class. And the things she said. I felt that. It was interesting the way Proust. I liked the way Faulkner.\n\nAnd when Olivia, who was tall and slim, with a long, aristocratic nose like a saluki, came in one day carrying Of Grammatology, Madeleine knew that what had been marginal was now mainstream.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that book like?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t read it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould I be asking if I had?\u201d\n\nOlivia sniffed. \u201cAren\u2019t we a little bitchy today?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust kidding. It\u2019s great. Derrida is my absolute god!\u201d\n\nAlmost overnight it became laughable to read writers like Cheever or Updike, who wrote about the suburbia Madeleine and most of her friends had grown up in, in favor of reading the Marquis de Sade, who wrote about anally deflowering virgins in eighteenth-century France.\n\nThe reason de Sade was preferable was that his shocking sex scenes weren\u2019t about sex but politics. They were therefore anti-imperialist, anti-bourgeois, anti-patriarchal, and anti-everything a smart young feminist should be against. Right up through her third year at college, Madeleine kept wholesomely taking courses like Victorian Fantasy: From Phantastes to The Water-Babies, but by senior year she could no longer ignore the contrast between the hard-up, blinky people in her Beowulf seminar and the hipsters down the hall reading Maurice Blanchot.\n\nGoing to college in the moneymaking eighties lacked a certain radicalism. Semiotics was the first thing that smacked of revolution. It drew a line; it created an elect; it was sophisticated and Continental; it dealt with provocative subjects, with torture, sadism, hermaphroditism\u2014with sex and power.\n\nMadeleine had always been popular at school. Years of being popular had left her with the reflexive ability to separate the cool from the uncool, even within subgroups, like the English department, where the concept of cool didn\u2019t appear to obtain.\n\nIf Restoration drama was getting you down, if scanning Wordsworth was making you feel dowdy and ink-stained, there was another option. You could flee K. McCall Saunders and the old New Criticism. You could defect to the new imperium of Derrida and Eco. You could sign up for Semiotics 211 and find out what everyone else was talking about.\n\n\n\nSemiotics 211 was limited to ten students. Of the ten, eight had taken Introduction to Semiotic Theory. This was visually apparent at the first class meeting.\n\nLounging around the seminar table, when Madeleine came into the room from the wintry weather outside, were eight people in black T-shirts and ripped black jeans. A few had razored off the necks or sleeves of their T-shirts. There was something creepy about one guy\u2019s face\u2014it was like a baby\u2019s face that had grown whiskers\u2014and it took Madeleine a full minute to realize that he\u2019d shaved off his eyebrows.\n\nEveryone in the room was so spectral-looking that Madeleine\u2019s natural healthiness seemed suspect, like a vote for Reagan. She was relieved, therefore, when a big guy in a down jacket and snowmobile boots showed up and took the empty seat next to her. He had a cup of take-out coffee.\n\nZipperstein asked the students to introduce themselves and explain why they were taking the seminar.\n\nThe boy without eyebrows spoke up first. \u201cUm, let\u2019s see. I\u2019m finding it hard to introduce myself, actually, because the whole idea of social introductions is so problematized.\n\nLike, if I tell you that my name is Thurston Meems and that I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, will you know who I am? O.K.\n\nMy name\u2019s Thurston and I\u2019m from Stamford, Connecticut. I\u2019m taking this course because I read Of Grammatology last summer and it blew my mind.\u201d\n\nWhen it was the turn of the boy next to Madeleine, he said in a quiet voice that he was a double major (biology and philosophy) and had never taken a semiotics course before, that his parents had named him Leonard, that it had always seemed pretty handy to have a name, especially when you were being called to dinner, and that if anyone wanted to call him Leonard he would answer to it.\n\nLeonard didn\u2019t make another comment. During the rest of the class, he leaned back in his chair, stretching out his long legs. After he finished his coffee, he dug into his right snowmobile boot and, to Madeleine\u2019s surprise, pulled out a tin of chewing tobacco. With two stained fingers, he placed a wad of tobacco in his cheek. For the next two hours, every minute or so, he spat, discreetly but audibly, into the cup.\n\nEvery week Zipperstein assigned one daunting book of theory and one literary selection. The pairings were eccentric if not downright arbitrary. (What did Saussure\u2019s Writings in General Linguistics, for instance, have to do with Pynchon\u2019s The Crying of Lot 49?) As for Zipperstein himself, he didn\u2019t run the class so much as observe it from behind the one-way mirror of his opaque personality. He hardly said a word. He asked questions now and then to stimulate discussion, and often went to the window to gaze in the direction of Narragansett Bay, as if thinking about his wooden sloop in dry dock.\n\nThree weeks into the course, on a February day of flurries and gray skies, they read Zipperstein\u2019s own book, The Making of Signs, along with Peter Handke\u2019s A Sorrow Beyond Dreams.\n\nIt was always embarrassing when professors assigned their own books. Even Madeleine, who found all the reading hard going, could tell that Zipperstein\u2019s contribution to the field was reformulative and second-tier.\n\nEveryone seemed a little hesitant when talking about The Making of Signs, so it was a relief when, after the break, they turned to the literary selection.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Zipperstein asked, blinking behind his round wire-rims. \u201cWhat did you make of the Handke?\u201d\n\nAfter a short silence, Thurston spoke up. \u201cThe Handke was totally dank and depressing,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved it.\u201d\n\nThurston was a sly-looking boy with short, gelled hair. His eyebrowlessness, along with his pale complexion, gave his face a superintelligent quality, like a floating, disembodied brain.\n\n\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cWell, Professor, here\u2019s a subject dear to my heart\u2014offing yourself.\u201d The other students tittered as Thurston warmed to his topic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s purportedly autobiographical, this book. But I\u2019d contend, with Barthes, that the act of writing is itself a fictionalization, even if you\u2019re treating actual events.\u201d\n\nBart. So that was how you pronounced it. Madeleine made a note, grateful to be spared humiliation.\n\nMeanwhile Thurston was saying, \u201cSo Handke\u2019s mother commits suicide and Handke sits down to write about it. He wants to be as objective as possible, to be totally\u2014remorseless!\u201d\n\nThurston stifled a smile. He aspired to be a person who would react to his own mother\u2019s suicide with high-literary remorselessness, and his soft, young face lit up with pleasure. \u201cSuicide is a trope,\u201d he announced.\n\n\u201cEspecially in German literature. You\u2019ve got The Sorrows of Young Werther. You\u2019ve got Kleist. Hey, I just thought of something.\u201d He held up a finger.\n\n\u201cThe Sorrows of Young Werther.\u201d He held up another finger.\n\n\u201cA Sorrow Beyond Dreams. My theory is that Handke felt the weight of all that tradition and this book was his attempt to break free.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you mean \u2018free\u2019?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cFrom the whole Teutonic, Sturm-und-Drang, suicidal thing.\u201d\n\nThe flurries swirling outside the windows looked like either flakes of soap or flash of ash, like something either very clean or very dirty.\n\n\u201cThe Sorrows of Young Werther is an apt reference,\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cBut I think that\u2019s more the translator\u2019s doing than Handke\u2019s. In German the book\u2019s called Wunschloses Ungl\u00fcck.\u201d\n\nThurston smiled, either because he was pleased to be receiving Zipperstein\u2019s full attention or because he thought German sounded funny.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a play on a German saying, wunschlos gl\u00fccklich, which means being happier than you could ever wish for. Only here Handke makes a nice reversal. It\u2019s a serious and strangely wonderful title.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it means being unhappier than you could ever wish for,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nZipperstein looked at her for the first time.\n\n\u201cIn a sense. As I said, something is lost in translation. What was your take?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the book?\u201d Madeleine asked, and immediately realized how stupid this sounded. She fell silent, the blood beating in her ears.\n\nPeople blushed in nineteenth-century English novels but never in contemporary Austrian ones.\n\nBefore the silence became uncomfortable, Leonard came to her rescue.\n\n\u201cI have a comment,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I was going to write about my mother\u2019s suicide, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be too concerned about being experimental.\u201d He leaned forward, putting his elbows on the table.\n\n\u201cI mean, wasn\u2019t anybody put off by Handke\u2019s so-called remorselessness? Didn\u2019t this book strike anyone as a tad cold?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter cold than sentimental,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cDo you think? Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019ve read the sentimental, filial account of a cherished dead parent before. We\u2019ve read it a million times. It doesn\u2019t have any power anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a little thought experiment here,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cSay my mother killed herself. And say I wrote a book about it.\n\nWhy would I want to do something like that?\u201d He closed his eyes and leaned his head back.\n\n\u201cFirst, I\u2019d do it to cope with my grief. Second, maybe to paint a portrait of my mother. To keep her alive in my memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think your reaction is universal,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cThat because you\u2019d respond to the death of a parent a certain way, that obligates Handke to do the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m saying that if your mother kills herself it\u2019s not a literary trope.\u201d\n\nMadeleine\u2019s heart had quieted now. She was listening to the discussion with interest.\n\nThurston was nodding his head in a way that somehow didn\u2019t suggest agreement.\n\n\u201cYeah, O.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cHandke\u2019s real mother killed herself. She died in a real world and Handke felt real grief or whatever. But that\u2019s not what this book\u2019s about. Books aren\u2019t about \u2018real life.\u2019 Books are about other books.\u201d He raised his mouth like a wind instrument and blew out bright notes.\n\n\u201cMy theory is that the problem Handke was trying to solve here, from a literary standpoint, was how do you write about something, even something real and painful\u2014like suicide\u2014when all of the writing that\u2019s been done on that subject has robbed you of any originality of expression?\u201d\n\nWhat Thurston was saying seemed to Madeleine both insightful and horribly wrong. It was maybe true, what he said, but it shouldn\u2019t have been.\n\n\u201c\u2018Popular literature,\u2019\u201d Zipperstein quipped, proposing an essay title. \u201c\u2018Or, How to Beat a Dead Horse.\u2019\u201d\n\nA spasm of mirth traveled through the class. Madeleine looked over to see that Leonard was staring at her. When the class ended, he gathered up his books and left.\n\nShe started seeing Leonard around after that. She saw him crossing the green one afternoon, hatless in winter drizzle. She saw him at Mutt & Geoff\u2019s, eating a messy Buddy Cianci sandwich. She saw him, one morning, waiting for a bus on South Main. Each time, Leonard was alone, looking forlorn and uncombed like a great big motherless boy. At the same time, he appeared somehow older than most guys at school.\n\nIt was Madeleine\u2019s last semester of senior year, a time when she was supposed to have some fun, and she wasn\u2019t having any. She\u2019d never thought of herself as hard up. She preferred to think of her current boyfriendless state as salutary and head-clearing. But when she found herself wondering what it would be like to kiss a guy who chewed tobacco, she began to worry that she was fooling herself.\n\nLooking back, Madeleine realized that her college love life had fallen short of expectations. Her freshman roommate, Jennifer Boomgaard, had rushed off to Health Services the first week of school to be fitted for a diaphragm. Unaccustomed to sharing a room with anybody, much less a stranger, Madeleine felt that Jenny was a little too quick with her intimacies. She didn\u2019t want to be shown Jennifer\u2019s diaphragm, which reminded her of an uncooked ravioli, and she certainly didn\u2019t want to feel the spermicidal jelly that Jenny offered to squirt into her palm. Madeleine was shocked when Jennifer started going to parties with the diaphragm already in place, when she wore it to the Harvard-Brown game, and when she left it one morning on top of their miniature fridge. That winter, when the Rev. Desmond Tutu came to campus for an anti-apartheid rally, Madeleine asked Jennifer on their way to see the great cleric, \u201cDid you put your diaphragm in?\u201d They lived the next four months in an eighteen-by-fifteen room without speaking to each other.\n\nThough Madeleine hadn\u2019t arrived at college sexually inexperienced, her freshman learning curve resembled a flat line. Aside from one make-out session with a Uruguayan named Carlos, a sandal-wearing engineering student who in low light looked like Che Guevara, the only boy she\u2019d fooled around with was a high school senior visiting campus for Early Action weekend. She found Tim standing in line at the Ratty, pushing his cafeteria tray along the metal track, and visibly quivering. His blue blazer was too big for him. He\u2019d spent the entire day wandering around campus with no one speaking to him. Now he was starving and wasn\u2019t sure if he was allowed to eat in the cafeteria or not. Tim seemed to be the only person at Brown more lost than Madeleine. She helped him negotiate the Ratty and, afterward, took him on a tour of the university. Finally, around ten-thirty that night, they ended up back in Madeleine\u2019s dorm room. Tim had the long-lashed eyes and pretty features of an expensive Bavarian doll, a little prince or yodeling shepherd boy. His blue blazer was on the floor and Madeleine\u2019s shirt unbuttoned when Jennifer Boomgaard came through the door. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201csorry,\u201d and proceeded to stand there, smiling at the floor as if already relishing how this juicy bit of gossip would play along the hall. When she finally did leave, Madeleine sat up and readjusted her clothes, and Tim picked up his blazer and went back to high school.\n\nAt Christmas, when Madeleine went home for vacation, she thought the scale in her parents\u2019 bathroom was broken. She got off to recalibrate the dial and got back on, whereupon the scale again registered the same weight. Stepping in front of the mirror, Madeleine encountered a worried chipmunk staring back.\n\n\u201cAm I not getting asked out because I\u2019m fat,\u201d the chipmunk said, \u201cor am I fat because I\u2019m not getting asked out?\u201d\n\n\u201cI never got the freshman fifteen,\u201d her sister gloated when Madeleine came down to breakfast.\n\n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t pig out like all my friends did.\u201d Accustomed to Alwyn\u2019s teasing, Madeleine paid no attention, quietly slicing and eating the first of the fifty-seven grapefruits she subsisted on until New Year\u2019s.\n\nDieting fooled you into thinking you could control your life. By January, Madeleine was down five pounds, and by the time squash season ended she was back in great shape, and still she didn\u2019t meet anyone she liked. The boys at college seemed either incredibly immature or prematurely middle-aged, bearded like therapists, warming brandy snifters over candles while listening to Coltrane\u2019s A Love Supreme. It wasn\u2019t until her junior year that Madeleine had a serious boyfriend. Billy Bainbridge was the son of Dorothy Bainbridge, whose uncle owned a third of the newspapers in the United States. Billy had flushed cheeks, blond curls, and a scar on his right temple that made him even more adorable than he already was. He was soft-spoken and nice-smelling, like Ivory soap. Naked, his body was nearly hairless.\n\nBilly didn\u2019t like to talk about his family. Madeleine took this as a sign of good breeding. Billy was a legacy at Brown and sometimes worried that he wouldn\u2019t have gotten in on his own. Sex with Billy was cozy, it was snuggly, it was perfectly fine. He wanted to be a filmmaker. The one film he made for Advanced Filmmaking, however, was a violent, unbroken twelve minutes of Billy throwing fecal-looking brownie mix at the camera. Madeleine began to wonder if there was a reason he never talked about his family.\n\nOne thing he did talk about, however, with increasing intensity, was circumcision. Billy had read an article in an alternative health magazine that argued against the practice, and it made a big impression on him.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it, it\u2019s a pretty weird thing to do to a baby,\u201d he said. \u201cCut off part of its dick? What\u2019s so different about a tribe in, like, Papua New Guinea putting bones through their noses and cutting off a baby\u2019s foreskin? A bone through the nose is a lot less invasive.\u201d Madeleine listened, trying to look sympathetic, and hoped Billy would drop the subject. But as the weeks passed he kept returning to it.\n\n\u201cThe doctors just do it automatically in this country,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ask my parents. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m Jewish or anything.\u201d He derided justifications on the basis of health or hygiene. \u201cMaybe that made sense three thousand years ago, out in the desert, when you couldn\u2019t take a shower. But now?\u201d\n\nOne night, as they were lying in bed, naked, Madeleine noticed Billy examining his penis, stretching it.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for the scar,\u201d he said somberly.\n\nHe interrogated his European friends, Henrik the Intact, Olivier the Foreskinned, asking,\n\n\u201cBut does it feel supersensitive?\u201d Billy was convinced that he\u2019d been deprived of sensation. Madeleine tried not to take this personally. Plus there were other problems with their relationship by then. Billy had a habit of staring deeply into Madeleine\u2019s eyes in a way that was somehow controlling. His roommate situation was odd. He lived off campus with an attractive, muscular girl named Kyle who was sleeping with at least three people, including Fatima Shirazi, a niece of the shah of Iran. On the wall of his living room Billy had painted the words Kill the Father. Killing the father was what, in Billy\u2019s opinion, college was all about.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your father?\u201d he asked Madeleine. \u201cIs it Virginia Woolf? Is it Sontag?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my case,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cmy father really is my father.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you have to kill him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s your father?\u201d\n\n\u201cGodard,\u201d he said.\n\nBilly talked about renting a house in Guanajuato with Madeleine over the summer. He said she could write a novel while he made a film. His faith in her, in her writing (even though she hardly wrote any fiction), made Madeleine feel so good that she started going along with the idea. And then one day she came up onto Billy\u2019s front porch and was about to rap on his window when something told her to look in the window instead. In the storm-tossed bed, Billy lay curled, John Lennon\u2013style, against the spread-eagled Kyle. Both were naked. A second later, in a puff of smoke, Fatima materialized, also naked, shaking baby powder over her gleaming Persian skin. She smiled at her bedmates, her teeth seed-like in purple, royal gums.\n\nMaddy\u2019s next boyfriend wasn\u2019t strictly her fault. She would never have met Dabney Carlisle if she hadn\u2019t taken an acting class, and she would never have taken an acting class if it hadn\u2019t been for her mother. As a young woman, Phyllida had wanted to be an actress. Her parents had been opposed, however.\n\n\u201cActing wasn\u2019t what people in our family, especially the ladies, did,\u201d was the way Phyllida put it. Every so often, in reflective moods, she told her daughters the story of her one great disobedience. After graduating from college, Phyllida had \u201crun away\u201d to Hollywood. Without telling her parents, she\u2019d flown out to Los Angeles, staying with a friend from Smith. She\u2019d found a job as a secretary in an insurance company. She and the friend, a girl named Sally Peyton, moved into a bungalow in Santa Monica. In six months Phyllida had three auditions, one screen test, and \u201cloads of invitations.\u201d She\u2019d once seen Jackie Gleason carrying a chihuahua into a restaurant. She\u2019d developed a lustrous suntan she described as \u201cEgyptian.\u201d Whenever Phyllida spoke about this period in her life, it seemed as if she was talking about another person. As for Alton, he became quiet, fully aware that Phyllida\u2019s loss had been his gain. It was on the train back to New York, the next Christmas, that she\u2019d met the straight-backed lieutenant colonel, recently returned from Berlin. Phyllida never went back to L.A. She got married instead. \u201cAnd had you two,\u201d she told her daughters.\n\nPhyllida\u2019s inability to realize her dreams had given Madeleine her own. Her mother\u2019s life was the great counterexample. It represented the injustice Madeleine\u2019s life would rectify. To come of age simultaneously with a great social movement, to grow up in the age of Betty Friedan and ERA marches and Bella Abzug\u2019s indomitable hats, to define your identity when it was being redefined, this was a freedom as great as any of the American freedoms Madeleine had read about in school. She could remember the night, in 1973, when her family gathered before the television in the den to watch the tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs. How she, Alwyn, and Phyllida had rooted for Billie Jean, while Alton had pulled for Bobby Riggs. How, as King ran Riggs back and forth across the court, outserving him, hitting winners he was too slow to return, Alton began to grumble.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a fair fight! Riggs is too old.\n\nIf they want a real test, she should play Smith or Newcombe.\u201d\n\nBut it didn\u2019t matter what Alton said.\n\nIt didn\u2019t matter that Bobby Riggs was fifty-five and King twenty-nine, or that Riggs hadn\u2019t been an especially great player even in his prime. What mattered was that this tennis match was on national television, during prime time, billed for weeks as \u201cThe Battle of the Sexes,\u201d and that the woman was winning. If any single moment defined Madeleine\u2019s generation of girls, dramatized their aspirations, put into clear focus what they expected from themselves and from life, it was those two hours and fifteen minutes when the country watched a man in white shorts get thrashed by a woman, pummeled repeatedly until all he could do, after match point, was to jump feebly over the net. And even that was telling: you were supposed to jump the net when you won, not lost. So how male was that, to act like a winner when you\u2019d just been creamed?\n\nAt the first meeting of Acting Workshop, Professor Churchill, a bald bullfrog of a man, asked the students to say something about themselves. Half the people in the class were theater majors, serious about acting or directing. Madeleine mumbled something about loving Shakespeare and Eugene O\u2019Neill.\n\nDabney Carlisle stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ve done a little modeling work, down in New York. My agent suggested I should take some acting lessons. So here I am.\u201d\n\nThe modeling he\u2019d done consisted of a single magazine ad, showing a group of Leni Riefenstahl\u2013ish athletes in boxer briefs, standing in a receding line on a beach whose black volcanic sand steamed around their marble feet. Madeleine didn\u2019t see the photograph until she and Dabney were already going out, when Dabney gingerly took it out of the bartending manual where he kept it safely pressed. She was inclined to make fun of it but something reverential in Dabney\u2019s expression stopped her. And so she asked where the beach had been (Montauk) and why it was so black (it wasn\u2019t) and how much he\u2019d gotten paid (\u201cfour figures\u201d) and what the other guys were like (\u201ctotal a-holes\u201d) and if he was wearing the underpants right now. It was sometimes difficult, with boys, to take an interest in the things that interested them. But with Dabney she wished it had been curling, she longed for it to be the model UN, anything but male modeling. This, anyway, was the authentic emotion she now identified herself as having felt. At the time\u2014Dabney cautioned her against touching the ad before he got it laminated\u2014Madeleine had rehearsed in her mind the standard arguments: that though objectification was de facto bad, the emergence of the idealized male form in the mass media scored a point for equality; that if men started getting objectified and started worrying about their looks and their bodies, they might begin to understand the burden women had been living with since forever, and might therefore be sensitized to these issues of the body. She even went so far as to admire Dabney for his courage in allowing himself to be photographed in snug little gray underpants.\n\nLooking the way Madeleine and Dabney did, it was inevitable that they would be cast as romantic leads in the scenes the workshop performed. Madeleine was Rosalind to Dabney\u2019s wooden Orlando, Maggie to his brick-like Brick in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. To rehearse the first time, they met at Dabney\u2019s fraternity house. Merely stepping through the front door reinforced Madeleine\u2019s aversion to places like Sigma Chi. It was around ten on a Sunday morning. The vestiges of the previous evening\u2019s \u201cHawaiian Night\u201d were still there to see\u2014the lei hanging from the antlers of the moose head on the wall, the plastic \u201cgrass\u201d skirt trampled on the beer-sodden floor, a skirt that, should Madeleine succumb to the outrageous good looks of Dabney Carlisle, she might, at a minimum, have to watch some drunken slut hula in to the baying of the brothers, or, at a maximum (for mai tais made you do crazy things), might even don herself, up in Dabney\u2019s room, for his pleasure alone. On the low-slung couch two Sigma Chi members were watching TV. At Madeleine\u2019s appearance, they stirred, rising out of the gloom like openmouthed carp. She hurried to the back stairs, thinking the things she always thought when it came to frats and frat guys: that their appeal stemmed from a primitive need for protection (one thought of Neanderthal clans banding together against other Neanderthal clans); that the hazing the pledges underwent (being stripped and blindfolded and left in the lobby of the Biltmore Hotel with bus fare taped to their genitals) enacted the very fears of male rape and emasculation that membership in the fraternity promised protection against; that any guy who longed to join a frat suffered from insecurities that poisoned his relationships with women; that there was something seriously wrong with homophobic guys who centered their lives around a homoerotic bond; that the stately mansions maintained by generations of dues-paying fraternity members were in reality sites for date rape and problem drinking; that frats always smelled bad; that you didn\u2019t ever want to shower in one; that only freshman girls were stupid enough to go to frat parties; that Kelly Traub had slept with a Sigma Delt guy who kept saying,\n\n\u201cNow you see it, now you don\u2019t, now you see it, now you don\u2019t\u201d; that such a thing wasn\u2019t going to happen to her, to Madeleine, ever.\n\nWhat she hadn\u2019t expected when it came to a fraternity was a sunny-haired silent type like Dabney, learning his lines in a folding chair, in parachute pants, shoeless. Looking back on their relationship, Madeleine figured she\u2019d had no choice. Dabney and she had been selected for each other in a Royal Wedding kind of way. She was Prince Charles to his Princess Di. She knew he couldn\u2019t act. Dabney had the artistic soul of a third-string tight end. In life Dabney moved and said little. Onstage he moved not at all but had to say a lot. His best dramatic moments came when the strain on his face from remembering his lines resembled the emotion he was trying to simulate.\n\nActing opposite Dabney made Madeleine more stiff and nervous than she already was. She wanted to do scenes with the talented kids in the workshop. She suggested interesting bits from The Vietnamization of New Jersey and Mamet\u2019s Sexual Perversity in Chicago, but got no takers. Nobody wanted to lower his or her average by acting with her.\n\nDabney didn\u2019t let it bother him. \u201cBunch of little shits in that class,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll never get any print work, much less movies.\u201d\n\nHe was more laconic than she liked her boyfriends to be. He had the wit of a store mannequin. But Dabney\u2019s physical perfection pushed these realities out of her mind. She\u2019d never been in a relationship where she wasn\u2019t the more attractive partner. It was slightly intimidating. But she could handle it. At three a.m., while Dabney lay sleeping beside her, Madeleine found she was up to the task of inventorying each abdominal cord, every hard lump of muscle. She enjoyed applying calipers to Dabney\u2019s waist to measure his body fat. Underwear modeling was all about the abs, Dabney said, and the abs were all about sit-ups and diet. The pleasure Madeleine got from looking at Dabney was reminiscent of the pleasure she\u2019d gotten as a girl from looking at sleek hunting dogs. Underneath this pleasure, like the coals that fed it, was a fierce need to enfold Dabney and siphon off his strength and beauty. It was all very primitive and evolutionary and felt fantastic. The problem was that she hadn\u2019t been able to allow herself to enjoy Dabney or even to exploit him a little, but had had to go and be a total girl about it and convince herself that she was in love with him. Madeleine required emotion, apparently. She disapproved of the idea of meaningless, extremely satisfying sex.\n\nAnd so she began to tell herself that Dabney\u2019s acting was \u201crestrained\u201d or \u201ceconomical.\u201d She appreciated that Dabney was \u201csecure about himself\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t need to prove anything\u201d and wasn\u2019t a \u201cshowoff.\u201d Instead of worrying that he was dull, Madeleine decided he was gentle. Instead of thinking he was poorly read, she called him intuitive. She exaggerated Dabney\u2019s mental abilities in order not to feel shallow for wanting his body. To this end she helped Dabney write\u2014O.K., she wrote\u2014English and anthro papers for him and, when he got A\u2019s, felt confirmed of his intelligence. She sent him off to modeling auditions in New York with good-luck kisses and listened to him complain bitterly about the \u201cfaggots\u201d who hadn\u2019t hired his services. It turned out that Dabney wasn\u2019t so beautiful. Among the truly beautiful he was only so-so. He couldn\u2019t even smile right.\n\nAt the end of the semester, the acting students met separately with the professor for a critical review. Churchill welcomed Madeleine with a wolfish yellow grin, then sat back jowly and deliberate in his chair.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed having you in the class, Madeleine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you can\u2019t act.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t hold back,\u201d Madeleine said, chastened but laughing. \u201cGive it to me straight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have a good feel for language, for Shakespeare especially. But your voice is reedy and you look worried onstage. Your forehead has a perpetual crease. A vocal coach could go a long way toward helping your instrument. But I worry about your worrying. You\u2019ve got it right now. The crease.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called thinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is fine.\n\nIf you\u2019re playing Eleanor Roosevelt. Or Golda Meir. But those parts don\u2019t come around very often.\u201d\n\nChurchill, steepling his fingers, continued, \u201cI\u2019d be more diplomatic if I thought this meant a lot to you. But I get the feeling you don\u2019t want to be a professional actress, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cGood. You\u2019re lovely. You\u2019re bright. The world is your oyster. Go with my blessings.\u201d\n\nWhen Dabney returned from his review with Churchill, he looked even more self-contented than usual.\n\n\u201cSo?\u201d Madeleine asked. \u201cHow did it go?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says I\u2019m perfect for soaps.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoap commercials?\u201d\n\nDabney looked peeved. \u201cDays of Our Lives. General Hospital. Ever heard of those?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he mean that as a compliment?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow else could he mean it? Soap actors have it made! They work every day, make great money, and never have to travel. I\u2019ve been wasting my time trying to get all this advertising work. Screw that. I\u2019m going to tell my agent to start lining up some auditions for soaps.\u201d\n\nMadeleine was silent at this news. She\u2019d assumed Dabney\u2019s enthusiasm for modeling was temporary, a tuition-earning scheme. Now she realized he was in earnest. She was, in fact, dating a model.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d Dabney asked her.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust that\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014but I doubt Prof. Churchill has that high of an opinion of the acting on Days of Our Lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he tell us the first class? He said he was giving a workshop in acting. For people who wanted to work in the theater.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the theater doesn\u2019t mean \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did he tellyou? Did he say you were going to be a movie star?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told me I couldn\u2019t act,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cHe did, huh?\u201d Dabney put his hands in his pockets, leaning back on his heels as if relieved not to have to deliver this verdict himself. \u201cIs that why you\u2019re so pissed off? And have to tear down my crit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not tearing down your crit. I\u2019m just not sure you got Churchill\u2019s meaning, exactly.\u201d\n\nDabney let out a bitter laugh. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get it right, would I? I\u2019m too dumb. I\u2019m just some dumb jock you have to write English papers for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. You seem to have a pretty good grasp of sarcasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, am I ever lucky,\u201d Dabney said.\n\n\u201cWhat would I do if you weren\u2019t around?\n\nYou have to catch all the subtleties for me, don\u2019t you? You and your flair for catching subtleties. It must be nice to be rich and sit around all day catching subtleties.\n\nWhat do you know about needing to make a living?\n\nIt\u2019s fine for you to make fun of my ad. You didn\u2019t get into college on a football scholarship. And now you have to come in here and run me down.\n\nYou know what? This is bullshit. This is total bullshit. I\u2019m sick of your condescension and your superiority complex. And Churchill\u2019s right. You can\u2019t act.\u201d\n\nIn the end Madeleine had to admit that Dabney was far more fluent than she\u2019d ever expected. He was capable of portraying a range of emotions, too, anger, disgust, wounded pride, and of simulating others, including affection, passion, and love. He had a great career in the soaps ahead of him.\n\n\n\nMadeleine and Dabney had broken up in May, right before summer, and there was no better time than summer to forget about somebody. She\u2019d gone straight down to Prettybrook the day she finished her last exam. For once she was glad to have such sociable parents. With all the cocktail parties and convivial dinners on Wilson Lane there was little time to dwell on herself. In July, she got an internship at a nonprofit poetry organization on the Upper East Side and began riding the train into the city. Madeleine\u2019s job was to oversee submissions for the annual New Voices award, which involved making sure that the submissions were complete before sending them off to the judge (Howard Nemerov, that year). Madeleine wasn\u2019t particularly technical, but because everyone else in the office was even less so, she ended up being the go-to person whenever the copier or the dot-matrix printer malfunctioned. Her coworker Brenda would come up to Madeleine\u2019s desk at least once a week and ask in a babyish voice,\n\n\u201cCan you help me? The printer\u2019s not being nice.\u201d The only part of the day Madeleine enjoyed was her lunch hour, when she got to walk around the muggy, stinking, thrilling streets, eat quiche in a French bistro as narrow as a bowling alley, and stare at the styles women her age or a little older were wearing. When the one straight guy at the nonprofit asked her to have a drink after work,\n\nMadeleine cooly answered, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t,\u201d trying not to feel bad about hurting his feelings, trying to think about her own feelings for a change.\n\nShe arrived back at college for her senior year, then, intent on being studious, career-oriented, and aggressively celibate. Casting a wide net, Madeleine sent away for applications to Yale grad school (English Language and Literature), an organization for teaching English in China, and an advertising internship at Foote, Cone & Belding, in Chicago. She studied for the GRE using a sample booklet. The verbal section was easy. The math required brushing up on her high school algebra. The logic problems, however, were a defeat to the spirit. \u201cAt the annual dancers\u2019 ball a number of dancers performed their favorite dance with their favorite partners. Alan danced the tango, while Becky watched the waltz. James and Charlotte were fantastic together. Keith was magnificent during his foxtrot and Simon excelled at the rumba. Jessica danced with Alan. But Laura did not dance with Simon. Can you determine who danced with whom and which dance they each enjoyed?\u201d Logic wasn\u2019t something Madeleine had been expressly taught. It seemed unfair to be asked about it. She did as the book suggested, diagramming the problems, placing Alan, Becky, James, Charlotte, Keith, Simon, Jessica, and Laura on the dance floor of her scrap paper, and pairing them according to the instructions. But their complicated transit wasn\u2019t a subject Madeleine\u2019s mind naturally followed. She wanted to know why James and Charlotte were fantastic together, and if Jessica and Alan were going out, and why Laura wouldn\u2019t dance with Simon, and if Becky was upset, watching.\n\nOne afternoon, on the bulletin board outside Hillel House, Madeleine noticed a flyer announcing the Melvin and Hetty Greenberg Fellowship for summer study at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and she applied for that. Using contacts of Alton\u2019s in the publishing world, she put on a business suit and went down to New York for an informational interview with an editor at Simon and Schuster. The editor, Terry Wirth, had once been a bright, idealistic English major just like Madeleine, but she found him that afternoon, in his tiny, manuscript-piled office looking onto the gloomy canyon of Sixth Avenue, a middle-aged father of two with a salary far below the median of his former classmates and a nasty, hour-and-fifteen-minute commute to his split-level in Montclair, New Jersey. On the prospects of a book he was publishing that month, the memoir of a migrant farmer,\n\nWirth said, \u201cNow\u2019s the calm before the calm.\u201d He gave Madeleine a stack of manuscripts from the slush pile to critique, offering to pay her fifty bucks a pop.\n\nInstead of reading the manuscripts, Madeleine took the subway down to the East Village. After buying a bag of pignoli cookies at De Robertis, she plunged into a hair salon, where, on a whim, she allowed a butch woman with a short, rat-tailed haircut to go to work on her.\n\n\u201cCut it close on the sides, higher on top,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d the woman said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Madeleine answered. To show her resolve, she took off her glasses. Forty-five minutes later, she put her glasses back on, horror-struck and elated at the transformation. Her head was really quite enormous. She had never fathomed its true size. She looked like Annie Lennox, or David Bowie. Like someone the hairdresser might be dating.\n\nThe Annie Lennox look was O.K., however. Androgyny was just the thing. Once she was back at school, Madeleine\u2019s haircut proclaimed her serious frame of mind, and by the end of the year, when her bangs had grown out to a maddening length she didn\u2019t know what to do with, she remained firm in her renunciations. (Her only slip-up had been the night in her bedroom with Mitchell, but nothing had happened.) Madeleine had her thesis to write. She had her future to figure out. The last thing she needed was a boy to distract her from her work and disturb her equilibrium. But then, during spring semester, she met Leonard Bankhead and her resolve went out the window.\n\nHe shaved irregularly. His Skoal had a menthol scent, cleaner, more pleasant than Madeleine expected. Whenever she looked up to find Leonard staring at her with his St. Bernard\u2019s eyes (the eyes of a drooler, maybe, but also of a loyal brute who could dig you out of an avalanche), Madeleine couldn\u2019t help staring back a significant moment longer.\n\nOne evening in early March, when she went to the Rockefeller Library to pick up the reserve reading for Semiotics 211, she found Leonard there as well. He was leaning against the counter, speaking animatedly to the girl on duty, who was unfortunately rather cute in a busty Bettie Page way.\n\n\u201cThink about it, though,\u201d Leonard was saying to the girl. \u201cThink about it from the point of view of the fly.\u201d\n\n\u201cO.K., I\u2019m a fly,\u201d the girl said with a throaty laugh.\n\n\u201cWe move in slow motion to them. They can see the swatter coming from a million miles away. The flies are like, \u2018Wake me when the swatter gets close.\u2019\u201d\n\nNoticing Madeleine, the girl told Leonard, \u201cJust a sec.\u201d\n\nMadeleine held out her call order slip, and the girl took it and went off into the stacks.\n\n\u201cPicking up the Balzac?\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBalzac to the rescue.\u201d\n\nNormally, Madeleine would have had many things to say to this, many comments about Balzac to make. But her mind was a blank. She didn\u2019t even remember to smile until he\u2019d looked away.\n\nBettie Page came back with Madeleine\u2019s order, sliding it toward her and immediately turning back to Leonard. He seemed different than he did in class, more exuberant, supercharged. He raised his eyebrows in a crazed, Jack Nicholson way and said,\n\n\u201cMy house fly theory is related to my theory about why time seems to go faster as you get older.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d the girl asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s proportional,\u201d Leonard explained. \u201cWhen you\u2019re five, you\u2019ve only been alive a couple thousand days. But by the time you\u2019re fifty, you\u2019ve lived around twenty thousand days. So a day when you\u2019re five seems longer because it\u2019s a greater percentage of the whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d the girl teased, \u201cthat follows.\u201d\n\nBut Madeleine had understood. \u201cThat makes sense,\u201d she said. \u201cI always wondered why that was.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a theory,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nBettie Page tapped Leonard\u2019s hand to get his attention.\n\n\u201cFlies aren\u2019t always so fast,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve caught flies in my bare hands before.\u201d\n\n\u201cEspecially in winter,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the kind of fly I\u2019d be. One of those knucklehead winter flies.\u201d\n\nThere was no good excuse for Madeleine to hang around the reserve reading room, and so she put the Balzac into her bag and headed out.\n\nShe began to dress differently on the days she had semiotics. She took out her diamond studs, leaving her ears bare. She stood in front of the mirror wondering if her Annie Hall glasses might possibly project a New Wave look. She decided not and wore her contacts. She unearthed a pair of Beatle boots she\u2019d bought at a church basement sale in Vinalhaven. She put up her collar, and wore more black.\n\nIn Week Four, Zipperstein assigned Umberto Eco\u2019s The Role of the Reader. It hadn\u2019t done much for Madeleine. She wasn\u2019t all that interested, as a reader, in the reader. She was still partial to that increasingly eclipsed entity: the writer. Madeleine had a feeling that most semiotic theorists had been unpopular as children, often bullied or overlooked, and so had directed their lingering rage onto literature. They wanted to demote the author. They wanted a book, that hard-won, transcendent thing, to be a text, contingent, indeterminate, and open for suggestions. They wanted the reader to be the main thing. Because they were readers.\n\nWhereas Madeleine was perfectly happy with the idea of genius. She wanted a book to take her places she couldn\u2019t get to herself. She thought a writer should work harder writing a book than she did reading it. When it came to letters and literature, Madeleine championed a virtue that had fallen out of esteem: namely, clarity. The week after they read Eco, they read portions of Derrida\u2019s Writing and Difference. The week after that, they read Jonathan Culler\u2019s On Deconstruction, and Madeleine came to class ready to contribute to the discussion for the first time. Before she could do so, however, Thurston beat her to it.\n\n\u201cThe Culler was passable at best,\u201d Thurston said.\n\n\u201cWhat didn\u2019t you like about it?\u201d the professor asked him.\n\nThurston had his knee up against the edge of the seminar table. He pushed his chair up on its back legs, scrunching up his face. \u201cIt\u2019s readable and everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd well argued and all that. But it\u2019s just a question of whether you can use a discredited discourse\u2014like, say, reason\u2014to explicate something as paradigmatically revolutionary as deconstruction.\u201d\n\nMadeleine searched along the table for mutual eye-rolling but the other students seemed eager to hear what Thurston had to say.\n\n\u201cCare to elaborate?\u201d Zipperstein said.\n\n\u201cWell, what I mean is, first off, reason is just a discourse like any other, right? It\u2019s only been imbued with a sense of absolute truth because it\u2019s the privileged discourse of the West. What Derrida\u2019s saying is that you have to use reason because, you know, reason is all there is. But at the same time you have to be aware that language is by its very nature unreasonable. You have to reason yourself out of reasonableness.\u201d He pulled up the sleeve of his T-shirt and scratched his bony shoulder. \u201cCuller, on the other hand, is still operating in the old mode. Mono as opposed to stereo. So from that point of view, I found the book, yeah, a little bit disappointing.\u201d\n\nA silence ensued. And deepened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Madeleine said, glancing at Leonard for support.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s just me, but wasn\u2019t it a relief to read a logical argument for once? Culler boils down everything Eco and Derrida are saying into a digestible form.\u201d\n\nThurston turned his head slowly to gaze across the seminar table at her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s bad,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. But Culler\u2019s work is of a different order than Derrida. Every genius needs an explainer. That\u2019s what Culler is for Derrida.\u201d\n\nMadeleine shrugged this off. \u201cI got a lot better idea of what deconstruction is from reading Culler than from reading Derrida.\u201d\n\nThurston took pains to give her point of view full consideration. \u201cIt\u2019s the nature of a simplification to be simple,\u201d he said.\n\nClass ended shortly after that, leaving Madeleine fuming. As she was coming out of Sayles Hall, she saw Leonard standing on the steps, holding a Coke can. She went right up to him and said, \u201cThanks for the help.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you were on my side. Why didn\u2019t you say anything in class?\u201d\n\n\u201cFirst Law of Thermodynamics,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cConservation of energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you agree with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did and I didn\u2019t,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t like the Culler?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Culler\u2019s good. But Derrida\u2019s a heavyweight. You can\u2019t just write him off.\u201d\n\nMadeleine looked dubious, but Derrida wasn\u2019t who she was mad at. \u201cConsidering how Thurston\u2019s always going on about how much he worships language, you\u2019d think he wouldn\u2019t parrot so much jargon. He used the word phallus three times today.\u201d\n\nLeonard smiled. \u201cFigures if he says it it\u2019ll be like having one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe drives me crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want to get some coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd fascist. That\u2019s another of his favorites. You know the dry cleaners on Thayer Street? He called them fascist.\u201d\n\n\u201cMust have gone extra heavy on the starch.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYes, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just invited me for coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did?\u201d Leonard said. \u201cYes, I did. O.K. Let\u2019s go get coffee.\u201d\n\nLeonard didn\u2019t want to go to the Blue Room. He said he didn\u2019t like to be around college students. They headed through Wayland Arch up to Hope Street, in the direction of Fox Point.\n\nAs they walked, Leonard spat into his Coke can every so often.\n\n\u201cPardon my disgusting habit,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine wrinkled up her nose. \u201cAre you going to keep doing that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why I do it. It\u2019s just something I picked up from my rodeo days.\u201d\n\nAt the next trash can they came to, he tossed the Coke and spat out his wad of tobacco.\n\nWithin a few blocks pretty campus plantings of tulip and daffodil gave way to treeless streets lined by working-class houses painted in cheerful hues. They passed a Portuguese bakery and a Portuguese fish store selling sardines and cuttlefish. The kids here had no yards to play in but seemed happy enough, wheeling back and forth along the blank sidewalks. Nearer the highway, there were a few warehouses and, on the corner of Wickenden, a local diner.\n\nLeonard wanted to sit at the counter. \u201cI need to be close to the pies,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to see which one is talking to me.\u201d\n\nAs Madeleine took a stool next to him, Leonard stared at the dessert case.\n\n\u201cDo you remember when they used to serve slices of cheese with apple pie?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cVaguely,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to do that anymore. You and I are probably the only two people in this place who remember it.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, I don\u2019t remember it,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t? Never had a little slice of Wisconsin cheddar with your apple pie? I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe they\u2019ll put a slice of cheese on a piece if you ask them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say I liked it. I\u2019m just mourning its passage.\u201d\n\nThe conversation lapsed. And suddenly, to her surprise, Madeleine was flooded with panic. She felt the silence like a judgment against her. At the same time, her anxiety about the silence made it even harder to speak.\n\nThough it didn\u2019t feel nice to be so nervous, it did feel nice, in a way. It had been a while since Madeleine had been that way around a guy.\n\nThe waitress was down at the end of the counter talking to another customer.\n\n\u201cSo why are you taking Zipperstein\u2019s class?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cPhilosophical interest,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cLiterally. Philosophy\u2019s all about theory of language right now. It\u2019s all linguistics. So I figured I\u2019d check it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you a biology major, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I really am,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThe philosophy\u2019s just a sideline.\u201d\n\nMadeleine realized that she\u2019d never dated a science major.\n\n\u201cDo you want to be a doctor?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now all I want to do is get the waitress\u2019s attention.\u201d\n\nLeonard waved his arm a few times to no avail. Suddenly he said, \u201cIs it hot in here?\u201d\n\nWithout waiting for an answer, he reached into the back pocket of his jeans and pulled out a blue bandanna, which he proceeded to put over his head, tying it in back and making a number of small, precise adjustments until he was satisfied. Madeleine watched this with a slight feeling of disappointment. She associated bandannas with hacky sack, the Grateful Dead, and alfalfa sprouts, all of which she could do without. Still, she was impressed with Leonard\u2019s sheer size on the stool next to her. His largeness, coupled with the softness\u2014the delicacy, almost\u2014of his voice, gave Madeleine a strange fairytale feeling, as if she were a princess sitting beside a gentle giant.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, though,\u201d Leonard said, still staring in the waitress\u2019s direction,\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get interested in philosophy because of linguistics. I got interested for the eternal verities. To learn how to die, et cetera. Now it\u2019s more like, \u2018What do we mean when we say we die?\u2019\n\n\u2018What do we mean we mean when we say we die?\u2019\u201d\n\nFinally, the waitress came over. Madeleine ordered the cottage cheese plate and coffee. Leonard ordered apple pie and coffee. When the waitress left, he spun his stool rightward, so that their knees briefly touched.\n\n\u201cHow very female of you,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSorry?\u201d\n\n\u201cCottage cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like cottage cheese.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you on a diet? You don\u2019t look like someone on a diet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nAnd here, for the first time, Leonard appeared rattled. Beneath the line of the bandanna, his face colored, and he spun away, breaking eye contact. \u201cJust curious,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the next second, he spun back, resuming the previous conversation. \u201cDerrida\u2019s supposed to be a lot clearer in French,\u201d he said. \u201cRumor has it his prose in French is limpid.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe I should read it in French, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know French?\u201d Leonard said, sounding impressed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not great. I can read Flaubert.\u201d\n\nIt was then that Madeleine made a big mistake. Things were going so well with Leonard, the mood was so promising\u2014even the weather lending a hand because, after they finished their food and left the diner, walking back to campus, a March drizzle forced them to share Madeleine\u2019s collapsible umbrella\u2014that a feeling came over her like those she\u2019d had as a girl when treated to a pastry or a dessert, a happiness so fraught by an awareness of its brevity that she took the tiniest bites, making the cream puff or \u00e9clair last as long as possible. In this same way, instead of seeing where the afternoon led, Madeleine decided to check its progress, to save some for later, and she told Leonard she had to go home and study.\n\nThey didn\u2019t kiss goodbye. They didn\u2019t come close to it.\n\nLeonard, hunching under the umbrella, abruptly said \u201cBye\u201d and hurried off through the rain, keeping his head down. Madeleine went back to the Narragansett. She lay down on her bed, and didn\u2019t move for a long time.\n\nThe days dragged until the next meeting of Sem 211. Madeleine arrived early, choosing a seat at the seminar table next to Leonard\u2019s usual spot. But when he showed up, ten minutes late, he took an available chair next to the professor. He didn\u2019t say anything in class or glance in Madeleine\u2019s direction even once. His face looked swollen and there was a line of blemishes running down one cheek. When the class ended, Leonard was the first one out the door.\n\nThe next week he missed class entirely.\n\nAnd so Madeleine was left to contend with semiotics, and with Zipperstein and his disciples, all by herself.\n\nBy now they had moved on to Derrida\u2019s Of Grammatology. The Derrida went like this: \u201cIn that sense, it is the Aufhebung of other writings, particularly of hieroglyphic script and of the Leibnizian characteristic that had been criticized previously through one and the same gesture.\u201d In poetic moods, the Derrida went like this: \u201cWhat writing itself, in its nonphonetic moment, betrays, is life. It menaces at once the breath, the spirit, and history as the spirit\u2019s relationship with itself. It is their end, their finitude, their paralysis.\u201d\n\nSince Derrida claimed that language, by its very nature, undermined any meaning it attempted to promote, Madeleine wondered how Derrida expected her to get his meaning. Maybe he didn\u2019t. That was why he deployed so much arcane terminology, so many loop-de-looping clauses. That was why he said what he said in sentences it took a minute to identify the subjects of. (Could \u201cthe access to pluridimensionality and to a delinearized temporality\u201d really be a subject?)\n\nReading a novel after reading semiotic theory was like jogging empty-handed after jogging with hand weights. After getting out of Semiotics 211, Madeleine fled to the Rockefeller Library, down to B Level, where the stacks exuded a vivifying smell of mold, and grabbed something\u2014anything, The House of Mirth, Daniel Deronda\u2014to restore herself to sanity. How wonderful it was when one sentence followed logically from the sentence before! What exquisite guilt she felt, wickedly enjoying narrative! Madeleine felt safe with a nineteenth-century novel. There were going to be people in it. Something was going to happen to them in a place resembling the world.\n\nThen, too, there were lots of weddings in Wharton and Austen. There were all kinds of irresistible gloomy men.\n\nThe next Thursday, Madeleine came to class wearing a Norwegian sweater with a snowflake design. She\u2019d gone back to her glasses. For the second week in a row, Leonard didn\u2019t show up. Madeleine worried that he\u2019d dropped the class, but it was too late in the semester to do that. Zipperstein said,\n\n\u201cHas anybody seen Mr. Bankhead? Is he sick?\u201d Nobody knew. Thurston arrived with a girl named Cassandra Hart, both of them sniffly and heroin-pale. Taking out a black Flair pen, Thurston wrote on Cassandra\u2019s bare shoulder,\n\n\u201cNot Real Skin.\u201d\n\nZipperstein was in a lively mood. He\u2019d just returned from a conference in New York, dressed differently than usual. Listening to him talk about the paper he\u2019d given at the New School, Madeleine suddenly understood. Semiotics was the form Zipperstein\u2019s midlife crisis had taken. Becoming a semiotician allowed Zipperstein to wear a leather jacket, to fly off to Douglas Sirk retrospectives in Vancouver, and to get all the sexy waifs in his classes. Instead of leaving his wife, Zipperstein had left the English department. Instead of buying a sports car, he\u2019d bought deconstruction.\n\nHe sat at the seminar table now and started speaking:\n\n\u201cI hope you read the Semiotext(e) for this week. Apropos of Lyotard, and in homage to Gertrude Stein, let me suggest the following: the thing about desire is that there is no there there.\u201d\n\nThat was it. That was Zipperstein\u2019s prompt. He sat before them, blinking, waiting for somebody to reply. He appeared to have all the patience in the world.\n\nMadeleine had wanted to know what semiotics was. She\u2019d wanted to know what the fuss was about. Well, now she felt she knew.\n\nBut then, in Week Ten, for reasons that were entirely extracurricular, semiotics began making sense.\n\nIt was a Friday night in April, just past eleven, and Madeleine was in bed, reading. The assigned text for that week was Roland Barthes\u2019 A Lover\u2019s Discourse. For a book purportedly about love, it didn\u2019t look very romantic. The cover was a somber chocolate brown, the title turquoise. There was no author photograph and only a sketchy bio, listing Barthes\u2019 other works.\n\nMadeleine had the book in her lap. With her right hand she was eating peanut butter straight from the jar. The spoon fit perfectly against the curve of her upper palate, allowing the peanut butter to dissolve creamily against her tongue.\n\nOpening to the introduction, she began to read:\n\nThe necessity for this book is to be found in the following consideration: that the lover\u2019s discourse is today of an extreme solitude.\n\nOutside, the temperature, which had remained cold through March, had shot up into the fifties. The resulting thaw was alarming in its suddenness, drainpipes and gutters dripping, sidewalks puddling, streets flooded, a constant sound of water rushing downhill.\n\nMadeleine had her windows open on the liquid darkness. She sucked the spoon and read on:\n\nWhat we have been able to say below about waiting, anxiety, memory is no more than a modest supplement offered to the reader to be made free with, to be added to, subtracted from, and passed on to others: around the figure, the players pass the handkerchief which sometimes, by a final parenthesis, is held a second longer before handing it on. (Ideally, the book would be a cooperative: \u201cTo the United Readers and Lovers.\u201d)\n\nIt wasn\u2019t only that this writing seemed beautiful to Madeleine. It wasn\u2019t only that these opening sentences of Barthes\u2019 made immediate sense. It wasn\u2019t only the relief at recognizing that here, finally, was a book she might write her final paper on. What made Madeleine sit up in bed was something closer to the reason she read books in the first place and had always loved them. Here was a sign that she wasn\u2019t alone. Here was an articulation of what she had been so far mutely feeling. In bed on a Friday night, wearing sweatpants, her hair tied back, her glasses smudged, and eating peanut butter from the jar, Madeleine was in a state of extreme solitude.\n\nIt had to do with Leonard. With how she felt about him and how she couldn\u2019t tell anyone. With how much she liked him and how little she knew about him. With how desperately she wanted to see him and how hard it was to do so.\n\nIn recent days, from her solitude, Madeleine had sent out feelers. She talked about Semiotics 211 with her roommates, mentioning Thurston, Cassandra, and Leonard. It turned out that Abby knew Leonard from her freshman year.\n\n\u201cWhat was he like?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cSort of intense. Really smart, but intense. He used to call me all the time. Like every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he like you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he just wanted to talk. He\u2019d keep me on the phone for an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you guys talk about?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything! His relationship. My relationship. His parents, my parents. Jimmy Carter getting attacked by that swamp rabbit, which he was obsessed about. He\u2019d go on and on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was he going out with?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome girl named Mindy. But then they broke up. That\u2019s when he really started calling me. He\u2019d call like six times a day. He was always going on about how good Mindy smelled. She had this smell that was supposedly perfectly compatible to Leonard, chemically. He was worried no girl would ever smell right to him again. I told him it was probably her moisturizer. He said no, it was her skin. It was chemically perfect. That\u2019s what he\u2019s like.\u201d She paused and gave Madeleine a searching look. \u201cWhy are you asking? Do you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI just know him from class,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to invite him for dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll invite him to dinner,\u201d Abby said.\n\nThe dinner had been on Tuesday night, three days ago. Leonard had come politely bearing a gift, a set of dish towels. He\u2019d dressed up, wearing a white shirt with a skinny necktie, his long hair gathered in a masculine ponytail like a Scottish warrior. He was touchingly sincere, saying hello to Abby, handing her the wrapped gift and thanking her for the invitation.\n\nMadeleine tried not to seem overeager. At dinner, she paid attention to Brian Weeger, whose breath had a dog-food smell. A couple of times, when she looked over at Leonard, he stared back, fixedly, appearing almost upset. Later, when Madeleine was in the kitchen, rinsing dishes, Leonard came in. She turned to find him inspecting a bump on the wall.\n\n\u201cThis must be an old gas main,\u201d he said.\n\nMadeleine looked at the bump, which had been painted over many times.\n\n\u201cThey used to have gas lamps in these old places,\u201d Leonard went on.\n\n\u201cThey probably used to pump the gas up from the basement. If anybody\u2019s pilot blew out, on any floor, you\u2019d have a leak. Gas didn\u2019t have an odor back then, either. They didn\u2019t start adding methyl mercaptan until later.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood to know,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cThis place must have been a powder keg.\u201d Leonard tapped the jutting object with his fingernail, turned, and looked Madeleine meaningfully in the face.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been going to class,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s head was way up above her, but then he bent down, in a peaceful, leaf-eater motion, and said, \u201cI haven\u2019t been feeling well.\u201d\n\n\u201cWere you sick?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m better now.\u201d\n\nIn the living room Olivia called out, \u201cWho wants some Delamain? It\u2019s yummy!\u201d\n\n\u201cI want some,\u201d Brian Weeger said. \u201cThat stuff\u2019s killer.\u201d\n\nLeonard said, \u201cWere the dish towels all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dish towels. I bought you some dish towels.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, they\u2019re great,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cThey\u2019re perfect. We\u2019ll use them! Thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have brought wine, or scotch, but that\u2019s the kind of thing my father would do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to do anything your father would do?\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s face and voice remained solemn as he replied, \u201cMy father is a depressive who self-medicates with alcohol. My mother is more or less the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do they live?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re divorced. My mother still lives in Portland, where I\u2019m from. My dad\u2019s in Europe. He lives in Antwerp. Last time I heard.\u201d\n\nThis interchange was encouraging, in a way. Leonard was sharing personal information. On the other hand, the information indicated that he had a troubled relationship with his parents, who were themselves troubled, and Madeleine made a point of going out only with guys who liked their parents.\n\n\u201cWhat does your father do?\u201d Leonard asked.\n\nCaught off guard, Madeleine hesitated. \u201cHe used to work at a college,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s retired.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was he? Professor?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the president.\u201d\n\nLeonard\u2019s face twitched. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a small college. In New Jersey. It\u2019s called Baxter.\u201d\n\nAbby came in to get some glasses. Leonard helped her get them off the top shelf. When she was gone, he turned back to Madeleine and said, as if in pain, \u201cThere\u2019s a Fellini film playing at the Cable Car this weekend. Amarcord.\u201d\n\nMadeleine gazed encouragingly up at him. There were all kinds of outmoded, novelistic words to describe how she was feeling, words like aflutter. But she had her rules. One rule was that the guy had to ask her out, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s playing on Saturday,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cThis Saturday?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like Fellini?\u201d\n\nTo reply to this question did not, in Madeleine\u2019s view, compromise her rule.\n\n\u201cYou want to know something embarrassing?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a Fellini film.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should see one,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I have your number? Oh, right, I have it. It\u2019s the same as Abby\u2019s number.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want me to write it down?\u201d Madeleine asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Leonard said.\n\n\u201cI have it.\u201d\n\nAnd he rose, brontosaurus-like, to his place among the treetops.\n\nFor the rest of the week, Madeleine stayed in every night, waiting for Leonard to call. When she came back from classes in the afternoon she interrogated her roommates to find out if he had called while she was out.\n\n\u201cSome guy called yesterday,\u201d Olivia said, on Thursday. \u201cWhen I was in the shower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, I forgot.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it sound like Leonard?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t notice. I was dripping wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks for taking a message!\u201d\n\n\u201cSorree,\u201d Olivia said.\n\n\u201cGod. It was just a two-second call. He said he\u2019d call back later.\u201d\n\nAnd so now it was Friday night\u2014Friday night!\u2014and Madeleine had declined to go out with Abby and Olivia in order to stay in and wait by the phone. She was reading A Lover\u2019s Discourse and marveling at its relevance to her life.\n\n\n\nWaiting\nattente / waiting\nTumult of anxiety provoked by waiting for the loved being, subject to trivial delays (rendezvous, letters, telephone calls, returns).\n\u2026 Waiting is an enchantment: I have received orders not to move. Waiting for a telephone is thereby woven out of tiny, unavowable interdictions to infinity: I forbid myself to leave the room, to go to the toilet, even to telephone (to keep the line from being busy) \u2026\n\nShe could hear the television going in the apartment below. Madeleine\u2019s bedroom faced the State Capitol dome, brightly lit against the dark sky. The heat, which they couldn\u2019t control, was still on, the radiator wastefully knocking and hissing.\n\nThe more she thought about it, the more Madeleine understood that extreme solitude didn\u2019t just describe the way she was feeling about Leonard. It explained how she\u2019d always felt when she was in love. It explained what love was like and, just maybe, what was wrong with it.\n\nThe telephone rang.\n\nMadeleine sat up in bed. She dog-eared the page she was reading. She waited as long as she could (three rings) before answering.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaddy?\u201d\n\nIt was Alton, calling from Prettybrook.\n\n\u201cOh. Hi, Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t sound so excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m studying.\u201d\n\nIn his usual way, without niceties, he got to the matter at hand. \u201cYour mother and I were just discussing graduation plans.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, Madeleine thought Alton meant that they were discussing her future. But then she realized it was just logistics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s April,\u201d she said. \u201cGraduation\u2019s not until June.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy experience with college towns is that the hotels get booked up months in advance. So we have to decide what we\u2019re doing. Now, here are the options. Are you listening?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Madeleine said, and began, at that instant, to tune out. She stuck the spoon back into the peanut butter jar and brought it to her mouth, this time just licking it.\n\nIn the phone Alton\u2019s voice was saying,\n\n\u201cOption one: Your mother and I come up the night before the ceremony, stay in a hotel, and we see you for dinner the night of graduation. Option two: We come up the morning of the ceremony, have breakfast with you, and then leave after the ceremony. Both proposals are acceptable to us. It\u2019s your choice. But let me explain the pros and cons of each scenario.\u201d\n\nMadeleine was about to answer when Phyllida spoke up on another extension.\n\n\u201cHi, dear. I hope we didn\u2019t wake you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t wake her,\u201d Alton barked. \u201cEleven o\u2019clock\u2019s not late at college. Especially on a Friday night. Hey, what are you doing in on a Friday night? Got a pimple?\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Mummy,\u201d Madeleine said, ignoring him.\n\n\u201cMaddy, sweetie, we\u2019re redoing your bedroom and I wanted to ask you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re redoing my bedroom?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it needs freshening up. I\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMy room?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I was thinking about recarpeting it in green. You know, a good green.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d Madeleine cried.\n\n\u201cMaddy, we\u2019ve kept your room the way it is for four years now\u2014you\u2019d think it was a shrine! I\u2019d like to be able to use it as a guest room, occasionally, because of the en suite bathroom. You can still have it when you come home, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019ll always be your room.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about my wallpaper?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s old. It\u2019s peeling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change my wallpaper!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, all right. I\u2019ll leave the wallpaper alone. But the carpet\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d Alton said in a peremptory tone. \u201cThis call is about graduation. Phyl, you\u2019re hijacking my agenda. You two sort out the redecorating some other time. Now, Maddy, let me go over the pros and cons. When your cousin graduated from Williams, we all had dinner after the ceremony. And, if you\u2019ll remember, Doats complained the whole time that he was missing all the parties\u2014and he left halfway through the meal. Now, your mother and I are willing to stay the night\u2014or two nights\u2014if we\u2019re going to see you. But if you\u2019re going to be busy, maybe the breakfast option makes more sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cGraduation\u2019s two months away. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I told your father,\u201d Phyllida said.\n\nIt occurred to Madeleine that she was tying up the line.\n\n\u201cLet me think about it,\u201d she said abruptly. \u201cI have to go. I\u2019m studying.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to stay the night,\u201d Alton repeated, \u201cI\u2019d like to make reservations soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall me later. Let me think about it. Call me Sunday.\u201d\n\nAlton was still speaking when she hung up, so when the phone rang again, twenty seconds later,\n\nMadeleine picked up and said,\n\n\u201cDaddy, stop it. We don\u2019t have to decide tonight.\u201d\n\nThere was silence on the line. And then a male voice said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to call me Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, God. Leonard? Sorry! I thought you were my father. He\u2019s freaking out about graduation plans already.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was just having a little freak-out myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout calling you.\u201d\n\nThis was good. Madeleine ran a finger along her lower lip. She said, \u201cHave you calmed down or do you want to call back later?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m resting comfortably now, thank you.\u201d\n\nMadeleine waited for more. None came. \u201cAre you calling for a reason?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYes. That Fellini film? I was hoping you might, if you\u2019re not too, I know it\u2019s bad manners calling so late, but I was at the lab.\u201d\n\nLeonard did sound a little nervous. That wasn\u2019t good. Madeleine didn\u2019t like nervous guys. Nervous guys were nervous for a reason. Up until now Leonard had seemed more the tortured type than the nervous type. Tortured was better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that was a complete sentence,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhat did I leave out?\u201d Leonard asked.\n\n\u201cHow about, \u2018Would you like to come with me?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be happy to,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nMadeleine frowned into the receiver. She had a feeling that Leonard had set up this exchange, like a chess player thinking eight moves ahead. She was going to complain when Leonard said, \u201cSorry. Not funny.\u201d He comically cleared his throat. \u201cListen, would you like to go to the movies with me?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer right away. He deserved a little punishment. And so she put the screws to him\u2014for another three seconds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d\n\nAnd there it was already, that word. She wondered if Leonard had noticed. She wondered what it meant that she had noticed. It was just a word, after all. A way of speaking.\n\nThe next night, Saturday, the fickle weather turned cold again. Madeleine was chilled in her brown suede jacket as she walked to the restaurant where they\u2019d agreed to meet. Afterward, they made their way to the Cable Car and found a sagging couch among the other mismatched sofas and armchairs that furnished the art-house cinema.\n\nShe had a hard time following the movie. The narrative cues weren\u2019t as crisp as those of Hollywood, and the film had a dream-like quality, lush but discontinuous. The audience, being a college audience, laughed knowingly during the risqu\u00e9 European moments: when the huge-titted woman stuffed her huge tit into the young hero\u2019s mouth; or when the old man up in the tree cried out, \u201cI want a woman!\u201d Fellini\u2019s theme appeared to be the same as Roland Barthes\u2019\u2014love\u2014but here it was Italian and all about the body instead of French and all about the mind. She wondered if Leonard had known what Amarcord was going to be about. She wondered if it was his way of getting her in the mood. As it so happened, she was in the mood, but no thanks to the movie. The movie was pretty to look at but confused her and made her feel na\u00efve and suburban. It seemed both overly indulgent and overly male.\n\nAfter it was over, they made their way out onto South Main. They had no stated destination. Madeleine was pleased to realize that Leonard, though tall, wasn\u2019t too tall. If she wore heels, the top of her head came up higher than his shoulders, almost to his chin.\n\n\u201cWhat did you think?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell, at least now I know what Felliniesque is.\u201d\n\nThe downtown skyline was on their left, across the river, the spire of the Superman building visible against the unnaturally pink city sky. The streets were empty except for other people leaving the cinema.\n\n\u201cMy goal in life is to become an adjective,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cPeople would go around saying, \u2018That was so Bankheadian.\u2019 Or, \u2018A little too Bankheadian for my taste.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBankheadian has a ring,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than Bankheadesque.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr Bankheadish.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsh is terrible all around. There\u2019s Joycean, Shakespearean, Faulknerian. But ish? Who is there who\u2019s an ish?\u201d\n\n\u201cThomas Mannish?\u201d\n\n\u201cKafkaesque,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cPynchonesque! See, Pynchon\u2019s already an adjective. Gaddis. What would Gaddis be? Gaddisesque? Gaddisy?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really do it with Gaddis,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cTough luck for Gaddis. Do you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI read a little of The Recognitions,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\nThey turned up Planet Street, climbing the slope.\n\n\u201cBellovian,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cIt\u2019s extra nice when they change the spelling slightly. Nabokovian already has the v. So does Chekhovian. The Russians have it made. Tolstoyan! That guy was an adjective waiting to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget Tolstoyanism,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cMy God!\u201d Leonard said. \u201cA noun! I\u2019ve never even dreamed of being a noun.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would Bankheadian mean?\u201d\n\nLeonard thought for a second. \u201c\u2018Of or related to Leonard Bankhead (American, born 1959), characterized by excessive introspection or worry. Gloomy, depressive. See basket case.\u2019\u201d\n\nMadeleine was laughing. Leonard stopped walking and took hold of her arm, looking at her seriously.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking you to my place,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll this time we\u2019ve been walking? I\u2019ve been leading you back to my place. This is how I do it, apparently. It\u2019s shameful. Shameful. I don\u2019t want it to be like that. Not with you. So I\u2019m telling you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI figured we were going back to your place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going to call you on it. When we got closer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re already close.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t come up.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Not tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cHannaesque,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cStubborn. Given to ironclad positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHannarian,\u201d Madeleine said. \u201cDangerous. Not to be messed with.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stand warned.\u201d\n\nThey stood looking at each other on cold, dark Planet Street. Leonard took his hands out of his pockets to tuck his long hair behind his ears.\n\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll come up just for a minute,\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSpecial Days\u201d\nf\u00eate / festivity\nThe amorous subject experiences every meeting\nwith the loved being as a festival.\n1. The Festivity is what is waited for, what is expected. What I expect of the promised presence is an unheard-of totality of pleasures, a banquet; I rejoice like the child laughing at the sight of the mother whose mere presence heralds and signifies a plenitude of satisfactions: I am about to have before me, and for myself, the \u201csource of all good things.\u201d\n\u201cI am living through days as happy as those God keeps for his chosen people; and whatever becomes of me, I can never say that I have not tasted the purest joys of life.\u201d\n\nIt was debatable whether or not Madeleine had fallen in love with Leonard the first moment she\u2019d seen him. She hadn\u2019t even known him then, and so what she\u2019d felt was only sexual attraction, not love. Even after they\u2019d gone out for coffee, she couldn\u2019t say that what she was feeling was anything more than infatuation. But ever since the night when they went back to Leonard\u2019s place after watching Amarcordand started fooling around, when Madeleine found that instead of being turned off by physical stuff, the way she often was with boys, instead of putting up with that or trying to overlook it, she\u2019d spent the entire night worrying that she was turning Leonard off, worrying that her body wasn\u2019t good enough, or that her breath was bad from the Caesar salad she\u2019d unwisely ordered at dinner; worrying, too, about having suggested they order martinis because of the way Leonard had sarcastically said,\n\n\u201cSure. Martinis. We can pretend we\u2019re Salinger characters\u201d; after having had, as a consequence of all this anxiety, pretty much no sexual pleasure, despite the perfectly respectable session they\u2019d put together; and after Leonard (like every guy) had immediately fallen asleep, leaving her to lie awake stroking his head and vaguely hoping she didn\u2019t get a urinary tract infection, Madeleine asked herself if the fact that she\u2019d just spent the whole night worrying wasn\u2019t, in fact, a surefire sign that she was falling in love. And certainly after they\u2019d spent the next three days at Leonard\u2019s place having sex and eating pizza, after she\u2019d relaxed enough to be able to come at least once in a while and finally to stop worrying so much about having an orgasm because her hunger for Leonard was in some way satisfied by his satisfaction, after she\u2019d allowed herself to sit naked on his gross couch and to walk to the bathroom knowing he was staring at her (imperfect) ass, to root for food in his disgusting refrigerator, to read the brilliant half-page of philosophy paper sticking up out of his typewriter, and to hear him pee with taurine force into the toilet bowl, certainly, by the end of those three days, Madeleine knew she was in love.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t mean she had to tell anyone. Especially Leonard.\n\nLeonard Bankhead had a studio apartment on the third floor of a low-rent student building. The halls were full of bikes and junk mail. Stickers decorated the other tenants\u2019 doors: a fluorescent marijuana leaf, a silk-screen Blondie. Leonard\u2019s door, however, was as blank as the apartment inside. In the middle of the room, a twin mattress lay beside a plastic milk crate supporting a reading lamp. There was no desk, no bookcase, not even a table, only the nasty couch, with a typewriter on another milk crate in front of it. There was nothing on the walls but bits of masking tape and, in one corner, a small portrait of Leonard, done in pencil. The drawing showed Leonard as George Washington, wearing a tricorne hat and sheltering under a blanket at Valley Forge. The caption read:\n\n\u201cYou go. I like it here.\u201d\n\nMadeleine thought the handwriting looked feminine.\n\nA ficus tree endured in the corner. Leonard moved it into the sun whenever he remembered to. Madeleine, taking pity on the tree, began to water it, until she caught Leonard looking at her one day, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on. What?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re watering my tree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe soil\u2019s dry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking care of my tree.\u201d\n\nShe stopped doing it after that.\n\nThere was a tiny kitchen where Leonard brewed and reheated the gallon of coffee he drank every day. A big greasy wok sat on the stove. The most Leonard did in the way of preparing a meal, however, was to pour Grape Nuts into the wok. With raisins. Raisins satisfied his fruit requirement.\n\nThe apartment had a message. The message said: I am an orphan. Abby and Olivia asked Madeleine what she and Leonard did together and she never had an answer. They didn\u2019t do<!--?i--> anything. She came to his apartment and they lay down on the mattress and Leonard asked her how she was doing, really wanting to know.\n\nWhat did they do? She talked; he listened; then he talked and she listened. She\u2019d never met anyone, and certainly not a guy, who was so receptive, who took everything in. She guessed that Leonard\u2019s shrink-like manner came from years of seeing shrinks himself, and though another of her rules was to never date guys who went to shrinks, Madeleine began to reconsider this prohibition. Back home, she and her sister had a phrase for serious emotional talks. They called it \u201chaving a heavy.\u201d If a boy approached during one, the girls would look up and give warning:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re having a heavy.\u201d And the boy would retreat. Until it was over. Until the heavy had passed.\n\nGoing out with Leonard was like having a heavy all the time. Whenever she was with him, Leonard gave her his full attention. He didn\u2019t stare into her eyes or smother her the way Billy had, but he made it clear he was available. He offered little advice. Only listened, and murmured, reassuringly.\n\nPeople often fell in love with their shrinks, didn\u2019t they? That was called transference and was to be avoided. But what if you were already sleeping with your shrink? What if your shrink\u2019s couch was already a bed?\n\nAnd plus it wasn\u2019t all heavy, the heavies. Leonard was funny. He told hilarious stories in a deadpan voice. His head sank into his shoulders, his eyes filled with rue, as his sentences drawled on. \u201cDid I ever tell you I play an instrument? The summer my parents got divorced, they sent me to live with my grandparents in Buffalo. The people next door were Latvian, the Bruverises. And they both played the kokle.\n\nDo you know what a kokle is?\n\nIt\u2019s sort of like a zither, but Latvian.\n\n\u201cAnyway, I used to hear Mr. and Mrs. Bruveris playing their kokles over in the next yard. It was an amazing sound. Sort of wild and over-stimulated on the one hand, but melancholy on the other. The kokle is the manic-depressive of the string family. Anyway, I was bored to death that summer. I was sixteen. Six foot one. One hundred and thirty-eight pounds. A major reefer smoker. I used to get high in my bedroom and blow the smoke out the window, and then I\u2019d go out to the porch and listen to the Bruverises playing next door. Sometimes other people came over. Other kokle players. They set up lawn chairs in the backyard and they\u2019d all sit there playing together. It was an orchestra! A kokle orchestra. Then one day they saw me watching and invited me over. They gave me potato salad and a grape Popsicle and I asked Mr. Bruveris how you played a kokle and he started giving me lessons. I used to go over there every day. They had an old kokle they let me borrow. I used to practice five, six hours a day. I was into it.\n\n\u201cAt the end of that summer, when I had to leave, the Bruverises gave me the kokle. To keep. I took it on the plane with me. I got a separate seat for it, like I was Rostropovich. My father had moved out of the house by then. So it was just me, my sister, and my mother. And I kept on practicing. I got good enough that I joined this band. We used to play at ethnic festivals and Orthodox weddings. We had these traditional costumes, embroidered vests, puffy sleeves, knee-high boots. Me and all the adults. Most of them were Latvian, some Russians, too. Our big number was \u2018Otchi Tchornyia.\u2019 That\u2019s the only thing that saved me in high school. The kokle.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you still play?\u201d\n\n\u201cHell no. Are you kidding? The kokle?\u201d\n\nListening to Leonard, Madeleine felt impoverished by her happy childhood. She never wondered why she acted the way she did, or what effect her parents had had on her personality. Being fortunate had dulled her powers of observation. Whereas Leonard noticed every little thing. For instance, they spent a weekend on Cape Cod (partly to visit Pilgrim Lake Laboratory, where Leonard was applying for a research fellowship), and as they were driving back, Leonard said, \u201cWhat do you do? Just hold it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just hold it. For two days. Until you get back home.\u201d\n\nAs his meaning seeped in, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have never, ever, taken a dump in my presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your presence?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I am present. Or nearby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it? Nothing. If you\u2019re talking about I-sleep-over-and-go-off-to-class-the-next-morning and then you go and take a dump, that\u2019s understandable. But when we spend two, almost three days together, eating surf and turf, and you do not take a dump the entire time, I can only conclude that you are more than a little anal.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what? It\u2019s embarrassing!\u201d Madeleine said.\n\n\u201cO.K.? I find it embarrassing.\u201d\n\nLeonard stared at her without expression and said, \u201cDo you mind when I take a dump?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we have to talk about this? It\u2019s sort of gross.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we do need to talk about it. Because you\u2019re obviously not very relaxed around me, and I am\u2014or thought I was\u2014your boyfriend, and that means\u2014or should mean\u2014that I\u2019m the person you\u2019re most relaxed around. Leonard equals maximum relaxation.\u201d\n\nGuys weren\u2019t supposed to be the talkers. Guys weren\u2019t supposed to get you to open up. But this guy was; this guy did. He\u2019d said he was her \u201cboyfriend,\u201d too. He\u2019d made it official.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to be more relaxed,\u201d Madeleine said, \u201cif it\u2019ll make you happy. But in terms of\u2014excretion\u2014don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t for me,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cThis is for Mr. Lower Intestine. This is for Mr. Duodenum.\u201d\n\nEven though this kind of amateur therapy didn\u2019t exactly work (after that last conversation, for instance, Madeleine had more, not less, trouble going Number 2 if Leonard was within a mile), it affected Madeleine deeply. Leonard was examining her closely. She felt handled in the right way, like something precious or immensely fascinating. It made her happy to think about how much he thought about her.\n\nBy the end of April, Madeleine and Leonard had gotten into a routine of spending every night together. On weeknights, after Madeleine finished studying, she headed over to the biology lab, where she\u2019d find Leonard staring at slides with two Chinese grad students. After she finally got Leonard to leave the lab, Madeleine then had to cajole him into sleeping at her place. At first, Leonard had liked staying at the Narragansett. He liked the ornate moldings and the view from her bedroom. He charmed Olivia and Abby by making pancakes on Sunday mornings. But soon Leonard began to complain that they always stayed at Madeleine\u2019s place and that he never got to wake up in his own bed. Staying at Leonard\u2019s place, however, required Madeleine to bring a fresh set of clothes each night, and since he didn\u2019t like her to leave clothes at his place (and, to be honest, she didn\u2019t like to, either, because whatever she left picked up a fusty smell), Madeleine had to carry her dirty clothes around to classes all day. She preferred sleeping at her own apartment, where she could use her own shampoo, conditioner, and loofah, and where it was \u201cclean-sheet day\u201d every Wednesday. Leonard never changed his sheets. They were a disturbing gray color. Dust balls clung to the edges of the mattress. One morning, Madeleine was horrified to see a calligraphic smear of blood that had leaked from her three weeks earlier, a stain she\u2019d attacked with a kitchen sponge while Leonard was sleeping.\n\n\u201cYou never wash your sheets!\u201d she complained.\n\n\u201cI wash them,\u201d Leonard said evenly.\n\n\u201cHow often?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they get dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot everyone can drop off their laundry at the cleaners every week. Not everybody grew up with \u2018clean-sheet day.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to drop them off,\u201d Madeleine said, undeterred. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a washer in the basement.\u201d\n\n\u201cI use the washer,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cJust not every Wednesday. I don\u2019t equate dirt with death and decay.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, and I do? I\u2019m obsessed with death because I wash my sheets?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople\u2019s attitudes to cleanliness have a lot to do with their fear of death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t about death, Leonard. This is about crumbs in the bed. This is about the fact that your pillow smells like a liverwurst sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does!\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmell it, Leonard!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s salami. I don\u2019t like liverwurst.\u201d\n\nTo a certain extent, this kind of arguing was fun. But then came nights when Madeleine forgot to pack a change of clothes and Leonard accused her of doing this on purpose in order to force him to sleep at her place. Next, more worryingly, came nights when Leonard said he was going home to study and would see her tomorrow. He began pulling all-nighters. One of his philosophy professors offered Leonard the use of his cabin in the Berkshires and, for an entire rainy weekend, Leonard went there, alone, to write a paper on Fichte, returning with a typescript 123 pages long and wearing a bright orange hunter\u2019s vest. The vest became his favorite item of clothing. He wore it all the time.\n\nHe started finishing Madeleine\u2019s sentences. As if her mind was too slow. As if he couldn\u2019t wait for her to gather her thoughts. He riffed on the things she said, going off on strange tangents, making puns. Whenever she told him he needed to get some sleep, he got angry and didn\u2019t call her for days. And it was during this period that Madeleine fully understood how the lover\u2019s discourse was of an extreme solitude. The solitude was extreme because it wasn\u2019t physical. It was extreme because you felt it while in the company of the person you loved. It was extreme because it was in your head, that most solitary of places.\n\nThe more Leonard pulled away, the more anxious Madeleine became. The more desperate she became, the more Leonard pulled away. She told herself to act cool. She went to the library to work on her marriage-plot thesis, but the sex-fantasy atmosphere\u2014the reading-room eye contact, the beckoning stacks\u2014made her desperate to see Leonard. And so against her will her feet began leading her back across campus through the darkness to the biology department. Up to the last moment, Madeleine had the crazy hope that this expression of weakness might in fact be strength. It was a brilliant strategy because it lacked all strategy. It involved no games, only sincerity. Seeing such sincerity, how could Leonard fail to respond? She was almost happy as she came up behind the lab table and tapped Leonard on the shoulder, and her happiness lasted until he turned around with a look not of love but of annoyance.\n\nIt didn\u2019t help that it was spring. Every day, people seemed more and more unclothed. The magnolia trees, budding on the green, looked positively enflamed. They sent out a perfume that drifted through the windows of Semiotics 211. The magnolia trees hadn\u2019t read Roland Barthes. They didn\u2019t think love was a mental state; the magnolias insisted it was natural, perennial.\n\nOn a beautiful warm May day, Madeleine showered, shaved her legs with extra care, and put on her first spring dress: an apple-green baby-doll dress with a bib collar and a high hem. With this, she wore Buster Browns, cream and rust, and went sockless. Her bare legs, toned from a winter of squash-playing, were pale but smooth. She kept her glasses on, left her hair loose, and walked over to Leonard\u2019s apartment on Planet Street. On the way, she stopped at a market to buy a hunk of cheese, some Stoned Wheat Thins, and a bottle of Valpolicella. Coming down the hill from Benefit toward South Main, she felt the warm breeze between her thighs. The front door of Leonard\u2019s building was propped open with a brick, so she went up to his apartment and knocked. Leonard opened the door. He looked like he\u2019d been napping.\n\n\u201cNiiiiice dress,\u201d he said.\n\nThey never made it to the park. They picnicked on each other. As Leonard pulled her toward the mattress, Madeleine dropped her packages, hoping the wine bottle didn\u2019t break. She slipped her dress over her head. Soon they were naked, raiding, it felt like, a huge basket of goodies. Madeleine lay on her stomach, her side, her back, nibbling all the treats, the nice-smelling fruit candies, the meaty drumsticks, as well as more sophisticated offerings, the biscotti flavored with anise, the wrinkly truffles, the salty spoonfuls of olive tapenade. She\u2019d never been so busy in her life. At the same time, she felt strangely displaced, not quite her usual tidy ego but merged with Leonard into a great big protoplasmic, ecstatic thing. She thought she\u2019d been in love before. She knew she\u2019d had sex before. But all those torrid adolescent gropings, all those awkward backseat romps, the meaningful, performative summer nights with her high school boyfriend Jim McManus, even the tender sessions with Billy where he insisted they look into each other\u2019s eyes as they came\u2014none of that prepared her for the wallop, the all-consuming pleasure, of this.\n\nLeonard was kissing her. When she could bear no more, Madeleine grabbed him savagely by his ears. She pulled Leonard\u2019s head away and held it still to show him the evidence of how she felt (she was crying now). In a hoarse voice edged with something else, a sense of peril, Madeleine said, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\nLeonard stared back at her. His eyebrows twitched. Suddenly, he rolled sideways off the mattress. He stood up and walked, naked, across the room. Crouching, he reached into her bag and pulled out A Lover\u2019s Discourse, from the pocket where she always kept it. He flipped the pages until he found the one he wanted. Then he returned to the bed and handed the book to her.\n\nI Love You\nje-t\u2019aime / I-love-you\n\nAs she read these words, Madeleine was flooded with happiness. She glanced up at Leonard, smiling. With his finger he motioned for her to keep going. The figure refers not to the declaration of love, to the avowal, but to the repeated utterance of the love cry.<!--?i--> Suddenly Madeleine\u2019s happiness diminished, usurped by the feeling of peril. She wished she weren\u2019t naked. She narrowed her shoulders and covered herself with the bedsheet as she obediently read on.\n\nOnce the first avowal has been made, \u201cI love you\" has no meaning whatever \u2026\n\nLeonard, squatting, had a smirk on his face.\n\nIt was then that Madeleine threw the book at his head.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1643023", "artist_names": "Nat

You also have to understand how machines work and I'm good at understanding how machines work. You also have to be someone who would like being on their own in a tiny spacecraft thousands and thousands of miles away from the surface of the earth and not panic or get claustrophobia or homesick or insane. And I like really little spaces, so long as there is no one else in them with me. Sometimes when I want to be on my own I get into the airing cupboard outside the bathroom and slide in beside the boiler and pull the door closed behind me and sit there and think for hours and it makes me feel very calm.\n\nSo I would have to be an astronaut on my own, or have my own part of the spacecraft which no one else could come into. And also there are no yellow things or brown things in a spacecraft, so that would be OK, too. And I would have to talk to other people from Mission Control, but we would do that through a radio linkup and a TV monitor, so they wouldn't be like real people who are strangers, but it would be like playing a computer game.\n\nAlso I wouldn't be homesick at all because I'd be surrounded by lots of the things I like, which are machines and computers and outer space. And I would be able to look out of a little window in the spacecraft and know that there was no one else near me for thousands and thousands of miles, which is what I sometimes pretend at night in the summer when I go and lie on the lawn and look up at the sky and I put my hands round the sides of my face so that I can't see the fence and the chimney and the washing line and I can pretend I'm in space. And all I could see would be stars. And stars are the places where the molecules that life is made of were constructed billions of years ago. For example, all the iron in your blood which stops you from being anemic was made in a star.\n\nAnd I would like it if I could take Toby with me into space, and that might be allowed because they sometimes do take animals into space for experiments, so if I could think of a good experiment you could do with a rat that didn't hurt the rat, I could make them let me take Toby.\nBut if they didn't let me I would still go because it would be a Dream Come True.\n89\nThe next day at school I told Siobhan that Father had told me I couldn't do any more detecting, which meant that the book was finished. I showed her the pages I had written so far, with the diagram of the universe and the map of the street and the prime numbers. And she said that it didn't matter. She said the book was really good as it was and that I should be very proud of having written a book at all, even if it was quite short and there were some very good books which were very short like Heart of Darkness, which was by Conrad.\n\nBut I said that it wasn't a proper book because it didn't have a proper ending because I never found out who killed Wellington so the murderer was still At Large. And she said that was like life, and not all murders were solved and not all murderers were caught. Like Jack the Ripper.\nI said I didn't like the idea that the murderer was still At Large. I said I didn't like to think that the person who killed Wellington could be living somewhere nearby and I might meet him when I went out for a walk at night. And this was possible because a murder was usually committed\nby a person who was known to the victim. Then I said, \"Father said I was never to mention Mr. Shears's name in our house again and\nthat he was an evil man and maybe that meant he was the person who killed Wellington.\"\n\nAnd she said, \"Perhaps your father just doesn't like Mr. Shears very much.\"\nAnd I asked, \"Why?\"\nAnd she said, \"I don't know, Christopher. I don't know because I don't know anything about Mr. Shears.\"\nI said, \"Mr. Shears used to be married to Mrs. Shears and he left her, like in a divorce. But I don't know if they were actually divorced.\"\nAnd Siobhan said, \"Well, Mrs. Shears is a friend of yours, isn't she. A friend of you and your father. So perhaps your father doesn't like Mr. Shears because he left Mrs. Shears. Because he did something bad to someone who is a friend.\"\nAnd I said, \"But Father says Mrs. Shears isn't a friend of ours anymore.\"\nAnd Siobhan said, \"I'm sorry, Christopher. I wish I could answer all these questions, but I simply don't know.\"\nThen the bell went for the end of school.\nThe next day I saw 4 yellow cars in a row on the way to school, which made it a Black Day, so I didn't eat anything at lunch and I sat in the corner of the room all day and read my A-level maths course book. And the next day, too, I saw 4 yellow cars in a row on the way to school,\nwhich made it another Black Day too, so I didn't speak to anyone and for the whole afternoon I sat in the corner of the Library groaning with my head pressed into the join between the two walls and this made me feel calm and safe. But on the third day I kept my eyes closed all the way to school until we got off the bus because after I have had 2 Black Days in a row I'm allowed to do that.\n\n97\nBut it wasn't the end of the book because five days later I saw 5 red cars in a row, which made it a Super Good Day, and I knew that something special was going to happen. Nothing special happened at school so I knew something special was going to happen after school. And when I got home I went down to the shop at the end of our road to buy some licorice laces and a Milky Bar with my pocket money. And when I had bought my licorice laces and a Milky Bar I turned round and saw Mrs. Alexander, the old lady from number 39, who was in the shop as well. She wasn't wearing jeans now. She was wearing a dress like a normal old lady. And she smelled of cooking. She said, \"What happened to you the other day?\"\n\nI asked, \"Which day?\"\nAnd she said, \"I came out again and you'd gone. I had to eat all the biscuits myself.\"\nI said, \"I went away.\"\nAnd she said, \"I gathered that.\"\nI said, \"I thought you might ring the police.\"\nAnd she said, \"Why on earth would I do that?\"\nAnd I said, \"Because I was poking my nose into other people's business and Father said I shouldn't investigate who killed Wellington. And a policeman gave me a caution and if I get into trouble again it will be a lot worse because of the caution.\"\nThen the Indian lady behind the counter said to Mrs. Alexander, \"Can I help you?\" and Mrs. Alexander said she'd like a pint of milk and a packet of Jaffa cakes and I went out of the shop. When I was outside the shop I saw that Mrs. Alexander's dachshund was sitting on the pavement. It was wearing a little coat made out of tartan material, which is Scottish and check. She had tied its lead to the drainpipe next to the door. I like dogs, so I bent down and I said hello to her dog and it licked my hand. Its tongue was rough and wet and it liked the smell on my trousers and started sniffing them. Then Mrs. Alexander came outside and said, \"His name is Ivor.\"\n\nI didn't say anything.\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"You're very shy, aren't you, Christopher.\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm not allowed to talk to you.\"\nAnd she said, \"Don't worry. I'm not going to tell the police and I'm not going to tell your father, because there's nothing wrong with having a chat. Having a chat is just being friendly, isn't it.\"\nI said, \"I can't do chatting.\"\nThen she said, \"Do you like computers?\"\nAnd I said, \"Yes. I like computers. I have a computer at home in my bedroom.\"\nAnd she said, \"I know. I can see you sitting at your computer in your bedroom sometimes when I look across the street.\"\nThen she untied Ivor's lead from the drainpipe.\nI wasn't going to say anything because I didn't want to get into trouble. Then I thought that this was a Super Good Day and something special hadn't happened yet, so it was possible that talking to Mrs. Alexander was the special thing that was going to happen. And I thought that she might tell me something about Wellington or about Mr. Shears without me asking her, so that wouldn't be breaking my promise So I said, \"And I like maths and looking after Toby. And also I like outer space and I like being on my own.\"\n\nAnd she said, \"I bet you're very good at maths, aren't you.\"\nAnd I said, \"I am. I'm going to do my A-level maths next month. And I'm going to get an A grade.\"\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"Really? A-level maths?\"\nI replied, \"Yes. I don't tell lies.\"\nAnd she said, \"I apologize. I didn't mean to suggest that you were lying. I just wondered if I heard you correctly. I'm a little deaf sometimes.\"\nAnd I said, \"I remember. You told me.\" And then I said, \"I'm the first person to do an A level from my school because it's a special school.\"\nAnd she said, \"Well, I am very impressed. And I hope you do get an A.\"\nAnd I said, \"I will.\"\nThen she said, \"And the other thing I know about you is that your favorite color is not yellow.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"No. And it's not brown either. My favorite color is red. And metal color.\"\nThen Ivor did a poo and Mrs. Alexander picked it up with her hand inside a little plastic bag and then she turned the plastic bag inside out and tied a knot in the top so that the poo was all sealed up and she didn't touch the poo with her hands.\nAnd then I did some reasoning. I reasoned that Father had only made me do a promise about five things, which were\n1. Not to mention Mr. Shears's name in our house\n2. Not to go asking Mrs. Shears about who killed that bloody dog\n3. Not to go asking anyone about who killed that bloody dog\n4. Not to go trespassing in other people's gardens\n5. To stop this ridiculous bloody detective game\nAnd asking about Mr. Shears wasn't any of these things.\nAnd if you are a detective you have to Take Risks, and this was a Super Good Day, which meant it was a good day for Taking Risks, so I said, \"Do you know Mr. Shears?\" which was like chatting.\n\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"Not really, no. I mean, I knew him well enough to say hello and talk to a little in the street, but I didn't know much about him. I think he worked in a bank. The National Westminster. In town.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"Father says that he is an evil man. Do you know why he said that? Is Mr. Shears an evil man?\"\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"Why are you asking me about Mr. Shears, Christopher?\"\nI didn't say anything because I didn't want to be investigating Wellington's murder and that was the reason I was asking about Mr. Shears.\nBut Mrs. Alexander said, \"Is this about Wellington?\"\n\nAnd I nodded because that didn't count as being a detective.\nMrs. Alexander didn't say anything. She walked to the little red box on a pole next to the gate to the park and she put Ivor's poo into the box, which was a brown thing inside a red thing, which made my head feel funny so I didn't look. Then she walked back to me.\nShe sucked in a big breath and said, \"Perhaps it would be best not to talk about these things, Christopher.\"\nAnd I asked, \"Why not?\"\nAnd she said, \"Because.\" Then she stopped and decided to start saying a different sentence. \"Because maybe your father is right and you shouldn't go around asking questions about this.\"\nAnd I asked, \"Why?\"\n\nAnd she said, \"Because obviously he is going to find it quite upsetting.\"\nAnd I said, \"Why is he going to find it upsetting?\"\nThen she sucked in another big breath and said, \"Because. . . because I think you know why your father doesn't like Mr. Shears very much.\"\nThen I asked, \"Did Mr. Shears kill Mother?\"\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"Kill her?\"\nAnd I said, \"Yes. Did he kill Mother?\"\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"No. No. Of course he didn't kill your mother.\"\nAnd I said, \"But did he give her stress so that she died of a heart attack?\"\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"I honestly don't know what you're talking about, Christopher.\"\nAnd I said, \"Or did he hurt her so that she had to go into hospital?\"\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"Did she have to go into hospital?\"\nAnd I said, \"Yes. And it wasn't very serious at first, but she had a heart attack when she was in hospital.\"\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"Oh my goodness.\"\nI said, \"And she died.\"\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said \"Oh my goodness\" again, and then she said, \"Oh, Christopher, I am so, so sorry. I never realized.\"\nThen I asked her, \"Why did you say 'I think you know why your father doesn't like Mr. Shears very much'?\"\n\nMrs. Alexander put her hand over her mouth and said, \"Oh dear, dear, dear.\" But she didn't answer my question.\nSo I asked her the same question again, because in a murder mystery novel when someone doesn't want to answer a question it is because they are trying to keep a secret or trying to stop someone from getting into trouble, which means that the answers to those questions are the most important answers of all, and that is why the detective has to put that person under pressure.\n\nBut Mrs. Alexander still didn't answer. Instead she asked me a question. She said, \"So you don't know?\"\nAnd I said, \"Don't know what?\"\nShe replied, \"Christopher, look, I probably shouldn't be telling you this.\" Then she said, \"Perhaps we should take a little walk in the park together. This is not the place to be talking about this kind of thing.\"\n\nI was nervous. I did not know Mrs. Alexander. I knew that she was an old lady and that she liked dogs. But she was a stranger. And I never go into the park on my own because it is dangerous and people inject drugs behind the public toilets in the corner. I wanted to go home and go up to my room and feed Toby and practice some maths.\n\nBut I was excited, too. Because I thought she might tell me a secret. And the secret might be about who killed Wellington. Or about Mr. Shears. And if she did that I might have more evidence against him, or be able to Exclude Him from My Investigations. So because it was a Super Good Day I decided to walk into the park with Mrs. Alexander, even though it scared me. When we were inside the park Mrs. Alexander stopped walking and said, \"I am going to say something to you and you must promise not to tell your father that I told you this.\"\n\nI asked, \"Why?\"\nAnd she said, \"I shouldn't have said what I said. And if I don't explain, you'll carry on wondering what I meant. And you might ask your father. And I don't want you to do that because I don't want you to upset him. So I'm going to explain why I said what I said. But before I do that you have to promise not to tell anyone I said this to you.\"\n\nI asked, \"Why?\"\nAnd she said, \"Christopher, please, just trust me.\"\nAnd I said, \"I promise.\" Because if Mrs. Alexander told me who killed Wellington, or she told me that Mr. Shears had really killed Mother, I could still go to the police and tell them because you are allowed to break a promise if someone has committed a crime and you know about it.\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"Your mother, before she died, was very good friends with Mr. Shears.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"I know.\"\nAnd she said, \"No, Christopher. I'm not sure that you do. I mean that they were very good friends. Very, very good friends.\"\nI thought about this for a while and said, \"Do you mean that they were doing sex?\"\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"Yes, Christopher. That is what I mean.\"\nThen she didn't say anything for about 30 seconds. Then she said, \"I'm sorry, Christopher. I really didn't mean to say anything that was going to upset you. But I wanted to explain. Why I said what I said. You see, I thought you knew. That's why your father thinks that Mr. Shears is\nan evil man. And that will be why he doesn't want you going around talking to people about Mr. Shears. Because that will bring back bad memories.\"\nAnd I said, \"Was that why Mr. Shears left Mrs. Shears, because he was doing sex with someone else when he was married to Mrs. Shears?\"\nAnd Mrs. Alexander said, \"Yes, I expect so.\"\nThen she said, \"I'm sorry, Christopher. I really am.\"\nAnd I said, \"I think I should go now.\"\nAnd she said, \"Are you OK, Christopher?\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm scared of being in the park with you because you're a stranger.\"\nAnd she said, \"I'm not a stranger, Christopher, I'm a friend.\"\n\nAnd I said, \"I'm going to go home now.\"\nAnd she said, \"If you want to talk about this you can come and see me anytime you want.\nYou only have to knock on my door.\"\nAnd I said, \"OK.\"\nAnd she said, \"Christopher?\"\nAnd I said, \"What?\"\nAnd she said, \"You won't tell your father about this conversation, will you?\"\nAnd I said, \"No. I promised.\"\nAnd she said, \"You go on home. And remember what I said. Anytime.\"\nThen I went home.\n\n101\nMr. Jeavons said that I liked maths because it was safe. He said I liked maths because it meant solving problems, and these problems were difficult and interesting but there was always a straightforward answer at the end. And what he meant was that maths wasn't like life because\nin life there are no straightforward answers at the end. I know he meant this because this is what he said.\nThis is because Mr. Jeavons doesn't understand numbers.\n\nHere is a famous story called The Monty Hall Problem which I have included in this book because it illustrates what I mean.\nThere used to be a column called Ask Marilyn in a magazine called Parade in America. And this column was written by Marilyn vos Savant and in the magazine it said that she had the highest IQ in the world in the Guinness Book of World Records Hall of Fame. And in the column she answered maths questions sent in by readers. And in September 1990 this question was sent in by Craig F. Whitaker of Columbia, Maryland (but it is not what is called a direct quote because I have made it simpler and easier to understand)\n\nYou are on a game show on television. On this game show the idea is to win a car as a prize. The game show host shows you three doors. He says that there is a car behind one of the doors and there are goats behind the other two doors. He asks you to pick a door. You pick a door but the door is not opened. Then the game show host opens one of the doors you didn't pick to show a goat (because he knows what is behind the doors). Then he says that you have one final chance to change your mind before the doors are opened and you get a car or a goat. So he asks you if you want to change your mind and pick the other unopened door instead. What should you do?\n\nMarilyn vos Savant said that you should always change and pick the final door because the chances are 2 in 3 that there will be a car behind that door. But if you use your intuition you think that chance is 50-50 because you think there is an equal chance that the car is behind any door. Lots of people wrote to the magazine to say that Marilyn vos Savant was wrong, even when she explained very carefully why she was right. Of the letters she got about the problem, 92% said that she was wrong and lots of these were from mathematicians and scientists. Here are\nsome of the things that they said\n\nI'm very concerned with the general public's lack of mathematical skills. Please help by confessing your error.\n-- Robert Sachs, Ph.D., George Mason University\n\nThere is enough mathematical illiteracy in this country, and we don't need the world's highest IQ propagating more. Shame!\n-- Scott Smith, Ph.D., University of Florida\n\nI am in shock that after being corrected by at least three mathematicians, you still do not see your mistake.\n-- Kent Ford, Dickinson State University\n\nI am sure you will receive many letters from high school and college students. Perhaps you should keep a few addresses for help with future columns.\n-- W. Robert Smith, Ph.D., Georgia State University\n\nYou are utterly incorrect... How many irate mathematicians are needed to get you to change your mind?\n-- E. Ray Bobo, Ph.D., Georgetown University\n\nIf all those Ph.D.'s were wrong, the country would be in very serious trouble.\n-- Everett Harman, Ph.D., U.S. Army Research Institute\n\nBut Marilyn vos Savant was right. And here are 2 ways you can show this.\nFirstly you can do it by maths like this\n\nLet the doors be called X, Y and Z.\nLet Cx be the event that the car is behind door X and so on.\nLet Hx be the event that the host opens door X and so on.\nSupposing that you choose door X, the possibility that you win a car if you then\nswitch your choice is given by the following formula\nP(Hz ^ Cy) + P(Hy ^ Cz)\n= P(Cy)\u00b7P (Hz \u00a6 Cy) + P(Cz)\u00b7P(Hy \u00a6 Cz)\n= (1/3 \u00b7 1) + (1/3 \u00b7 1) = 2/3\n\nSo if you change, 2 times out of 3 you get a car. And if you stick, you only get a car 1 time out of 3.\nAnd this shows that intuition can sometimes get things wrong. And intuition is what people use in life to make decisions. But logic can help you work out the right answer. It also shows that Mr. Jeavons was wrong and numbers are sometimes very complicated and not very straightforward at all. And that is why I like The Monty Hall Problem.\n\n103\nWhen I got home Rhodri was there. Rhodri is the man who works for Father, helping him do heating maintenance and boiler repair. And he sometimes comes round to the house in the evening to drink beer with Father and watch the television and have a conversation. Rhodri was wearing a pair of white dungarees which had dirty marks all over them and he had a gold ring on the middle finger of his left hand and he smelled of something I do not know the name of which Father often smells of when he comes home from work. I put my licorice laces and my Milky Bar in my special food box on the shelf, which Father is not allowed to touch because it is mine.\n\nThen Father said, \"And what have you been up to, young man?\"\nAnd I said, \"I went to the shop to get some licorice laces and a Milky Bar.\"\nAnd he said, \"You were a long time.\"\nAnd I said, \"I talked to Mrs. Alexander's dog outside the shop. And I stroked him and he sniffed my trousers.\" Which was another white lie.\nThen Rhodri said to me, \"God, you do get the third degree, don't you.\"\n\nBut I didn't know what the third degree was.\nAnd he said, \"So, how are you doing, captain?\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm doing very well, thank you,\" which is what you're meant to say.\nAnd he said, \"What's 251 times 864?\"\nAnd I thought about this and I said,\"216,864.\" Because it was a really easy sum because you just multiply 864 X 1,000,which is 864,000. Then you divide it by 4, which is 216,000, and that's 250 X 864. Then you just add another 864 onto it to get 251 X 864. And that's 216,864.\nAnd I said, \"Is that right?\"\nAnd Rhodri said, \"I haven't got a bloody clue,\" and he laughed.\nI don't like it when Rhodri laughs at me. Rhodri laughs at me a lot. Father says it is being friendly.\nThen Father said, \"I'll stick one of those Gobi Aloo Sag things in the oven for you, OK?\"\nThis is because I like Indian food because it has a strong taste. But Gobi Aloo Sag is yellow, so I put red food coloring into it before I eat it. And I keep a little plastic bottle of this in my special food box.\nAnd I said, \"OK.\"\nAnd Rhodri said, \"So, it looks like Parky stitched them up, then?\" But this was to Father, not to me.\nAnd Father said, \"Well, those circuit boards looked like they'd come out of the bloody ark.\"\nAnd Rhodri said, \"You going to tell them?\"\nAnd Father said, \"What's the point? They're hardly going to take him to court, are they?\"\n\nAnd Rhodri said, \"That'll be the day.\"\nAnd Father said, \"Best to let sleeping dogs lie, I reckon.\"\nThen I went into the garden.\nSiobhan said that when you are writing a book you have to include some descriptions of things. I said that I could take photographs and put them in the book. But she said the idea of a book was to describe things using words so that people could read them and make a picture in\ntheir own head. And she said it was best to describe things that were interesting or different. She also said that I should describe people in the story by mentioning one or two details about them so that people could make a picture of them in their head. Which is why I wrote about Mr. Jeavons's shoes with all the holes in them and the policeman who looked as if he had two mice in his nose and the thing Rhodri smelled of but I didn't know the name for. So I decided to do a description of the garden. But the garden wasn't very interesting or different. It was just a garden, with grass and a shed and a clothesline. But the sky was interesting and different because usually skies look boring because they are all blue or all gray or all covered in one pattern of clouds and they don't look like they are hundreds of miles above your head. They look like someone might have painted them on a big roof. But this sky had lots of different types of clouds in it at different heights, so you could see how big it was and this made it look enormous. Furthest away in the sky were lots of little white clouds which looked like fish scales or sand\ndunes which had a very regular pattern. Then next furthest away and to the west were some big clouds which were colored slightly orange because it was nearly evening and the sun was going down. Then closest to the ground was a huge cloud which was colored gray because it was a rain\ncloud. And it was a big pointy shape and it looked like this.\n\nAnd when I looked at it for a long time I could see it moving very slowly and it was like an alien spaceship hundreds of kilometers long, like in Dune or Blake's 7 or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, except that it wasn't made of solid material, it was made of droplets of condensed water vapor, which is what clouds are made of. And it could have been an alien spaceship. People think that alien spaceships would be solid and made of metal and have lights all over them and move slowly through the sky because that is how we would build a spaceship if we were able to build one that big. But aliens, if they exist, would probably be very different from us. They might look like big slugs, or be flat like reflections. Or they might be bigger than planets. Or they might not have bodies at all. They might just be information, like in a computer.\nAnd their spaceships might look like clouds, or be made up of unconnected objects like dust or leaves.\n\nThen I listened to the sounds in the garden and I could hear a bird singing and I could hear traffic noise which was like the surf on a beach and I could hear someone playing music somewhere and children shouting. And in between these noises, if I listened very carefully and stood completely still, I could hear a tiny whining noise inside my ears and the air going in and out of my nose.\n\nThen I sniffed the air to see if I could see what the air in the garden smelled like. But I couldn't smell anything. It smelled of nothing. And this was interesting, too. Then I went inside and fed Toby.\n\n107\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles is my favorite book.\nIn The Hound of the Baskervilles, Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Watson get a visit from James Mortimer, who is a doctor from the moors in Devon. James Mortimer's friend, Sir Charles Baskerville, has died of a heart attack and James Mortimer thinks that he might have been scared to death. James Mortimer also has an ancient scroll which describes the curse of the Baskervilles.\n\nOn this scroll it says that Sir Charles Baskerville had an ancestor called Sir Hugo Baskerville, who was a wild, profane and godless man. And he tried to do sex with a daughter of a yeoman, but she escaped and he chased her across the moor. And his friends, who were daredevil roisterers, chased after him. And when they found him, the daughter of the yeoman had died of exhaustion and fatigue. And they saw a great black beast, shaped like a hound yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested on, and this hound was tearing the throat out of Sir Hugo Baskerville. And one of the friends died of fear that very night and the other two were broken men for the rest of their days.\nJames Mortimer thinks that the Hound of the Baskervilles might have scared Sir Charles to death and he is worried that his son and heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, will be in danger when he goes to the hall in Devon.\n\nSo Sherlock Holmes sends Doctor Watson to Devon with Sir Henry Baskerville and James Mortimer. And Doctor Watson tries to work out who might have killed Sir Charles Baskerville. And Sherlock Holmes says he will stay in London, but he travels to Devon secretly and does investigations of his own. And Sherlock Holmes finds out that Sir Charles was killed by a neighbor called Stapleton who is a butterfly collector and a distant relation of the Baskervilles. And Stapleton is poor, so he tries to kill Sir Henry Baskerville so that he will inherit the hall. In order to do this he has brought a huge dog from London and covered it in phosphorus to make it glow in the dark, and it was this dog which scared Sir Charles Baskerville to death. And Sherlock Holmes and Watson and Lestrade from Scotland Yard catch him. And Sherlock Holmes and Watson shoot the dog, which is one of the dogs which gets killed in the story, which is not nice because it is not the dog's fault. And Stapleton escapes into the Grimpen Mire, which is part of the moor, and he dies because he is sucked into a bog.\n\nThere are some bits of the story I don't like. One bit is the ancient scroll because it is written in old language which is difficult to understand, like this Learn then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not again be loosed to our undoing.\n\nAnd sometimes Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (who is the author) describes people like this There was something subtly wrong with the face, some coarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps of eye, some looseness of lip which marred its perfect beauty. And I don't know what some hardness, perhaps of eye means, and I'm not interested in faces.\n\nBut sometimes it is fun not knowing what the words mean because you can look them up in a dictionary, like goyal (which is a deep dip) or tors (which are hills or rocky heights). I like The Hound of the Baskervilles because it is a detective story, which means that\nthere are clues and Red Herrings. These are some of the clues\n\n1. Two of Sir Henry Baskerville's boots go missing when he is staying at a hotel in London. This means that someone wants to give them to the Hound of the Baskervilles to smell, like a bloodhound, so that it can chase him. This means that the Hound of the Baskervilles is not a\nsupernatural being but a real dog.\n\n2. Stapleton is the only person who knows how to get through the Grimpen Mire and he tells Watson to stay out of it for his own safety. This means that he is hiding something in the middle of the Grimpen Mire and doesn't want anyone else to find it.\n\n3. Mrs. Stapleton tells Doctor Watson to \"go straight back to London instantly.\" This is because she thinks Doctor Watson is Sir Henry Baskerville and she knows that her husband wants to kill him.\n\nAnd these are some of the Red Herrings\n1. Sherlock Holmes and Watson are followed when they are in London by a man in a coach with a black beard. This makes you think that the man is Barrymore, who is the caretaker at Baskerville Hall, because he is the only other person who has a black beard. But the man is really Stapleton, who is wearing a false beard.\n\n2. Selden, the Netting Hill murderer. This is a man who has escaped from a prison nearby and is being hunted down on the moors, which makes you think that he has something to do with the story, because he is a criminal, but he hasn't anything to do with the story at all.\n\n3. The Man on the Tor. This is a silhouette of a man that Doctor Watson sees on the moor at night and doesn't recognize, which makes you think it is the murderer. But it is Sherlock Holmes who has come to Devon secretly. I also like The Hound of the Baskervilles because I like Sherlock Holmes and I think that if I were a proper detective he is the kind of detective I would be. He is very intelligent and he solves the mystery and he says The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes.\n\nBut he notices them, like I do. Also it says in the book Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching his mind at will. And this is like me, too, because if I get really interested in something, like practicing maths, or reading a book about the Apollo missions or great white sharks, I don't notice anything else and Father can be calling me to come and eat my supper and I won't hear him. And this is why I am very good at playing chess, because I detach my mind at will and concentrate on the board and after a while the person I am playing will stop concentrating and start scratching their nose, or staring out of the window, and then they will make a mistake and I will win.\nAlso Doctor Watson says about Sherlock Holmes His mind... was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which all these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted. And that is what I am trying to do by writing this book.\n\nAlso Sherlock Holmes doesn't believe in the supernatural, which is God and fairy tales and Hounds of Hell and curses, which are stupid things.\nAnd I am going to finish this chapter with two interesting facts about Sherlock Holmes\n\n1. In the original Sherlock Holmes stories Sherlock Holmes is never described as wearing a deerstalker hat, which is what he is always wearing in pictures and cartoons. The deerstalker hat was invented by a man called Sidney Paget, who did the illustrations for the original books.\n\n2. In the original Sherlock Holmes stories Sherlock Holmes never says \"Elementary, my dear Watson.\" He only ever says this in films and on the television.\n\n109\nThat night I wrote some more of my book, and the next morning I took it into school so that Siobhan could read it and tell me if I had made mistakes with the spelling and the grammar. Siobhan read the book during morning break when she has a cup of coffee and sits at the edge of the playground with the other teachers. And after morning break she came and sat down next to me and said she had read the bit about my conversation with Mrs. Alexander and she said, \"Have you told your father about this?\"\n\nAnd I replied, \"No.\"\nAnd she said, \"Are you going to tell your father about this?\"\nAnd I replied, \"No.\"\nAnd she said, \"Good. I think that's a good idea, Christopher.\" And then she said, \"Did it make you sad to find this out?\"\nAnd I asked, \"Find what out?\"\nAnd she said, \"Did it make you upset to find out that your mother and Mr. Shears had an affair?\"\nAnd I said, \"No.\"\nAnd she said, \"Are you telling the truth, Christopher?\"\nAnd then I said, \"I always tell the truth.\"\n\nAnd she said, \"I know you do, Christopher. But sometimes we get sad about things and we don't like to tell other people that we are sad about them. We like to keep it a secret. Or sometimes we are sad but we don't really know we are sad. So we say we aren't sad. But really we are.\"\nAnd I said, \"I'm not sad.\"\nAnd she said, \"If you do start to feel sad about this, I want you to know that you can come and talk to me about it. Because I think talking to me will help you feel less sad. And if you don't feel sad but you just want to talk to me about it, that would be OK, too. Do you understand?\"\nAnd I said, \"I understand.\"\nAnd she said, \"Good.\"\n\nAnd I replied, \"But I don't feel sad about it. Because Mother is dead. And because Mr. Shears isn't around anymore. So I would be feeling sad about something that isn't real and doesn't exist. And that would be stupid.\"\nAnd then I practiced maths for the rest of the morning and at lunch I didn't have the quiche because it was yellow, but I did have the carrots and the peas and lots of tomato ketchup. And for afters I had some blackberry and apple crumble, but not the crumble bit because that was yellow, too, and I got Mrs. Davis to take the crumble bit off before she put it onto my plate because it doesn't matter if different sorts of food are touching before they are actually on your plate.\nThen, after lunch, I spent the afternoon doing art with Mrs. Peters and I painted some pictures of aliens which looked like this.\n\n113\n\nMy memory is like a film. That is why I am really good at remembering things, like the conversations I have written down in this book, and what people were wearing, and what they smelled like, because my memory has a smelltrack which is like a soundtrack. And when people ask me to remember something I can simply press Rewind and Fast Forward and Pause like on a video recorder, but more like a DVD player because I don't have to Rewind through everything in between to get to a memory of something a long time ago. And there are no buttons, either, because it is happening in my head. If someone says to me, \"Christopher, tell me what your mother was like,\" I can Rewind to lots of different scenes and say what she was like in those scenes. For example, I could Rewind to 4 July 1992 when I was 9 years old, which was a Saturday, and we were on holiday in Cornwall and in the afternoon we were on the beach in a place called Polperro. And Mother was wearing a pair of shorts made out of denim and a light blue bikini top and she was smoking cigarettes called Consulate which were mint flavor. And she wasn't swimming. Mother was sunbathing on a towel which had red and purple stripes and she was reading a book by Georgette Heyer called The Masqueraders. And then she finished sunbathing and went into the water to swim and she said, \"Bloody Nora, it's cold.\" And she said I should come and swim, too, but I don't like swimming because I don't like taking my clothes off. And she said I should just roll up my trousers and walk into the water a little way, so I did. And I stood in the water. And Mother said, \"Look. It's lovely.\" And she jumped backward and disappeared under the water and I thought a shark had eaten her and I screamed and she stood up out of the water again and came over to where I was standing and held up her right\nhand and spread her fingers out in a fan and said, \"Come on, Christopher, touch my hand. Come on now. Stop screaming. Touch my hand. Listen to me, Christopher. You can do it.\"\n\nAnd after a while I stopped screaming and I held up my left hand and spread my fingers out in a fan and we made our fingers and thumbs touch each other and Mother said, \"It's OK, Christopher. It's OK. There aren't any sharks in Cornwall,\" and then I felt better. Except I can't remember anything before I was about 4 because I wasn't looking at things in the right way before then, so they didn't get recorded properly.\nAnd this is how I recognize someone if I don't know who they are. I see what they are wearing, or if they have a walking stick, or funny hair, or a certain type of glasses, or they have a particular way of moving their arms, and I do a Search through my memories to see if I have met them before.\n\nAnd this is also how I know how to act in difficult situations when I don't know what to do. For example, if people say things which don't make sense, like, \"See you later, alligator,\" or \"You'll catch your death in that,\" I do a Search and see if I have ever heard someone say this\nbefore. And if someone is lying on the floor at school, I do a Search through my memory to find a picture of someone having an epileptic fit and then I compare the picture with what is happening in front of me so I can decide whether they are just lying down and playing a game, or having a sleep, or whether they are having an epileptic fit. And if they are having an epileptic fit, I move any furniture out of the way to stop them from banging their head and I take my jumper off and I put it underneath their head and I go and find a teacher.\n\nOther people have pictures in their heads, too. But they are different because the pictures in my head are all pictures of things which really happened. But other people have pictures in their heads of things which aren't real and didn't happen. For example, sometimes Mother used to say, \"If I hadn't married your father I think I'd be living in a little farmhouse in the south of France with someone called Jean. And he'd be, ooh, a local handyman. You know, doing painting and decorating for people, gardening, building fences. And we'd have a veranda with figs growing over it and there would be a field of sunflowers at the bottom of the garden and a little town on the hill in the distance and we'd sit outside in the evening and drink red wine and smoke Gauloises cigarettes and watch the sun go down.\"\n\nAnd Siobhan once said that when she felt depressed or sad she would close her eyes and she would imagine that she was staying in a house on Cape Cod with her friend Elly, and they would take a trip on a boat from Provincetown and go out into the bay to watch the humpback whales and that made her feel calm and peaceful and happy. And sometimes, when someone has died, like Mother died, people say, \"What would you want to say to your mother if she was here now?\" or \"What would your mother think about that?\" which is stupid because Mother is dead and you can't say anything to people who are dead and dead people can't think.\n\nAnd Grandmother has pictures in her head, too, but her pictures are all confused, like someone has muddled the film up and she can't tell what happened in what order, so she thinks that dead people are still alive and she doesn't know whether something happened in real life or whether it happened on television.\n\n127\n\nWhen I got home from school Father was still out at work, so I unlocked the front door and went inside and took my coat off. I went into the kitchen and put my things on the table. And one of the things was this book which I had taken into school to show to Siobhan. I made myself\na raspberry milk shake and heated it up in the microwave and then went through to the living room to watch one of my Blue Planet videos about life in the deepest parts of the ocean. The video was about the sea creatures who live around sulfur chimneys, which are underwater volcanoes where gases are ejected from the earth's crust into the water. Scientists never expected there to be any living organisms there because it was so hot and so poisonous, but there are whole ecosystems there.\n\nI like this bit because it shows you that there is always something new that science can discover, and all the facts that you take for granted can be completely wrong. And also I like the fact that they are filming in a place which is harder to get to than the top of Mount Everest but is only a few miles away from sea level. And it is one of the quietest and darkest and most secret places on the surface of the earth. And I like imagining that I am there sometimes, in a spherical metal submersible with windows that are 50 cm thick to stop them from imploding under the pressure. And I imagine that I am the only person inside it, and that it is not connected to a ship at all but can operate under its own power and I can control the motors and move anywhere I want to on the seabed and I can never be found.\n\nFather came home at 5:48 p.m. I heard him come through the front door. Then he came into the living room. He was wearing a lime green and sky blue check shirt and there was a double knot on one of his shoes but not on the other. He was carrying an old advert for Fussell's Milk Powder which was made of metal and painted with blue and white enamel and covered with little circles of rust which were like bullet holes, but he didn't explain why he was carrying this.\n\nHe said, \"Howdy, pardner,\" which is a joke he does.\nAnd I said, \"Hello.\"\nI carried on watching the video and Father went into the kitchen.\nI had forgotten that I had left my book lying on the kitchen table because I was too interested in the Blue Planet video. This is what is called Relaxing Your Guard, and it is what you must never do if you are a detective.\n\nIt was 5:54 p.m. when Father came back into the living room. He said, \"What is this?\" but he said it very quietly and I didn't realize that he was angry because he wasn't shouting.\nHe was holding the book in his right hand.\nI said, \"It's a book I'm writing.\"\n\nAnd he said, \"Is this true? Did you talk to Mrs. Alexander?\" He said this very quietly as well, so I still didn't realize that he was angry.\nAnd I said, \"Yes.\"\nThen he said, \"Holy fucking Jesus, Christopher. How stupid are you?\" This is what Siobhan says is called a rhetorical question. It has a question mark at the end, but you are not meant to answer it because the person who is asking it already knows the answer. It is difficult to spot a rhetorical question. Then Father said, \"What the fuck did I tell you, Christopher?\" This was much louder. And I replied, \"Not to mention Mr. Shears's name in our house. And not to go asking Mrs. Shears, or anyone, about who killed that bloody dog. And not to go trespassing in other people's gardens. And to stop this ridiculous bloody detective game. Except I haven't done any of those things. I just asked Mrs. Alexander about Mr. Shears because -- \" But Father interrupted me and said, \"Don't give me that bollocks, you little shit. You knew exactly what you were bloody doing. I've read the book, remember.\" And when he said this he held up the book and shook it. \"What else did I say, Christopher?\"\n\nI thought that this might be another rhetorical question, but I wasn't sure. I found it hard to work out what to say because I was starting to get scared and confused. Then Father repeated the question, \"What else did I say, Christopher?\"\nI said, \"I don't know.\"\nAnd he said, \"Come on. You're the fucking memory man.\"\nBut I couldn't think.\nAnd Father said, \"Not to go around sticking your fucking nose into other people's business.\nAnd what do you do? You go around sticking your nose into other people's business. You go around raking up the past and sharing it with every Tom, Dick and Harry you bump into. What am I going to do with you, Christopher? What the fuck am I going to do with you?\"\n\nI said, \"I was just doing chatting with Mrs. Alexander. I wasn't doing investigating.\"\nAnd he said, \"I ask you to do one thing for me, Christopher. One thing.\"\nAnd I said, \"I didn't want to talk to Mrs. Alexander. It was Mrs. Alexander who --\"\nBut Father interrupted me and grabbed hold of my arm really hard.\nFather had never grabbed hold of me like that before. Mother had hit me sometimes because she was a very hot-tempered person, which means that she got angry more quickly than other people and she shouted more often. But Father was a more levelheaded person, which means he didn't get angry as quickly and he didn't shout as often. So I was very surprised when he grabbed me.\n\nI don't like it when people grab me. And I don't like being surprised either. So I hit him, like I hit the policeman when he took hold of my arms and lifted me onto my feet. But Father didn't let go, and he was shouting. And I hit him again. And then I didn't know what I was doing anymore.\n\nI had no memories for a short while. I know it was a short while because I checked my watch afterward. It was like someone had switched me off and then switched me on again. And when they switched me on again I was sitting on the carpet with my back against the wall and there was blood on my right hand and the side of my head was hurting. And Father was standing on the carpet a meter in front of me looking down at me and he was still holding my book in his right hand, but it was bent in half and all the corners were messed up, and there was a scratch on his neck and a big rip in the sleeve of his green and blue check shirt and he was breathing really deeply.\n\nAfter about a minute he turned and walked through to the kitchen. Then he unlocked the back door into the garden and went outside. I heard him lift the lid of the dustbin and drop something into it and put the lid of the dustbin back on. Then he came into the kitchen again, but he wasn't carrying the book anymore. Then he locked the back door again and put the key into the little china jug that is shaped like a fat nun and he stood in the middle of the kitchen and closed his eyes.\n\nThen he opened his eyes and he said, \"I need a fucking drink.\"\nAnd he got himself a can of beer.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/427169", "artist_names": "James Brown & The Famous Flames", "full_title": "Baby, You're Right by\u00a0James\u00a0Brown & The Famous Flames", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c214827cbe638b65bb912f2330dc08b8.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c214827cbe638b65bb912f2330dc08b8.700x700x1.jpg", "id": 427169, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 3492882, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1668055956, "path": "/James-brown-and-the-famous-flames-baby-youre-right-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-brown-and-the-famous-flames-baby-youre-right-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1960, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1960", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1960", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c214827cbe638b65bb912f2330dc08b8.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c214827cbe638b65bb912f2330dc08b8.700x700x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Baby, You\u2019re Right", "title_with_featured": "Baby, You're Right", "updated_by_human_at": 1668055956, "url": "https://genius.com/James-brown-and-the-famous-flames-baby-youre-right-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/344510", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cc75fa8755675c074f139faccd4d7359.330x265x1.jpg", "id": 344510, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cc75fa8755675c074f139faccd4d7359.330x265x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Brown & The Famous Flames", "slug": "James-brown-and-the-famous-flames", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-brown-and-the-famous-flames"}, "artist": "James Brown & The Famous Flames", "lyrics": "Baby, You\u2019re Right LyricsIf you think I love you\nWell, baby, you're right\nIf you think I wanna hug you\nWell, baby, you're right\nI wanna love you\nI wanna hug you\nBecause I, yeah\nI need you so bad, yeah\nSo come on, just me and you\n\nI wanna love you\nI wanna hug you\nBecause I need you so bad\nWhen I cannot get you\nIt makes me so mad\nIf you think I want you\nWell, baby, you're right\nIf you think I wanna haunt you\nWell, baby, you're right\n\nI want to love you\nI want to hug you\nBecause I, yeah\nJust me and you\nAnd everything gonna be alright\nYeah\n\nI want to love you\nI want to hug you\nBecause I'm so bad\nWhen I cannot get you\nIt makes me so mad\n\nMmm, yeah\nEverybody got the blues, yeah\nJust me and you, baby\nI believe everything will be alright\nOne more time, yeah\n\nI want to love you\nI want to hug you\nBecause I need you so bad\nWhen I can't get you\nIt makes me so mad, yeah\nYou might also likeWhoa, yeah\nCome on!\nOh yeah!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 5, "api_path": "/songs/1969372", "artist_names": "Andy stewart", "full_title": "Donald Where\u2019s Your Troosers?

Scene 1 LyricsBanquet halls are a very special place, where under one big roof so many different memories are made. From proms to weddings to baby showers, once that DJ starts to spin, there's something about that cavernous echo that begs to be filled with sing-along dance tunes. Top 40 hits come and go, and no doubt there will be plenty of those contemporary tunes throughout the evening, but there are few songs that are as fun now as they were the first time. Not only do they never go out of style, they are essential components of the perfect hoe-down in all banquet halls.\n\n1. The Chicken Dance\nThis song is a great opener to get the crowd going. Even the stiffest old timers can't help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on. And what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks? This is a great song for a country-themed wedding.\n\n2. Macarena, by Los Dos Rios\nA major craze when first released in 1995, the Macarena will keep the energy up, up, up. The simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination, and the Latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat.\n\n3. Dancing Queen, by ABBA\nLight-hearted and bubbly, Dancing Queen is a must-have for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young. Dancing Queen was written for the royal Swedish wedding in 1976, but its candy-sweet ebullience is as fresh as ever. This song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the U.S.\n4. My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion\nThe words are simple, the feeling is big. Lost love is in the air, and nobody ever said it better than Celine. Play this song later in the night, after a few glasses of wine have everyone misty-eyed and ready to belt out, \"My heart will go on and OOOOOOON!\" with Celine.\n\n5. Don't Stop Believin, by Journey\nThe ultimate crowd-pleaser, bring the mood up again with Journey's quintessential Americana midnight adventure song. Fists will pump and memories of late-night train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back. Even though this song came out in 1981, it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who weren't even born then know the words. It's a great goodbye, goodnight, and see you on the road song.\n\nThese time-honored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because they've got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh. They are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones.\n\nriage, first gave sign\nUnto his contract; fire and air did shine,\nAs guilty of the match; and from the hill\nThe nymphs with shriekings do the region fill.\nHere first began their bane; this day was ground\nOf all their ills; for now, nor rumour's sound,\nNor nice respect of state, moves Dido ought;\nHer love no longer now by stealth is sought:\nShe calls this wedlock, and with that fair name\nCovers her fault. Forthwith the bruit and fame,\nThrough all the greatest Lybian towns is gone;\nFame, a fleet evil, than which is swifter none,\nThat moving grows, and flying gathers strength,\nLittle at first, and fearful; but at length\nShe dares attempt the skies, and stalking proud\nWith feet on ground, her head doth pierce a cloud!\nThis child, our parent earth, stirr'd up with spite\nOf all the gods, brought forth; and, as some write,\nShe was last sister of that giant race\nThat thought to scale Jove' s court; right swift of pace,\nAnd swifter far of wing; a monster vast,\nAnd dreadful. Look, how many plumes are placed\nOn her huge corps, so many waking eyes\nStick underneath; and, which may stranger rise\nIn the report, as many tongues she bears,\nAs many mouths, as many listening ears.\nNightly, in midst of all the heaven, she flies,\nAnd through the earth's dark shadow shrieking cries,\nNor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep;\nBy day on tops of houses she doth keep,\nOr on high towers; and doth thence affright\nCities and towns of most conspicuous site:\nAs covetous she is of tales and lies,\nAs prodigal of truth: this monster\u2014\nLup.\n[within.] Come, follow me, assist me, second me! Where'! the\nemperor?\n\n1 Eques.\n[within.] Sir, you must pardon us.\n\n2 Eques.\n[within.] Caesar is private now; you may not enter.\n\nTuc.\n[within.] Not enter! Charge them upon their allegiance,\ncropshin.\n\n1 Eques.\n[within.] We have a charge to the contrary, sir.\n\nLup.\n[within.] I pronounce you all traitors, horrible traitors:\nWhat! do you know my affairs? I have matter of danger and state to impart to Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nWhat noise is there? who's that names Caesar?\n\nLup.\n[within.] A friend to Caesar. One that, for Caesar's good,\nwould speak with Caesar.\nCaes.\nWho is it? look, Cornelius.\n\n1 Eques.\n[within.] Asinius Lupus.\n\nCaes.\nO, bid the turbulent informer hence;\nWe have no vacant ear now, to receive\nThe unseason'd fruits of his officious tongue.\n\nMec.\nYou must avoid him there.\n\nLup.\n[within.] I conjure thee, as thou art. Caesar, or respectest\nthine own safety, or the safety of the state, Caesar, hear me,\nspeak with me, Caesar; 'tis no common business I come about, but\nsuch, as being neglected, may concern the life of Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nThe life of Caesar! Let him enter. Virgil, keep thy seat.\nEnter Lupus, Tucca, and Lictors.\n\nEques.\n[within.] Bear back, there: whither will you? keep back!\n\nTuc.\nBy thy leave, goodman usher: mend thy peruke; so.\n\nLup.\nLay hold on Horace there; and on Mecaenas, lictors. Romans,\noffer no rescue, upon your allegiance: read, royal Caesar.\n[Gives a paper.] I'll tickle you, Satyr.\n\nTuc.\nHe will, Humours, he will; he will squeeze you, poet\npuck-fist.\n\nLup.\nI'll lop you off for an unprofitable branch, you satirical\nvarlet.\n\nTuc.\nAy, and Epaminondas your patron here, with his flagon chain;\ncome, resign: [takes off Mecaenas' chain,] though 'twere your great grandfather's, the law has made it mine now, sir. Look to him, my party-coloured rascals; look to him.\n\nCaes.\nWhat is this, Asinius Lupus? I understand it not.\n\nLup.\nNot understand it! A libel, Caesar; a dangerous, seditious\nlibel; a libel in picture.\n\nCaes.\nA libel!\n\nLup.\nAy, I found it in this Horace his study, in Mecaenas his\nhouse, here; I challenge the penalty of the laws against them.\n\nTuc.\nAy, and remember to beg their land betimes; before some of\nthese hungry court-hounds scent it out.\n\nCaes.\nShew it to Horace: ask him if he know it.\n\nLup.\nKnow it! his hand is at it, Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nThen 'tis no libel.\n\nHor.\nIt is the imperfect body of an emblem, Caesar, I began for\nMecaenas.\n\nLup.\nAn emblem! right: that's Greek for a libel. Do but mark how\nconfident he is.\n\nHor.\nA just man cannot fear, thou foolish tribune;\nNot, though the malice of traducing tongues,\nThe open vastness of a tyrant's ear,\nThe senseless rigour of the wrested laws,\nOr the red eyes of strain'd authority,\nShould, in a point, meet all to take his life:\nHis innocence is armour 'gainst all these.\n\nLup.\nInnocence! O impudence! let me see, let me see! Is not here an\neagle! and is not that eagle meant by Caesar, ha? Does not Caesar\ngive the eagle? answer me; what sayest thou?\n\nTuc.\nHast thou any evasion, stinkard?\n\nLup.\nNow he's turn'd dumb. I'll tickle you, Satyr.\n\nHor.\nPish: ha, ha!\n\nLup.\nDost thou pish me? Give me my long sword.\n\nHor.\nWith reverence to great Caesar, worthy Romans,\nObserve but this ridiculous commenter;\nThe soul 'to my device was in this distich:\nThus oft, the base and ravenous multitude\nSurvive, to share the spoils of fortitude.\nWhich in this body I have figured here,\nA vulture\u2014\n\nLup.\nA vulture! Ay, now, 'tis a vulture. O abominable! monstrous!\nmonstrous! has not your vulture a beak? has it not legs, and\ntalons, and wings, and feathers?\n\nTuc.\nTouch him, old buskins.\n\nHor.\nAnd therefore must it be an eagle?\n\nMec.\nRespect him not, good Horace: say your device.\n\nHor.\nA vulture and a wolf\n\nLup.\nA wolf! good: that's I; I am the wolf: my name's Lupus; I am\nmeant by the wolf. On, on; a vulture and a wolf\n\nHor.\nPreying upon the carcass of an ass\u2014\n\nLup.\nAn ass! good still: that's I too; I am the ass. You mean me by\nthe ass.\n\nMec.\nPrithee, leave braying then.\n\nHor.\nIf you will needs take it, I cannot with modesty give it from\nyou.\n\nMec.\nBut, by that beast, the old Egyptians\nWere wont to figure, in their hieroglyphics,\nPatience, frugality, and fortitude;\nFor none of which we can suspect you, tribune.\n\nCaes.\nWho was it, Lupus, that inform'd you first, This should be\nmeant by us? Or was't your comment?\n\nLup.\nNo, Caesar; a player gave me the first light of it indeed.\n\nTuc.\nAy, an honest sycophant-like slave, and a politician besides\n\nCaes.\nWhere is that player?\n\nTuc.\nHe is without here.\n\nCaes.\nCall him in.\n\nTuc.\nCall in the player there: master AEsop, call him.\n\nEquites.\n[within.] Player! where is the player? bear back: none but\nthe player enter.\n\n[Enter AESOP, followed by CRISPINUS and DEMETRIUS.\nTuc.\nYes, this gentleman and his Achates must.\n\nCris.\nPray you, master usher:\u2014we'll stand close, here.\n\nTuc.\n'Tis a gentleman of quality, this; though he be somewhat out\nof clothes, I tell ye.\u2014Come, AEsop, hast a bay-leaf in thy mouth?\nWell said; be not out, stinkard. Thou shalt have a monopoly of\nplaying confirm'd to thee, and thy covey, under the emperor's broad seal, for this service.\n\nCaes.\nIs this he?\n\nLup.\nAy, Caesar, this is he.\n\nCaes.\nLet him be whipped. Lictors, go take him hence.\nAnd, Lupus, for your fierce credulity,\nOne fit him with a pair of larger ears:\n'Tis Caesar's doom, and must not be revoked.\nWe hate to have our court and peace disturb'd\nWith these quotidian clamours. See it done.\n\nLup.\nCaesar! \n\n[Exeunt some of the Lictors, with Lupus and AEsop\nCaes.\nGag him, [that] we may have his silence.\n\nVirg.\nCaesar hath done like Caesar. Fair and just\nIs his award, against these brainless creatures.\n'Tis not the wholesome sharp morality,\nOr modest anger of a satiric spirit,\nThat hurts or wounds the body of the state;\nBut the sinister application\nOf the malicious, ignorant, and base\nInterpreter; who will distort, and strain\nThe general scope and purpose of an author\nTo his particular and private spleen.\n\nCaes.\nWe know it, our dear Virgil, and esteem it\nA most dishonest practice in that man,\nWill seem too witty in another's work.\nWhat would Cornelius Gallus, and Tibullus?\n\n[They whisper Caesar.\nTuc.\n[to Mecaenas.] Nay, but as thou art a man, dost hear! a man\nof worship and honourable: hold, here, take thy chain again.\nResume, mad Mecoenas. What! dost thou think I meant to have kept it, old boy? no: I did it but to fright thee, I, to try how thou\nwould'st take it. What! will I turn shark upon my friends, or my\nfriends' friends? I scorn it with my three souls. Come, I love\nbully Horace as well as thou dost, I: 'tis an honest hieroglyphic.\nGive me thy wrist, Helicon. Dost thou think I'll second e'er a\nrhinoceros of them all, against thee, ha? or thy noble Hippocrene,\nhere? I'll turn stager first, and be whipt too: dost thou see,\nbully?\n\nCaes.\nYou have your will of Caesar: use it, Romans.\nVirgil shall be your praetor: and ourself\nWill here sit by, spectator of your sports;\nAnd think it no impeach of royalty.\nOur ear is now too much profaned, grave Maro,\nWith these distastes, to take thy sacred lines;\nPut up thy book, till both the time and we\nBe fitted with more hallow'd circumstance\nFor the receiving of so divine a work.\nProceed with your design.\n\nMec. Gal. Tib.\nThanks to great Caesar.\n\nGal.\nTibullus, draw you the indictment then, whilst Horace arrests\nthem on the statute of Calumny. Mecaenas and I will take our\nplaces here. Lictors, assist him.\n\nHor.\nI am the worst accuser under heaven.\n\nGal.\nTut, you must do it; 'twill be noble mirth.\n\nHor.\nI take no knowledge that they do malign me.\n\nTib.\nAy, but the world takes knowledge.\n\nHor.\nWould the world knew\nHow heartily I wish a fool should hate me!\n\nTuc.\nBody of Jupiter! what! will they arraign my brisk Poetaster\nand his poor journeyman, ha? Would I were abroad skeldering for, a drachm, so I were out of this labyrinth again! I do feel myself\nturn stinkard already: but I must set the best face I have upon't\nnow.\n[Aside.]\u2014Well said, my divine, deft Horace, bring the whoreson detracting slaves to the bar, do; make them hold up their spread golls: I'll give in evidence for thee, if thou wilt. Take courage, Crlspinus; would thy man had a clean band!\n\nCris.\nWhat must we do, captain?\n\nTuc.\nThou shalt see anon: do not make division with thy legs so.\n\nCaes.\nWhat's he. Horace?\n\nHor.\nI only know him for a motion, Caesar.\n\nTuc.\nI am one of thy commanders, Caesar; a man of service and\naction: my name is Pantilius Tucca; I have served in thy wars\nagainst Mark Antony, I.\n\nCaes.\nDo you know him, Cornelius?\n\nGal.\nHe's one that hath had the mustering, or convoy of a company\nnow and then: I never noted him by any other employment.\n\nCaes.\nWe will observe him better.\n\nTib.\nLictor, proclaim silence in the court.\n\nLict.\nIn the name of Caesar, silence!\n\nTib.\nLet the parties, the accuser and the accused, present\nthemselves.\n\nLict.\nThe accuser and the accused, present yourselves in court.\n\nCris.\nDem.

That you (not having\nthe fear of Phoebus, or his shafts, before your eyes) contrary to\nthe peace of our liege lord, Augustus Caesar, his crown and\ndignity, and against the form of a statute, in that case made and\nprovided, have moat ignorantly, foolishly, and, more like\nyourselves, maliciously, gone about to deprave, and calumniate the\nperson and writings of Quintus Horatius Flaccus, here present,\npoet, and priest to the Muses, and to that end have mutually\nconspired and plotted, at sundry times, as by several means, and in\nsundry places, for the better accomplishing your base and envious\npurpose, taxing him falsely, of self-love, arrogancy, impudence,\nrailing, filching by translation, etc. Of all which calumnies, and\nevery of them, in manner and form aforesaid, what answer you!

First, you must know,\nThat where there is a true and perfect merit,\nThere can be no dejection; and the scorn\nOf humble baseness, oftentimes so works\nIn a high soul, upon the grosser spirit,\nThat to his bleared and offended sense,\nThere seems a hideous fault blazed in the object;\nWhen only the disease is in his eyes.\nHere-hence it comes our Horace now stands tax'd\nOf impudence, self-love, and arrogance,\nBy those who share no merit in themselves;\nAnd therefore think his portion is as small.\nFor they, from their own guilt, assure their souls,\nIf they should confidently praise their works,\nIn them it would appear inflation:\nWhich, in a full and well digested man,\nCannot receive that foul abusive name,\nBut the fair title of erection.\nAnd, for his true use of translating men,\nIt still hath been a work of as much palm,\nIn clearest judgments, as to invent or make,\nHis sharpness,\u2014-that is most excusable;\nAs being forced out of a suffering virtue,\nOppressed with the license of the time:\u2014-\nAnd howsoever fools or jerking pedants,\nPlayers, or suchlike buffoon barking wits,\nMay with their beggarly and barren trash\nTickle base vulgar ears, in their despite;\nThis, like Jove's thunder, shall their pride control,\n\"The honest satire hath the happiest soul.\"\n\nNow, Romans, you have heard our thoughts;\nwithdraw when you please.\n\nTib.\nRemove the accused from the bar.\n\nTuc.\nWho holds the urn to us, ha?

These, or such,\nWhether of malice, or of ignorance,\nOr itch t' have me their adversary, I know not,\nOr all these mixt; but sure I am, three years\nThey did provoke me with their petulant styles\nOn every stage: and I at last unwilling,\nBut weary, I confess, of so much trouble,\nThought I would try if shame could win upon 'em,'\nAnd therefore chose Augustus Caesar's times,\nWhen wit and area were at their height in Rome,\nTo shew that Virgil, Horace, and the rest\nOf those great master-spirits, did not want\nDetractors then, or practicers against them:\nAnd by this line, although no parallel,\nI hoped at last they would sit down and blush;\nBut nothing I could find more contrary.\nAnd though the impudence of flies be great,\nYet this hath so provok'd the angry wasps,\nOr, as you said, of the next nest, the hornets,\nThat they fly buzzing, mad, about my nostrils,\nAnd, like so many screaming grasshoppers\nHeld by the wings, fill every ear with noise.\nAnd what? those former calumnies you mention'd.\nFirst, of the law: indeed I brought in Ovid\nChid by his angry father for neglecting\nThe study of their laws for poetry:\nAnd I am warranted by his own words:\n\nSaepe pater dixit, studium quid inutile tentas!\nMaeonides nullas ipse reliquit opes.\n\nAnd in far harsher terms elsewhere, as these:\n\nNon me verbosas leges ediscere, non me\nIngrato voces prostituisse foro.\n\nBut how this should relate unto our laws,\nOr the just ministers, with least abuse,\nI reverence both too much to understand!\nThen, for the captain, I will only speak\nAn epigram I here have made: it is\n\nUNTO TRUE SOLDIERS.\nThat's the lemma: mark it.\nStrength of my country, whilst I bring to view\nSuch: as are miss-call'd captains, and wrong you,\nAnd your high names; I do desire, that thence,\nBe nor put on you, nor you take offence:\nI swear by your true friend, my muse, I love\nYour great profession which I once did prove;\nAnd did not shame it with my actions then,\nNo more than I dare now do with my pen.\nHe that not trusts me, having vowed thus much,\nBut's angry for the captain, still: is such.\nNow for the players, it is true, I tax'd them,\nAnd yet but some; and those so sparingly,\nAs all the rest might have sat still unquestion'd,\nHad they but had the wit or conscience\nTo think well of themselves. But impotent, they\nThought each man's vice belong'd to their whole tribe;\nAnd much good do't them! What they have done 'gainst me,\nI am not moved with: if it gave them meat,\nOr got them clothes, 'tis well; that was their end.\nOnly amongst them, I am sorry for\nSome better natures, by the rest so drawn,\nTo run in that vile line.\n\nPol.\nAnd is this all!\nWill you not answer then the libels?\n\nAut.\nNo.\n\nPol.\nNor the Untrussers?\n\nAut.\nNeither.\n\nPol.\nY'are undone then.\n\nAut.\nWith whom?\n\nPol.\nThe world.\n\nAut.\nThe bawd!\n\nPol.\nIt will be taken\nTo be stupidity or tameness in you.\n\nAut.\nBut they that have incensed me, can in soul\nAcquit me of that guilt.

They would think it strange, now,\nA man should take but colts-foot for one day,\nAnd, between whiles, spit out a better poem\nThan e'er the master of art, or giver of wit,\nTheir belly, made. Yet, this is possible,\nIf a free mind had but the patience,\nTo think so much together and so vile.\nBut that these base and beggarly conceits\nShould carry it, by the multitude of voices,\nAgainst the most abstracted work, opposed\nTo the stuff'd nostrils of the drunken rout!\nO, this would make a learn'd and liberal soul\nTo rive his stained quill up to the back,\nAnd damn his long-watch'd labours to the fire,\nThings that were born when none but the still night\nAnd his dumb candle, saw his pinching throes,\nWere not his own free merit a more crown\nUnto his travails than their reeling claps.\nThis 'tis that strikes me silent, seals my lips,\nAnd apts me rather to sleep out my time,\nThan I would waste it in contemned strifes\nWith these vile Ibides, these unclean birds,\nThat make their mouths their clysters, and still purge\nFrom their hot entrails. But I leave the monsters\nTo their own fate. And, since the Comic Muse\nHath proved so ominous to me, I will try\nIf TRAGEDY have a more kind aspect;\nHer favours in my next I will pursue,\nWhere, if I prove the pleasure but of one,\nSo he judicious be, he shall be alone\nA theatre unto me; Once I'll say\nTo strike the ear of time in those fresh strains,\nAs shall, beside the cunning of their ground,\nGive cause to some of wonder, some despite,\nAnd more despair, to imitate their sound.\nI, that spend half my nights, and all my days,\nHere in a cell, to get a dark paleface,\nTo come forth worth the ivy or the bays,\nAnd in this age can hope no other grace\u2014-\nLeave me!

Scene 1 LyricsBanquet halls are a very special place, where under one big roof so many different memories are made. From proms to weddings to baby showers, once that DJ starts to spin, there's something about that cavernous echo that begs to be filled with sing-along dance tunes. Top 40 hits come and go, and no doubt there will be plenty of those contemporary tunes throughout the evening, but there are few songs that are as fun now as they were the first time. Not only do they never go out of style, they are essential components of the perfect hoe-down in all banquet halls.\n\n1. The Chicken Dance\nThis song is a great opener to get the crowd going. Even the stiffest old timers can't help but get up and shake a leg when this song comes on. And what could be cuter than a gaggle of little kids all wiggling their tail feathers and squawking like chicks? This is a great song for a country-themed wedding.\n\n2. Macarena, by Los Dos Rios\nA major craze when first released in 1995, the Macarena will keep the energy up, up, up. The simple dance moves and catchy tune are an irresistible combination, and the Latin flavor will be a welcome change of beat.\n\n3. Dancing Queen, by ABBA\nLight-hearted and bubbly, Dancing Queen is a must-have for any occasion where free spirits are blooming and the night is young. Dancing Queen was written for the royal Swedish wedding in 1976, but its candy-sweet ebullience is as fresh as ever. This song has gone on to be a romantic staple at just about every wedding in the U.S.\n4. My Heart Will Go On, by Celine Dion\nThe words are simple, the feeling is big. Lost love is in the air, and nobody ever said it better than Celine. Play this song later in the night, after a few glasses of wine have everyone misty-eyed and ready to belt out, \"My heart will go on and OOOOOOON!\" with Celine.\n\n5. Don't Stop Believin, by Journey\nThe ultimate crowd-pleaser, bring the mood up again with Journey's quintessential Americana midnight adventure song. Fists will pump and memories of late-night train rides and midnight diner trysts will flood back. Even though this song came out in 1981, it still plays on the radio often enough that kids who weren't even born then know the words. It's a great goodbye, goodnight, and see you on the road song.\n\nThese time-honored tunes have been staples of banquet halls for decades because they've got that timeless jive that keeps them fresh. They are sure to bring back old memories and inspire new ones.\n\nriage, first gave sign\nUnto his contract; fire and air did shine,\nAs guilty of the match; and from the hill\nThe nymphs with shriekings do the region fill.\nHere first began their bane; this day was ground\nOf all their ills; for now, nor rumour's sound,\nNor nice respect of state, moves Dido ought;\nHer love no longer now by stealth is sought:\nShe calls this wedlock, and with that fair name\nCovers her fault. Forthwith the bruit and fame,\nThrough all the greatest Lybian towns is gone;\nFame, a fleet evil, than which is swifter none,\nThat moving grows, and flying gathers strength,\nLittle at first, and fearful; but at length\nShe dares attempt the skies, and stalking proud\nWith feet on ground, her head doth pierce a cloud!\nThis child, our parent earth, stirr'd up with spite\nOf all the gods, brought forth; and, as some write,\nShe was last sister of that giant race\nThat thought to scale Jove' s court; right swift of pace,\nAnd swifter far of wing; a monster vast,\nAnd dreadful. Look, how many plumes are placed\nOn her huge corps, so many waking eyes\nStick underneath; and, which may stranger rise\nIn the report, as many tongues she bears,\nAs many mouths, as many listening ears.\nNightly, in midst of all the heaven, she flies,\nAnd through the earth's dark shadow shrieking cries,\nNor do her eyes once bend to taste sweet sleep;\nBy day on tops of houses she doth keep,\nOr on high towers; and doth thence affright\nCities and towns of most conspicuous site:\nAs covetous she is of tales and lies,\nAs prodigal of truth: this monster\u2014\nLup.\n[within.] Come, follow me, assist me, second me! Where'! the\nemperor?\n\n1 Eques.\n[within.] Sir, you must pardon us.\n\n2 Eques.\n[within.] Caesar is private now; you may not enter.\n\nTuc.\n[within.] Not enter! Charge them upon their allegiance,\ncropshin.\n\n1 Eques.\n[within.] We have a charge to the contrary, sir.\n\nLup.\n[within.] I pronounce you all traitors, horrible traitors:\nWhat! do you know my affairs? I have matter of danger and state to impart to Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nWhat noise is there? who's that names Caesar?\n\nLup.\n[within.] A friend to Caesar. One that, for Caesar's good,\nwould speak with Caesar.\nCaes.\nWho is it? look, Cornelius.\n\n1 Eques.\n[within.] Asinius Lupus.\n\nCaes.\nO, bid the turbulent informer hence;\nWe have no vacant ear now, to receive\nThe unseason'd fruits of his officious tongue.\n\nMec.\nYou must avoid him there.\n\nLup.\n[within.] I conjure thee, as thou art. Caesar, or respectest\nthine own safety, or the safety of the state, Caesar, hear me,\nspeak with me, Caesar; 'tis no common business I come about, but\nsuch, as being neglected, may concern the life of Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nThe life of Caesar! Let him enter. Virgil, keep thy seat.\nEnter Lupus, Tucca, and Lictors.\n\nEques.\n[within.] Bear back, there: whither will you? keep back!\n\nTuc.\nBy thy leave, goodman usher: mend thy peruke; so.\n\nLup.\nLay hold on Horace there; and on Mecaenas, lictors. Romans,\noffer no rescue, upon your allegiance: read, royal Caesar.\n[Gives a paper.] I'll tickle you, Satyr.\n\nTuc.\nHe will, Humours, he will; he will squeeze you, poet\npuck-fist.\n\nLup.\nI'll lop you off for an unprofitable branch, you satirical\nvarlet.\n\nTuc.\nAy, and Epaminondas your patron here, with his flagon chain;\ncome, resign: [takes off Mecaenas' chain,] though 'twere your great grandfather's, the law has made it mine now, sir. Look to him, my party-coloured rascals; look to him.\n\nCaes.\nWhat is this, Asinius Lupus? I understand it not.\n\nLup.\nNot understand it! A libel, Caesar; a dangerous, seditious\nlibel; a libel in picture.\n\nCaes.\nA libel!\n\nLup.\nAy, I found it in this Horace his study, in Mecaenas his\nhouse, here; I challenge the penalty of the laws against them.\n\nTuc.\nAy, and remember to beg their land betimes; before some of\nthese hungry court-hounds scent it out.\n\nCaes.\nShew it to Horace: ask him if he know it.\n\nLup.\nKnow it! his hand is at it, Caesar.\n\nCaes.\nThen 'tis no libel.\n\nHor.\nIt is the imperfect body of an emblem, Caesar, I began for\nMecaenas.\n\nLup.\nAn emblem! right: that's Greek for a libel. Do but mark how\nconfident he is.\n\nHor.\nA just man cannot fear, thou foolish tribune;\nNot, though the malice of traducing tongues,\nThe open vastness of a tyrant's ear,\nThe senseless rigour of the wrested laws,\nOr the red eyes of strain'd authority,\nShould, in a point, meet all to take his life:\nHis innocence is armour 'gainst all these.\n\nLup.\nInnocence! O impudence! let me see, let me see! Is not here an\neagle! and is not that eagle meant by Caesar, ha? Does not Caesar\ngive the eagle? answer me; what sayest thou?\n\nTuc.\nHast thou any evasion, stinkard?\n\nLup.\nNow he's turn'd dumb. I'll tickle you, Satyr.\n\nHor.\nPish: ha, ha!\n\nLup.\nDost thou pish me? Give me my long sword.\n\nHor.\nWith reverence to great Caesar, worthy Romans,\nObserve but this ridiculous commenter;\nThe soul 'to my device was in this distich:\nThus oft, the base and ravenous multitude\nSurvive, to share the spoils of fortitude.\nWhich in this body I have figured here,\nA vulture\u2014\n\nLup.\nA vulture! Ay, now, 'tis a vulture. O abominable! monstrous!\nmonstrous! has not your vulture a beak? has it not legs, and\ntalons, and wings, and feathers?\n\nTuc.\nTouch him, old buskins.\n\nHor.\nAnd therefore must it be an eagle?\n\nMec.\nRespect him not, good Horace: say your device.\n\nHor.\nA vulture and a wolf\n\nLup.\nA wolf! good: that's I; I am the wolf: my name's Lupus; I am\nmeant by the wolf. On, on; a vulture and a wolf\n\nHor.\nPreying upon the carcass of an ass\u2014\n\nLup.\nAn ass! good still: that's I too; I am the ass. You mean me by\nthe ass.\n\nMec.\nPrithee, leave braying then.\n\nHor.\nIf you will needs take it, I cannot with modesty give it from\nyou.\n\nMec.\nBut, by that beast, the old Egyptians\nWere wont to figure, in their hieroglyphics,\nPatience, frugality, and fortitude;\nFor none of which we can suspect you, tribune.\n\nCaes.\nWho was it, Lupus, that inform'd you first, This should be\nmeant by us? Or was't your comment?\n\nLup.\nNo, Caesar; a player gave me the first light of it indeed.\n\nTuc.\nAy, an honest sycophant-like slave, and a politician besides\n\nCaes.\nWhere is that player?\n\nTuc.\nHe is without here.\n\nCaes.\nCall him in.\n\nTuc.\nCall in the player there: master AEsop, call him.\n\nEquites.\n[within.] Player! where is the player? bear back: none but\nthe player enter.\n\n[Enter AESOP, followed by CRISPINUS and DEMETRIUS.\nTuc.\nYes, this gentleman and his Achates must.\n\nCris.\nPray you, master usher:\u2014we'll stand close, here.\n\nTuc.\n'Tis a gentleman of quality, this; though he be somewhat out\nof clothes, I tell ye.\u2014Come, AEsop, hast a bay-leaf in thy mouth?\nWell said; be not out, stinkard. Thou shalt have a monopoly of\nplaying confirm'd to thee, and thy covey, under the emperor's broad seal, for this service.\n\nCaes.\nIs this he?\n\nLup.\nAy, Caesar, this is he.\n\nCaes.\nLet him be whipped. Lictors, go take him hence.\nAnd, Lupus, for your fierce credulity,\nOne fit him with a pair of larger ears:\n'Tis Caesar's doom, and must not be revoked.\nWe hate to have our court and peace disturb'd\nWith these quotidian clamours. See it done.\n\nLup.\nCaesar! \n\n[Exeunt some of the Lictors, with Lupus and AEsop\nCaes.\nGag him, [that] we may have his silence.\n\nVirg.\nCaesar hath done like Caesar. Fair and just\nIs his award, against these brainless creatures.\n'Tis not the wholesome sharp morality,\nOr modest anger of a satiric spirit,\nThat hurts or wounds the body of the state;\nBut the sinister application\nOf the malicious, ignorant, and base\nInterpreter; who will distort, and strain\nThe general scope and purpose of an author\nTo his particular and private spleen.\n\nCaes.\nWe know it, our dear Virgil, and esteem it\nA most dishonest practice in that man,\nWill seem too witty in another's work.\nWhat would Cornelius Gallus, and Tibullus?\n\n[They whisper Caesar.\nTuc.\n[to Mecaenas.] Nay, but as thou art a man, dost hear! a man\nof worship and honourable: hold, here, take thy chain again.\nResume, mad Mecoenas. What! dost thou think I meant to have kept it, old boy? no: I did it but to fright thee, I, to try how thou\nwould'st take it. What! will I turn shark upon my friends, or my\nfriends' friends? I scorn it with my three souls. Come, I love\nbully Horace as well as thou dost, I: 'tis an honest hieroglyphic.\nGive me thy wrist, Helicon. Dost thou think I'll second e'er a\nrhinoceros of them all, against thee, ha? or thy noble Hippocrene,\nhere?

But impotent, they\nThought each man's vice belong'd to their whole tribe;\nAnd much good do't them! What they have done 'gainst me,\nI am not moved with: if it gave them meat,\nOr got them clothes, 'tis well; that was their end.\nOnly amongst them, I am sorry for\nSome better natures, by the rest so drawn,\nTo run in that vile line.\n\nPol.\nAnd is this all!\nWill you not answer then the libels?\n\nAut.\nNo.\n\nPol.\nNor the Untrussers?\n\nAut.\nNeither.\n\nPol.\nY'are undone then.\n\nAut.\nWith whom?\n\nPol.\nThe world.\n\nAut.\nThe bawd!\n\nPol.\nIt will be taken\nTo be stupidity or tameness in you.\n\nAut.\nBut they that have incensed me, can in soul\nAcquit me of that guilt.

They would think it strange, now,\nA man should take but colts-foot for one day,\nAnd, between whiles, spit out a better poem\nThan e'er the master of art, or giver of wit,\nTheir belly, made. Yet, this is possible,\nIf a free mind had but the patience,\nTo think so much together and so vile.\nBut that these base and beggarly conceits\nShould carry it, by the multitude of voices,\nAgainst the most abstracted work, opposed\nTo the stuff'd nostrils of the drunken rout!\nO, this would make a learn'd and liberal soul\nTo rive his stained quill up to the back,\nAnd damn his long-watch'd labours to the fire,\nThings that were born when none but the still night\nAnd his dumb candle, saw his pinching throes,\nWere not his own free merit a more crown\nUnto his travails than their reeling claps.\nThis 'tis that strikes me silent, seals my lips,\nAnd apts me rather to sleep out my time,\nThan I would waste it in contemned strifes\nWith these vile Ibides, these unclean birds,\nThat make their mouths their clysters, and still purge\nFrom their hot entrails. But I leave the monsters\nTo their own fate. And, since the Comic Muse\nHath proved so ominous to me, I will try\nIf TRAGEDY have a more kind aspect;\nHer favours in my next I will pursue,\nWhere, if I prove the pleasure but of one,\nSo he judicious be, he shall be alone\nA theatre unto me; Once I'll say\nTo strike the ear of time in those fresh strains,\nAs shall, beside the cunning of their ground,\nGive cause to some of wonder, some despite,\nAnd more despair, to imitate their sound.\nI, that spend half my nights, and all my days,\nHere in a cell, to get a dark paleface,\nTo come forth worth the ivy or the bays,\nAnd in this age can hope no other grace\u2014-\nLeave me!

and engages on board a Turkey ship\u2014Account of a black man's being kidnapped on board and sent to the West Indies, and the author's fruitless endeavours to procure his freedom\u2014Some account of the manner of the author's conversion to the faith of Jesus Christ.\n\nOur voyage to the North Pole being ended, I returned to London with Doctor Irving, with whom I continued for some time, during which I began seriously to reflect on the dangers I had escaped, particularly those of my last voyage, which made a lasting impression on my mind, and, by the grace of God, proved afterwards a mercy to me; it caused me to reflect deeply on my eternal state, and to seek the Lord with full purpose of heart ere it was too late. I rejoiced greatly; and heartily thanked the Lord for directing me to London, where I was determined to work out my own salvation, and in so doing procure a title to heaven, being the result of a mind blended by ignorance and sin.\n\nIn process of time I left my master, Doctor Irving, the purifier of waters, and lodged in Coventry-court, Haymarket, where I was continually oppressed and much concerned about the salvation of my soul, and was determined (in my own strength) to be a first-rate Christian. I used every means for this purpose; and, not being able to find any person amongst my acquaintance that agreed with me in point of religion, or, in scripture language, 'that would shew me any good;' I was much dejected, and knew not where to seek relief; however, I first frequented the neighbouring churches, St. James's, and others, two or three times a day, for many weeks: still I came away dissatisfied; something was wanting that I could not obtain, and I really found more heartfelt relief in reading my bible at home than in attending the church; and, being resolved to be saved, I pursued other methods still. First I went among the quakers, where the word of God was neither read or preached, so that I remained as much in the dark as ever. I then searched into the Roman catholic principles, but was not in the least satisfied. At length I had recourse to the Jews, which availed me nothing, for the fear of eternity daily harassed my mind, and I knew not where to seek shelter from the wrath to come. However this was my conclusion, at all events, to read the four evangelists, and whatever sect or party I found adhering thereto such I would join. Thus I went on heavily without any guide to direct me the way that leadeth to eternal life. I asked different people questions about the manner of going to heaven, and was told different ways. Here I was much staggered, and could not find any at that time more righteous than myself, or indeed so much inclined to devotion. I thought we should not all be saved (this is agreeable to the holy scriptures), nor would all be damned. I found none among the circle of my acquaintance that kept wholly the ten commandments. So righteous was I in my own eyes, that I was convinced I excelled many of them in that point, by keeping eight out of ten; and finding those who in general termed themselves Christians not so honest or so good in their morals as the Turks, I really thought the Turks were in a safer way of salvation than my neighbours: so that between hopes and fears I went on, and the chief comforts I enjoyed were in the musical French horn, which I then practised, and also dressing of hair. Such was my situation some months, experiencing the dishonesty of many people here. I determined at last to set out for Turkey, and there to end my days. It was now early in the spring 1774. I sought for a master, and found a captain John Hughes, commander of a ship called Anglicania, fitting out in the river Thames, and bound to Smyrna in Turkey. I shipped myself with him as a steward; at the same time I recommended to him a very clever black man, John Annis, as a cook. This man was on board the ship near two months doing his duty: he had formerly lived many years with Mr. William Kirkpatrick, a gentleman of the island of St. Kitts, from whom he parted by consent, though he afterwards tried many schemes to inveigle the poor man. He had applied to many captains who traded to St. Kitts to trepan him; and when all their attempts and schemes of kidnapping proved abortive, Mr. Kirkpatrick came to our ship at Union Stairs on Easter Monday, April the fourth, with two wherry boats and six men, having learned that the man was on board; and tied, and forcibly took him away from the ship, in the presence of the crew and the chief mate, who had detained him after he had notice to come away. I believe that this was a combined piece of business: but, at any rate, it certainly reflected great disgrace on the mate and captain also, who, although they had desired the oppressed man to stay on board, yet he did not in the least assist to recover him, or pay me a farthing of his wages, which was about five pounds. I proved the only friend he had, who attempted to regain him his liberty if possible, having known the want of liberty myself. I sent as soon as I could to Gravesend, and got knowledge of the ship in which he was; but unluckily she had sailed the first tide after he was put on board. My intention was then immediately to apprehend Mr. Kirkpatrick, who was about setting off for Scotland; and, having obtained a habeas corpus for him, and got a tipstaff to go with me to St. Paul's church-yard, where he lived, he, suspecting something of this kind, set a watch to look out. My being known to them occasioned me to use the following deception: I whitened my face, that they might not know me, and this had its desired effect. He did not go out of his house that night, and next morning I contrived a well plotted stratagem notwithstanding he had a gentleman in his house to personate him. My direction to the tipstaff, who got admittance into the house, was to conduct him to a judge, according to the writ. When he came there, his plea was, that he had not the body in custody, on which he was admitted to bail. I proceeded immediately to that philanthropist, Granville Sharp, Esq. who received me with the utmost kindness, and gave me every instruction that was needful on the occasion. I left him in full hope that I should gain the unhappy man his liberty, with the warmest sense of gratitude towards Mr. Sharp for his kindness; but, alas! my attorney proved unfaithful; he took my money, lost me many months employ, and did not do the least good in the cause: and when the poor man arrived at St. Kitts, he was, according to custom, staked to the ground with four pins through a cord, two on his wrists, and two on his ancles, was cut and flogged most unmercifully, and afterwards loaded cruelly with irons about his neck. I had two very moving letters from him, while he was in this situation; and also was told of it by some very respectable families now in London, who saw him in St. Kitts, in the same state in which he remained till kind death released him out of the hands of his tyrants. During this disagreeable business I was under strong convictions of sin, and thought that my state was worse than any man's; my mind was unaccountably disturbed; I often wished for death, though at the same time convinced I was altogether unprepared for that awful summons. Suffering much by villains in the late cause, and being much concerned about the state of my soul, these things (but particularly the latter) brought me very low; so that I became a burden to myself, and viewed all things around me as emptiness and vanity, which could give no satisfaction to a troubled conscience. I was again determined to go to Turkey, and resolved, at that time, never more to return to England. I engaged as steward on board a Turkeyman (the Wester Hall, Capt. Linna); but was prevented by means of my late captain, Mr. Hughes, and others. All this appeared to be against me, and the only comfort I then experienced was, in reading the holy scriptures, where I saw that 'there is no new thing under the sun,' Eccles. i. 9; and what was appointed for me I must submit to. Thus I continued to travel in much heaviness, and frequently murmured against the Almighty, particularly in his providential dealings; and, awful to think! I began to blaspheme, and wished often to be any thing but a human being. In these severe conflicts the Lord answered me by awful 'visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed,' Job xxxiii. 15. He was pleased, in much mercy, to give me to see, and in some measure to understand, the great and awful scene of the judgment-day, that 'no unclean person, no unholy thing, can enter into the kingdom of God,' Eph. v. 5. I would then, if it had been possible, have changed my nature with the meanest worm on the earth; and was ready to say to the mountains and rocks 'fall on me,' Rev. vi. 16; but all in vain. I then requested the divine Creator that he would grant me a small space of time to repent of my follies and vile iniquities, which I felt were grievous. The Lord, in his manifold mercies, was pleased to grant my request, and being yet in a state of time, the sense of God's mercies was so great on my mind when I awoke, that my strength entirely failed me for many minutes, and I was exceedingly weak. This was the first spiritual mercy I ever was sensible of, and being on praying ground, as soon as I recovered a little strength, and got out of bed and dressed myself, I invoked Heaven from my inmost soul, and fervently begged that God would never again permit me to blaspheme his most holy name. The Lord, who is long-suffering, and full of compassion to such poor rebels as we are, condescended to hear and answer. I felt that I was altogether unholy, and saw clearly what a bad use I had made of the faculties I was endowed with; they were given me to glorify God with; I thought, therefore, I had better want them here, and enter into life eternal, than abuse them and be cast into hell fire. I prayed to be directed, if there were any holier than those with whom I was acquainted, that the Lord would point them out to me. I appealed to the Searcher of hearts, whether I did not wish to love him more, and serve him better. Notwithstanding all this, the reader may easily discern, if he is a believer, that I was still in nature's darkness. At length I hated the house in which I lodged, because God's most holy name was blasphemed in it; then I saw the word of God verified, viz. 'Before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.'\n\nI had a great desire to read the bible the whole day at home; but not having a convenient place for retirement, I left the house in the day, rather than stay amongst the wicked ones; and that day as I was walking, it pleased God to direct me to a house where there was an old sea-faring man, who experienced much of the love of God shed abroad in his heart. He began to discourse with me; and, as I desired to love the Lord, his conversation rejoiced me greatly; and indeed I had never heard before the love of Christ to believers set forth in such a manner, and in so clear a point of view. Here I had more questions to put to the man than his time would permit him to answer; and in that memorable hour there came in a dissenting minister; he joined our discourse, and asked me some few questions; among others, where I heard the gospel preached. I knew not what he meant by hearing the gospel; I told him I had read the gospel: and he asked where I went to church, or whether I went at all or not. To which I replied, 'I attended St. James's, St. Martin's, and St. Ann's, Soho;'\u2014'So,' said he, 'you are a churchman.' I answered, I was. He then invited me to a love-feast at his chapel that evening. I accepted the offer, and thanked him; and soon after he went away, I had some further discourse with the old Christian, added to some profitable reading, which made me exceedingly happy. When I left him he reminded me of coming to the feast; I assured him I would be there. Thus we parted, and I weighed over the heavenly conversation that had passed between these two men, which cheered my then heavy and drooping spirit more than any thing I had met with for many months. However, I thought the time long in going to my supposed banquet. I also wished much for the company of these friendly men; their company pleased me much; and I thought the gentlemen very kind, in asking me, a stranger, to a feast; but how singular did it appear to me, to have it in a chapel! When the wished-for hour came I went, and happily the old man was there, who kindly seated me, as he belonged to the place. I was much astonished to see the place filled with people, and no signs of eating and drinking. There were many ministers in the company. At last they began by giving out hymns, and between the singing the minister engaged in prayer; in short, I knew not what to make of this sight, having never seen any thing of the kind in my life before now. Some of the guests began to speak their experience, agreeable to what I read in the Scriptures; much was said by every speaker of the providence of God, and his unspeakable mercies, to each of them. This I knew in a great measure, and could most heartily join them. But when they spoke of a future state, they seemed to be altogether certain of their calling and election of God; and that no one could ever separate them from the love of Christ, or pluck them out of his hands. This filled me with utter consternation, intermingled with admiration. I was so amazed as not to know what to think of the company; my heart was attracted and my affections were enlarged. I wished to be as happy as them, and was persuaded in my mind that they were different from the world 'that lieth in wickedness,' 1 John v. 19. Their language and singing, &c. did well harmonize; I was entirely overcome, and wished to live and die thus. Lastly, some persons in the place produced some neat baskets full of buns, which they distributed about; and each person communicated with his neighbour, and sipped water out of different mugs, which they handed about to all who were present. This kind of Christian fellowship I had never seen, nor ever thought of seeing on earth; it fully reminded me of what I had read in the holy scriptures, of the primitive Christians, who loved each other and broke bread. In partaking of it, even from house to house, this entertainment (which lasted about four hours) ended in singing and prayer. It was the first soul feast I ever was present at. This last twenty-four hours produced me things, spiritual and temporal, sleeping and waking, judgment and mercy, that I could not but admire the goodness of God, in directing the blind, blasphemous sinner in the path that he knew not of, even among the just; and instead of judgment he has shewed mercy, and will hear and answer the prayers and supplications of every returning prodigal:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0O! to grace how great a debtor\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Daily I'm constrain'd to be!\nAfter this I was resolved to win Heaven if possible; and if I perished I thought it should be at the feet of Jesus, in praying to him for salvation. After having been an eye-witness to some of the happiness which attended those who feared God, I knew not how, with any propriety, to return to my lodgings, where the name of God was continually profaned, at which I felt the greatest horror. I paused in my mind for some time, not knowing what to do; whether to hire a bed elsewhere, or go home again. At last, fearing an evil report might arise, I went home, with a farewell to card-playing and vain jesting, &c. I saw that time was very short, eternity long, and very near, and I viewed those persons alone blessed who were found ready at midnight call, or when the Judge of all, both quick and dead, cometh.\n\nThe next day I took courage, and went to Holborn, to see my new and worthy acquaintance, the old man, Mr. C\u2014\u2014; he, with his wife, a gracious woman, were at work at silk weaving; they seemed mutually happy, and both quite glad to see me, and I more so to see them. I sat down, and we conversed much about soul matters, &c. Their discourse was amazingly delightful, edifying, and pleasant. I knew not at last how to leave this agreeable pair, till time summoned me away. As I was going they lent me a little book, entitled \"The Conversion of an Indian.\" It was in questions and answers. The poor man came over the sea to London, to inquire after the Christian's God, who, (through rich mercy) he found, and had not his journey in vain. The above book was of great use to me, and at that time was a means of strengthening my faith; however, in parting, they both invited me to call on them when I pleased. This delighted me, and I took care to make all the improvement from it I could; and so far I thanked God for such company and desires. I prayed that the many evils I felt within might be done away, and that I might be weaned from my former carnal acquaintances. This was quickly heard and answered, and I was soon connected with those whom the scripture calls the excellent of the earth. I heard the gospel preached, and the thoughts of my heart and actions were laid open by the preachers, and the way of salvation by Christ alone was evidently set forth. Thus I went on happily for near two months; and I once heard, during this period, a reverend gentleman speak of a man who had departed this life in full assurance of his going to glory. I was much astonished at the assertion; and did very deliberately inquire how he could get at this knowledge. I was answered fully, agreeable to what I read in the oracles of truth; and was told also, that if I did not experience the new birth, and the pardon of my sins, through the blood of Christ, before I died, I could not enter the kingdom of heaven. I knew not what to think of this report, as I thought I kept eight commandments out of ten; then my worthy interpreter told me I did not do it, nor could I; and he added, that no man ever did or could keep the commandments, without offending in one point. I thought this sounded very strange, and puzzled me much for many weeks; for I thought it a hard saying. I then asked my friend, Mr. L\u2014\u2014d, who was a clerk in a chapel, why the commandments of God were given, if we could not be saved by them? To which he replied, 'The law is a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ,' who alone could and did keep the commandments, and fulfilled all their requirements for his elect people, even those to whom he had given a living faith, and the sins of those chosen vessels were already atoned for and forgiven them whilst living; and if I did not experience the same before my exit, the Lord would say at that great day to me 'Go ye cursed,' &c. &c. for God would appear faithful in his judgments to the wicked, as he would be faithful in shewing mercy to those who were ordained to it before the world was; therefore Christ Jesus seemed to be all in all to that man's soul. I was much wounded at this discourse, and brought into such a dilemma as I never expected. I asked him, if he was to die that moment, whether he was sure to enter the kingdom of God? and added, 'Do you know that your sins are forgiven you?' He answered in the affirmative. Then confusion, anger, and discontent seized me, and I staggered much at this sort of doctrine; it brought me to a stand, not knowing which to believe, whether salvation by works or by faith only in Christ. I requested him to tell me how I might know when my sins were forgiven me. He assured me he could not, and that none but God alone could do this. I told him it was very mysterious; but he said it was really matter of fact, and quoted many portions of scripture immediately to the point, to which I could make no reply. He then desired me to pray to God to shew me these things. I answered, that I prayed to God every day. He said, 'I perceive you are a churchman.' I answered I was. He then entreated me to beg of God to shew me what I was, and the true state of my soul. I thought the prayer very short and odd; so we parted for that time. I weighed all these things well over, and could not help thinking how it was possible for a man to know that his sins were forgiven him in this life. I wished that God would reveal this self same thing unto me. In a short time after this I went to Westminster chapel; the Rev. Mr. P\u2014\u2014 preached, from Lam. iii. 39. It was a wonderful sermon; he clearly shewed that a living man had no cause to complain for the punishment of his sins; he evidently justified the Lord in all his dealings with the sons of men; he also shewed the justice of God in the eternal punishment of the wicked and impenitent. The discourse seemed to me like a two-edged sword cutting all ways; it afforded me much joy, intermingled with many fears, about my soul; and when it was ended, he gave it out that he intended, the ensuing week, to examine all those who meant to attend the Lord's table. Now I thought much of my good works, and at the same time was doubtful of my being a proper object to receive the sacrament; I was full of meditation till the day of examining. However, I went to the chapel, and, though much distressed, I addressed the reverend gentleman, thinking, if I was not right, he would endeavour to convince me of it. When I conversed with him, the first thing he asked me was, what I knew of Christ? I told him I believed in him, and had been baptized in his name. 'Then,' said he, 'when were you brought to the knowledge of God? and how were you convinced of sin?' I knew not what he meant by these questions; I told him I kept eight commandments out of ten; but that I sometimes swore on board ship, and sometimes when on shore, and broke the sabbath. He then asked me if I could read? I answered, 'Yes.'\u2014'Then,' said he,'do you not read in the bible, he that offends in one point is guilty of all?' I said, 'Yes.' Then he assured me, that one sin unatoned for was as sufficient to damn a soul as one leak was to sink a ship. Here I was struck with awe; for the minister exhorted me much, and reminded me of the shortness of time, and the length of eternity, and that no unregenerate soul, or any thing unclean, could enter the kingdom of Heaven. He did not admit me as a communicant; but recommended me to read the scriptures, and hear the word preached, not to neglect fervent prayer to God, who has promised to hear the supplications of those who seek him in godly sincerity; so I took my leave of him, with many thanks, and resolved to follow his advice, so far as the Lord would condescend to enable me. During this time I was out of employ, nor was I likely to get a situation suitable for me, which obliged me to go once more to sea. I engaged as steward of a ship called the Hope, Capt. Richard Strange, bound from London to Cadiz in Spain. In a short time after I was on board I heard the name of God much blasphemed, and I feared greatly, lest I should catch the horrible infection. I thought if I sinned again, after having life and death set evidently before me, I should certainly go to hell. My mind was uncommonly chagrined, and I murmured much at God's providential dealings with me, and was discontented with the commandments, that I could not be saved by what I had done; I hated all things, and wished I had never been born; confusion seized me, and I wished to be annihilated. One day I was standing on the very edge of the stern of the ship, thinking to drown myself; but this scripture was instantly impressed on my mind\u2014'that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him,' 1 John iii. 15. Then I paused, and thought myself the unhappiest man living. Again I was convinced that the Lord was better to me than I deserved, and I was better off in the world than many. After this I began to fear death; I fretted, mourned, and prayed, till I became a burden to others, but more so to myself. At length I concluded to beg my bread on shore rather than go again to sea amongst a people who feared not God, and I entreated the captain three different times to discharge me; he would not, but each time gave me greater and greater encouragement to continue with him, and all on board shewed me very great civility: notwithstanding all this I was unwilling to embark again. At last some of my religious friends advised me, by saying it was my lawful calling, consequently it was my duty to obey, and that God was not confined to place, &c. &c. particularly Mr. G.S. the governor of Tothil-fields Bridewell, who pitied my case, and read the eleventh chapter of the Hebrews to me, with exhortations. He prayed for me, and I believed that he prevailed on my behalf, as my burden was then greatly removed, and I found a heartfelt resignation to the will of God. The good man gave me a pocket Bible and Allen's Alarm to the unconverted. We parted, and the next day I went on board again. We sailed for Spain, and I found favour with the captain. It was the fourth of the month of September when we sailed from London; we had a delightful voyage to Cadiz, where we arrived the twenty-third of the same month. The place is strong, commands a fine prospect, and is very rich. The Spanish galloons frequent that port, and some arrived whilst we were there. I had many opportunities of reading the scriptures. I wrestled hard with God in fervent prayer, who had declared in his word that he would hear the groanings and deep sighs of the poor in spirit. I found this verified to my utter astonishment and comfort in the following manner:\n\nOn the morning of the 6th of October, (I pray you to attend) or all that day, I thought that I should either see or hear something supernatural. I had a secret impulse on my mind of something that was to take place, which drove me continually for that time to a throne of grace. It pleased God to enable me to wrestle with him, as Jacob did: I prayed that if sudden death were to happen, and I perished, it might be at Christ's feet.\n\nIn the evening of the same day, as I was reading and meditating on the fourth chapter of the Acts, twelfth verse, under the solemn apprehensions of eternity, and reflecting on my past actions, I began to think I had lived a moral life, and that I had a proper ground to believe I had an interest in the divine favour; but still meditating on the subject, not knowing whether salvation was to be had partly for our own good deeds, or solely as the sovereign gift of God; in this deep consternation the Lord was pleased to break in upon my soul with his bright beams of heavenly light; and in an instant as it were, removing the veil, and letting light into a dark place, I saw clearly with the eye of faith the crucified Saviour bleeding on the cross on mount Calvary: the scriptures became an unsealed book, I saw myself a condemned criminal under the law, which came with its full force to my conscience, and when 'the commandment came sin revived, and I died,' I saw the Lord Jesus Christ in his humiliation, loaded and bearing my reproach, sin, and shame. I then clearly perceived that by the deeds of the law no flesh living could be justified. I was then convinced that by the first Adam sin came, and by the second Adam (the Lord Jesus Christ) all that are saved must be made alive. It was given me at that time to know what it was to be born again, John iii. 5. I saw the eighth chapter to the Romans, and the doctrines of God's decrees, verified agreeable to his eternal, everlasting, and unchangeable purposes. The word of God was sweet to my taste, yea sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. Christ was revealed to my soul as the chiefest among ten thousand. These heavenly moments were really as life to the dead, and what John calls an earnest of the Spirit[V]. This was indeed unspeakable, and I firmly believe undeniable by many. Now every leading providential circumstance that happened to me, from the day I was taken from my parents to that hour, was then in my view, as if it had but just then occurred. I was sensible of the invisible hand of God, which guided and protected me when in truth I knew it not: still the Lord pursued me although I slighted and disregarded it; this mercy melted me down. When I considered my poor wretched state I wept, seeing what a great debtor I was to sovereign free grace. Now the Ethiopian was willing to be saved by Jesus Christ, the sinner's only surety, and also to rely on none other person or thing for salvation. Self was obnoxious, and good works he had none, for it is God that worketh in us both to will and to do. The amazing things of that hour can never be told\u2014it was joy in the Holy Ghost! I felt an astonishing change; the burden of sin, the gaping jaws of hell, and the fears of death, that weighed me down before, now lost their horror; indeed I thought death would now be the best earthly friend I ever had. Such were my grief and joy as I believe are seldom experienced. I was bathed in tears, and said, What am I that God should thus look on me the vilest of sinners? I felt a deep concern for my mother and friends, which occasioned me to pray with fresh ardour; and, in the abyss of thought, I viewed the unconverted people of the world in a very awful state, being without God and without hope.\n\nIt pleased God to pour out on me the Spirit of prayer and the grace of supplication, so that in loud acclamations I was enabled to praise and glorify his most holy name. When I got out of the cabin, and told some of the people what the Lord had done for me, alas, who could understand me or believe my report!\u2014None but to whom the arm of the Lord was revealed. I became a barbarian to them in talking of the love of Christ: his name was to me as ointment poured forth; indeed it was sweet to my soul, but to them a rock of offence. I thought my case singular, and every hour a day until I came to London, for I much longed to be with some to whom I could tell of the wonders of God's love towards me, and join in prayer to him whom my soul loved and thirsted after. I had uncommon commotions within, such as few can tell aught about. Now the bible was my only companion and comfort; I prized it much, with many thanks to God that I could read it for myself, and was not left to be tossed about or led by man's devices and notions. The worth of a soul cannot be told.\u2014May the Lord give the reader an understanding in this. Whenever I looked in the bible I saw things new, and many texts were immediately applied to me with great comfort, for I knew that to me was the word of salvation sent. Sure I was that the Spirit which indited the word opened my heart to receive the truth of it as it is in Jesus\u2014that the same Spirit enabled me to act faith upon the promises that were so precious to me, and enabled me to believe to the salvation of my soul. By free grace I was persuaded that I had a part in the first resurrection, and was 'enlightened with the light of the living,' Job xxxiii. 30. I wished for a man of God with whom I might converse: my soul was like the chariots of Aminidab, Canticles vi. 12. These, among others, were the precious promises that were so powerfully applied to me: 'All things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive,' Mat. xxi. 22. 'Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,' John xiv. 27. I saw the blessed Redeemer to be the fountain of life, and the well of salvation. I experienced him all in all; he had brought me by a way that I knew not, and he had made crooked paths straight. Then in his name I set up my Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto he hath helped me: and could say to the sinners about me, Behold what a Saviour I have! Thus I was, by the teaching of that all-glorious Deity, the great One in Three, and Three in One, confirmed in the truths of the bible, those oracles of everlasting truth, on which every soul living must stand or fall eternally, agreeable to Acts iv. 12. 'Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved, but only Christ Jesus.' May God give the reader a right understanding in these facts! To him that believeth all things are possible, but to them that are unbelieving nothing is pure, Titus i. 15. During this period we remained at Cadiz until our ship got laden. We sailed about the fourth of November; and, having a good passage, we arrived in London the month following, to my comfort, with heartfelt gratitude to God for his rich and unspeakable mercies. On my return I had but one text which puzzled me, or that the devil endeavoured to buffet me with, viz. Rom. xi. 6. and, as I had heard of the Reverend Mr. Romaine, and his great knowledge in the scriptures, I wished much to hear him preach. One day I went to Blackfriars church, and, to my great satisfaction and surprise, he preached from that very text. He very clearly shewed the difference between human works and free election, which is according to God's sovereign will and pleasure. These glad tidings set me entirely at liberty, and I went out of the church rejoicing, seeing my spots were those of God's children. I went to Westminster Chapel, and saw some of my old friends, who were glad when they perceived the wonderful change that the Lord had wrought in me, particularly Mr. G\u2014\u2014 S\u2014\u2014, my worthy acquaintance, who was a man of a choice spirit, and had great zeal for the Lord's service. I enjoyed his correspondence till he died in the year 1784. I was again examined at that same chapel, and was received into church fellowship amongst them: I rejoiced in spirit, making melody in my heart to the God of all my mercies. Now my whole wish was to be dissolved, and to be with Christ\u2014but, alas! I must wait mine appointed time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MISCELLANEOUS

Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand, on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay, on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and, last but not least, on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man, Mary, star of the sea.\n\nThe three girl friends were seated on the rocks, enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly. Many a time and oft were they won't to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine, Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey, two little curlyheaded boys, dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name H.M.S. Belleisle printed on both. For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins, scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them. They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets, building castles as children do, or playing with their big coloured ball, happy as the day was long. And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight. He was but eleven months and nine days old and, though still a tiny toddler, was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words. Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin.\n\n\u2014Now, baby, Cissy Caffrey said. Say out big, big. I want a drink of water.\n\nAnd baby prattled after her:\n\n\u2014A jink a jink a jawbo.\n\nCissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children, so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on. What a persuasive power that girl had! But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold, a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib. None of your spoilt beauties, Flora MacFlimsy sort, was Cissy Caffrey. A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life, always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips, a girl lovable in the extreme. And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother.\nBut just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky. Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule. The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had. But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and, true to the maxim that every little Irishman's house is his castle, he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and (alas to relate!) the coveted castle too. Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends.\n\n\u2014Come here, Tommy, his sister called imperatively. At once! And you, Jacky, for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand. Wait till I catch you for that.\n\nHis eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister's word was law with the twins. And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure. His little man-o'-war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life's tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit. Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn't be far from him, her eyes dancing in admonition.\n\n\u2014Nasty bold Jacky! she cried.\n\nShe put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly:\n\n\u2014What's your name? Butter and cream?\n\n\u2014Tell us who is your sweetheart, spoke Edy Boardman. Is Cissy your sweetheart?\n\n\u2014Nao, tearful Tommy said.\n\n\u2014Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart? Cissy queried.\n\n\u2014Nao, Tommy said.\n\n\u2014I know, Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes. I know who is Tommy's sweetheart. Gerty is Tommy's sweetheart.\n\n\u2014Nao, Tommy said on the verge of tears.\n\nCissy's quick motherwit guessed what was amiss and she whispered to Edy Boardman to take him there behind the pushcar where the gentleman couldn't see and to mind he didn't wet his new tan shoes.\nBut who was Gerty?\nGerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions, lost in thought, gazing far away into the distance was, in very truth, as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see. She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though, as folks often said, she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell. Her figure was slight and graceful, inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch's female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling. The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid's bow, Greekly perfect. Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either. Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman, a deliberate lie, when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty (the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals) and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she'd never speak to her again. No. Honour where honour is due. There was an innate refinement, a languid queenly hauteur about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep. Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her. Mayhap it was this, the love that might have been, that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look, tense with suppressed meaning, that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes, a charm few could resist. Why have women such eyes of witchery? Gerty's were of the bluest Irish blue, set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows. Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive. It was Madame Vera Verity, directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette, who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes, so becoming in leaders of fashion, and she had never regretted it. Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose? That would suit Mrs Dignam because she had a button one. But Gerty's crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair. It was dark brown with a natural wave in it. She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too, Thursday for wealth. And just now at Edy's words as a telltale flush, delicate as the faintest rosebloom, crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God's fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal.\n\nFor an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes. She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue. Inclination prompted her to speak out: dignity told her to be silent. The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning. She knew right well, no-one better, what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers' quarrel. As per usual somebody's nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window. Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W. E. Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university. Little recked he perhaps for what she felt, that dull aching void in her heart sometimes, piercing to the core. Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time. They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph. But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked, every inch a gentleman, the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn't go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden.\n\nGerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out. A neat blouse of electric blue selftinted by dolly dyes (because it was expected in the Lady's Pictorial that electric blue would be worn) with a smart vee opening down to the division and kerchief pocket (in which she always kept a piece of cottonwool scented with her favourite perfume because the handkerchief spoiled the sit) and a navy threequarter skirt cut to the stride showed off her slim graceful figure to perfection. She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone. All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery's summer sales, the very it, slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice, seven fingers two and a penny. She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then, smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her! And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew. Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear (Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very petite but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell, a five, and never would ash, oak or elm) with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep. Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops. As for undies they were Gerty's chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen (though Gerty would never see seventeen again) can find it in his heart to blame her? She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery, three garments and nighties extra, and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons, rosepink, pale blue, mauve and peagreen, and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn't trust those washerwomen as far as she'd see them scorching the things. She was wearing the blue for luck, hoping against hope, her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers' meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn't of a Friday.\n\nAnd yet and yet! That strained look on her face! A gnawing sorrow is there all the time. Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where, giving way to tears, she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelingsthough not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror. You are lovely, Gerty, it said. The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful. Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain. Yes, she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T. C. D. (because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie) and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be. He was too young to understand. He would not believe in love, a woman's birthright. The night of the party long ago in Stoer's (he was still in short trousers) when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips. He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss (the first!) but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments. Impetuous fellow! Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie's strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men. But waiting, always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over. No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal, perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey, and who would understand, take her in his sheltering arms, strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss. It would be like heaven. For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve. With all the heart of her she longs to be his only, his affianced bride for riches for poor, in sickness in health, till death us two part, from this to this day forward.\n\nAnd while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be. Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face, Bertha Supple too, and Edy, little spitfire, because she would be twentytwo in November. She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess. Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann's pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire, dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction, then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn't like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn't eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap's lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery's summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses. He would be tall with broad shoulders (she had always admired tall men for a husband) with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon (three wonderful weeks!) and then, when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house, every morning they would both have brekky, simple but perfectly served, for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes.\n\nEdy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight. But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there'd be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground, if you please. The temper of him! O, he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies. Edy told him no, no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him.\n\n\u2014You're not my sister, naughty Tommy said. It's my ball.\n\nBut Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up, look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career, having won the day.\n\n\u2014Anything for a quiet life, laughed Ciss.\n\nAnd she tickled tiny tot's two cheeks to make him forget and played here's the lord mayor, here's his two horses, here's his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in, chinchopper, chinchopper, chinchopper chin. But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him.\n\n\u2014I'd like to give him something, she said, so I would, where I won't say.\n\n\u2014On the beeoteetom, laughed Cissy merrily.\nGerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she'd be ashamed of her life to say, flushing a deep rosy red, and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said. But not a pin cared Ciss.\n\n\u2014Let him! she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose. Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I'd look at him.\n\nMadcap Ciss with her golliwog curls. You had to laugh at her sometimes. For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men's faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White. That was just like Cissycums. O, and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father's suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road, smoking a cigarette. There was none to come up to her for fun. But she was sincerity itself, one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made, not one of your twofaced things, too sweet to be wholesome.\n\nAnd then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ. It was the men's temperance retreat conducted by the missioner, the reverend John Hughes S. J., rosary, sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament. They were there gathered together without distinction of social class (and a most edifying spectacle it was to see) in that simple fane beside the waves, after the storms of this weary world, kneeling before the feet of the immaculate, reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto, beseeching her to intercede for them, the old familiar words, holy Mary, holy virgin of virgins. How sad to poor Gerty's ears! Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink, by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson's Weekly, she might now be rolling in her carriage, second to none. Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket, thinking. But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cist its shadow over her childhood days. Nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to the fumes of intoxication, forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness, deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low.\n\nAnd still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful, Virgin most merciful. And Gerty, rapt in thought, scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk. You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face (it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell) or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose. Poor father! With all his faults she loved him still when he sang Tell me, Mary, how to woo thee or My love and cottage near Rochelle and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby's salad dressing for supper and when he sang The moon hath raised with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried, God have mercy on him, from a stroke. Her mother's birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken. No-one would have thought the end was so near. Now he was laid to rest. And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn't even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby's cork lino, artistic, standard designs, fit for a palace, gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home.\n\nA sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house, a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold. And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn't like her mother's taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about, taking snuff. Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways. It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer's christmas almanac, the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window. You could see there was a story behind it. The colours were done something lovely. She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat. She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker's pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant.\n\nThe twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks. Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball. Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please. The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty's skirt near the little pool by the rock. The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn't come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed.\n\n\u2014If you fail try again, Edy Boardman said.\n\nGerty smiled assent and bit her lip. A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle. Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking. She felt the warm flush, a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell, surging and flaming into her cheeks. Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight, wan and strangely drawn, seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen.\n\nThrough the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin, spiritual vessel, pray for us, honourable vessel, pray for us, vessel of singular devotion, pray for us, mystical rose. And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered, their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary, the most pious Virgin's intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her.\n\nThe twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers. Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee, clapping baby hands in air. Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah! and, my word, didn't the little chap enjoy that! And then she told him to say papa.\n\n\u2014Say papa, baby. Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa.\n\nAnd baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health, a perfect little bunch of love, and he would certainly turn out to be something great, they said.\n\n\u2014Haja ja ja haja.\n\nCissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out, holy saint Denis, that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him. Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it:\n\n\u2014Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa.\n\nAnd two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks. It was all no use soothering him with no, nono, baby, no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss, always readywitted, gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased.\n\nGerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves, no hour to be out, and the little brats of twins. She gazed out towards the distant sea. It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out, the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft. And while she gazed her heart went pitapat. Yes, it was her he was looking at, and there was meaning in his look. His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through, read her very soul. Wonderful eyes they were, superbly expressive, but could you trust them? People were so queer. She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner, the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey, the matinee idol, only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn't stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly retrouss\u00e9 from where he was sitting. He was in deep mourning, she could see that, and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face. She would have given worlds to know what it was. He was looking up so intently, so still, and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down. She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away. Here was that of which she had so often dreamed. It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no-one else. The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him, her dreamhusband, because she knew on the instant it was him. If he had suffered, more sinned against than sinning, or even, even, if he had been himself a sinner, a wicked man, she cared not. Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her. There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm. She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known, those cyclists showing off what they hadn't got and she just yearned to know all, to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her, make him forget the memory of the past. Then mayhap he would embrace her gently, like a real man, crushing her soft body to him, and love her, his ownest girlie, for herself alone.\n\nRefuge of sinners. Comfortress of the afflicted. Ora pro nobis. Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away: and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart. Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church, the stained glass windows lighted up, the candles, the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin's sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O'Hanlon at the altar, carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down. He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic. He told her that time when she told him about that in confession, crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see, not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature's laws, he said, in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God, he said, and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word. He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours' adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place.\n\nThe exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it. Little monkeys common as ditchwater. Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places, the both of them. And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned.\n\n\u2014Jacky! Tommy!\n\nNot they! What a great notion they had! So Cissy said it was the very last time she'd ever bring them out. She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him, tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn't get it to grow long because it wasn't natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it. She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn't rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible. It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble. Tableau! That would have been a very charming expose for a gentleman like that to witness.\n\nQueen of angels, queen of patriarchs, queen of prophets, of all saints, they prayed, queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O'Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn't because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O'Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the Tantum ergo and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the Tantumer gosa cramen tum. Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow's of George's street on the Tuesday, no the Monday before Easter and there wasn't a brack on them and that was what he was looking at, transparent, and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form (the cheek of her!) because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself.\n\nCissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl's shoulders\u2014a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.\n\nEdy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty, half smiling, with her specs like an old maid, pretending to nurse the baby. Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no-one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers. And she said to Gerty:\n\n\u2014A penny for your thoughts.\n\n\u2014What? replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth. I was only wondering was it late.\n\nBecause she wished to goodness they'd take the snottynosed twins and their babby home to the mischief out of that so that was why she just gave a gentle hint about its being late. And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy, as glib as you like, said it was half past kissing time, time to kiss again. But Edy wanted to know because they were told to be in early.\n\n\u2014Wait, said Cissy, I'll run ask my uncle Peter over there what's the time by his conundrum.\n\nSo over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket, getting nervous, and beginning to play with his watchchain, looking up at the church. Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself. One moment he had been there, fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze, and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman, selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure.\n\nCissy said to excuse her would he mind please telling her what was the right time and Gerty could see him taking out his watch, listening to it and looking up and clearing his throat and he said he was very sorry his watch was stopped but he thought it must be after eight because the sun was set. His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones. Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order.\n\nThen they sang the second verse of the Tantum ergo and Canon O'Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time. It was getting darker but he could see and he was looking all the time that he was winding the watch or whatever he was doing to it and then he put it back and put his hands back into his pockets. She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon. His dark eyes fixed themselves on her again drinking in her every contour, literally worshipping at her shrine. If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man's passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man's face. It is for you, Gertrude MacDowell, and you know it.\n\nEdy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins' caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O'Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out Panem de coelo praestitisti eis and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over. Gerty winced sharply. A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable. It hurt\u2014O yes, it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was. Gerty's lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat, so slim, so flawless, so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of. She had loved him better than he knew. Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears. Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see.\n\n\u2014O, responded Gerty, quick as lightning, laughing, and the proud head flashed up. I can throw my cap at who I like because it's leap year.\n\nHer words rang out crystalclear, more musical than the cooing of the ringdove, but they cut the silence icily. There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with. As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces. And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot. Miss puny little Edy's countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it, the little kinnatt, because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof, apart, in another sphere, that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it.\n\nEdy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior. And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky, laughing up out of his gleeful eyes, and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby, without as much as by your leave, sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib.\n\n\u2014O my! Puddeny pie! protested Ciss. He has his bib destroyed.\n\nThe slight contretemps claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights.\n\nGerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.\n\nHow moving the scene there in the gathering twilight, the last glimpse of Erin, the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk, hither, thither, with a tiny lost cry. And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book The Lamplighter by Miss Cummins, author of Mabel Vaughan and other tales. For Gerty had her dreams that no-one knew of. She loved to read poetry and when she got a keepsake from Bertha Supple of that lovely confession album with the coralpink cover to write her thoughts in she laid it in the drawer of her toilettable which, though it did not err on the side of luxury, was scrupulously neat and clean. It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove, the tortoiseshell combs, her child of Mary badge, the whiterose scent, the eyebrowleine, her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely's of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs. Art thou real, my ideal? it was called by Louis J Walsh, Magherafelt, and after there was something about twilight, wilt thou ever? and ofttimes the beauty of poetry, so sad in its transient loveliness, had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her, one by one, and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it. But it must end, she felt. If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her. Love laughs at locksmiths. She would make the great sacrifice. Her every effort would be to share his thoughts. Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness. There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse, cruel only to be kind. But even if\u2014what then? Would it make a very great difference? From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled. She loathed that sort of person, the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl's honour, degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station. No, no: not that. They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess. Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall. She thought she understood. She would try to understand him because men were so different. The old love was waiting, waiting with little white hands stretched out, with blue appealing eyes. Heart of mine! She would follow, her dream of love, the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all, the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide. Nothing else mattered. Come what might she would be wild, untrammelled, free.\n\nCanon O'Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang Laudate Dominum omnes gentes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn't she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out:\n\n\u2014O, look, Cissy!\n\nAnd they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church, blue and then green and purple.\n\n\u2014It's fireworks, Cissy Caffrey said.\n\nAnd they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church, helterskelter, Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn't fall running.\n\n\u2014Come on, Gerty, Cissy called. It's the bazaar fireworks.\n\nBut Gerty was adamant. She had no intention of being at their beck and call. If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was. The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling. She looked at him a moment, meeting his glance, and a light broke in upon her. Whitehot passion was in that face, pasion silent as the grave, and it had made her his. At last they were left alone without the others to pry and pass remarks and she knew he could be trusted to the death, steadfast, a sterling man, a man of inflexible honour to his fingertips. His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her. She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no-one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that, supply soft and delicately rounded, and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart, his hoarse breathing, because she knew too about the passion of men like that, hotblooded, because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she'd never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed. But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips. Besides there was absolution so long as you didn't do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too, my dear, and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors' photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did.\n\nAnd Jacky Caffrey shouted to look, there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look, look, there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air, a soft thing, to and fro, dark. And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees, up, up, and, in the tense hush, they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it, high, high, almost out of sight, and her face was suffused with a divine, an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too, nainsook knickers, the fabric that caresses the skin, better than those other pettiwidth, the green, four and eleven, on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no-one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn't ashamed and he wasn't either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn't resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking, looking. She would fain have cried to him chokingly, held out her snowy slender arms to him to come, to feel his lips laid on her white brow, the cry of a young girl's love, a little strangled cry, wrung from her, that cry that has rung through the ages. And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O! then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O! and everyone cried O! O! in raptures and it gushed out of it a stream of rain gold hair threads and they shed and ah! they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden, O so lovely, O, soft, sweet, soft!\n\nThen all melted away dewily in the grey air: all was silent. Ah! She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly, a pathetic little glance of piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl He was leaning back against the rock behind. Leopold Bloom (for it is he) stands silent, with bowed head before those young guileless eyes. What a brute he had been! At it again? A fair unsullied soul had called to him and, wretch that he was, how had he answered? An utter cad he had been! He of all men! But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes, for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered. Should a girl tell? No, a thousand times no. That was their secret, only theirs, alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don't tell.\n\nCissy Caffrey whistled, imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was: and then she cried:\n\n\u2014Gerty! Gerty! We're going. Come on. We can see from farther up.\n\nGerty had an idea, one of love's little ruses. She slipped a hand into her kerchief pocket and took out the wadding and waved in reply of course without letting him and then slipped it back. Wonder if he's too far to. She rose. Was it goodbye? No. She had to go but they would meet again, there, and she would dream of that till then, tomorrow, of her dream of yester eve. She drew herself up to her full height. Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart, full of a strange shining, hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face. She half smiled at him wanly, a sweet forgiving smile, a smile that verged on tears, and then they parted.\n\nSlowly, without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy, to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey, to little baby Boardman. It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed. She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because\u2014because Gerty MacDowell was...\n\nTight boots? No. She's lame! O!\n\nMr Bloom watched her as she limped away. Poor girl! That's why she's left on the shelf and the others did a sprint. Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib. Jilted beauty. A defect is ten times worse in a woman. But makes them polite. Glad I didn't know it when she was on show. Hot little devil all the same. I wouldn't mind. Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses. That squinty one is delicate. Near her monthlies, I expect, makes them feel ticklish. I have such a bad headache today. Where did I put the letter? Yes, all right. All kinds of crazy longings. Licking pennies. Girl in Tranquilla convent that nun told me liked to smell rock oil. Virgins go mad in the end I suppose. Sister? How many women in Dublin have it today? Martha, she. Something in the air. That's the moon. But then why don't all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon, I mean? Depends on the time they were born I suppose. Or all start scratch then get out of step. Sometimes Molly and Milly together. Anyhow I got the best of that. Damned glad I didn't do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter. Made up for that tramdriver this morning. That gouger M'Coy stopping me to say nothing. And his wife engagement in the country valise, voice like a pickaxe. Thankful for small mercies. Cheap too. Yours for the asking. Because they want it themselves. Their natural craving. Shoals of them every evening poured out of offices. Reserve better. Don't want it they throw it at you. Catch em alive, O. Pity they can't see themselves. A dream of wellfilled hose. Where was that? Ah, yes. Mutoscope pictures in Capel street: for men only. Peeping Tom. Willy's hat and what the girls did with it. Do they snapshot those girls or is it all a fake? Lingerie does it. Felt for the curves inside her deshabill\u00e9. Excites them also when they're. I'm all clean come and dirty me. And they like dressing one another for the sacrifice. Milly delighted with Molly's new blouse. At first. Put them all on to take them all off. Molly. Why I bought her the violet garters. Us too: the tie he wore, his lovely socks and turnedup trousers. He wore a pair of gaiters the night that first we met. His lovely shirt was shining beneath his what? of jet. Say a woman loses a charm with every pin she takes out. Pinned together. O, Mairy lost the pin of her. Dressed up to the nines for somebody. Fashion part of their charm. Just changes when you're on the track of the secret. Except the east: Mary, Martha: now as then. No reasonable offer refused. She wasn't in a hurry either. Always off to a fellow when they are. They never forget an appointment. Out on spec probably. They believe in chance because like themselves. And the others inclined to give her an odd dig. Girl friends at school, arms round each other's necks or with ten fingers locked, kissing and whispering secrets about nothing in the convent garden. Nuns with whitewashed faces, cool coifs and their rosaries going up and down, vindictive too for what they can't get. Barbed wire. Be sure now and write to me. And I'll write to you. Now won't you? Molly and Josie Powell. Till Mr Right comes along, then meet once in a blue moon. Tableau! O, look who it is for the love of God! How are you at all? What have you been doing with yourself? Kiss and delighted to, kiss, to see you. Picking holes in each other's appearance. You're looking splendid. Sister souls. Showing their teeth at one another. How many have you left? Wouldn't lend each other a pinch of salt.\n\nAh!\n\nDevils they are when that's coming on them. Dark devilish appearance. Molly often told me feel things a ton weight. Scratch the sole of my foot. O that way! O, that's exquisite! Feel it myself too. Good to rest once in a way. Wonder if it's bad to go with them then. Safe in one way. Turns milk, makes fiddlestrings snap. Something about withering plants I read in a garden. Besides they say if the flower withers she wears she's a flirt. All are. Daresay she felt 1. When you feel like that you often meet what you feel. Liked me or what? Dress they look at. Always know a fellow courting: collars and cuffs. Well cocks and lions do the same and stags. Same time might prefer a tie undone or something. Trousers? Suppose I when I was? No. Gently does it. Dislike rough and tumble. Kiss in the dark and never tell. Saw something in me. Wonder what. Sooner have me as I am than some poet chap with bearsgrease plastery hair, lovelock over his dexter optic. To aid gentleman in literary. Ought to attend to my appearance my age. Didn't let her see me in profile. Still, you never know. Pretty girls and ugly men marrying. Beauty and the beast. Besides I can't be so if Molly. Took off her hat to show her hair. Wide brim. Bought to hide her face, meeting someone might know her, bend down or carry a bunch of flowers to smell. Hair strong in rut. Ten bob I got for Molly's combings when we were on the rocks in Holles street. Why not? Suppose he gave her money. Why not? All a prejudice. She's worth ten, fifteen, more, a pound. What? I think so. All that for nothing. Bold hand: Mrs Marion. Did I forget to write address on that letter like the postcard I sent to Flynn? And the day I went to Drimmie's without a necktie. Wrangle with Molly it was put me off. No, I remember. Richie Goulding: he's another. Weighs on his mind. Funny my watch stopped at half past four. Dust. Shark liver oil they use to clean. Could do it myself. Save. Was that just when he, she?\n\nO, he did. Into her. She did. Done.\n\nAh!\n\nMr Bloom with careful hand recomposed his wet shirt. O Lord, that little limping devil. Begins to feel cold and clammy. Aftereffect not pleasant. Still you have to get rid of it someway. They don't care. Complimented perhaps. Go home to nicey bread and milky and say night prayers with the kiddies. Well, aren't they? See her as she is spoil all. Must have the stage setting, the rouge, costume, position, music. The name too. Amours of actresses. Nell Gwynn, Mrs Bracegirdle, Maud Branscombe. Curtain up. Moonlight silver effulgence. Maiden discovered with pensive bosom. Little sweetheart come and kiss me. Still, I feel. The strength it gives a man. That's the secret of it. Good job I let off there behind the wall coming out of Dignam's. Cider that was. Otherwise I couldn't have. Makes you want to sing after. Lacaus esant taratara. Suppose I spoke to her. What about? Bad plan however if you don't know how to end the conversation. Ask them a question they ask you another. Good idea if you're stuck. Gain time. But then you're in a cart. Wonderful of course if you say: good evening, and you see she's on for it: good evening. O but the dark evening in the Appian way I nearly spoke to Mrs Clinch O thinking she was. Whew! Girl in Meath street that night. All the dirty things I made her say. All wrong of course. My arks she called it. It's so hard to find one who. Aho! If you don't answer when they solicit must be horrible for them till they harden. And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings. Parrots. Press the button and the bird will squeak. Wish she hadn't called me sir. O, her mouth in the dark! And you a married man with a single girl! That's what they enjoy. Taking a man from another woman. Or even hear of it. Different with me. Glad to get away from other chap's wife. Eating off his cold plate. Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle. French letter still in my pocketbook. Cause of half the trouble. But might happen sometime, I don't think. Come in, all is prepared. I dreamt. What? Worst is beginning. How they change the venue when it's not what they like. Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who. Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped. Yet if I went the whole hog, say: I want to, something like that. Because I did. She too. Offend her. Then make it up. Pretend to want something awfully, then cry off for her sake. Flatters them. She must have been thinking of someone else all the time. What harm? Must since she came to the use of reason, he, he and he. First kiss does the trick. The propitious moment. Something inside them goes pop. Mushy like, tell by their eye, on the sly. First thoughts are best. Remember that till their dying day. Molly, lieutenant Mulvey that kissed her under the Moorish wall beside the gardens. Fifteen she told me. But her breasts were developed. Fell asleep then. After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home. Featherbed mountain. Gnashing her teeth in sleep. Lord mayor had his eye on her too. Val Dillon. Apoplectic.\n\nThere she is with them down there for the fireworks. My fireworks. Up like a rocket, down like a stick. And the children, twins they must be, waiting for something to happen. Want to be grownups. Dressing in mother's clothes. Time enough, understand all the ways of the world. And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth. I knew she could whistle. Mouth made for that. Like Molly. Why that highclass whore in Jammet's wore her veil only to her nose. Would you mind, please, telling me the right time? I'll tell you the right time up a dark lane. Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning, cure for fat lips. Caressing the little boy too. Onlookers see most of the game. Of course they understand birds, animals, babies. In their line.\n\nDidn't look back when she was going down the strand. Wouldn't give that satisfaction. Those girls, those girls, those lovely seaside girls. Fine eyes she had, clear. It's the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil. Did she know what I? Course. Like a cat sitting beyond a dog's jump. Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show. Call that innocence? Poor idiot! His wife has her work cut out for her. Never see them sit on a bench marked Wet Paint. Eyes all over them. Look under the bed for what's not there. Longing to get the fright of their lives. Sharp as needles they are. When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking, thought she might like, twigged at once he had a false arm. Had, too. Where do they get that? Typist going up Roger Greene's stairs two at a time to show her understandings. Handed down from father to, mother to daughter, I mean. Bred in the bone. Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing. Best place for an ad to catch a woman's eye on a mirror. And when I sent her for Molly's Paisley shawl to Prescott's by the way that ad I must, carrying home the change in her stocking! Clever little minx. I never told her. Neat way she carries parcels too. Attract men, small thing like that. Holding up her hand, shaking it, to let the blood flow back when it was red. Who did you learn that from? Nobody. Something the nurse taught me. O, don't they know! Three years old she was in front of Molly's dressingtable, just before we left Lombard street west. Me have a nice pace. Mullingar. Who knows? Ways of the world. Young student. Straight on her pins anyway not like the other. Still she was game. Lord, I am wet. Devil you are. Swell of her calf. Transparent stockings, stretched to breaking point. Not like that frump today. A. E. Rumpled stockings. Or the one in Grafton street. White. Wow! Beef to the heel.\n\nA monkey puzzle rocket burst, spluttering in darting crackles. Zrads and zrads, zrads, zrads. And Cissy and Tommy and Jacky ran out to see and Edy after with the pushcar and then Gerty beyond the curve of the rocks. Will she? Watch! Watch! See! Looked round. She smelt an onion. Darling, I saw, your. I saw all.\n\nLord!\n\nDid me good all the same. Off colour after Kiernan's, Dignam's. For this relief much thanks. In Hamlet, that is. Lord! It was all things combined. Excitement. When she leaned back, felt an ache at the butt of my tongue. Your head it simply swirls. He's right. Might have made a worse fool of myself however. Instead of talking about nothing. Then I will tell you all. Still it was a kind of language between us. It couldn't be? No, Gerty they called her. Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin's barn a blind.\n\nHer maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown.\n\nPlace made me think of that I suppose. All tarred with the same brush Wiping pens in their stockings. But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood. Every bullet has its billet. Course I never could throw anything straight at school. Crooked as a ram's horn. Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa's pants will soon fit Willy and fuller's earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah. No soft job. Saves them. Keeps them out of harm's way. Nature. Washing child, washing corpse. Dignam. Children's hands always round them. Cocoanut skulls, monkeys, not even closed at first, sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds. Oughtn't to have given that child an empty teat to suck. Fill it up with wind. Mrs Beaufoy, Purefoy. Must call to the hospital. Wonder is nurse Callan there still. She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace. That young doctor O'Hare I noticed her brushing his coat. And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too, marriageable. Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms. Husband rolling in drunk, stink of pub off him like a polecat. Have that in your nose in the dark, whiff of stale boose. Then ask in the morning: was I drunk last night? Bad policy however to fault the husband. Chickens come home to roost. They stick by one another like glue. Maybe the women's fault also. That's where Molly can knock spots off them. It's the blood of the south. Moorish. Also the form, the figure. Hands felt for the opulent. Just compare for instance those others. Wife locked up at home, skeleton in the cupboard. Allow me to introduce my. Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript, wouldn't know what to call her. Always see a fellow's weak point in his wife. Still there's destiny in it, falling in love. Have their own secrets between them. Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn't take them in hand. Then little chits of girls, height of a shilling in coppers, with little hubbies. As God made them he matched them. Sometimes children turn out well enough. Twice nought makes one. Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride. Marry in May and repent in December. This wet is very unpleasant. Stuck. Well the foreskin is not back. Better detach.\n\nOw!\n\nOther hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket. Long and the short of it. Big he and little she. Very strange about my watch. Wristwatches are always going wrong. Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he. Yes, I suppose, at once. Cat's away, the mice will play. I remember looking in Pill lane. Also that now is magnetism. Back of everything magnetism. Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled. That causes movement. And time, well that's the time the movement takes. Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit. Because it's all arranged. Magnetic needle tells you what's going on in the sun, the stars. Little piece of steel iron. When you hold out the fork. Come. Come. Tip. Woman and man that is. Fork and steel. Molly, he. Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you're a man to see that and, like a sneeze coming, legs, look, look and if you have any guts in you. Tip. Have to let fly.\n\nWonder how is she feeling in that region. Shame all put on before third person. More put out about a hole in her stocking. Molly, her underjaw stuck out, head back, about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show. And when the painters were in Lombard street west. Fine voice that fellow had. How Giuglini began. Smell that I did. Like flowers. It was too. Violets. Came from the turpentine probably in the paint. Make their own use of everything. Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn't hear. But lots of them can't kick the beam, I think. Keep that thing up for hours. Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back.\n\nWait. Hm. Hm. Yes. That's her perfume. Why she waved her hand. I leave you this to think of me when I'm far away on the pillow. What is it? Heliotrope? No. Hyacinth? Hm. Roses, I think. She'd like scent of that kind. Sweet and cheap: soon sour. Why Molly likes opoponax. Suits her, with a little jessamine mixed. Her high notes and her low notes. At the dance night she met him, dance of the hours. Heat brought it out. She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before. Good conductor, is it? Or bad? Light too. Suppose there's some connection. For instance if you go into a cellar where it's dark. Mysterious thing too. Why did I smell it only now? Took its time in coming like herself, slow but sure. Suppose it's ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across. Yes, it is. Because those spice islands, Cinghalese this morning, smell them leagues off. Tell you what it is. It's like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin, fine like what do you call it gossamer, and they're always spinning it out of them, fine as anything, like rainbow colours without knowing it. Clings to everything she takes off. Vamp of her stockings. Warm shoe. Stays. Drawers: little kick, taking them off. Byby till next time. Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed. Know her smell in a thousand. Bathwater too. Reminds me of strawberries and cream. Wonder where it is really. There or the armpits or under the neck. Because you get it out of all holes and corners. Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something. Muskrat. Bag under their tails. One grain pour off odour for years. Dogs at each other behind. Good evening. Evening. How do you sniff? Hm. Hm. Very well, thank you. Animals go by that. Yes now, look at it that way. We're the same. Some women, instance, warn you off when they have their period. Come near. Then get a hogo you could hang your hat on. Like what? Potted herrings gone stale or. Boof! Please keep off the grass.\n\nPerhaps they get a man smell off us. What though? Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day. Breath? What you eat and drink gives that. No. Mansmell, I mean. Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different. Women buzz round it like flies round treacle. Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost. The tree of forbidden priest. O, father, will you? Let me be the first to. That diffuses itself all through the body, permeates. Source of life. And it's extremely curious the smell. Celery sauce. Let me.\n\nMr Bloom inserted his nose. Hm. Into the. Hm. Opening of his waistcoat. Almonds or. No. Lemons it is. Ah no, that's the soap.\n\nO by the by that lotion. I knew there was something on my mind. Never went back and the soap not paid. Dislike carrying bottles like that hag this morning. Hynes might have paid me that three shillings. I could mention Meagher's just to remind him. Still if he works that paragraph. Two and nine. Bad opinion of me he'll have. Call tomorrow. How much do I owe you? Three and nine? Two and nine, sir. Ah. Might stop him giving credit another time. Lose your customers that way. Pubs do. Fellows run up a bill on the slate and then slinking around the back streets into somewhere else.\n\nHere's this nobleman passed before. Blown in from the bay. Just went as far as turn back. Always at home at dinnertime. Looks mangled out: had a good tuck in. Enjoying nature now. Grace after meals. After supper walk a mile. Sure he has a small bank balance somewhere, government sit. Walk after him now make him awkward like those newsboys me today. Still you learn something. See ourselves as others see us. So long as women don't mock what matter? That's the way to find out. Ask yourself who is he now. The Mystery Man on the Beach, prize titbit story by Mr Leopold Bloom. Payment at the rate of one guinea per column. And that fellow today at the graveside in the brown macintosh. Corns on his kismet however. Healthy perhaps absorb all the. Whistle brings rain they say. Must be some somewhere. Salt in the Ormond damp. The body feels the atmosphere. Old Betty's joints are on the rack. Mother Shipton's prophecy that is about ships around they fly in the twinkling. No. Signs of rain it is. The royal reader. And distant hills seem coming nigh.\n\nHowth. Bailey light. Two, four, six, eight, nine. See. Has to change or they might think it a house. Wreckers. Grace Darling. People afraid of the dark. Also glowworms, cyclists: lightingup time. Jewels diamonds flash better. Women. Light is a kind of reassuring. Not going to hurt you. Better now of course than long ago. Country roads. Run you through the small guts for nothing. Still two types there are you bob against. Scowl or smile. Pardon! Not at all. Best time to spray plants too in the shade after the sun. Some light still. Red rays are longest. Roygbiv Vance taught us: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. A star I see. Venus? Can't tell yet. Two. When three it's night. Were those nightclouds there all the time? Looks like a phantom ship. No. Wait. Trees are they? An optical illusion. Mirage. Land of the setting sun this. Homerule sun setting in the southeast. My native land, goodnight.\n\nDew falling. Bad for you, dear, to sit on that stone. Brings on white fluxions. Never have little baby then less he was big strong fight his way up through. Might get piles myself. Sticks too like a summer cold, sore on the mouth. Cut with grass or paper worst. Friction of the position. Like to be that rock she sat on. O sweet little, you don't know how nice you looked. I begin to like them at that age. Green apples. Grab at all that offer. Suppose it's the only time we cross legs, seated. Also the library today: those girl graduates. Happy chairs under them. But it's the evening influence. They feel all that. Open like flowers, know their hours, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichokes, in ballrooms, chandeliers, avenues under the lamps. Nightstock in Mat Dillon's garden where I kissed her shoulder. Wish I had a full length oilpainting of her then. June that was too I wooed. The year returns. History repeats itself. Ye crags and peaks I'm with you once again. Life, love, voyage round your own little world. And now? Sad about her lame of course but must be on your guard not to feel too much pity. They take advantage.\n\nAll quiet on Howth now. The distant hills seem. Where we. The rhododendrons. I am a fool perhaps. He gets the plums, and I the plumstones. Where I come in. All that old hill has seen. Names change: that's all. Lovers: yum yum.\n\nTired I feel now. Will I get up? O wait. Drained all the manhood out of me, little wretch. She kissed me. Never again. My youth. Only once it comes. Or hers. Take the train there tomorrow. No. Returning not the same. Like kids your second visit to a house. The new I want. Nothing new under the sun. Care of P. O. Dolphin's Barn. Are you not happy in your? Naughty darling. At Dolphin's barn charades in Luke Doyle's house. Mat Dillon and his bevy of daughters: Tiny, Atty, Floey, Maimy, Louy, Hetty. Molly too. Eightyseven that was. Year before we. And the old major, partial to his drop of spirits. Curious she an only child, I an only child. So it returns. Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home. And just when he and she. Circus horse walking in a ring. Rip van Winkle we played. Rip: tear in Henny Doyle's overcoat. Van: breadvan delivering. Winkle: cockles and periwinkles. Then I did Rip van Winkle coming back. She leaned on the sideboard watching. Moorish eyes. Twenty years asleep in Sleepy Hollow. All changed. Forgotten. The young are old. His gun rusty from the dew.\n\nBa. What is that flying about? Swallow? Bat probably. Thinks I'm a tree, so blind. Have birds no smell? Metempsychosis. They believed you could be changed into a tree from grief. Weeping willow. Ba. There he goes. Funny little beggar. Wonder where he lives. Belfry up there. Very likely. Hanging by his heels in the odour of sanctity. Bell scared him out, I suppose. Mass seems to be over. Could hear them all at it. Pray for us. And pray for us. And pray for us. Good idea the repetition. Same thing with ads. Buy from us. And buy from us. Yes, there's the light in the priest's house. Their frugal meal. Remember about the mistake in the valuation when I was in Thom's. Twentyeight it is. Two houses they have. Gabriel Conroy's brother is curate. Ba. Again. Wonder why they come out at night like mice. They're a mixed breed. Birds are like hopping mice. What frightens them, light or noise? Better sit still. All instinct like the bird in drouth got water out of the end of a jar by throwing in pebbles. Like a little man in a cloak he is with tiny hands. Weeny bones. Almost see them shimmering, kind of a bluey white. Colours depend on the light you see. Stare the sun for example like the eagle then look at a shoe see a blotch blob yellowish. Wants to stamp his trademark on everything. Instance, that cat this morning on the staircase. Colour of brown turf. Say you never see them with three colours. Not true. That half tabbywhite tortoiseshell in the City Arms with the letter em on her forehead. Body fifty different colours. Howth a while ago amethyst. Glass flashing. That's how that wise man what's his name with the burning glass. Then the heather goes on fire. It can't be tourists' matches. What? Perhaps the sticks dry rub together in the wind and light. Or broken bottles in the furze act as a burning glass in the sun. Archimedes. I have it! My memory's not so bad.\n\nBa. Who knows what they're always flying for. Insects? That bee last week got into the room playing with his shadow on the ceiling. Might be the one bit me, come back to see. Birds too. Never find out. Or what they say. Like our small talk. And says she and says he. Nerve they have to fly over the ocean and back. Lots must be killed in storms, telegraph wires. Dreadful life sailors have too. Big brutes of oceangoing steamers floundering along in the dark, lowing out like seacows. Faugh a Ballagh! Out of that, bloody curse to you! Others in vessels, bit of a handkerchief sail, pitched about like snuff at a wake when the stormy winds do blow. Married too. Sometimes away for years at the ends of the earth somewhere. No ends really because it's round. Wife in every port they say. She has a good job if she minds it till Johnny comes marching home again. If ever he does. Smelling the tail end of ports. How can they like the sea? Yet they do. The anchor's weighed. Off he sails with a scapular or a medal on him for luck. Well. And the tephilim no what's this they call it poor papa's father had on his door to touch. That brought us out of the land of Egypt and into the house of bondage. Something in all those superstitions because when you go out never know what dangers. Hanging on to a plank or astride of a beam for grim life, lifebelt round him, gulping salt water, and that's the last of his nibs till the sharks catch hold of him. Do fish ever get seasick?\n\nThen you have a beautiful calm without a cloud, smooth sea, placid, crew and cargo in smithereens, Davy Jones' locker, moon looking down so peaceful. Not my fault, old cockalorum.\n\nA last lonely candle wandered up the sky from Mirus bazaar in search of funds for Mercer's hospital and broke, drooping, and shed a cluster of violet but one white stars. They floated, fell: they faded. The shepherd's hour: the hour of folding: hour of tryst. From house to house, giving his everwelcome double knock, went the nine o'clock postman, the glowworm's lamp at his belt gleaming here and there through the laurel hedges. And among the five young trees a hoisted lintstock lit the lamp at Leahy's terrace. By screens of lighted windows, by equal gardens a shrill voice went crying, wailing: Evening Telegraph, stop press edition! Result of the Gold Cup race! and from the door of Dignam's house a boy ran out and called. Twittering the bat flew here, flew there. Far out over the sands the coming surf crept, grey. Howth settled for slumber, tired of long days, of yumyum rhododendrons (he was old) and felt gladly the night breeze lift, ruffle his fell of ferns. He lay but opened a red eye unsleeping, deep and slowly breathing, slumberous but awake. And far on Kish bank the anchored lightship twinkled, winked at Mr Bloom.\n\nLife those chaps out there must have, stuck in the same spot. Irish Lights board. Penance for their sins. Coastguards too. Rocket and breeches buoy and lifeboat. Day we went out for the pleasure cruise in the Erin's King, throwing them the sack of old papers. Bears in the zoo. Filthy trip. Drunkards out to shake up their livers. Puking overboard to feed the herrings. Nausea. And the women, fear of God in their faces. Milly, no sign of funk. Her blue scarf loose, laughing. Don't know what death is at that age. And then their stomachs clean. But being lost they fear. When we hid behind the tree at Crumlin. I didn't want to. Mamma! Mamma! Babes in the wood. Frightening them with masks too. Throwing them up in the air to catch them. I'll murder you. Is it only half fun? Or children playing battle. Whole earnest. How can people aim guns at each other. Sometimes they go off. Poor kids! Only troubles wildfire and nettlerash. Calomel purge I got her for that. After getting better asleep with Molly. Very same teeth she has. What do they love? Another themselves? But the morning she chased her with the umbrella. Perhaps so as not to hurt. I felt her pulse. Ticking. Little hand it was: now big. Dearest Papli. All that the hand says when you touch. Loved to count my waistcoat buttons. Her first stays I remember. Made me laugh to see. Little paps to begin with. Left one is more sensitive, I think. Mine too. Nearer the heart? Padding themselves out if fat is in fashion. Her growing pains at night, calling, wakening me. Frightened she was when her nature came on her first. Poor child! Strange moment for the mother too. Brings back her girlhood. Gibraltar. Looking from Buena Vista. O'Hara's tower. The seabirds screaming. Old Barbary ape that gobbled all his family. Sundown, gunfire for the men to cross the lines. Looking out over the sea she told me. Evening like this, but clear, no clouds. I always thought I'd marry a lord or a rich gentleman coming with a private yacht. Buenas noches, se\u00f1orita. El hombre ama la muchacha hermosa. Why me? Because you were so foreign from the others.\n\nBetter not stick here all night like a limpet. This weather makes you dull. Must be getting on for nine by the light. Go home. Too late for Leah, Lily of Killarney. No. Might be still up. Call to the hospital to see. Hope she's over. Long day I've had. Martha, the bath, funeral, house of Keyes, museum with those goddesses, Dedalus' song. Then that bawler in Barney Kiernan's. Got my own back there. Drunken ranters what I said about his God made him wince. Mistake to hit back. Or? No. Ought to go home and laugh at themselves. Always want to be swilling in company. Afraid to be alone like a child of two. Suppose he hit me. Look at it other way round. Not so bad then. Perhaps not to hurt he meant. Three cheers for Israel. Three cheers for the sister-in-law he hawked about, three fangs in her mouth. Same style of beauty. Particularly nice old party for a cup of tea. The sister of the wife of the wild man of Borneo has just come to town. Imagine that in the early morning at close range. Everyone to his taste as Morris said when he kissed the cow. But Dignam's put the boots on it. Houses of mourning so depressing because you never know. Anyhow she wants the money. Must call to those Scottish Widows as I promised. Strange name. Takes it for granted we're going to pop off first. That widow on Monday was it outside Cramer's that looked at me. Buried the poor husband but progressing favourably on the premium. Her widow's mite. Well? What do you expect her to do? Must wheedle her way along. Widower I hate to see. Looks so forlorn. Poor man O'Connor wife and five children poisoned by mussels here. The sewage. Hopeless. Some good matronly woman in a porkpie hat to mother him. Take him in tow, platter face and a large apron. Ladies' grey flannelette bloomers, three shillings a pair, astonishing bargain. Plain and loved, loved for ever, they say. Ugly: no woman thinks she is. Love, lie and be handsome for tomorrow we die. See him sometimes walking about trying to find out who played the trick. U. p: up. Fate that is. He, not me. Also a shop often noticed. Curse seems to dog it. Dreamt last night? Wait. Something confused. She had red slippers on. Turkish. Wore the breeches. Suppose she does? Would I like her in pyjamas? Damned hard to answer. Nannetti's gone. Mailboat. Near Holyhead by now. Must nail that ad of Keyes's. Work Hynes and Crawford. Petticoats for Molly. She has something to put in them. What's that? Might be money.\n\nMr Bloom stooped and turned over a piece of paper on the strand. He brought it near his eyes and peered. Letter? No. Can't read. Better go. Better. I'm tired to move. Page of an old copybook. All those holes and pebbles. Who could count them? Never know what you find. Bottle with story of a treasure in it, thrown from a wreck. Parcels post. Children always want to throw things in the sea. Trust? Bread cast on the waters. What's this? Bit of stick.\n\nO! Exhausted that female has me. Not so young now. Will she come here tomorrow? Wait for her somewhere for ever. Must come back. Murderers do. Will I?\n\nMr Bloom with his stick gently vexed the thick sand at his foot. Write a message for her. Might remain. What?\nI.\n\nSome flatfoot tramp on it in the morning. Useless. Washed away. Tide comes here. Saw a pool near her foot. Bend, see my face there, dark mirror, breathe on it, stirs. All these rocks with lines and scars and letters. O, those transparent! Besides they don't know. What is the meaning of that other world. I called you naughty boy because I do not like.\nAM. A.\n\nNo room. Let it go.\n\nMr Bloom effaced the letters with his slow boot. Hopeless thing sand. Nothing grows in it. All fades. No fear of big vessels coming up here. Except Guinness's barges. Round the Kish in eighty days. Done half by design.\n\nHe flung his wooden pen away. The stick fell in silted sand, stuck. Now if you were trying to do that for a week on end you couldn't. Chance. We'll never meet again. But it was lovely. Goodbye, dear. Thanks. Made me feel so young.\n\nShort snooze now if I had. Must be near nine. Liverpool boat long gone.. Not even the smoke. And she can do the other. Did too. And Belfast. I won't go. Race there, race back to Ennis. Let him. Just close my eyes a moment. Won't sleep, though. Half dream. It never comes the same. Bat again. No harm in him. Just a few.\n\nO sweety all your little girlwhite up I saw dirty bracegirdle made me do love sticky we two naughty Grace darling she him half past the bed met him pike hoses frillies for Raoul de perfume your wife black hair heave under embon se\u00f1orita young eyes Mulvey plump bubs me breadvan Winkle red slippers she rusty sleep wander years of dreams return tail end Agendath swoony lovey showed me her next year in drawers return next in her next her next.\n\nA bat flew. Here. There. Here. Far in the grey a bell chimed. Mr Bloom with open mouth, his left boot sanded sideways, leaned, breathed. Just for a few\n\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\nCuckoo.\n\nThe clock on the mantelpiece in the priest's house cooed where Canon O'Hanlon and Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.

He starts handing them out]\nCartman:\tHere you go, Kyle... And here's yours, Stan...\nKyle:\tWhat is this, Cartman?\nCartman:\tThey're invitations to my birthday party this weekend.\nStan:\tOh, sweet! Your mom's giving you a big party again this year?\nCartman:\tThaat's right. 'Cause it's my birthday, my bu bubu birthday...\nKyle:\tKick ass, dude! Cartman's mom throws the best birthday parties ever.\nCartman:\tThat's right.\nStan:\tYeah. If my mom could cook like Cartman's mom, I'd be a big fatass, too.\nCartman:\tThat's ri-aayy.\nPip:\tOh, Eric. I didn't get an invitation.\nCartman:\t[darting over] Oh, really? Gosh. Where could I have put Pip's invitation?? Let's see, Pip's invitation, Pip's invitation... Oh! I remember! [Pip smiles hopefully] I shoved it up my ass! [Pip's hopes are dashed] Yeess, that's right. I wrote it out, put it in an envelope, sealed it, and then shoved it right up my ass, forever ruining any chance you had of coming to my birthday party! Sorry, Pip ol' chap! [moves on] Here's yours, Wendy... and here's yours, Clyde...\nMr. Garrison:\t[excitedly] Children, children! Today is a very special day.\nCartman:\tNo, my birthday isn't until Saturday.\nMr. Garrison:\tI'm not talking about your birthday, Eric. We have a new student joining our class today.\nCartman:\tEeeeeeh!\nMr. Garrison:\tNow, some of you know what it's like to be the new kid in town, so I want you all to take special care to make him feel welcome. I want you all to meet our new classmate... [leans down to the new kid] uh-uh, what's your name again?\nNew kid:\tDamien! [dark music plays: Rectus...dominus... His eyes show flaming, crackling pupils]\nMr. Garrison:\tSay 'hi' to Damien! [silence] And where are you from, Damien?\nDamien:\tThe seventh layer of hell!\nMr. Garrison:\tOoooh, that's exciting, my mother was from Alabama. [Damien goes around the teacher's desk and hops up on it, kicking away the apple. Garrison steps aside]\nDamien:\tMy arrival shall note the end of the Beginning, the beginning of the End, the new reign of my father! [... rectus... cheesy poofs... ]\nMr. Garrison:\tYour father?\nDamien:\tThe Prince of Darkness!\nMr. Garrison:\tWow, we have royalty in our class. Why don't you take your seat, Damien? We're gonna finish our lesson on great singers of the Baroque era. [Damien hops down and goes to sit next to Cartman] Now, children, Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass...\nCartman:\tHey, new kid. Do you want an invitation to my birthday party?\nDamien:\tHere begins the rule of pain! The new domination of...\nCartman:\tPsych! I wasn't gonna give you an invitation, hehehehehehe! Hey, who cut your hair? Stevie Wonder? [Rectus... dominus... Damien turns to him and concentrates. Cartman's desk suddenly turns over and dumps Cartman onto the floor] Byah. Oof! [the desk goes out the window. The class sits up]\nStan:\tWhoa, dude! [sancti... ]\nKyle:\tDamn, what a freak!\nCartman:\t[getting up] Hey! I had a poofy pie in that desk!

[he blinks]\nCartman:\tEheh. You got in trouble, you got in trouble.\n[The cafeteria: the boys already have their lunches]\nStan:\tHey, Cartman? How come the birthday invitation you gave me says 'Green Mega Man'?\nKyle:\tYeah. Mine says 'Red Mega Man'.\nCartman:\tRight. That's what your supposed to get for my birthday.\nStan:\tDude. You're not supposed to tell people what to get you for your birthday.\nKyle:\tYeah, that's weak!\nCartman:\tLook, it's very simple guys. Green Mega Man goes with Red Mega Man and Yellow Mega Man to make the Ultra Mega Mega Man. You have to have all three or it doesn't work, see?\nStan:\tUp yours. Cartman. I'll get you whatever the hell I want. [crumples up the invitation and throws it away]\nCartman:\tOooh. So maybe you don't want to have any of my mon's cake, pie, and ice cream, then.\nStan:\tOh great, Green Mega Man it is. [food wins out over principle]\nCartman:\tNow. As you can see, Kenny, you are to get me Yellow Mega Man. That's because Yellow Mega Man is the cheapest one, and I know how poor your family is. [Damien arrives]\nStan:\tHeeyy, what do you think you're doing, new kid?\nCartman:\tYeah. You can't sit with us, weirdo!\nDamien:\tInfidels! I will turn you all into beasts of burden!\nKyle:\tYou can't sit with us, new kid. Go find another table! [Damien walks off]\nCartman:\tYich. Anyway Kenny, Yellow Man is only $8.95, so maybe your mom can put it on layaway and make payments for a year or two. [Stan and Kyle laugh, then Cartman laughs. Kenny punches him] Eeyy!\nPip:\t[As Damien approaches] Oh. Good day, Damien. My name is Philip, but everyone calls me Pip - because they hate me.\nDamien:\tThen I will call you Pip.\nPip:\tRight-o.\nStan:\tHey new kid! [Cartman turns around. Kenny is already facing him] Kenny says he saw... your mother drop you off this morning, and she's a real dog.\nKenny:\t(Yeah, I feel that she's a freakin' bitch!)\nDamien:\tThat does it! Woo-paah [points his index fingers at Kenny. ... rectus... dominus... Kenny trembles for a moment, and then a moment of silence]\nStan:\tWhat the... ?\nKyle:\tDude! He turned Kenny into a duck-billed platypus.\nStan:\tA what?\nKenny:\tQuack-quack.\nCartman:\tEeyy! Uh-turn him back you butthole, he has to buy me the Yellow Mega Man!\nChef:\t[coming up behind them] Hello there, children.\nStan:\tHey, Chef.\nChef:\tHow's it going?\nKyle:\tBad.\nChef:\tWhy bad?\nKyle:\tChef, there's a new kid in school, and he's a total weirdo freak.\nChef:\tOh children, children, you shouldn't not like somebody just because they're different. Here, let me sing you a little song:\nWe're all special in our own way\nEverybody's different, but that's okay\n'Cause even though we might-a have different-colored skin\nDifferent points of view, be tall or thin\nIt doesn't mean I can't lay you down, woman, and touch your silky skin\n[a psychedelic scene appears behind him]\nWith my love deep inside you, where no man has ever been\n[he stands behind a lovely black woman wearing trunks and a big smile]\nRub you legs, caress your thighs and uh...\n[he floats on a cloud with a lovely white woman, then he's back in the cafeteria]\nWhat were we talking about again?\nKyle:\tThe new kid.\nDamien:\t[standing on a table] Death to the holy! The wrath of the fallen angels now heads for you all! [Rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs... Pip's cap flies off, followed by milk and lunch trays, large tote bags, wall poster, clocks... ]\nStan:\tWhoa!\nChef:\tOh! That is one fudged-up little cracker! [... footballs, bunnyfish, desks, telephones, fire alarms, rifles... ]\nKyle:\tWe told you, dude. [Kids scream. Pip is awestruck. Kids and lunch tables begin to rise and fly around.]\nChef:\tWe've got to do something, children! [Mr. Hankey flies by, then K. C., then a cow (think Twister)]\nDamien:\tBring me Jesus! My wrath shall continue until I speak to Jesus! [... rectus... dominus... cheesy poofs... rectus... dominus... ]\nStan, Kyle:\tJesus?\n[The set of Jesus and Pals. Jesus freshens up, and Roland the cameraman comes in]\nRoland:\tTwo minutes to air, Jesus.\nJesus:\tThanks, Roland. Blessed art thou. [Stan and Kyle dash in]\nStan:\tJesus, Jesus!\nJesus:\tAh-hi kids, I only do autographs after the show.\nStan:\tNono. There's a big problem at school. Some new kid showed up, wearing all black, and and Chef thinks he's evil.\nKyle:\tYeah. Look what he did to our friend, Kenny.\nKenny:\tQuack-quack.\nJesus:\tWow. That's pretty heavy.\nStan:\tThis new kid, he just keeps throwing things around and... saying stuff aboout his dark prince father coming. He says he wants to talk to you.\nJesus:\tThe Dark Prince?\nStan:\tYeah.\nKyle:\tYeah.\nJesus:\tSo it was written, and so the cycle of years brings the Son of the Evil One.\nStan:\t[to Kyle] Whoa. Huduh now he's talking like the new kid.\nJesus:\tThou must taketh me to this seedling of Satan, so mine eyes can confirm the wretched truth.\nKyle:\t... K.\n[School playground]\nGroundskeeper:\tFive minutes until recess is over, you little bastards!\n[Cartman is heard speaking. Three kids look at him: Wendy, Clyde, and a third student who is taking notes. Cartman stands next to an easel, pointing at drawings he made earlier. A fourth kid joins them later]\nCartman:\tNow, as you can see, the Red Mega Man uses thee... Mega Cycle, which is what Clyde will be getting me for my birthday. Wendy, you were supposed to get me the Mega Power Choopper, illustrated... here, but, I'm changing your present to the Yellow Mega Man, since Kenny has been turned into a... duck-billed platypus. That means that the Mega Man beach house, illustrated... heuh, will be a gift given by two people at once, 'cause it costs more money... [a footbal lands in front of Damien, who sets fire to it.

I know it's hard being the new kid, but the children may accept you someday.\nDamien:\tI don't need acceptance. I'm the Son of Satan! [torches the jungle gym. Butters screams as he falls off]\nPip:\tBelieve me! I know what it's like not to have friends. Perhaps you should speak to the school counselor. He helps me a lot when I'm feeling lonely.

Then the terms will be discussed!\nJesus:\tVery well. Let the final battle between Good and Evil be fought - right here in South Park!\nJimbo:\tCome on, Ned! We've got to get our asses to the bookie!

Uh, being the new kid can be tough, but I'm your friend, mkay?\nDamien:\tEverybody hates me!\nMr. Mackey:\tWell-uh. Why do you suppose that is?\nDamien:\tBecause I'm the son of the Devil?\nMr. Mackey:\tUhuh. That's a good start, why else?\nDamien:\tBecause I... burn them and kill them?\nMr. Mackey:\tWell yeah, maybe that's it. Wha... wha what you need to do, uh Damien, is - is to be overly nice. Nde no no matter how mean the other kids are to you, just don't retaliate. Yeeu be passive, mkay? That's what I taught the little British boy, Pip, and, and just look at how much the other children like him now.\n[The playground. Bebe, K. C., the other blonde girl, and Clyde surround Pip]\nClyde:\tI bet I can spit the most on him. [spits, and it lands on Pip's left shoulder]\nBebe:\tOh yeah? I bet I can spit in his hair. [spits, and it lands on his right eye]\nPip:\tEho. Nice try. A little higher and you've got it.\nStan:\tDamn, recess sucks without any slides or nothin'\nCartman:\t[Sees Damien coming] Oh, here comes the unholy butthole now. Ey! Thanks a lot for burning everything down, you little bitch!\nDamien:\tI a - pologize for ruining your playground. And turning your friend into a duck-billed platypus. I was doing my father's bidding. I didn't have a choice. [a sequence of blinks hints as to the boys' response. Cartman moves closer to Damien]\nCartman:\t[farts and moves away] Oh, excuse me new kid. I didn't mean to fart on you, I didn't have a choice! [Damien is angry, but restrains himself]\nStan:\tPhew! You stink, new kid. You smell like a fart.\nKyle:\tYeah. We're gonna call you Fartboy from now on.\nStan:\tBubye, Fartboy.\nKyle:\tSee ya.\nPip:\tGood day, Damien. How are you?\nDamien:\tThose guys farted on me, and then called me-\nPip:\tFartboy? Oho good. Perhaps they won't call me that anymore.\n[Skeeter's bar; people are having drinks. Chef is at the bar talking to someone. Jesus throws open the doors and enters]\nJesus:\tAhm-hm-hm! Excuse me, I just talked to the bookie at the sports betting bar-\nChef:\tOh ooh. [a woman at a nearby table whistles the same thing]\nJesus:\tI have been forsaken! It seems that several bets were changed to Satan this morning. [Two men at the bar look at each other] In fact, it seems that only one person in this entire town is still betting on me!\nPriest:\tYou should all be ashamed of yourselves, betting against your Lord and Savior! I am disgusted!\nJesus:\tYour bet was changed as well. You forsaked me too!\nPriest:\tOho... Right, well... He does have a couple of hundred pounds on you, Jesus.\nJesus:\tI implore you all: don't bet on the Dark One. It is a bet that you will never win.\nPriest:\tJesus, I am sorry I have sinned against you. I'm gonna march right over to that bookie and change my bet right now!\nMr. Garrison:\tOh, ye- yeah, yeah, me too, me too.\nJimbo:\tYeah.\nPriest:\tPraise the Lo-hohohord! Thank you sweet Jesus for showing us the light! See ya later. [Jesus turns and walks out] What the hell, does he think we're all crazy?\nMr. Garrison:\tYeah, crazy. [Two men that look like Bill and Fosse chortle behind him]\nMan 3:\tHe's so gay.\nMan 4:\tYeah. [The two men seen earlier toast the comments, and Jesus looks in once more.]\nJesus:\tYou're all a bunch of Judases!\n[Outside the bar. Jesus runs into Stan, Kyle, and Kenny]\nStan:\tHey, Jesus.\nJesus:\tWhat are you doing out so late, kids?\nKyle:\tWe have to find Red and Green Mega Man for Cartman's birthday party.\nJesus:\tOh. Kids, yeyou believe I can beat Satan, right?\nStan:\tSh-sure, dude, you're the Son of God.\nKyle:\tYeah. You aren't having any doubts, are you?\nJesus:\tNo, uh-no, no. But could ya help me train a little?\n[Satan's press conference. At least three television stations (4, 11, and 38) have crews present]\nReporter 1:\tSatan, what do expect the outcome of the fight to be?\nSatan:\tI will crush him like a little bug!\nReporter 2:\tSatan, what about the rumors of your involvement in the Gulf War? [Satan thinks a moment, then begins to answer, but a hand covers his mouth]\nDon King:\tLet's focus on the fight, can we please? I'm so sick of people talkin' smack about my fighters, all this 'He's mean. He's a dirty fighter. He's the cause for all the violence and death in the world.' It's just getting old. Let's just let everything be decided in the ring.\n[A training room. Jesus is working on a punching bag while Stan and Kyle look on. Cartman enters]\nCartman:\tYou guys, shouldn't you be out shopping for my birthday presents?\nStan:\tHere Jesus, drink these raw eggs.\nJesus:\tNo way, dude!\nChef:\t[in the ring] Ah-ah-ah I can't. I can't hit Jesus Christ. My mother would never speak to me again.\nStan:\tBut you're his sparring partner, Chef.\nKyle:\tYeah, you have to hit him.\nJesus:\tSatan must be defeated, Chef! Please help me to train.\nChef:\tOkay. But I'm just gonna tap you. Alright?\nJesus:\tGive it your best sho- [poof] Oh! [falls back to the floor]\nChef:\tOh! God in Heaven! What have I done?!\nJesus:\tAnybody get the number of that truck? [drops his head]\n[Cartman's birthday party; several balloons are tethered to the banner. Carnival music plays. Two elephants are present, as is the Ferris wheel, all in the backyard]\nLiane:\tCome on, kiddies. Eat more.\nCartman:\t[greeting children as they come in with their presents] Welcome, Clyde. Please put your present on the table to your left. Welcome, Bebe, presents go to your left. Welcome, Chef.\nChef:\tYup! Here's your present, children. [hands Cartman his gift] Well, uhnice party. Uh, see ya later.\nKyle:\tHey, you just got here, Chef!\nChef:\tI know, but the fight is starting.\nStan:\tDude, check it out. Cartman's mom made chili.\nMrs Cartman:\t[turning to see what Stan said, and sees Chef] Mmmmm.\nChef:\tMmmmm. That's my favorite kind of chili.\n[On the sidewalk in front of Cartman's house, Damien and Pip sit]\nDamien:\tI guess all the kids are at that fat boy's party.\nPip:\tYes. It's always such a huge event. Sometimes, I like to sneak up to the fence and close my eyes, and pretend I'm there.\nDamien:\tThe other kids have always hated you?\nPip:\tOh yes. Actually I think they make fun of the fat boy a lot too,... but now I think they like him because he picks on me. [Damien gets an idea]\n[South Park Forum]\nMichael Buffer:\tIn the blue corner, wearing white trunks, weighing in at a mere 140 lbs., Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ! [the crowd cheers] And in the very very blllack corner, wearing very very blllack trunks, the king of all that is evilll, Beeeeeelzebub! [the crowd now cheers for Satan. Jesus turns and glowers at them, and they shrink away] Ladies and gentlemen, Lllllet's get ready to rumbllllle!!\nReferee:\tOkay, I want a good clean fight guys. No punches below the belt, holding, or miracles. [the bell rings]\n[Cartman's birthday party. A carnie does tricks. Damien enters with Pip in tow]\nCartman:\tHey! What the hell do you think you're doing here?\nStan:\tYeah, you weren't invited, new kid.\nKyle:\tAnd neither were you, Pip!\nPip:\tYes. I tried to tell Damien that we weren't invited, but-\nDamien:\tWait a minute! Give me a chance. I want to do something special for your party. [His eye flare up again. Rectus... dominus... Damien taps Pip on the shoulder and the ground opens up.]\nPip:\t[Small demons grab him. ... sancti... cheesy poofs... ] Aaaa! [He is launched like a rocket] Aye Aye Aye Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee! [He gives off fireworks]\nKyle:\tWow!\nStan:\tWhoa, that was cool! [The children, Bebe, Wendy, and Clyde among them, look up and are duly impressed. They applaud]\nKyle:\tHey, you're not such a bad guy after all, Damien.\nCartman:\tYeah. Come on in and join the party. [Damien is pleased]\n[South Park Forum, round 2. Satan and Jesus meet up. Satan gives Jesus a hard left, throwing him against the ropes. The crowd cheers. Jesus looks back, and they are silent. Jesus turns to fight, but receives a blow in the abdomen, again stumbling to the ropes. Satan gives him a left cross. Satan stands back, and Jesus' halo now flutters all over the place]\nSatan:\tCome on, you little wuss, fight! Throw a punch!\n[Cartman's birthday party. He is now opening his presents]\nCartman:\tOooh I wonder what Stan got me for my birthday present? Oh look, a Blue Mega Maaan. Thank you, Stan, you may now eat pie and cake and ice cream now. [Stan leaves] And what did Wendy get me? Oooh it's the Yellow Mega Maaan. Help yourself to pie and cake and ice cream, Wendy.[she leaves] Oh, look what Kyle got me? It's the Red Mega-...

DIE!!\nKyle:\t[At the same time] Aaaaaaaa!\nCartman:\t[getting up and moving towards the center of the yard] That's it! Party is over! [the kids look glum] Everybody go home! [he turns the party switch off. Music slows to a stop, everything goes dark, and the banner floats away] GET THE HELL OUT, I SAID! THE PARTY'S OVER! GET OUT, GODDAMMIT! [Stan and Kyle stop]\nStan:\tWhoa, dude, you need to mellow out!\nCartman:\tTake your stupid Ants In The Pants with you! [Throws it at Kyle, who is felled by it. The kids regroup in front of the house]\nDamien:\tWow. That kid has some emotional problems.\nStan:\tAaanh, he does this all the time.\nChef:\tCome on, children! We can still catch the end of the fight!\nPip:\t[descending] Ooooooooooooooooooooooo uf! Ohoho, what a splendid par-ty.\n[South Park Forum, a later round. Satan gives Jesus a fierce left, launching him into the air and against the ropes again. Jesus comes forward, and Satan gives him a right to the face.]\nJesus:\tOh! [backs up helplessly]\nSatan:\tFight, dammit! [gives him another right to the face]\nJesus:\tOow! [Satan pick him up] Ooooooh! [throws him against the rope, then gives him another right to the face. Jesus now has a swollen left eye]\nStan:\t[as he, Kyle, and Kenny approach Jesus' corner] Dude, Jesus is getting his butt kicked! [the round ends] You've got to fight, Jesus.\nJesus:\tWhy? What's the point? Nobody believes in me. Everyone put their money on Satan. My Father forsaked me, the town forsaked me... I'm completely forsook.\nKyle:\tSomebody bet on you, Jesus. You said yourself that one person still had money on you.\nJesus:\tIt doesn't matter. He's way too strong for me anyway-I give up.\nStan:\tGoddammit Jesus, snap out of it! What would Nancy Kerrigan do, huh? Mancy Kerrigan wouldn't give up. When things were looking their darkest, Nancy Kerrigan fought to be the best. [Kyle looks at him] She wouldn't stop until she was Number One!\nKyle:\tUuuuh. Stan?\nStan:\tNancy Kerrigan wouldn't settle for second-best!\nKyle:\tStan.\nStan:\tShe wouldn't quit until she brought home the gold!\nKyle:\tStan!\nStan:\t[turning to Kyle] What?\nKyle:\tNancy Kerrigan got the silver, dude. She came in second.\nStan:\t[thinks a moment] ... Really?\nKyle:\tYeah, dude!\nStan:\tHoh, never mind, Jesus. Nancy Kerrigan sucks. [Jesus takes a ladleful of water from a pail next to him] You know, somebody once said. 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man'\nJesus:\t... Who said that?\nStan:\tYou did, Jesus. [Jesus ponders these words as he looks at Satan]\nJesus:\tYou're right, Stan. Thank you, boys! [gets up as the next round begins and fights without his halo]\nKyle:\tWow. Did he say that in the Bible?\nStan:\tNah, I saw it on Star Trek.\nKyle:\tHmmm.\nSatan:\t[Satan takes a couple of swing at Jesus, but Jesus ducks them] Come on, sissy. Hit me! Hit me!\nJesus:\tOkay, pal. You asked for it! [The crowd looks on as Jesus prepares to punch Satan. Jesus delivers the blow, but nothing happens. The sound of escaping air is heard. Stan just buries his head in his hands in disbelief]\nSatan:\t[protecting his ribs] Ooooooh, you got me. [drops flat on his back]\nReferee:\tOne... Two... Three...\nJimbo:\tNo way! He barely touched him!\nReferee:\t... Seven... Eight [Satan opens his left eye, then closes it again.]... Nine... Ten. You're out! [The match ends, and Jesus jumps up in victory]\nStan, Kyle:\tOur Savior!\nMichael Buffer:\tThe winner by knockout and still undisputed ruler of your spiritual kingdommmm, Jesus, El Saviooor-rrrrrrrrrr, Christ! [Satan pops right back up]\nMr. Garrison:\tHey, he isn't hurt. He took a dive, he threw the fight!\nJimbo:\tYeah!\nSatan:\tFools! You are all fools! Of course I took a dive. Don't you see? Who do you think was the one person that bet on Jesus to win? [The crowd wonders] Me, you idiots! And now I will take all your hard-earned money, and return to Hell a much richer Prince of Darkness, and buy some realty. HA HA HA HA HAA! [dances out of the ring]\nPriest:\tI don't believe this!\nMr. Garrison:\tYeah, what a mean thing to do!\nSatan:\t[now on the Forum floor] Farewell, fools!\nJimbo:\tMan, that guy is a jerk. [Satan dances away and Stan enters the ring]\nStan:\t[over the microphone] Jesus told you guys not to bet on Satan.\nMr. Garrison:\tBoy, did we get screwed.\nChef:\tJesus, we're sorry. Can you ever forgive us?\nJesus:\tAw heck. [puts his halo back on] Do I have a choice? [The crowd cheers with relief]\nJimbo:\tWell, Jesus, I definitely learned my lesson. Neeever bet on evil, 'cause when you d- Ned! Look, there's a rare duck-billed platypus! [Kenny is highlighted] Ih-it's comin' right for us! [pulls out a semi-automatic and fires away at Kenny. Kenny is soon on the floor with his head blown off.]\nStan:\tOh my God, they killed Kenny.\nKyle:\tYou bastard!\nDamien:\tWell, goodbye, guys. It was nice getting to know you. [rats swarm all over Kenny's head]\nStan:\tYou're leaving already?\nDamien:\tI have to. My dad's always on the move. [the rats leave also]\nStan:\tWow. I feel kinda bad for that kid.\nKyle:\tYeah. Just when he was being accepted he has to leave and start over.\nStan:\tParents can be so cruel. Don't they realize that what a child needs more than anything is security?\n[Cartman's backyard. He's the only one at the picnic table, and it's still full of food. Cartman looks full, though]\nLiane:\tMore pie, hon?\nCartman:\tEh... n-yeh.

Hennigan, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, 1974\n\nTHE SEEK BUTTON on the Ford's radio is working. The downtown recedes. Miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. The SEEK function locks on someplace in stereo, college FM probably. \"Yeah,\" a new friend says, \"Whas up. Whas goin on.\" The radio has another button, VOL, which gets jacked repeatedly while the Ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. Not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to RJam Productions in North Dorchester, where black kids from Boston's now-integrated high schools-Latin, Madison Park, Jeremiah Burke, Mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named Schoolly D who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. \"Before we start this next record\u2026,\" Schooly's saying. The record in question is called \"Signifying Rapper,\" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from Side 2 of Schoolly's Smoke Some Kill.\nThe black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then. On the southbound left of the Fitzgerald Expressway pass 20 blocks of grim Irish-Catholic housing projects, the western border of Belfast, complete with Sinn Fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious United Ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused \"Them\" from wherever it is \"They\" live-the Third World fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white South Boston. On the Expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of Haiti, Jamaica and Georgia; a territory that maps of Boston call North Dorchester.\n\nUniting the two sides of the Expressway is just about nothing. Both neighborhoods are tough and poor. Both hate the college world across the river, which, because of Boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen. And kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto Philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from Smoke Some Kill, very much richer.\n\nNot that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when Morgan v. Hennigan, Boston's own Brown v. Board of Education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected Italians were sometimes unwelcome in the Irish precincts east of the Expressway, kids in Boston's Little Belfast sang along with James Brown over the radio.\n\"Say it loud\nI'm black and I'm proud\nSay it loud\nI'm black and I'm proud!\"\n\nExcept that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: Jesus christ, \"I'm proud to be black\" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, Jesus, and you get the hell outta there. And so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.\n\n\"Say it loud\nI'm mmm hum proud\nSay it loud\nMum hum hum proud!\"\n\nBut rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting \"ghetto\" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. How, for example, does the sing-along fan of Smoke Some Kill mumble his way through these lines:\n\n\"Black is beautiful\nBrown is sick? slick? stiff?\nYellow's OK\nBut white ain't shit.\"\n\nRjam Productions, modestly headquartered in a mixed black/Hispanic Field, Corner section of North Dorchester, is as follows:\n\n* One (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block;\n* One (1) touch-tone telephone (leased);\n* Two (2) Chevy Blazers, vanity-plated RJAM1 and RJAM2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased);\n* One (1) VCR with Kathleen Turner's Body Heat cued up on the morning in question;\n* Most importantly, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract\nIf, as has happened to many local labels, Rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. But there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer's gavel. Schoolly D, the original Signifying Rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap \"fanzines\" Hip-Hop and The Source; and Rjam's prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next Schoolly D. Or the next Ice T, or Kool Moe Dee, or L. L. Cool J., or whoever's the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. On this particular morning, the dream is to be the next MC Lyte--a hard-rapping woman known for jams like \"MC Lyte vs. Vanna Whyte\" and \"10% Dis\"--since today is Tam-Tam's day and Tam-Tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the MC Lyte mold who, like MC Lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once.\n\nOr so claims Tam-Tam's producer, promoter, and dutch uncle, Gary Smith, who opened RJam on Martin Luther King's birthday, '89, with his older brother Nate. Nate, the elder statesman, is 25. Gary, 22, runs the company while Nate travels with his boyhood-friend-turned-boss, quadruple-platinum, Prince-derived rapper/singer, Bobby Brown. RJam was founded in part with an investment from the 23-year-old multi-millionaire Brown, a native of Roxbury. Brown now lives in Los Angeles.\n\nNate and Gary Smith turn a healthy profit making demos at $500/tape, but the brothers aren't in the health business. Their aim: to follow in the corporate footsteps of Def Jam, a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in Hollis, Queens, which since its basement days, has given America Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, and much of the rest of that culture-quake called rap. Gary Smith doesn't compare RJam to Def Jam, and, unlike Def Jam's Russell Simmons, Gary produces pop, soul, and R&B as well as straight rap, and actually prefers R&B. But how many sophomores at nearby Jeremiah Burke can afford to dream in R&B, to front music lessons and $500 for an nth-hand sound set-up, find three friends to learn drums, bass and keyboards, and then raise another $500 to make a demo at RJam? Anybody with a larynx can rap, however, and Rjam's brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman, Boston Edison and the Chevrolet Motor Credit Corp.\n\nTwenty minutes farther south on the Fitzgerald Expressway, across the Neponset River and into the pricey suburbs, is the scene of John Cheever's boyhood, more recently celebrated as Massachusetts Miracle country, where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week, four of which will fail within 12 months. RJam's Gary Smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban Chambers of Commerce, sharing their worries about cash flow, overhead, and the enforceability of his contracts; but Gary's world and theirs are as far apart as those of Ward and Eldridge Cleaver. Worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives' seaside homes. In Gary's neighborhood, property values are actually falling.\n\nWaiting less than patiently for Tam-Tam, Gary honks twice. A tall, grave girl with an angel's heart-shaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of RJAM1. She has, apparently, at least two voices, the cynical, sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling Pebbles men ain't worth it, and the whisper in which she now says hello.\n\nAs RJAM1 re-crosses North Dorchester, heading back to the soundproof studios to get the day's work started, Gary and DJ Reese hash out production details. Tam-Tam's a dignified island in the back seat, and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the Motor City in '63 with Berry Gordy and an eighty-pound teenage Diana Ross, just voted Best Dressed at Cass Technical High School, driving crosstown to record a little number called \"Where Did Our Love Go.\"\n\nAsk Tam-Tam about Diana Ross, and she gives a beatific smile. She's 16; she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to, when rap was new and she was 8; Run-DMC or somebody, she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences. Like most of rap's black audience (as distinct from rap's white audience, which is usually a decade older), Tam-Tam has no first-hand recollection of James Brown except as a source for rap. She is too young to have attended segregated schools. She was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in Boston and can't remember the awful day in '74 when \"pro-neighborhood\" marchers from Irish South Boston came upon a black pedestrian at City Hall and beat him with pole-mounted American flags.\n\nTam-Tam has star presence, and like many who do, she seems to see very little of what goes on around her, the price of the star's intense focus on self. She reminds you of Senator Gary Hart. He, too, had star presence. In front of a crowd, Hart was riveting; in the elevator riding up to the auditorium, he was barely there. Being barely there in the neighborhood Tam-Tam calls home is probably not such a bad thing, and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here. Ambition is, finally, a form of hope, a scarce commodity in North Dorchester.\n\nBack in Rjam's control booth, Dj Reese and producer Ralph Stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be \"Ho, You're Guilty.\" Drum parts are taken from a Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the user's choice of drum-matrix. The TR-909's keys, on a console designed to resemble, vaguely, the familiar piano, are named after the sound each creates-bass, snare, mid-tom, hi-tom--and the sounds are named after the actual drums which, until the TR-909, were required to make those sounds. The TR-909 even sports a key named HAND CLAP, making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger, rendering obsolete the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping. The finished \"Ho, You're Guilty\" will sound lush with percussion, melody, and instrumental breaks. Not one human musician will be employed in the recording process.\n\nEach percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track: a snare track, a bass track, a clap track, etc. Reese has been studying the classics lately, too, viz: James Brown's Dead on the Heavy Funk from '75ish, including the ageless groove, \"Funky President,\" in which James announces his third-party candidacy. Some of Bobby Byrd's Dead guitar, and a holy moment when James exhales rhythmically, have been isolated from a store-bought cassette of Dead, re-recorded on clean tape, then re-re-recorded onto a computer-readable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by Ralph Stacey using a Roland D-50 linear synth. The guitar and the exhalation then go, as altered, from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board. Reese, the DJ, will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands.\n\nAs Reese and Ralph Stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape, Tam-Tam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth. You ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf. She doesn't seem to register the question. \"The other career besides rap I'd like to pursue is modelling,\" she says. \"I'm five-seven. That's the perfect height for a model.\"\n\nMixing takes the rest of the day. Producer Ralph Stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question: \"Why do you want to write about rap, anyway?\" It is lucky that at that minute Reese is done mixing. Tomorrow the RJam staff will tape Tam-Tam's vocal track and lay this over Reese's rhythm track. Then the sound will be \"fattened\" with stacks of horns, guitar hooks, bells, canned applause, and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the Rolands. The final demo tape of \"Ho, You're Guilty\" will then be shopped to the 20 major, minor, and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12-inch single.\n\nEveryone's ready to call it a day. Gary Smith's already huddled with some new wanna-be stars in RJam's reception area. Reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth, and Tam-Tam immediately stands, modelling forgotten, utterly alert. Reese gestures to her with maestro hands. She raps at an absent Antoinette in the hard, sexy voice you haven't heard since this morning, extemporaneous but on beat:\n\"I'm a female\nYou're just a fairytale.\"\n\nThe small-w we here are two white Boston males: one native, one oft-transplanted; both residing in Somerbridge, a dim, ethnic-Portuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet. M. is an attorney with a taste for jazz, Blues, funk; D. a grad student and would-be drifter who watches TV instead of sleeping. Our cultural tastes and interests are day and night. They converged only lately, when D's stereo arrived UPS and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable, somewhat furtive, and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called rap/hip-hop.* About our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague & distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing. For instance, we agreed that real or serious rap is not JJ FAD or Tone Loc or Beasties, Egyptian Lover or Fat Boys, not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush. \"Serious\" rap--a unique U.S. inner-city fusion of funk, technified reggae, teen-to-teen \"hardcore\" rock, and the early 70s \"poetry of the black experience\" of Nikki Giavonni, the Last Poets, etc.--has, since its late-70s delivery at the record-scratching hands of Afrika Bambaataa and his Zulu Nation, Sugarhill Gang, Kool Herc and his automated Herculords, and Grandmaster Flash, always had its real roots in the Neighborhood, the black gang-banger Underground. Black music, of and for blacks.\n\nWe concurred as to the wheres and whens of rap's begetting--mid-to-late 70s' South Bronx house parties; then, by decade's end, block parties, with municipal electric lights tapped for a power source, literal dancing in the streets; by '82, regular rap-houses and then \"floating clubs\"--the Roxy every Sunday, The Bronx's Disco Fever TWTh--everybody Breaking to a new musical antimusic being fashioned from records and turntables and an amateur DJs ad-lib banter; a very heavy reggae influence at the beginning; the more rhythmic pure rap an offshoot, its brisker, sparer, backbeat designed for Breakdance, and the smooth-rapping partygoer who just didn't want to shut up when others' music was on. We agreed, too, on rough chronology: amateur house-partiers giving way to professional DJs, pioneers; they, too, then overshadowed by new art-entrepreneurs, former Breakers, failed singers, gag-majorettes; then the rise of \"Indies,\" the tiny independent labels that keep most new music on life-support--Sugar Hill, Jive, Tommy Boy, Wild Pitch, Profile Records, Enjoy--then, after King Tim III's \"Personality Jock\" and Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight,\" an entree into urban black radio; then to underground \"Mix\" radio; then corporate levels, digital technology, very big money, the early-80s talent that became an early Scene's cream--Spoonie G. and Sequence, Eric Fresh, Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover and Run-DMC. Then, Spring '84, the extraordinary Midas touch of Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons' Def Jam label (now under contract to CBS) from which sprang a mid-80s stable of true stars, in the Underground--Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J, Slick Rick, the still-unparalleled Eric B. and Rakim--and L.A.'s alternatives: Kool Moe Dee, L.A. Dream Team, and others. And now, at decade's end, an absolute explosion of rap-as-pop, big business, MTV, special fashions, posters, merchandise, with only a few big, new, cutting-edge acts--L.A.'s N.W.A., Philadelphia's Schoolly D, Miami's 2 Live Crew, De La Soul's House-blend of rap/funk/jazz--remaining too esoteric or threatening or downright obscene to cross all the way over and cash in with big labels. By '89 rap is finally proving as \"important\" (read also lucrative) to an anemic shock-and rebellion-music industry as Punk was an exact decade ago. This was all just data. We agreed on it, and on how it was curious that we both had such strange, distant facts down cold.\n\nOur point of departure, essay-wise, was always less what we know than what we felt, listening: less what we liked than why. For this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap, trying to summon a kind of objective, critical, purely \"aesthetic\" passion that the music itself made impossible. For outsiders, rap's easy to move to, hard to dissect. The more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued, the more we felt that the stuff's appeal for two highbrow, upscale whites was just plain incongruous. Because serious rap has, right from the start, presented itself as a closed show. Usually critical questions of culture, context, background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions. Not here. No question that serious rap is, and is very self-consciously, music by urban blacks about same to and for same. To mainstream whites it's a tight cohesion that can't but look, from outside the cultural window, like occlusion, clannishness (sic) and inbreeding, a kind of reverse snobbery about what's \"def\" and \"fresh\" and in-the-Scene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college Societies and WASP-only country clubs. Serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or Establishment, and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individuals--the Great White Male is rap's Grand Inquisitor, its idiot questioner--its Alien Other no less than Reds were for McCarthy. The music's paranoia, together with its hermetic racial context, helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary.\n\nOther incongruities. Rap is a \"music\" essentially without melody, built instead around a digitally synthesized drum- and back-beat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waiting-room table, enhanced by \"sampled\" (pirated) \"krush grooves\" (licks or repetitive chord-series) conceived and recorded by pre-rap rock icons, the whole affair characterized by a distinctive, spare, noisy, clattering \"style\" whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of low-I amperage around the performative circuit of the MC/rapper and his record-scratching, sound-mixing Sancho Panza, the DJ.\n\nThe rapper (the guy in the cameo cut or Kangol hat, pricey warm-up, unlaced Adidas, extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion) offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight, stressed, rhymed verse, the verse's syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from Nantucket. The lyrics, nearly always self-referential, tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes, themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull. Eg: just how bad/cool/fresh/def the rapper and his lyrics are; just how equally un-all-these his music rivals are; how troublesome, vacuous and acquisitive women are; how wonderful it is to be \"paid in full\" for rapping instead of stealing or dealing; how gangs are really families, 'caine's constant bad news. And, in particular, how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late-80s American glory.\n\nThe masks are many, too many for anything really but direct aural inspection: rap personae can change frequently even within single albums, the rapper delivering Hard, violent Black Nationalist communique on one cut, dubbing against Trinidadian steel drums on another, basking in big label eclat on a third, cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb, cooing to his \"bitch\" and then on the flip side, threatening to go get his gun again if she can't learn who's boss. Though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face, the quintessential rap group is unquintessential, chameleonesque. This is either by weird design, or it's a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness\u2026or most likely, it's just a good old venerable synecdoche of rap's genre itself, one that's now moving so fast it can't quite fix on its own identity -- much less hold still for anything like cool, critical classification or assessment, from outside.\n\nThe MC's Alice Toklas-esque DJ hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black Germanness of a whole lot of digital editing & playback equipment. His responsibility is the song behind and around the rap -- the backbeat, krush groove, and the \"sound carpet,\" i.e. a kind of electric aural environment, a chaos behind the rapper's rhymed order, a digitalized blend of snippets, squeaks, screams, sirens, snatches from pop media, all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of \"samples\" that results. The most recognizable of these samples range from staccato record-scratches to James Brown and Funkadelic licks, to M.L.K.'s public Dream, to quotidian pop pap like \"The Theme from Shaft,\" Brady Bunch dialogue, and '50s detergent commercials.\n\nWe have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hip-hop available in every single on-line periodical ... xcept for one or two underground newsletters (viz. The City Sun, Fresh-Est) circulated in parts of the Bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine China White or AKs. From the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and PhDs, the following has become clear. Outside England, where the Punk-weaned audience has developed a taste for spectacle-through-windows, for vicarious Rage and Protest against circumstances that have exactly 0% to do with them, most of what Rolling Stone calls \"devoted rock consumers\" (meaning we post-baby-boomers), plus almost all established rock critics, tend to regard non-crossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic, or swaggering and bellicose and dangerous--at all events, basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive self-referentiality\u2026in short, as closed to them, to us, as a music. Unrecognizable as what we've been trained and adverted to buy as pop.... Great to dance to, of course, but then what might the white audience for today's mainstream expect? Rap, whether fecund or sterile, is today's pop music's lone cutting edge, the new, the unfamiliar, the brain-resisted-while-body-boogies. And that resisted, alien, exhilarating cutting edge has always been black.\n\n\"What have you left me? what have I got?\nLast night in cold blood my young brother got shot\nMy homey got jacked\nMy mother's on crack\nMy sister can't work cause her arms show tracks\nMadness, insanity\nLive in profanity\nThen some punk claim that they understandin' me?\nGive me a break--what world do you live in?\nDeath is my sex--guess my religion.\"**\n\nWhat makes this stuff so much more disturbing, more real to outsiders than the Punk Rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously? Maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom: I always found it tough to listen straight-faced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit. All doctrine and pronouncement, exclusively anti-, this Punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void, nothing human to grab onto. I have no idea what a Punk performer thinks, feels, is, day-to-day... in fact I always suspected he had no day, but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow. Can you imagine a Punk with four-foot hair and spiked jacket and nose-ring, say, eating a bologna sandwich? Replacing a light bulb? Putting a quarter in a meter? Not me, boy. And even Barnum, who knew fear sells, also knew that freakshows aren't frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance. 0% affinity = 0% empathy. And fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat.\n\nPublic Enemy and N.W.A., Ice T and Schoolly D discomfit us, our friends, the critics we read and cornered, because the Hard rappers' lyrics are conscientious about being of/for the real lives and attitudes of recognizable, if alien, persons. Here's where it's a level up from mere spectacle: ideology in Hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition. This makes rap not only better than Punk, but way scarier. Serious Hard raps afford white listeners genuine, horse's-mouth access to the life-and-death plight and mood of an American community on the genuine edge of im-/explosion, an ugly new sub-nation we've been heretofore conditioned to avoid, remand to the margins, not even see except through certain carefully abstract, attenuating filters.\n\nFor outsiders, rap is hard to dissect, easy to move to. The command is: dance, don't understand; participate, don't manipulate. Rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology. The first is that nu style of speak--the \"dialect drug,\" De La Soul calls it--that rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us. Some in-words, like \"fly,\" meaning \"finelooking,\" have been in coin since the beginning, now venerable as Old English because they turn up on Grandmaster Flash cuts from '82. Others, like \"dead presidents,\" rap for $$, are either coming into or going out of currency, depending on when you read this. Rap, a club language, has myriad ways to describe one's own or others' looks. \"Fly\" is how a man digs a woman. One would never describe oneself as \"fly,\" even when cataloguing one's own attractions (done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps Village Voice personals). \"Fresh\" means irresistibly stylish, oft-modified by \"funky,\" \"crazy,\" or \"stoopid,\" predominantly used to convey the fly-ness of things other than women, including oneself or one's rap, which two concepts rappers, like schizophrenics, can't always keep separate in their heads. \"Dope\" means \"def,\" and \"def\" means crazy funky stoopid fresh. Synonyms include: the shit, the It, the cool, the thang, the word, the grooviest, the categorical imperative, die weltanschung, the that-which-Potter-Stewart-would-know-if-he-saw. A def rapper is so style-defining as to make the stylish mere copycats. To be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machine--not seeking solitude, but rather confident that others will follow. The def rapper MC's a def rap, which rap def-ly tells of its own (and the rapper's) def-ness--so def, as MC/manager, entrepreneur Russell Rush Simmons brags, that it had to be on a label called Def Jam.\n\nRap celebrates power, equating strength with style, and style with the \"I\" in \"Individuality.\" Rappers \"dis\"--dismiss--the styleless, faceless. To \"ill\" is to be weak or wrong; to \"bite\" is to thieve another's dope beat. And only the ill would bite.\n\nEarly remastered pop was the first fake music ever, since what the record buyer of '63 experienced as Aural Event on his turntable couldn't happen live. Rock began to become an Illusion of Event which technology made possible; rock became more like the movies, starting down a long road at the end of which was MTV.\n\nNot that this kept Phil Spector up nights. The gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean, for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price. With each magnetic jump from live, as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes, the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied. Dual high-bias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10,000 units of Elvis Presley, retaped on similar 2-units-per-10,000 tape, became 4 units of hiss; retaped, 8; then 16; then 32. As the sound got fuller, it decayed.\n\nThe solution was a breakthrough called multi-tracking--using recorders that could capture and play back on 2 (as in stereo), 4 (as in '67's then-ear-shattering Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band), 12, 16, and today 24 parallel tracks, eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next. Rhythms, melodies, harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks, allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and re-mix, adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track. Rap Edisons like Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa began as party DJs, not musicians. Their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer, allowing them to \"stack\" the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike, was a kind of crude, extemporaneous multitracking. Technological loops like those in the NASA-esque studios of CBS and Polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys. Carter was President. The Bee Gees, with five Top-Ten hits in twelve months, were king.\n\nDigital recording, the science dividing Rjam's Tam-Tam on tape from Tam-Tam as heard \"live\" is a technology that converts music to codes or \"digits.\" The codes are \"read\" by a computer, one combining sophisticated sound-to-code translation hardware with a number-crunching COS and a high-response synthesizer, at speeds of 40,000 digits per second and up. The recorded sounds, reduced to numbers, can be shaped, mangled, muffled, amplified, and even canonized.*** Hardware then translates the digits, as read and altered, back into sound, which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds. The result: hiss-free reproduction on an infinity of tracks, each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely.\n\nDigital recording, part of the 80s sea-change in how pop gets made, divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer, the engineer at the mixing board, the producer who coordinates the multi-tracking and mixing process, and the electronic hardware that actually \"makes\" the music we buy. The latest synthesizers**** produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations, with voltage-meters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to \"attack-delay envelope\" (another non-rap term, denoting the microtimed, counterpoised quality of a note's duration, how a note's sound/quaver-structure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fades--the manipulation of a piano's foot-pedals, for example, affects the delay component of each note and chord's envelope). The Kurzweil 250, a state-of-the-art system, is a 1-?track/12,018-note synthesizer linked by software to an Apple MacIntosh Plus, which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound. The Kurzweil could put all of culture in a blender--take Janet Leigh's Cremora-curdling scream from Psycho, store it in the Mac, program the synth such that an F# will be reproduced as Janet Leigh's F# scream, then play \"We Shall Overcome\" as if screamed by Janet Leigh; store this; treat similarly Bach's St. Matthew's Passion, except with vast choruses of screaming Janet Leighs, then \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" then \"Twist and Shout\" (by the Isleys, not the Beatles), all as screams; then replay the four as one horrific jumble, or select amidst the jumble; and then whatever you came up with in the final, painstakingly re-mixed mix you could play backwards. And call that \"finished.\" Or never finish. It's like holding music at gunpoint. You can make it do--or do to you --whatever you can think of. Whim is the only limit.\n\nBasically we decided we were into rap because, even media-hype aside, this music had some kind of hard edge to it. Date of composition here is July '89. Think back. This last has been a fiscal year in which Madonna's \"back on top,\" in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts, in which Rod Stewart's out of cryogenics and back on top.... MTV's ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels; Bobby McFerrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synth-reggae invitation to \"Be Happy,\" a song that has the same verbal-pre-packaging feel as \"Where's the Beef?\"\n\nThis last year heavy metal's fake-Satanist male models accounted for 1/2 of total U.S. record sales; U2 filmed a $20,000,000 homage to their own self-righteousness and Bono's ever more ill-disguised megalomania. A year when even good old REM finally went corporate-pop with Green, when good old Springsteen trashed his bride, when as modest and nascent a talent as Tracy Chapman earned cymbal-crashing critical raves for her competent, updated frappe of Baez and Armatrading, so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh. Just not a notable pop year at all. Except in rap. Rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical Scene the way early jazz, rock, the Summer of Love, folk/protest, god even the way New Wave and Punk were \"Scenes\"--the S-word here simultaneously meaning: something new to look at; something loud and upsetting (\"Oh please, Veronica, let's not have a Scene!\"); and, best, an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet, marry and beget. Whether by virtue or default, rap is pretty much what there is to like right now, if you want to regard today's pop as anything more than covert jingles in 4/4-time. In our opinion.\n\nBut so the point is we enjoy it. Plus we've developed some theses about why serious rap is important, both as art-for-own-sake and as a kind of metaphor-with-larynx for a subbed-culture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the American present.\n\nRap is expanding gas-like through the 80s' dry time, growing from house party schtick, gang anthem, a small-label fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimers--then somehow, when we weren't looking, into Scene, movement, On The Air--finally, in the last 24 months, assuming the fecund role of genuine Genre. Exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track. There's now Dub's mix of rap and reggae, House's mix of rap and 70s-, huge-afro'd funk, Acid House's psychedelic hip-hop. There is black rap for white mass-consumption (Tone Loc, Run?DMC), black rap for local set and -house consumption (countless local stars and wanna-be's in every large city), ultra-black rap superstars for the whole marginal Nation inside (Heavy D, Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane), white rap for white masses (the execrable Beastie Boys). There is Hispanic, Salsa-influenced rap out of different West Coast barrios, rap fused with West Indian or Islamic traditional music in Digital Underground, Eric B. and Rakim, and others, or fused with oh-so-danceable R&B in the new \"jack swing\" offshoot (Bobby Brown, MC Hammer); even gay and bohemian young urban Bs have their trendsetters in Teddy Riley and Guy, De La Soul, Kwabe. Etc. etc.***** A major impediment to sampling this Scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the Scene itself is changing. If you're reading this in print it's already dated.\n\nAnd the rap world's vitality is one of replacement as well as variety, allowing the genre to remain fresh, as band after band is seduced into the \"real\" music biz. This Scene is hydra-like. Almost the moment a rap artist like Run-DMC or L. L. Cool J \"breaks through\" into major-market mix appeal, MTV's land of corporate bankability, certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed. The breakthrough band's B-boys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime: after all, they've been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status, about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice. Their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame, of the now-enhanced authority of their \"Message\"--though it's hard to feature Public Enemy rapping about a Black-Militant renaissance, about revolution and American apocalypse, while lily-white CBS Records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats.\n\nNevertheless, back in the underground Scene, the breakthrough band's tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal, to await feverishly \"their\" crew's spots on the same music TV they love to dis. In short, there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late-60s protest rock. Which if you think about it, is passing strange. The white mainstream Other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s \"Establishment\" too look downright benign.\n\nOur opinion, then, from a distance: not only is a serious rap serious poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great 80s Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we've been encouraged sadly to write off,6 it's quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. \"Real\" (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocab, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred and (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn't get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers, doesn't get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership (most of the moved being poets themselves), doesn't generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best PhD-poets rent their names and time ... and especially does not inspire a whole culture's youth to try to follow in their Connecticut-catalogue brogans' prints. Because of rap's meteoric rise, though, you've got poor kids, tough kids, \"underachievers,\" a \"lost generation\"... more young people--ostensibly forever turned off \"language\" by TV, video games and low U.S.D.E. budgets--more of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time, trying to put words together in striking and creative ways, than the U.S.A. has probably ever had at one time. That few of these will become \"stars\" matters far less than the grim stats about, say, the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status: the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values (and values enough to let rap-dissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing) can obviously be applied in mainstream-approved, \"productive\" ways--G.E.D.'s college, Standard Written English ...perhaps someday even ad-copywriting!\n\nBut is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted four-car garages like North Dorchester's RJam's in spite of the genre's near-disciplinary prosodic restrictions, or because of them? Can't really tell. Probably doesn't matter. The fact remains that, were \"important poetry\" presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a Supply-Side democracy (popularity, effect, the separation of fan from his cash), staid journals like Poetry and American Poetry Review would be featuring some number of fade-cut, multiple-earring'd authors' photos in each issue; and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to \"listen rude\" to Wilbur and Levertov and Ashbery, just as e.g Rimbaud and Pound did to their own contemporaries ... to the delight and invigoration of a time's poetry...\n\n... And even just the prospected fantasy of seeing Public Enemy's be-clocked Flavor Fav and like a Jorie Graham or Amy Clampitt sitting down over beer and Celestial Seasonings to hash out the debate over line-breaks in dactylic pentameter, a very serious young homeboy in Italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhyme's renaissance--at least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhyme-as-form--to the cold corridors of Serious Appreciation.\n\nUnlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s, though, rap's own quality, the def freshness of the MC's bit, is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against. In case you thought we forgot, rap is first of all a movement in rock music, and thus the time-honored requirement is that the rap Scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock 'n roll to justify one of its essential roles, rebellion-against. Except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter, spread, grow in urgency--from the 50s' parents and principals, homework, hot rods, the sweet hurt of teen love, to the urban 80s, police, violent death, homelessness, the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry, fatherlessness, the animal emptiness of sex w/o love, the almost Trilaterally sinister White Establishment (\"THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT'S. . . \"), Everyone Else: life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not, about the betrayal of the past, of the promises exacted by Carmichael, X, and the now-formal martyrdom of King.\n\nSegregation may affect their hearts and minds, Earl Warren warned, as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, both alumni of Boston's old separate-but-awful schools, bear loud witness. Now, 40 years after X disgustedly quit a racist high school and began a career as a kind of be-bop gang-banger, 35 years after Brown v. Board of Education invented integration, 15 years after Morgan v. Hennigan brought Brown to Boston, North Dorchester is worse and its schools aren't better. A former United States Secretary of Education converts to Drug Czar, symbolizing a national change of mind: now drugs, not poor schools (and certainly not the American apartheid of which segregated schools were but one facet), is our root \"innercity\" problem. Tam-Tam's Boston is strangely less hopeful than the notoriously segregated pre-Hennigan city, perhaps because before Hennigan reformers could promise that segregation was why things were so bad. Segregation was blame's bullseye: abolish the bullseye, and blame for the estrangement of the races flies everywhere, hitting the cops, or the courts, or the teachers, or the taught, or what's taught. There's even a rap--B.D.P.'s \"Why is That?\"--blaming our miseries on the failure of the schools to \"teach black kids to be black.\"\n\nBut everything the white rock listener pays to enjoy is black-begotten. If today's Top?40 environment seems bleak or befouled, imagine the present mainstream without its sweetest sourcewaters, without the King-Waters-King Blues trinity, the Brownian soul, the backbeat, cut time, blue notes, funky French curves of sax and brass, the guitar solo, call-and-response, the Cold Medina or Lucky Powder, those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits, the single hand in the white glove holding Pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames.... Black music is American pop's breath and bread; and we, as both born audience and born salesmen, know it.\n\nSo maybe it's them. Them. Maybe we're approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the white-run entertainment industry will have to pack up what it's taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities. Maybe, in serious rap, the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned, part of a neo-Nationalist agenda, the hermetic new Scene's tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat.\n\nYou may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete. And, hazier, of how complicated this stuff of sampler-from-outside can be. What's remained passing strange, for use, is the vague threat's appeal. The unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love. Whence the fear, though, is really no matter. For look at the world, at the masses we're part of. At what you look at closest. The plain 80s data is that, whereas love, devotion, passion seem only to divide, it's fear and strangeness that bind crowds, fill halls, unite Us, somehow, as audience, under the great tent.\n\n*'Hip-hop' is an older synonym, coined by Rap pioneer, Kool Herc, to describe the heavily danceable Jamaican scatting he introduced between records at the huge South Bronx block parties he and other new-Scene celebrities, like Jazzy Five and former Black Spades leader, Afrika Bambaataa, could turn into late-70s frenzies of Breakdance (both music and dance a self-conscious reaction against the glittered unreality of downtown Disco).\n\n**Except but now hey kids! thanks to AT&T you can now speak directly to Ice T and hear his philosophy of life by phone! 1-900-907-9111. \"Chill out with Ice T,\" the rapper adrape in military hardware and ammunition says on MTV, \"I'm just waiting on you to call me,\" pointing at the camera and then himself lest the audience get at all confused. \"Don't forget to ask your parent's permission first\" (white corporate voice-over)--$2.00 first minute, etc. etc.\n\n***\"Canon\" being another non-jive rap term, meaning the division of a single sequence of sound into two or more repeating sound-sequences, like a vocal round.\n\n**** ... themselves the heirs of a long, 20th-century evolutionary process, from the playe-?piano to the 20s Oncles Martenot and Theremin and Trautonium (crude electronic instruments big in France), to Pierre Schaeffer's musique concrete in '48, to the first Electronic Music Synthesizer invented by engineers at RCA in the 50s to the inauguration of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in '59, to Robert Moog's '64 development of the Moog 55, the first emitter of amplified \"blurps, fwipps, simps, twings, and schlonks\" to be commercially produceable. Walter/Wendy Carlos used a Moog 55 for his/her '68 Switched-On Bach, an album that did more than anything to popularize synthesized sound.\n\n***** Note how the ecstatic force's movement extends beyond sound into dance-Chicago-based house-dancing is very different from Coast-based rap-dancing, while both are distinct from the Quaalude sway a De La Soul's lazy complexity invites--and beyond dance into urban haute couture itself. The \"cameo\" or \"fade,\" that troubling cyberpunk flat-top haircut favored by Carl Lewis and Grace Jones but popularized by the group Cameo's rapping Larry Blackmon, has now become less a haircut than a sculptural statement: words, logos, slogans and complex signs razored into the rigid anvil of hair that is, according to the Voice, \"the most culturally conscious unisex hairstyle since the afro.\" The standard 80s-rap uniform--sideways baseball cap or Kangol, ropey chains, acetate warmup and unlaced hightops--\"...now symbolizes a cruder, more casual era,\" and is diffracting into a rap-House-gay-jackswing look replete with polka-dot ties, loose pleated twills, and expensive dance-loafers or British \"moon boots,\" a combination Ricky Ricardo-Frank Sinatra dapper that now befits a Scene with the dignity, silliness and pull of real Genre. Plus don't forget that just one big change in street and school fashions means millions and millions in garment revenue--even more $$ once the white mainstream, as is its won't, follows in the cutting edge's media-delayed wake.\n\n****** \"We've lost a whole generation to their own culture out here,\" rues an LAPD Assistant Commissioner in a 14 May '89 Boston TV news special on the national Wa-?On

But the Beauforts were not exactly common; some people said they were even worse. Mrs. Beaufort belonged indeed to one of America's most honoured families; she had been the lovely Regina Dallas (of the South Carolina branch), a penniless beauty introduced to New York society by her cousin, the imprudent Medora Manson, who was always doing the wrong thing from the right motive. When one was related to the Mansons and the Rushworths one had a \"droit de cite\" (as Mr. Sillerton Jackson, who had frequented the Tuileries, called it) in New York society; but did one not forfeit it in marrying Julius Beaufort?\n\nThe question was: who was Beaufort? He passed for an Englishman, was agreeable, handsome, ill-tempered, hospitable and witty. He had come to America with letters of recommendation from old Mrs. Manson Mingott's English son-in-law, the banker, and had speedily made himself an important position in the world of affairs; but his habits were dissipated, his tongue was bitter, his antecedents were mysterious; and when Medora Manson announced her cousin's engagement to him it was felt to be one more act of folly in poor Medora's long record of imprudences.\nBut folly is as often justified of her children as wisdom, and two years after young Mrs. Beaufort's marriage it was admitted that she had the most distinguished house in New York. No one knew exactly how the miracle was accomplished. She was indolent, passive, the caustic even called her dull; but dressed like an idol, hung with pearls, growing younger and blonder and more beautiful each year, she throned in Mr. Beaufort's heavy brown-stone palace, and drew all the world there without lifting her jewelled little finger. The knowing people said it was Beaufort himself who trained the servants, taught the chef new dishes, told the gardeners what hot-house flowers to grow for the dinner-table and the drawing-rooms, selected the guests, brewed the after-dinner punch and dictated the little notes his wife wrote to her friends. If he did, these domestic activities were privately performed, and he presented to the world the appearance of a careless and hospitable millionaire strolling into his own drawing-room with the detachment of an invited guest, and saying: \"My wife's gloxinias are a marvel, aren't they? I believe she gets them out from Kew.\"\n\nMr. Beaufort's secret, people were agreed, was the way he carried things off. It was all very well to whisper that he had been \"helped\" to leave England by the international banking-house in which he had been employed; he carried off that rumour as easily as the rest\u2014though New York's business conscience was no less sensitive than its moral standard\u2014he carried everything before him, and all New York into his drawing-rooms, and for over twenty years now people had said they were \"going to the Beauforts'\" with the same tone of security as if they had said they were going to Mrs. Manson Mingott's, and with the added satisfaction of knowing they would get hot canvas-back ducks and vintage wines, instead of tepid Veuve Clicquot without a year and warmed-up croquettes from Philadelphia.\n\nMrs. Beaufort, then, had as usual appeared in her box just before the Jewel Song; and when, again as usual, she rose at the end of the third act, drew her opera cloak about her lovely shoulders, and disappeared, New York knew that meant that half an hour later the ball would begin.\n\nThe Beaufort house was one that New Yorkers were proud to show to foreigners, especially on the night of the annual ball. The Beauforts had been among the first people in New York to own their own red velvet carpet and have it rolled down the steps by their own footmen, under their own awning, instead of hiring it with the supper and the ball-room chairs. They had also inaugurated the custom of letting the ladies take their cloaks off in the hall, instead of shuffling up to the hostess's bedroom and recurling their hair with the aid of the gas-burner; Beaufort was understood to have said that he supposed all his wife's friends had maids who saw to it that they were properly coiffees when they left home.\n\nThen the house had been boldly planned with a ball-room, so that, instead of squeezing through a narrow passage to get to it (as at the Chiverses') one marched solemnly down a vista of enfiladed drawing-rooms (the sea-green, the crimson and the bouton d'or), seeing from afar the many-candled lustres reflected in the polished parquetry, and beyond that the depths of a conservatory where camellias and tree-ferns arched their costly foliage over seats of black and gold bamboo.\n\nNewland Archer, as became a young man of his position, strolled in somewhat late. He had left his overcoat with the silk-stockinged footmen (the stockings were one of Beaufort's few fatuities), had dawdled a while in the library hung with Spanish leather and furnished with Buhl and malachite, where a few men were chatting and putting on their dancing-gloves, and had finally joined the line of guests whom Mrs. Beaufort was receiving on the threshold of the crimson drawing-room.\n\nArcher was distinctly nervous. He had not gone back to his club after the Opera (as the young bloods usually did), but, the night being fine, had walked for some distance up Fifth Avenue before turning back in the direction of the Beauforts' house. He was definitely afraid that the Mingotts might be going too far; that, in fact, they might have Granny Mingott's orders to bring the Countess Olenska to the ball.\n\nFrom the tone of the club box he had perceived how grave a mistake that would be; and, though he was more than ever determined to \"see the thing through,\" he felt less chivalrously eager to champion his betrothed's cousin than before their brief talk at the Opera.\n\nWandering on to the bouton d'or drawing-room (where Beaufort had had the audacity to hang \"Love Victorious,\" the much-discussed nude of Bouguereau) Archer found Mrs. Welland and her daughter standing near the ball-room door. Couples were already gliding over the floor beyond: the light of the wax candles fell on revolving tulle skirts, on girlish heads wreathed with modest blossoms, on the dashing aigrettes and ornaments of the young married women's coiffures, and on the glitter of highly glazed shirt-fronts and fresh glace gloves.\n\nMiss Welland, evidently about to join the dancers, hung on the threshold, her lilies-of-the-valley in her hand (she carried no other bouquet), her face a little pale, her eyes burning with a candid excitement. A group of young men and girls were gathered about her, and there was much hand-clasping, laughing and pleasantry on which Mrs. Welland, standing slightly apart, shed the beam of a qualified approval. It was evident that Miss Welland was in the act of announcing her engagement, while her mother affected the air of parental reluctance considered suitable to the occasion.\n\nArcher paused a moment. It was at his express wish that the announcement had been made, and yet it was not thus that he would have wished to have his happiness known. To proclaim it in the heat and noise of a crowded ball-room was to rob it of the fine bloom of privacy which should belong to things nearest the heart. His joy was so deep that this blurring of the surface left its essence untouched; but he would have liked to keep the surface pure too. It was something of a satisfaction to find that May Welland shared this feeling. Her eyes fled to his beseechingly, and their look said: \"Remember, we're doing this because it's right.\"\n\nNo appeal could have found a more immediate response in Archer's breast; but he wished that the necessity of their action had been represented by some ideal reason, and not simply by poor Ellen Olenska. The group about Miss Welland made way for him with significant smiles, and after taking his share of the felicitations he drew his betrothed into the middle of the ball-room floor and put his arm about her waist.\n\n\"Now we shan't have to talk,\" he said, smiling into her candid eyes, as they floated away on the soft waves of the Blue Danube.\nShe made no answer. Her lips trembled into a smile, but the eyes remained distant and serious, as if bent on some ineffable vision. \"Dear,\" Archer whispered, pressing her to him: it was borne in on him that the first hours of being engaged, even if spent in a ball-room, had in them something grave and sacramental. What a new life it was going to be, with this whiteness, radiance, goodness at one's side!\n\nThe dance over, the two, as became an affianced couple, wandered into the conservatory; and sitting behind a tall screen of tree-ferns and camellias Newland pressed her gloved hand to his lips.\n\n\"You see I did as you asked me to,\" she said.\n\n\"Yes: I couldn't wait,\" he answered smiling. After a moment he added: \"Only I wish it hadn't had to be at a ball.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.\" She met his glance comprehendingly. \"But after all\u2014even here we're alone together, aren't we?\"\n\n\"Oh, dearest\u2014always!\" Archer cried.\n\nEvidently she was always going to understand; she was always going to say the right thing. The discovery made the cup of his bliss overflow, and he went on gaily: \"The worst of it is that I want to kiss you and I can't.\" As he spoke he took a swift glance about the conservatory, assured himself of their momentary privacy, and catching her to him laid a fugitive pressure on her lips. To counteract the audacity of this proceeding he led her to a bamboo sofa in a less secluded part of the conservatory, and sitting down beside her broke a lily-of-the-valley from her bouquet. She sat silent, and the world lay like a sunlit valley at their feet.\n\n\"Did you tell my cousin Ellen?\" she asked presently, as if she spoke through a dream.\n\nHe roused himself, and remembered that he had not done so. Some invincible repugnance to speak of such things to the strange foreign woman had checked the words on his lips.\n\n\"No\u2014I hadn't the chance after all,\" he said, fibbing hastily.\n\n\"Ah.\" She looked disappointed, but gently resolved on gaining her point. \"You must, then, for I didn't either; and I shouldn't like her to think\u2014\"\n\n\"Of course not. But aren't you, after all, the person to do it?\"\n\nShe pondered on this. \"If I'd done it at the right time, yes: but now that there's been a delay I think you must explain that I'd asked you to tell her at the Opera, before our speaking about it to everybody here. Otherwise she might think I had forgotten her. You see, she's one of the family, and she's been away so long that she's rather\u2014sensitive.\"\nArcher looked at her glowingly. \"Dear and great angel! Of course I'll tell her.\" He glanced a trifle apprehensively toward the crowded ball-room. \"But I haven't seen her yet. Has she come?\"\n\n\"No; at the last minute she decided not to.\"\n\n\"At the last minute?\" he echoed, betraying his surprise that she should ever have considered the alternative possible.\n\n\"Yes. She's awfully fond of dancing,\" the young girl answered simply. \"But suddenly she made up her mind that her dress wasn't smart enough for a ball, though we thought it so lovely; and so my aunt had to take her home.\"\n\n\"Oh, well\u2014\" said Archer with happy indifference. Nothing about his betrothed pleased him more than her resolute determination to carry to its utmost limit that ritual of ignoring the \"unpleasant\" in which they had both been brought up.\n\n\"She knows as well as I do,\" he reflected, \"the real reason of her cousin's staying away; but I shall never let her see by the least sign that I am conscious of there being a shadow of a shade on poor Ellen Olenska's reputation.\"1Embed"}]
