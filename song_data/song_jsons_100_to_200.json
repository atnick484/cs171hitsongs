Mmm\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd it starts in my toes, makes me crinkle my nose\nWherever it goes, I always know\nThat you make me smile, please stay for a while now\nJust take your time, wherever you go\n\n[Breakdown]\nTa-da-dam, ta-da, da-dam, ta-da-dam, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-dam\nUm-ba, da-da, um-ba, ta-da-da-da, uhm, mm-mmh\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI've been asleep for a while now\nYou tuck me in, just like a child now\n'Cause every time you hold me in your arms\nI'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth\n\n[Chorus]\nIt starts in my soul and I lose all control\nWhen you kiss my nose, the feeling shows\n'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time now\nHolding me tight\n\n[Outro]\nWherever, wherever, wherever you go\nWherever, wherever, wherever you go\nWherever you go, I always know\n'Cause you make me smile, even just for a while31Embed"

Drake (Devvon Terrell Cover) Lyrics[Intro: Devvon Terrell]\nMy name is Devvon Terrell\nThis is a raw session\nYou know the vibes\n\n[Verse: Devvon Terrell]\nTrips that you plan for the next whole week\nBands too long for a nigga so cheap\nAnd your flex OD, and your sex OD\nYou got it, girl, you got it (Oh)\nOh lemme tell you\nYou got it, girl, you got it\nYou should deal with a five star nigga\nKnow you work more than just 6 figures\nI'm applying the pressure my finger on the trigger\nI know you got a roster just full of hittas\nBut you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers\nBeen through so much shit that you don't even know the difference\nMade so many mental notes that you can't save a picture\nGot so many cuts and bruises I was still invested\nStill treat you like the best like KD to the Nets\n[Bridge: Devvon Terrell]\nI see you and I know you legit (Yeah)\nHigh off you, I need a fix (Yeah)\nYou a hot girl I'm off this lukewarm\nThat's like comparing you to a groupon chile\n\n[Chorus: Devvon Terrell]\nYou got it, girl, you got it (Aye)\nYou got it, girl, you got itYou might also likeEmbed"

of the hundred bottles with the radio beamer tower and its hangars, chimbneys and equilines or, at least, he was\u2019nt actually the then last king of all Ireland for the time being for the jolly

Ireland, when he found him \u2014 self all alone by himself in his grand old handwedown pile after all of them had all gone off with themselves to their castles of mud, as best they cud, on footback,

Ghenter\u2019s gaunts and his Macclefield\u2019s swash and his readymade Reillys and his pan-prestuberian poncho, the body you\u2019d pity him, the way the world is, poor he, the heart of Midleinster and the supereminent lord of them all, overwhelmed as he was with black ruin like a sponge out of water, allocutioning in bellcantos to his own oliverian society MacGuiney\u2019s Dreans of Ergen Adams

(Who else)\nWho's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who else)\nWho's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who else)\nOh, baby, baby, we belong together\n\n[Verse 2]\nI can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind\nBobby Womack's on the radio\nSinging to me, \"If you think you're lonely now\"\nWait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)\nI gotta change the station\nSo I turn the dial, tryin' to catch a break\nAnd then I hear Babyface, \"I only think of you\"\nAnd it's breaking my heart\nI'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm feelin' all out of my element\nThrowin' things, cryin'\nTryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong\nThe pain reflected in this song\nAin't even half of what I'm feeling inside\nI need you, need you back in my life, baby (My life, my life)\n(We belong together)\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen you left, I lost a part of me (Together)\nIt's still so hard to believe\nCome back, baby, please\n(Come back, come back, come back, come back)\n'Cause we belong together\nWho else am I gonna lean on when times get rough? (Who will?)\nWho's gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up? (Who will?)\nWho's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better (Who will?)\nOh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby\n(We belong together) (Who will?)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nWhen you left, I lost a part of me (Who will?)\nIt's still so hard to believe (Who will?)\nCome back, baby, please\n(Come back, come back, come back, come back)\n'Cause we belong together\nWho am I gonna lean on when times get rough?

It isn't fair\nI've had enough, now I want my share\nCan't you see, I wanna live\nBut you just take more than you give\n[Verse 2]\nWell, there's a pretty girl serving\nAt the counter of the corner shop\nShe's been waiting back there, waiting for a dream\nHer dreams walk in and out; they never stop\nWell she's not too proud, to cry out loud\nShe runs to the street and she screams\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat about me? It isn't fair\nI've had enough, now I want my share\nCan't you see, I wanna live\nBut you just take more than you give\nMore than you give\n\n[Bridge]\nTake a step back and see the little people\nThey might be young\nBut they're the ones that make the big people big\nSo listen as they whisper:\n\"What about me?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd now I'm standing on the corner\nAll the world's gone home\nNobody's changed, nobody's been saved\nAnd I'm feeling cold and alone\nI guess I'm lucky, I smile a lot\nBut sometimes I wish for more, than I've got\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhat about me? It isn't fair\nI've had enough, now I want my share\nCan't you see, I wanna live\nBut you just take more\nWhat about me? It isn't fair\nI've had enough, now I want my share\nCan't you see, I wanna live\nBut you just take more, you just take more\nYou just take more than you give\n\n[Outro]\nWhat about me?\nWhat about me?\nWhat about me?Embed"
