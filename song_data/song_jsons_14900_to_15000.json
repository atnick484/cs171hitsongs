you\nThought you said that you would always be in love\nBut you're not in love no more\nDid it frighten you\nHow we kissed when we danced on the light up floor?\nOn the light up floor\n[Pre-Chorus]\nBut I hear sounds in my mind\nBrand new sounds in my mind\nBut honey, I'll be seein' you 'ever I go\nBut honey, I'll be seein' you down every road\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause honey, I'll come get my things, but I can't let go\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\nOh, I wish I could get my things and just let go\nI'm waiting for it, that green light, I want it\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes I wake up in a different bedroom\nI whisper things, the city sings 'em back to you\n\n[Refrain]\nWell, those rumours, they have big

leave you spinning like a Tilt-A-Whirl\n\n[Chorus]\nI met a girl, she made me smile\nShe made me wait, she crossed the street\nShe crossed my heart, she fixed her dress\nShe bit her lip, she lit me up\nI met a girl, with crazy shoes\nAnd baby blues, the way she moves\nIs changin' my whole world\nI met a girl\n[Verse 2]\nThe sunshine waits for her to wake up\nShe's a ponytail, no makeup,

about all of this good love you'll be missin' out on\nYou wouldn't have played me\n[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]\nCan't say I'm not hurt\nI'll be damned if I'm broken\nWhat we had is now hers\nLet her

love\n\n[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]\nAnd I admit that I thought about creeping\nSo you could get a dose of how I feel\n'Cause our hearts can never seem to break even\nBut what's the use, I'd rather pack it up and leave it\n'Cause here we are again, 'cause you're wrong again\nYou're tryin' to tell me that you love me\n'Cause your actions say another thing\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Keyshia Cole]\nCan't say I'm

hm, uh\nWhy you worry 'bout that other ho?\n'Cause that other ho ain't worry 'bout another ho\nYeah, you say it's over, but you still fussin'\nYou just clumsy, always tripping over nothin'\nThat other bitch is just that other bitch\nI give her space and give you the mother ship\nWe can't let her tear down what we built\nI told you if you ride or die then I'll be your seat-belt\nIn sickness and in

head on my shoulder\nNobody else get's to hold her\nBut this ole boy\n\nWe're in my old ford oh lord\nHoles in my floor board\nBut she don't seem to mind\nWe park in a hay field\nFog up the windshield\nMy kind of killing time\nShe sweetens my tea and she butters my biscuit\nI am who I am and buddy she gets it\nI ain't got to change a thing\nAnd I don't know if it could get any better\nBut man if it does then i reckon i better get to picking out a ring\n\nThis ole boy got it going on\nGot the good lord smiling on me\nHer big blue eyes and the sweet red wine\nGot me buzzin'

Mayor Richard M. Daley was the States\u2019 Attorney of Cook County from 1981 through 1988, and he has served as Mayor of the City of Chicago from 1989 to the present.\n\n2. On or about February 25, 1982, Police Superintendent Richard Brzeczek informed States Attorney Richard M.

Brzeczek further informed Daley that he would not initiate a criminal investigation into the allegations that Wilson was tortured unless Daley authorized such an investigation. Id.\n\n4. Daley never authorized a criminal investigation, and the Chicago Police Department therefore did not initiate a criminal investigation into Wilson\u2019s allegations, and on May 19, 1983, Daley honored Burge and four other Area 2 detectives for their work in the Wilson case\u201d Brzeczek Dep., Wilson v. City of Chicago, pp 123-24; Brzeczek Affidavit; Chicago Tribune, 5/20/83, \u201cDaley Hails 11 in Crime War.\u201d\n\n5. The Chicago Police Department never investigated numerous allegations of police torture and abuse which arose from the manhunt to find and arrest Andrew Wilson and which were lodged with its IAD and OPS in February of 1982. Wilson v. City of Chicago, 6 F3d 1230 (7th Cir. 1993).\n6. On November 12, 1982, Andrew Wilson testified at his motion to suppress hearing that he was tortured by Jon Burge, John Yucaitis, and other Area 2 detectives by electric shock, bagging, beating and burning on a radiator. People v. Wilson. 2\n\n7. In their Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, filed on January 22, 1992 before the Chicago Police Board in the Matter of Charges Filed against Respondents Jon Burge, John Yucaitis and Patrick O\u2019Hara, Cases # 1856-58, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers, on behalf of the City of Chicago and Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin, judicially admitted that: At the hearing, Andrew Wilson will testify that on February 14, 1982, he was arrested at an apartment by several officers, including respondents Burge and Yucaitis. As Wilson was being taken to the car to be transported to Area II, he heard Burge telling the transporting officers not to \u201cmess with\u201d Wilson and that they would deal with him when they arrived at the station. Wilson was then taken to Area II by Yucaitis and three other officers. Transcript of Testimony of Andrew Wilson, July 7, 10, 11, 1989, at 2914-31 When they arrived at Area II, Wilson was taken to a room where the four transporting officers, including Yucaitis, and other officers started beating him. They hit him, kicked him, knocked him down and slammed him into a window so hard that it broke. In addition, one of the officers grabbed a plastic garbage bag and put it over Wilson\u2019s head, holding it around his neck so that he could not breathe. The officers took the bag off when Wilson bit a hole in it. The officers stopped beating Wilson when Burge entered the room and stated that if it had been him, he would not have left any marks on Wilson. Tr. at 2932-36 Wilson was taken to a second room and handcuffed to the wall. Yucaitis then took Wilson to a telephone and told him to call his brother. When Wilson replied that he did not want to talk but wanted a lawyer, he was taken back to the second room again handcuffed to the wall. Tr. At 2937-44. Burge entered the room and told Wilson he was going to make a statement because Burge\u2019s reputation was at stake. Burge left the room and Yucaitis came in with a brown paper bag. Yucaitis opened the bag and took out a black box about 12-14 inches long, 8-9 inches wide and 6 \u00bd-7 inches high. The box had a crank and two wires with clamps. Yucaitis squatted down in front of Wilson with the box between his own legs, and put one clamp in Wilson\u2019s nose and one on Wilson\u2019s ears, and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson\u2019s teeth to grind and was so painful that he kicked Yucaitis. Yucaitis punched him in the mouth and cranked the box again. Yucaitis left the room and then returned, put the black box in the bag, and left again. Tr. at 2947-55. Respondent O\u2019Hara then came in and took Wilson to see the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, Lawrence Hyman. According to Wilson\u2019s testimony, with O\u2019Hara present, Wilson asked Hyman, \u201cYou want me to make a statement after they\u2019ve been torturing me?\u201d O\u2019Hara took Wilson back to the second room. Tr. at 2956-59. Burge later returned to the second room with the brown paper bag and said, \u201cFun time.\u201d Burge put a pair of handcuffs on Wilson\u2019s other arm and another pair on Wilson\u2019s 3 ankles. He then placed the bag in the garbage can and left. He returned, took out the black box, put the clamps on Wilson\u2019s ears and cranked the box. The shock caused Wilson\u2019s to grind his teeth and knocked Wilson out of his chair. Wilson kept rubbing the clips from the electrical device off his ears. Tr at 2961-63. Wilson was then handcuffed across the radiator, kneeling with his arms outstretched. Burge and another officer put the clamps on Wilson\u2019s little fingers and cranked the box repeatedly this time for longer periods. As he was being shocked, Wilson\u2019s chest, leg and face were forced against the radiator and he was burned. Tr. at 2963-66 When Burge stopped cranking and took the clamps off Wilson\u2019s little fingers, he took another shocking device out of the bag. It plugged into an electrical outlet and had a cord sticking out of it. Burge placed the device very near Wilson\u2019s skin so that he could feel it tingling. Burge then jabbed the second device into Wilson\u2019s back and Wilson got a full jolt, slamming Wilson into the grill on the window. Wilson began spitting out blood. Burge and the other officer put the devices back in the bag and left. Tr. at 296-68. A while later, Wilson was taken to Area I headquarters for a lineup.

When he failed to give information implicating himself in the murder, respondent Burge entered the room and told Jones that he was going to talk. Burge then asked Jones if he had ever heard of him, and when Jones replied that he had not, Burge told him that before he left the station Jones would \u201cwish he had never set eyes on him.\u201d Burge left the interrogation room but returned after Jones persisted in his refusal to talk to the interrogating detectives. Burge had Jones cuffed to a second ring and then produced and plugged into the wall socket a wooden box measuring approximately 10\" x 6\" x 6\", with tweezers and a long nail type device. He again asked Jones if he was going to talk. When Jones again refused, Burge pulled down Jones\u2019 pants and shorts and, using\nthe electrical device, shocked Jones three times, on the foot, thigh, and penis. While he was shocking Jones, Burge demanded that Jones talk. He told Jones that he had also shocked \u201cSatan\u201d (Anthony Holmes) and \u201cCochise,\u201d forcing them to crawl all over the floor. He also told Jones that nobody would believe his word against a lieutenant\u2019s. Burge asked another Area II detective present in the room if he had seen anything, and the detective looked at the ceiling and said no. Burge also tied a sock in Jones\u2019 mouth. Burge was interrupted in his interrogation of Jones, apparently by the news that a policeman had been shot and killed on a bus in his area. Later, Burge also struck Jones with a stapler. When Jones continued to deny knowing anything about the murder, Burge again entered the interrogation room. He pointed a gun at Jones\u2019 head, cocked it and told Jones he was going to \u201cblow his black head off.\u201d 6\nCity and Martin\u2019s Memorandum In Opposition, pp. 7-8.\n\n17.

On or about November 2, 1990 OPS Director Gayle Shines approved as\n\u201ccompelling\u201d and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 25 page Report and findings made by OPS investigator Michael Goldston concerning allegations of torture and abuse at Area 2. This Report included the following findings:\nAs to the matter of alleged physical abuse, the preponderance of the evidence is that abuse did occur and that it was systematic. The time span involved covers more than ten years. The type of abuse described was not limited to the usual beating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and planned torture. The evidence presented by some individuals convinced juries and appellate courts that personnel assigned to Area 2 engaged in methodical abuse. 20 The number of incidents in which an Area 2 command member is identified as an accused can lead to only one conclusion. Particular command members were aware of the systematic abuse and participated in it either by actively participating in same or failing to take any action to bring it to an end. This conclusion is also supported by the number of incidents in which Area 2 offices are named as the location of the abuse.\nOPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings, and Cover Letter, Shines to Martin, dated November 2, 1990 (Goldston Report).\n\n93. In her forwarding memo of November 2, 1990, OPS Director Shines, while\napproving the conclusions of Goldston and Sanders, further informed Superintendent Martin that they both did \u201ca masterful job of marshaling the facts in this intensive and extensive project and their conclusions are compelling.\u201d 11/2/90 Cover Memo, Shines to Martin, with OPS Special Project Conclusion Reports and Findings enclosed.\n\n94. On or about November 2, 1990, OPS Director Gayle Shines approved \u201cas\ncompelling\u201d and forwarded to Superintendent Martin the 66 page report and conclusions of OPS investigator Francine Sanders which found that based on \u201cthe overwhelming body of evidence which supports the allegations\u201d that administrative charges of excessive force should be sustained against Jon Burge and John Yucaitis including that they \u201crepeatedly administered electrical stimulation to Mr [Andrew] Wilson\u2019s body in order to create pain\u201d and that Burge \u201cheld Mr. Wilson, while handcuffed, against a hot radiator causing burns to Mr. Wilson\u2019s face, chest and thigh.\u201d Chicago Police Office of Professional Standards (OPS) Special Investigative Report and Findings, October 26, 1990 (Sanders Report), pp.62-66.\n\n95.

At no time from receiving the Goldston Report in November of 1990 until he left 21 office in April of 1992, did Martin, OPS Director Shines, or any other City policymaking official take any steps to further investigate the allegations made by the some fifty victims listed in the Goldston report.\n\n97. Instead, Martin, after waiting three months, wrote Shines seeking \u201cfurther\nclarification\u201d concerning the Goldston and Sanders Reports. Memo, Martin to Shines, 2/6/91.\n\n98. Despite all of the torture evidence contained in the Goldston and Sanders Reports, in the Fact Sheet, and that was previously presented to Martin and the City Council, the City and Martin did not seek the prosecution of Burge and his confederates in the Wilson case, for a continuing conspiracy on the basis of the numerous other torture cases listed in the Goldston report, or to prosecute Burge for the numerous other cases which were documented in the\nevidence presented, including the Patterson and Madison Hobley cases.\n\n99. In her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Martin, Shines supplied the \u201cclarifications\u201d sought by Martin, and informed him that the OPS findings \u201creflect the unprecedented comprehensiveness of this investigation.\u201d Shines memo, 4/30/91.\n\n100. With her April 30, 1991 memorandum to Superintendent Martin, OPS Director\nShines included investigator Goldston\u2019s clarification memo, in which Goldston set forth that his investigation established that Area 2 detectives and supervisors Jon Burge, John Byrne, Peter Dignan, Charles Grunhard, John Yucaitis, Thomas McKenna, and Patrick O\u2019Hara were \u201cplayers\u201d\nwhose names \u201crepeatedly appeared as connected to allegations of abuse.\u201d Goldston Memo of 4/30/91, attached to Shines Memo to Martin of the same date.\n\n101.

Cr 123543 (reopened).\n\n102. However, after secret communications with Corporation Counsel Kelly Welch, which the City still refuses to produce, Martin refused to accept or adopt the Goldston findings, open any additional criminal or administrative investigations into the numerous allegations of Area 2 torture, to commission additional investigation into the alleged systemic pattern and practice of torture, or to discipline or seek criminal charges against any of the named officers, but rather contacted the Police Foundation in order to have them evaluate the methodology used by Goldston in arriving at his findings.

See, generally, proceedings in Fallon v. Dillon, 90 C 6722.\n\n105. In November of 1991, after Defendant Martin and Corporation Counsel Kelly\nWelsh had initiated proceedings before the Police Board to fire Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara for torturing Andrew Wilson, Mayor Daley \u201cdefended his decision not to take action against the officers when he was state\u2019s attorney in 1982, explaining that . .

Dillon, #90-C-6722.\n\n107. In an article which appeared in the February 8, 1992 Chicago Tribune,\nSuperintendent Leroy Martin, whgo was one of the previous Area 2 Commanders, was quoted as saying that it was an \u201coutright lie\u201d that Area 2 commanders knew about or condoned torture.

The testimony reveals an astounding pattern or plan on the part of respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara] to torture certain suspects, often with substantial criminal records, into confessing to crimes\nor to condone such activity. 24 Memorandum In Opposition To Motion To Bar Testimony Concerning Other Alleged Victims of Police Misconduct, p. 1.\n\n110. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, identified the \u201cseven\nadditional victims of torture tactics at Area II headquarters\u201d as Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes,\nGeorge Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree. Id., pp. 7-\n14.\n111. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission - - - that the similar acts\ntestimony of Melvin Jones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin,\nLeroy Orange, and Lawrence Poree\n[I]s highly probative of the modus operandi used or condoned in the torturing of suspects\nto elicit statements. Respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara\u2019s] methods of torture\nthrough electric shock, bagging, and holding a gun to a suspect\u2019s head are more that\nsufficiently unique to establish a modus operandi for 404 b purposes. In addition, the\ntestimony establishes a pattern of and plan to torture these suspects in these similar ways\nto elicit confessions to violent crimes.\nId. p. 17.\n112. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin\nJones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and\nLawrence Poree:\nclearly establishes respondents\u2019 [Burge, Yucaitis and O\u2019Hara\u2019s] motive and intent in\ntorturing or condoning the torture of Wilson. Respondents generally engaged in these\nsimilar practices in order to coerce a confession to a serious crime.\nId. p. 22. 25\n113. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, judicially admitted that the similar acts testimony of Melvin\nJones, Anthony Holmes, George Powell, Donald White, Shadeed Mumin, Leroy Orange, and\nLawrence Poree:\nshows the physical existence of one or more electric shock devices at Area II, prior to\nand subsequent to Wilson\u2019s arrest, and Burge\u2019s possession of and familiarity with the use\nof the devices. It is also admissible to show knowledge of that technique and of the\nbagging technique, about which respondents deny knowing, and the technique of putting\na gun to the head of a victim.\nId., p. 24.\n114. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Martin and the City, made the following judicial admission:\nThere is no question that the similarities between [Andrew] Wilson\u2019s testimony\nand the similar victims\u2019 testimony is more than sufficient to meet the 404 b standard.\nBurge was the main perpetrator of the torture in almost all of the cases, and, when he was\nnot the principal, he was still involved. In the case of all but one of the victims, the\nvictim was picked up and taken to Area II where he was then interrogated regarding his\nknowledge or involvement in a serious offense. Although Donald White was taken\ninstead to Area I, he was taken there and interrogated by Area II detectives. All of the\nvictims were black and generally had significant criminal histories.\nAlso similar was the way in which several victims were threatened with\nconsequences if they refused to make a statement. After an initial refusal, the\npunishment would begin and then would become stronger and more painful as the\nrefusals to speak persisted. The most striking similarities, however, are found in the\nmethods of torture used on the suspects. Wilson was electro shocked by Yucaitis using\nthe black box and by Burge who used the black box and a curling-iron looking device,\nwas \u201cbagged\u201d and beaten, and was threatened with a gun placed in his mouth. Jones,\nHolmes, Poree, Powell and Orange were similarly electro shocked by Burge. Holmes,\nPowell, White and Mumin were all \u201cbagged\u201d and beaten to the point where they lost or\nalmost lost consciousness. Burge pointed a cocked gun at Jones\u2019s head, hit Poree in the\nhead with a pistol, and placed a revolver containing one bullet at Mumin\u2019s head and\nsnapped it three times slowly. White had a gun placed in his mouth. Additionally, each\nof the victims was slapped around and punched.\nBurge\u2019s statements to the victims were also very similar. Burge told both Jones\nand Mumin that nobody would ever believe their word against his. As he did in relation\nto Wilson, he referred to the absence of marks on Mumin\u2019s body. He said \u201cfun time\u201d as 26\nhe approached Wilson and Poree with the black box, and laughed when he bagged\nMumin. He told Wilson he would \u201cfry his black ass\u201d and Jones he would \u201cblow his\nblack head off.\u201d\nAs the case law cited above aptly demonstrates, these actions or the condoning of\nthese actions are overwhelming in their similarity.\nId., pp. 25-26.\n115. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Chicago Police Superintendent Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, made the\nfollowing judicial admission:\nGiven the similarities between the serious offenses charged and the offenses to which the\nsimilar victims will testify, there is no question that the offenses are close enough in time\nto be relevant to this case. Tak[ing] the offenses in sequence, they reveal a pattern of\nalmost identical acts of torture directed towards persons suspected of violent crimes.\nWhile the sequence spans twelve years, each offense is close enough to the next to\nconnect it to the relevant pattern of behavior. Moreover, Melvin Jones\u2019 and Donald\nWhite\u2019s testimony will demonstrate that they were tortured just days before Andrew\nWilson was tortured.\nId., p. 28.\n116. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:\nIndeed, as the testimony of the similar victims shows, respondents [Burge, Yucaitis and\nO\u2019Hara] counted on the fact that their testimony would be believed over that of a convict\nwhen they persisted in their pattern of torture.\nId., p. 28.\n117. In a document filed in the case of Wilson v. City of Chicago, Jon Burge, Patrick\nO\u2019Hara and John Yucaitis, 86-C-2360, entitled \u201cCity of Chicago\u2019s Memorandum in Response\nTo Plaintiff Andrew Wilson\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment,\u201d the City, through its lawyers,\nmade the following judicial admission:\nPlaintiff Andrew Wilson has testified that he was beaten, kicked, punched, burned by\nbeing harnessed to a radiator, and repeatedly electro shocked on his hands, face, ears, and 27\nbetween his legs by defendant police officers. Plaintiff now seeks summary judgment that\nthis outrageous conduct, unsanctioned and condemned by the City, and for which\ndefendant officers were fired and/or disciplined, was within the defendants\u2019 scope of\nemployment.\nCity Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Wilson\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, p. 1.\n118.

City of Chicago, 86-C-2360, entitled\n\u201cCity of Chicago\u2019s Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson\u2019s Motion for\nSummary Judgment,\u201d the City, through its lawyers, made the following judicial admission:\nThe instrumentalities by which defendants tortured plaintiff also illustrate that defendant\nofficers were not in the scope of their employment. Plaintiff has failed to furnish any\nevidence to suggest that the instruments used by the officers to shock him - - -the black\nbox device and the modified curling iron - - were furnished by the City.\nId., p. 17.\n119. In its Memorandum in Response To Plaintiff Andrew Wilson\u2019s Motion for\nSummary Judgment,\u201d the City, through its lawyers, made the judicial admission that\nBurge \u201ccruelly torture[d]\u201d Andrew Wilson and \u201cdenie[d] him necessary medical\nassistance.\u201d\nId., p. 19.\n120. In this Memorandum, the City, through its lawyers, made the following admission\nconcerning it change of position from defending Burge for his alleged torture of Andrew Wilson\nto asserting that said torture was so outrageous as to be outside the scope of Burge\u2019s\nemployment: \u201cThe change in the City\u2019s position was the result of inquiries undertaken by the\nCity in good faith and in the public interest.\u201d Id. p. 12.\n121. On July 30, 1992, almost two years after Superintendent Martin had first received\nthe Goldston findings, the Police Foundation submitted its report to Superintendent of Police\nMatt Rodriguez. After noting that because \u201changings, shockings, \u2018baggings\u2019 beatings, chokings,\nand beatings were alleged to occur, many in the Area 2 Headquarters itself, a thorough and\nrigorous investigation seemed required,\u201d and that it passed no judgment as to whether the torture\nalleged had in fact took place, the Report criticized Goldston\u2019s methodology.

Burge also applied the end of an electric shock\ndevice, housed in a black box, to Holmes\u2019 handcuffs, giving Holmes an intense shock,\nwhich caused him to fall out of his chair and roll on the floor. The shock was extremely\npainful and caused Holmes to press his jaws together and grit his teeth.\nMemorandum In Opposition filed on January 22, 1992, p. 9.\n143. On April 19, 2004 Anthony Holmes gave a Court reported statement in which he\ndescribed the allegations made in Plaintiff\u2019s Proffer in even greater detail.\n144.

The\nfirst time they showed him a wooden box, with no top and a generator inside with two\nwires. Burge said \u201cthis is what we got for niggers like you.\u201d Later (that year) Burge and\nHoke put Poree, while handcuffed, on a table and hit him. They then pulled his pants\ndown and applied electric shock to his arm, testicles and under his armpits.\n146. In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago lawyers,\non behalf of Leroy Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted that:\nLawrence Poree will testify that on two occasions in 1973, he was interrogated by\nrespondent Burge and another detective. The first time they showed him a wooden box\nwith no top, a generator inside, and two wires.

They then pulled his pants down and applied\nelectroshock to his arm and armpits, and to his testicles.\nOn August 7, 1979, Poree was arrested and brought to Area II where he was\ninterrogated by Burge. Poree was handcuffed in the interrogation room, and the black\nbox was on the table. Burge came in and said, \u201cfun time again.\u201d Poree was handcuffed\nto the wall and hit in the head with a pistol.

In U.S. ex. rel. Maxwell v. Gilmore, 1999 WL 130331 (N.D.Ill.) at *14; Judge\nShadur stated the following in his decision:\nIt is now common knowledge that in the early to mid-1980s Chicago Police Commander\nJon Burge and many officers working under him regularly engaged in the physical abuse 33\nand torture of prisoners to extract confessions. Both internal police accounts and\nnumerous lawsuits and appeals brought by suspects alleging such abuse substantiate that\nthose beatings and other means of torture occurred as an established practice, not just on\nan isolated basis.\n150. At the May 13, 2003 oral argument in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in US\nex. rel. Leonard Hinton v. McArdory, Seventh Circuit Judge Diane Wood made the following statement\nfrom the bench: \u201cterrible things were happening in Area 2, things that should make us ashamed\nof our police force and justice system.\u201d\n151. In Wilson v. City of Chicago, 120 F.3d 681, 683-85 (7th Cir. 1997), the Seventh\nCircuit Court of Appeals held that Defendant Burge acted within the scope of his employment\nwith the City \u201cwhen he tortured Wilson,\u201d stating:\nBurge was not pursuing a frolic of his own. He was enforcing the criminal law of Illinois\noverzealously by extracting confessions from criminal suspects by improper means. He\nwas, as it were, too loyal an employee. He was acting squarely within the scope of his\nemployment.\n152.

Id. at 18,\n22, 41.\n213. White testified that Hill put the bag over his head two additional times, and that\nwhile he was bagged, he was beaten over his head, preventing him from breathing.

He also identified Detective Hill\u2019s photograph and stated that he was the officer\nwho put the bag over his head. Id. at 32-36, 38-40, 47, 56.\n218. White further testified that at one time while he had the bag over his head, one of\nthe officers put a gun to his mouth, and at another point, he was hit with fists and a book, or a\nstack of something.

In their Memorandum In Opposition, specially appointed City of Chicago\nlawyers, on behalf of Superintendent Martin and the City of Chicago, judicially admitted:\nOn the evening of February 12, 1982, two days before Andrew Wilson\u2019s arrest, Donald\nWhite was picked up by police officers and taken to 11th and State. He was taken to a\nroom on the 5th floor by Hill, McKenna, Katalinic and respondent O\u2019Hara, and they\nbegan asking him who killed the police officers. They continued to ask him and White\nrepeatedly told them that he did not shoot the officers. Hill got mad and said \u201cI am tired\nof this fucking shit.\u201d He took a black garbage bag and put it over White\u2019s head and then\nsomeone began beating him on his head. Although he could not see them with the bag\nover his head, there had to have been at least four people hitting him. O\u2019Hara was in\nthe room, as was Burge at various times. When White still stated that he did not shoot\nthe officers and did not know anything, they put the bag back over his head two more\ntimes and beat him again. White almost lost consiousness. At one point, someone\nstuck a gun in his mouth. White then said he would tell them anything they wanted to\nknow. Hill then asked him questions, and, when White didn\u2019t have it right, Hill\npretended he was going to hit White.\nWhite testified to these facts in a deposition taken in connection with Andrew\nWilson\u2019s civil trial. White had not told anyone for five years that he had been abused\nbecause he feared for his life at the hands of the police officers. When he finally agreed\nto testify about the abuse he suffered, he did so only on the condition that\nWilson\u2019s lawyers would move him out of Illinois. In addition, because he was\nafraid and did not know who he could trust, he did not file an OPS complaint. His\nmother, however, did file an OPS complaint in connection with his torture at the hands\nof the police officers. OPS reached a finding of \u201cnot sustained.\u201d 48\nMemorandum In Opposition filed on January 22, 1992 in the Matter of Charges Filed against\nRespondents Jon Burge, et. al. , Cases # 1856-58, pp. 10-11.\n221.

And its, do you acknowledge - - -\nA: Including, including the Chicago Police Department.\nCity Council Hearing, Committee on Police, Fire an Municipal Institutions, Public\nHearing on Police Brutality, Day 5, October 11, 1989, p. 285.\n357. On October 11, 1989, Police Superintendent Leroy Martin testified before the\nChicago City Council and gave the following answers to the following question by Alderman\nCaldwell:\nQ: One final question, Superintendent, and this was asked of Dr. Fogel on\nnumerous occasions. It has to do with the suggested code of silence among\npolice officers. As Superintendent of Chicago\u2019s Police Department, do you\nagree or - - -\nA: Yes.\nQ: Do you agree that there is in fact in force and functioning a code of silence\namong police officers?\nA: To some extent, yes, sir.\nId., pp. 368-69.\n358. On or about October 19, 1987, OPS Director Fogel sent a document entitled\n\u201cProposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,\u201d to the Mayor of the City of Chicago\nin which he wrote:\nBy accepting all cases, even erring on the liberal side, to be accommodative to the\npublic, OPS gives the appearance of moving forward on all complaints. The opposite\noccurs. The appearance of doing a thorough investigation with full due process\nand endless unnecessary reviews for all, actually operates to immunize police\nfrom internal discipline, increases their overtime, leads to an enormous \u201cpaper storm\u201d\nand has institutionalized lying.\n\u201cProposed Revamping of Office of Professional Standards,\u201d October 19, 1987, p. 2.\n359. [Deleted]\n360. In Jones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d 985, (7th Cir. 1987) the Seventh Circuit 76\nCourt of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict against Area 2 Violent Crimes detectives, supervisors\nand commanding officers, including detectives James Houtsma, Dennis McGuire, John McCabe,\nand Raymond McNally, Sgt. Alvin Palmer, Lt. Griffith, and Commander Milton Deas, for\nconspiracy to \u201crailroad\u201d 18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:\nWe cannot say that the jury acted unreasonably in finding that all of the\nindividual defendants were voluntary participants in a common venture to\nrailroad George Jones.\nJones v. City of Chicago, 856 F. 2d at 992.\n361. In Jones v. City of Chicago, the Seventh Circuit affirmed a jury verdict against the\nCity of Chicago for maintaining a \u201cstreet files\u201dcustom or policy which led to the railroading of\n18 year old George Jones for a 1981 murder, stating:\nThe custom in question is the maintenance of the \"street files,\" police\nfiles withheld from the state's attorney and therefore unavailable as a\nsource of exculpatory information that might induce him not to prosecute\nor, failing that, would at least be available to defense counsel under\nBrady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, 83 S. Ct. 1194 (1963). As\nwe noted recently, information undermining the credibility of a government\nwitness is within the scope of Brady's rule. See United States v.\nHerrera-Medina, 853 F.2d 564, slip op. at 5 (7th Cir. 1988).\nAlthough the lawfulness of the street-files practice has never been\nadjudicated, the City, which has abandoned the practice, does not challenge\nthe jury's implicit finding that it denied criminal defendants due process\nof law. Brady v. Maryland does not require the police to keep written\nrecords of all their investigatory activities; but attempts to circumvent\nthe rule of that case by retaining records in clandestine files\ndeliberately concealed from prosecutors and defense counsel cannot be\ntolerated. The City sensibly does not attempt to defend such behavior in\nthis court.\nThere is little doubt that the clandestine character of the street files\nplayed a role in Jones's misfortunes. Cf. Harris v. City of Pagedale, 821\nF.2d 499, 507 (8th Cir. 1987). If the state's attorney had had [*996]\naccess to them, he would have discovered memos by Kelly and especially by\nLaverty that would have given any prosecutor pause. Alternatively, defense 77\ncounsel would have obtained them prior to trial and the trial would have\nended even sooner than it did. The only question is whether this custom was\na custom of the City of Chicago. As the custom was department-wide\nand of long standing, the jury was entitled to conclude that it had been\nconsciously approved at the highest policy-making level for decisions\ninvolving the police department -- the standard suggested by the recent\nplurality opinion in City of St. Louis v. Praprotnik, 485 U.S. 112, 108 S.\nCt. 915, 99 L. Ed. 2d 107 (1988). See also Stokes v. Bullins, 844 F.2d 269,\n273 (5th Cir. 1988).\nJones, 856 F. 2d at 995.\n362.

On April 24, 2002, Judge Paul Biebel, Chief Judge of the Cook County Criminal\nDivision, appointed Special Prosecutors Edward Egan and Robert Boyle to investigate\nallegations of police torture and abuse at Area 2 and Area 3.\n574.

In Re: The Matters of Leonard Bajenski, et. al., June 8, 2004, p. 27.\n575. From 1972 to the present, the only police department discipline which has been\nimposed against any Area 2 or Area 3 detective, supervisor, or command officer for any\nallegations of torture or physical abuse made against them has been the firing of Jon Burge and\nthe suspension of John Yucaitis for the torture of Andrew Wilson on February 14, 1982.\n576. From 1972 to the present, the City of Chicago and its Police Department has\nconducted no criminal investigations into any of the allegations of torture or other physical abuse\nmade against Area 2 and Area 3 detectives and supervisors, including, but not limited to, the\nalleged victims named above.\n577. From 1972 to the present, the City of Chicago and its Police Department has not\nsought criminal charges against any Area 2 and Area 3 detective or supervisor on the basis of 110\nallegations of torture or other physical abuse, including, but not limited to, those made by the\nalleged victims named above.\n578.

Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36, 43-46\n584. In an August 31, 1998 memo from the office of the Superintendent , Thomas\nNeedham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional\nStandards, Needham listed the following cases:\nDarrell Cannon CR#134723\nStanley Howard CR# 142017\nGregory Banks CR# 188617\nLee Holmes CR# 126802\nPhilip Adkins CR# 142201\nDonald White CR# 169867\nLavert Jones CR# 200390\nStanley Ware CR# 202019 112\nMichael Johnson CR# 125071\nand wrote that \u201cyou are hereby instructed to classify all of the allegations in the above\nreferenced complaint register files as \u2018not sustained.\u2019\u201d August 31, 1998 memo from Thomas\nNeedham, General Counsel to the Superintendent, to Leonard Benefico, Office of Professional\nStandards.\n585. As a basis for this unprecedented order, Needham cited the age of the cases and the\npurported lack of \u201cnew evidence,\u201d when, in fact, a wealth of new evidence had been developed\nby the OPS investigators in almost all of the cases. Id.; CR files of listed cases; Testimony of\nOPS investigators at People v. Cannon Hearing.\n586. Superintendent Hillard, after talking to Neeedham about his decision, ratified his\nactions in \u201cnot sustaining\u2019\u201d these cases, stating, under oath, that \u201cI support Tom Needham 100\npercent when it comes down to representing me in this department in hard cases like that.\u201d\nHillard Dep., Santiago v. Marquez, 5/3/99, pp. 32-33, 35-36.\n587. In a letter dated August 2, 1999, from Citizens Alert, addressed to Superintendent\nTerry Hillard, OPS Director Callie Baird and Police Board President Demitrius Carney, the\nsignators wrote:\nWe write as a group of public officials, citizens and organizations concerned with\npolice violence and discipline to urge you to immediately reopen and review several\nOffice of Professional Standards (OPS) investigations into police torture, and to open\ninvestigations in numerous other torture cases where no OPS investigations have been\nconducted. We further urge you to commission an independent investigation into the\nobvious violations of police regulations and procedure and legal process by certain OPS\nand police officials during the torture investigations which were conducted by the OPS.\nAugust 2, 1999 Letter from Citizens Alert, Mary Powers et. al. to Hillard, Carney, and Baird.\n588. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators further wrote: 113\nRecent news articles and publicly released documents and depositions reveal that the\nOPS reopened nine torture investigations in 1992 and 1993 as a result of prior OPS\nfindings that physical abuse of African American suspects at Area 2 from 1973 to 1986\nincluded \"psychological techniques and planned torture,\" was \"systematic,\" and\n\"methodical,\" and that Area 2 command members, particularly Jon Burge, \"were aware\nof the systematic abuse and perpetuated it either by actively participating in same or\nfailing to take any action to bring it to an end.\" Goldston Report, pp 2-3. The now public\nevidence further reveals that OPS investigators Tillman, Lawrence, and Cosey conducted\nthorough investigations in each of these cases, discovered new evidence not available\nduring the initial investigations, and sustained findings in six of the cases. The sustained\nfindings included findings that victims were electric shocked, suffocated with a plastic\nbag, suspended in air by their handcuffs, beaten and stomped, and racially abused. The\nevidence further shows that these sustained findings were entered against several police\nofficers who were and are still Chicago police officers in good standing, most notably\nLieutenant Peter Dignan, who had allegations of torture and abuse sustained against him\nin five of the six cases. The evidence further reveals that these findings and the\ninvestigative files were tendered to OPS Director Gayle Shines in 1994 for her review,\nand that she overturned the findings in four of the cases in late 1994 and early 1995, at\nthe same time that Peter Dignan was nominated by the Mayor and the Department for\nmerit promotion to Lieutenant. Ms. Shines has admitted that in the approximately 2500\nsustained cases which she reviewed during her eight year career as Director, she\noverturned a total of 10 cases, including these four against Dignan.\nThe evidence further shows that in the other two cases, Darrell Cannon and Stanley\nHoward, Ms. Shines never completed her review of the sustained findings of torture, but\nrather kept these files in her office for four years, together with the other seven files.\nCannon, who was on trial in a murder case, and Howard, who is on death row, sought\nthese files by subpoena, but Shines and the Department failed to produce these files,\nwhich contained highly exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, after Ms. Shines left the OPS\nin 1998, counsel to the Superintendent, Thomas Needham, obtained the nine torture files\nfrom the OPS and, without consultation with the Superintendent, summarily reversed the\nsustained findings and closed the cases. Needham, who, as a longtime assistant state\u2019s\nattorney, was closely connected to the prosecution of several torture victims, including\nCannon, admitted that his summary reversals of the torture findings were not based on\nthe merits of the cases, but rather on the fact that the files had languished in Shines\u2019\noffice for so long a period of time. The Superintendent never reviewed these cases on the\nmerits as he is required by police procedure to do, and he only learned of his counsel\u2019s\nunjustifiable actions by reading about them in a February 1999 Chicago Tribune article.\nAdditionally, the public evidence reveals that the OPS failed to investigate numerous\nadditional documented cases of police torture against African American suspects. In the\ncase of Melvin Jones, Mary Powers of Citizen\u2019s Alert specifically requested by a letter\ndated July 26, 1989 that the OPS open an investigation into the recently revealed\nallegations that Jones was electric shocked at by Jon Burge and several other Area 2\ndetectives who remain on the force to this day. Contrary to police and OPS procedure, no\ninvestigation was ever opened, despite the fact that the City has subsequently admitted in 114\nofficial court papers that Jones was in fact tortured. Similarly, in the Shadeed Mumin\ncase, an investigation was opened and OPS investigators developed compelling new\nevidence that he was tortured by Burge and an unidentified detective. Just as the OPS\ninvestigator was about to identify this officer, the OPS discontinued the investigation,\nsupposedly because the investigation had not been assigned a complaint register number.\nIn numerous other cases, including Aaron Patterson and nine other men who are\npresently on death row as a result of confessions which they allege were tortured from\nthem, the OPS has failed to conduct any investigation whatsoever into these most serious\nallegations.\nId.\n589. In the August 2, 1999 letter, the signators made the following demands:\n1. Given Ms. Shines\u2019 clear misconduct, lack of objectivity, and failure to complete her\nreview of the Cannon and Howard sustained findings, that new OPS Director, Callie\nBaird, conduct an independent review on the merits of the six sustained torture\ncases;\n2. If Ms. Baird concurs with one or more of the sustained findings, that the\nSuperintendent fully and fairly review those findings on the merits, as he is required by\npolice procedure to do;\n3.

On January 1, 2002, Sheila O\u2019Grady was Mayor Daley\u2019s Chief of Staff. Id.\n596. In response, Jeffrey Given, Georges\u2019 assistant, wrote that suing Burge \u201cwould\nseem to undercut our ability to defend [against the inmates\u2019] suit by challenging the underlying\nfacts . . .\u201d \u201cCity Considered Suing Burge; Officials Weighed Their Options to Fight Growing\nUproar over Torture Allegations Against the Fired Police Commander,\u201d Chicago Tribune,\n4/29/04.\n597. Mindful that the torture allegations were gaining new momentum, Given and\nGeorges also considered mounting a public relations campaign to counter continuing negative\npublicity about Burge and the City\u2019s role in the torture scandal. Id.\n598. Given and Georges recognized that the campaign would not be easy for a wide\nvariety of reasons, including that some of Burge\u2019s men were still on the police force, the\ndepartment had been embarrassed by Needham\u2019s unilateral shelving of the OPS torture\ninvestigations despite the investigators\u2019 sustained findings, and that the Tribune\u2019s then recent\nseries on the continuing CPD practice of obtaining false confessions had again focused attention\non the issue, and Given further stated \u201cbut query how we\u2019ll do in the court of public opinion\nafter a long, public, expensive and embarrassing discovery process?\u201d NBC5.com; Chicago\nTribune.\n599. Instead of suing Burge, or otherwise distancing the City from him, the City decided 117\nto invest unlimited public funds in representing Burge and at least thirty-five other Area 2\ndetectives accused of torture and abuse in the four torture cases and to fight production and\npublic disclosure of additional documents that would further expose the City\u2019s central role in the\ntorture scandal in civil and criminal cases and with the Special Prosecutor. Id.\n600. On August 27, 2004 in his sworn testimony before the Prisoner Review Board,\nformer Area 2 Commander and Superintendent Leroy Martin falsely denied that he did not have\ncontemporaneous knowledge of the allegations of torture and abuse against Jon Burge and other\nArea 2 detectives while he was Commander. Tr. of 8/27/04 Parole Revocation Hearing of Darrell\nCannon.\n601. In her concurring opinion in Hinton v. Uchtman (sub. nom.)___F 3d ___ (7th Cir.\n2005), Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood found:\n[T]he claim Hinton has made regarding his confession illustrates dramatically the\nhigh price our system of criminal justice pays when police abuse runs rampant: a\ncloud hangs over everything that the bad actors touched . . . [A] mountain of\nevidence indicates that torture was an ordinary occurrence at the Area Two station\nof the Chicago Police Department during the exact time period pertinent to\nHinton's case. Eventually, as this sorry tale came to light, the Office of\nProfessional Standards Investigation of the Police Department looked into the\nallegations, and it issued a report that concluded that police torture under the\ncommand of Lt. Jon Burge \u2014 the officer in charge of Hinton's case \u2014 had been a\nregular part of the system for more than ten years. And, in language reminiscent\nof the news reports of 2004 concerning the notorious Abu Ghraib facility in Iraq,\nthe report said that \"[t]he type of abuse described was not limited to the usual\nbeating, but went into such esoteric areas as psychological techniques and\nplanned torture.\" The report detailed specific cases, such as the case of Andrew\nWilson, who was taken to Area Two on February 14, 1982. There a group led by\nBurge beat Wilson, stuffed a bag over his head, handcuffed him to a radiator, and\nrepeatedly administered electric shocks to his ears, nose, and genitals. See People\nv. Wilson, 506 N.E.2d 571 (Ill. 1987). Burge eventually lost his job with the\npolice, though not until 1992. See In the Matter of the Charges Filed Against Jon\nBurge, No. 91-1856 (Chicago Police Board, February 11, 1993). To this day,\nBurge has not been prosecuted for any of these actions, though it appears that he\nat least thinks that he may still be at some risk of prosecution. See, for example, 118\n\"Cop brutality probe must be thorough, fair,\" Chi. Sun-Times, May 16, 2002\n(editorial); Hal Dardick, \"Burge repeatedly takes 5th; Former police commander\nstays mum on torture questions,\" Chi. Tribune, Sept. 2, 2004 (noting allegations\nthat Burge or people reporting to him had tortured 108 Black and Latino suspects\nbetween August 1972 and September 1991). . . .\nBehavior like that attributed to Burge imposes a huge cost on society: it\ncreates distrust of the police generally, despite the fact that most police officers\nwould abhor such tactics, and it creates a cloud over even the valid convictions in\nwhich the problem officer played a role. Indeed, the alleged conduct is so\nextreme that, if proven, it would fall within the prohibitions established by the\nUnited Nations Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"), which defines torture as\n\"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is\nintentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a\nthird person information or a confession . . .,\" thereby violating the fundamental\nhuman rights principles that the United States is committed to uphold. . . .Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path":

up!)\nI came to bring you that California love\nAnd a little New York hate, it's all of the above\nI'm not playin', I said I'm off the chain\nYou niggas better follow instructions, I said (get up!)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI ball \u2018til I fall, stunt 'til I drop\n'Em off the showroom floor, not the used car lot\nYou buy a bottle, I buy the bar\nI make every other week feel like Mardi Gras\nWhen I get into it, I get into it\nEverybody can\u2019t do it the way I do it\nI make it rain, till the sun come out\nA nigga playin', we make the guns come out\nNow, my question is who they gon' blame\nWhen I'm back number one on the Billboard again?\nShit shift now, the game done changed\nSince Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain\nI guess I made the kids want slang\nAnd N.W.A. made the West Coast bang\nNah, it's just music man, it's just music\nNow get your ass on the dance floor and move it\n[Hook]\nI have the savoir-faire\nI\u2019m the reason, everybody, here, I said (get up!)\nI make it hot, I make it hot in here\nYour feet hurtin'? I really don't care, I said (get up!)\nI wanna see, I, I wanna see ya move\nAnd get all into the groove, I say (get up!)\nI'm gettin' money man, I really don't care\nLet me see you put your ass in the air, I said (get up!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, lady, you look good, I wanna get to know you better\nYou look good in them jeans and them red stilettos\nYou got a Bentley Coupe booty baby, I wanna drive\nSee it'll tell you what your mileage is when I'm inside\nI wanna take you for a spin, you know, round and round\nSwitch gears till' your love comes down\nI take you to the point of no return if you listen you learn\nJust how a nigga earn, I got money to burn\nWhile they can't get a place, she drop the bomb on me\nIt's up and down and up and down gracefully\nRick James would've said She a Brick House\nBut Fifty you should go home and see what that bitch bout\nI find out she like it how I like it, huh\nBack it up, get ya some, I know how to get ya sprung\nTune ya up and use the tongue, under the hood is so good\nShe said it so good, goddamn I'm so hood, nigga what up?\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI have the savoir-faire\nI\u2019m the reason, everybody, here, I said (get up!)\nI make it hot, I make it hot in here\nYour feet hurtin'?

this is for the best\nYou can lie in that bed\nIn a stranger's arms reachin' for comfort\nClose your eyes and still get no rest\n[Verse 2]\nCause love remembers\nThe smell of a summer day\nLying in a hammock over fresh cut grass\nAnd the promise of forever\nYeah love remembers\nThe sound of the pouring rain\nBeatin' down on the top of a car\nOn the side of the road\nWhere it couldn't wait\nYeah love remembers\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou might convince yourself\nThere's shelter in a bottle\nFor a while there it might numb the pain\nBut when it hits you, then it hits you\nThat love's still gone and you'll be wishin'\nThat you'd poured it down the drain\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause love remembers\nThe taste of cotton candy lip gloss\nOn the lips of a long kiss\nAnd the plans they made together\nYeah love remembers\nTo feel the fingertips\nRunning through soakin' wet hair\nOn the bank after a midnight swim\nYeah love remembers\nYou might also likeYeah love remembers\nThe smell of a summer day\nLying in

he still won't speak to me\nI pawned my grandpa's old guitar in college\nFor a case of beer and a tank of gasoline\nI took a swing at my old man one Christmas\nI never dreamed that it would be his last\nI wish mom had wrung my neck\nWhen she caught me with those cigarettes\nWhich reminds me, I'm down to my last pack\n[Chorus]\nIf I had a dime for half the things I did\nThat didn't make no sense at all\nI'd be living a little higher on the hog\nIf only I'd've known that later on down the road\nI'd look back and not like what I see\nI'd've changed a lot of things\nStarting with me\n\n[Verse 2]\nI called my brother everything I could think of\nThe night he wouldn't bail me out of jail\nI lost a job most folks around here would die for\nBy laying out all night and raising hell\nAnd I let a woman that I love slip through my fingers\nChalk another dumb move up to my foolish pride\nI wasn't there standing by the bed\nWhen the preacher bowed his head\nWith the family, the day my grandma die\n\n[Chorus][x2]See Jake Owen LiveGet tickets as low as $305You might also like1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/426404", "artist_names": "Hilary Duff",

Lyrics[Intro]\nFor you baby, I'd find you\nFor you baby, I'd find you\nFor you baby, I'd find you\n\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nI done been around the world, been around the block\nBeen around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac\nLike Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top\nShe'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc\nLet her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot\nPicture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx\nHype said it's a wrap, she still on the set\nPuttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez\nShe was Eye Candy in the XXL\nHopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell\nI knew she (Wouldn't get far) 'cause five hundred dollars\nCan't get you that (Far), how you get that (Far)\nAnd all these new video bitches tryin' to be Melyssa Ford\nBut they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord\nShe a video vixen, but behind closed doors\nShe do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha\n[Chorus: The Game]\n(You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, put your hands up ladies\n(You wouldn't get far), if you kept your legs closed\n(It would be just a waste of time)\nBut you know, (You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, I wrote this song for you\nFor you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all\n\n[Verse 2: Kanye West]\nPop quiz, how many topless, black foxes\nDid I have under my belt, like boxers?\nNot to brag but, if it add up\nOne, two, nigga, that's mad nuts\nGame, you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these\nBitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me?\nThe only dream, of that ghetto prom queen\nWas to make it to the screen, maybe get seen\nMaybe get chose by a nigga from my team\nHead so good he don't ask for a pre... nup\nNow ask yourself this question, umm\nWould you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O?\nWould you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo?\nWould you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo?\nWell why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'?\nBut since they all fall in my palm, I take a trio, yo\nYou might also like[Chorus: The Game]\n(You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, put your hands up ladies\n(You

you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nI done had my share of bitches with long hair\nShort 'do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah\nI been around the block in the Bentley drop-top\nIn Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott\nI got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case\nShe'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes\nAnd ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonc\u00e9 from Jay\nBut I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day\nThe things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face\nStabbed Un in the stomach\nShe must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman\nOn that superhero shit\nFly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'\nImpala, forget the double D's\nI put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara\nAnd she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo\nThat's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow\n[Chorus: The Game]\n(You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars\nYou know who you are, put

sayin'\nAnd then y'knahmsayin, to make that even mo' fucked up\nI'm watchin' Oprah cover Hurricane Katrina\nI see the same bitch on Oprah\nFloatin away on the hood of a Camry\nThat was in the nigga
