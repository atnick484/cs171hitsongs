she'd known me a long time\nAnd she spoke of being in love\nWith every mountain she had climbed\nAnd she talked of trails she'd walked up\nFar above the timberline\nFrom that night on I knew I'd write songs\nWith Carolina in the pines\n\nThere's a new moon on the fourteenth\nFirst Quarter the 21st\nAnd the full moon in the last week\nBrings a fullness to this earth\nThere's no guesswork in the clockwork\nOn the worlds part or mine\nThere are nights I only feel right\nWith Carolina in the pines\n\nWhen the frost shows on the windows\nAnd the wood stove smokes and glows\nAs the fire grows we can warm our souls\nWatching rainbows in the cove\nAnd well talk of trails weve walked up\nFar above the timberline\nThere are nights I only feel right\nWith Carolina in the pinesYou might also

She had thrust it there after filling it with tobacco, but without stooping to light it at the hearth, where indeed there was no appearance of a fire having been kindled that morning. Forthwith, however, as soon as the order was given, there was an intense red glow out of the bowl of the pipe, and a whiff of smoke came from Mother Rigby's lips. Whence the coal came, and how brought thither by an invisible hand, I have never been able to discover.\n\n\"Good!\" quoth Mother Rigby, with a nod of her head.\n\n\"Thank ye, Dickon! And now for making this scarecrow. Be within call, Dickon, in case I need you again.\"\n\nThe good woman had risen thus early (for as yet it was scarcely sunrise) in order to set about making a scarecrow, which she intended to put in the middle of her corn-patch. It was now the latter week of May, and the crows and blackbirds had already discovered the little, green, rolledup leaf of the Indian corn just peeping out of the soil. She was determined, therefore, to contrive as lifelike a scarecrow as ever was seen, and to finish it immediately, from top to toe, so that it should begin its sentinel's duty that very morning. Now Mother Rigby (as everybody must have heard) was one of the most cunning and potent witches in New England, and might, with very little trouble, have made a scarecrow ugly enough to frighten the minister himself. But on this occasion, as she had awakened in an uncommonly pleasant humor, and was further dulcified by her pipe tobacco, she resolved to produce something fine, beautiful, and splendid, rather than hideous and horrible.\n\n\"I don't want to set up a hobgoblin in my own corn-patch, and almost at my own doorstep,\" said Mother Rigby to herself, puffing out a whiff of smoke;\n\"I could do it if I pleased, but I'm tired of doing marvellous things, and so I'll keep within the bounds of every-day business just for variety's sake. Besides, there is no use in scaring the little children for a mile roundabout, though 't is true I'm a witch.\"\n\nIt was settled, therefore, in her own mind, that the scarecrow should represent a fine gentleman of the period, so far as the materials at hand would allow. Perhaps it may be as well to enumerate the chief of the articles that went to the composition of this figure.\n\nThe most important item of all, probably, although it made so little show, was a certain broomstick, on which Mother Rigby had taken many an airy gallop at midnight, and which now served the scarecrow by way of a spinal column, or, as the unlearned phrase it, a backbone. One of its arms was a disabled flail which used to be wielded by Goodman Rigby, before his spouse worried him out of this troublesome world; the other, if I mistake not, was composed of the pudding stick and a broken rung of a chair, tied loosely together at the elbow. As for its legs, the right was a ho handle, and the left an undistinguished and miscellaneous stick from the woodpile. Its lungs, stomach, and other affairs of that kind were nothing better than a meal bag stuffed with straw. Thus we have made out the skeleton and entire corporosity of the scarecrow, with the exception of its head; and this was admirably supplied by a somewhat withered and shrivelled pumpkin, in which Mother Rigby cut two holes for the eyes and a slit for the mouth, leaving a bluish-colored knob in the middle to pass for a nose. It was really quite a respectable face.\n\n\"I've seen worse ones on human shoulders, at any rate,\" said Mother Rigby.\n\n\"And many a fine gentleman has a pumpkin head, as well as my scarecrow.\"\n\nBut the clothes, in this case, were to be the making of the man. So the good old woman took down from a peg an ancient plum-colored coat of London make, and with relics of embroidery on its seams, cuffs, pocket-flaps, and button-holes, but lamentably worn and faded, patched at the elbows, tattered at the skirts, and threadbare all over. On the left breast was a round hole, whence either a star of nobility had been rent away, or else the hot heart of some former wearer had scorched it through and through. The neighbors said that this rich garment belonged to the Black Man's wardrobe, and that he kept it at Mother Rigby's cottage for the convenience of slipping it on whenever he wished to make a grand appearance at the governor's table. To match the coat there was a velvet waistcoat of very ample size, and formerly embroidered with foliage that had been as brightly golden as the maple leaves in October, but which had now quite vanished out of the substance of the velvet. Next came a pair of scarlet breeches, once worn by the French governor of Louisbourg, and the knees of which had touched the lower step of the throne of Louis le Grand. The Frenchman had given these small-clothes to an Indian powwow, who parted with them to the old witch for a gill of strong waters, at one of their dances in the forest. Furthermore, Mother Rigby produced a pair of silk stockings and put them on the figure's legs, where they showed as unsubstantial as a dream, with the wooden reality of the two sticks making itself miserably apparent through the holes. Lastly, she put her dead husband's wig on the bare scalp of the pumpkin, and surmounted the whole with a dusty three-cornered hat, in which was stuck the longest tail feather of a rooster.\n\nThen the old dame stood the figure up in a corner of her cottage and chuckled to behold its yellow semblance of a visage, with its nobby little nose thrust into the air. It had a strangely self-satisfied aspect, and seemed to say,\n\n\"Come look at me!\"\n\n\"And you are well worth looking at, that's a fact!\" quoth Mother Rigby, in admiration at her own handiwork.\n\n\"I've made many a puppet since I've been a witch, but methinks this is the finest of them all. 'Tis almost too good for a scarecrow. And, by the by, I'll just fill a fresh pipe of tobacco and then take him out to the corn-patch.\"\n\nWhile filling her pipe the old woman continued to gaze with almost motherly affection at the figure in the corner. To say the truth, whether it were chance, or skill, or downright witchcraft, there was something wonderfully human in this ridiculous shape, bedizened with its tattered finery; and as for the countenance, it appeared to shrivel its yellow surface into a grin\u2014a funny kind of expression betwixt scorn and merriment, as if it understood itself to be a jest at mankind. The more Mother Rigby looked the better she was pleased.\n\n\"Dickon,\" cried she sharply,\n\n\"another coal for my pipe!\"\nHardly had she spoken, than, just as before, there was a red-glowing coal on the top of the tobacco. She drew in a long whiff and puffed it forth again into the bar of morning sunshine which struggled through the one dusty pane of her cottage window. Mother Rigby always liked to flavor her pipe with a coal of fire from the particular chimney corner whence this had been brought. But where that chimney corner might be, or who brought the coal from it,\u2014further than that the invisible messenger seemed to respond to the name of Dickon,\u2014I cannot tell.\n\n\"That puppet yonder,\" thought Mother Rigby, still with her eyes fixed on the scarecrow,\n\n\"is too good a piece of work to stand all summer in a corn-patch, frightening away the crows and blackbirds. He's capable of better things. Why, I've danced with a worse one, when partners happened to be scarce, at our witch meetings in the forest! What if I should let him take his chance among the other men of straw and empty fellows who go bustling about the world?\"\n\nThe old witch took three or four more whiffs of her pipe and smiled.\n\n\"He'll meet plenty of his brethren at every street corner!\" continued she.\n\n\"Well; I didn't mean to dabble in witchcraft to-day, further than the lighting of my pipe, but a witch I am, and a witch I'm likely to be, and there's no use trying to shirk it. I'll make a man of my scarecrow, were it only for the joke's sake!\"\n\nWhile muttering these words, Mother Rigby took the pipe from her own mouth and thrust it into the crevice which represented the same feature in the pumpkin visage of the scarecrow.\n\n\"Puff, darling, puff!\" said she.\n\n\"Puff away, my fine fellow! your life depends on it!\"\n\nThis was a strange exhortation, undoubtedly, to be addressed to a mere thing of sticks, straw, and old clothes, with nothing better than a shrivelled pumpkin for a head,\u2014as we know to have been the scarecrow's case. Nevertheless, as we must carefully hold in remembrance, Mother Rigby was a witch of singular power and dexterity; and, keeping this fact duly before our minds, we shall see nothing beyond credibility in the remarkable incidents of our story. Indeed, the great difficulty will be at once got over, if we can only bring ourselves to believe that, as soon as the old dame bade him puff, there came a whiff of smoke from the scarecrow's mouth. It was the very feeblest of whiffs, to be sure; but it was followed by another and another, each more decided than the preceding one.\n\n\"Puff away, my pet! puff away, my pretty one!\" Mother Rigby kept repeating, with her pleasantest smile.\n\n\"It is the breath of life to ye; and that you may take my word for.\"\n\nBeyond all question the pipe was bewitched. There must have been a spell either in the tobacco or in the fiercely-glowing coal that so mysteriously burned on top of it, or in the pungently-aromatic smoke which exhaled from the kindled weed. The figure, after a few doubtful attempts at length blew forth a volley of smoke extending all the way from the obscure corner into the bar of sunshine. There it eddied and melted away among the motes of dust. It seemed a convulsive effort; for the two or three next whiffs were fainter, although the coal still glowed and threw a gleam over the scarecrow's visage. The old witch clapped her skinny hands together, and smiled encouragingly upon her handiwork. She saw that the charm worked well. The shrivelled, yellow face, which heretofore had been no face at all, had already a thin, fantastic haze, as it were of human likeness, shifting to and fro across it; sometimes vanishing entirely, but growing more perceptible than ever with the next whiff from the pipe. The whole figure, in like manner, assumed a show of life, such as we impart to ill-defined shapes among the clouds, and half deceive ourselves with the pastime of our own fancy.\nIf we must needs pry closely into the matter, it may be doubted whether there was any real change, after all, in the sordid, wornout worthless, and ill-jointed substance of the scarecrow; but merely a spectral illusion, and a cunning effect of light and shade so colored and contrived as to delude the eyes of most men. The miracles of witchcraft seem always to have had a very shallow subtlety; and, at least, if the above explanation do not hit the truth of the process, I can suggest no better.\n\n\"Well puffed, my pretty lad!\" still cried old Mother Rigby.\n\n\"Come, another good stout whiff, and let it be with might and main. Puff for thy life, I tell thee! Puff out of the very bottom of thy heart, if any heart thou hast, or any bottom to it! Well done, again! Thou didst suck in that mouthful as if for the pure love of it.\"\n\nAnd then the witch beckoned to the scarecrow, throwing so much magnetic potency into her gesture that it seemed as if it must inevitably be obeyed, like the mystic call of the loadstone when it summons the iron.\n\n\"Why lurkest thou in the corner, lazy one?\" said she.\n\n\"Step forth! Thou hast the world before thee!\"\n\nUpon my word, if the legend were not one which I heard on my grandmother's knee, and which had established its place among things credible before my childish judgment could analyze its probability, I question whether I should have the face to tell it now.\n\nIn obedience to Mother Rigby's word, and extending its arm as if to reach her outstretched hand, the figure made a step forward\u2014a kind of hitch and jerk, however, rather than a step\u2014then tottered and almost lost its balance. What could the witch expect? It was nothing, after all, but a scarecrow stuck upon two sticks. But the strong-willed old beldam scowled, and beckoned, and flung the energy of her purpose so forcibly at this poor combination of rotten wood, and musty straw, and ragged garments, that it was compelled to show itself a man, in spite of the reality of things. So it stepped into the bar of sunshine. There it stood, poor devil of a contrivance that it was!\u2014with only the thinnest vesture of human similitude about it, through which was evident the stiff, rickety, incongruous, faded, tattered, good-for-nothing patchwork of its substance, ready to sink in a heap upon the floor, as conscious of its own unworthiness to be erect. Shall I confess the truth? At its present point of vivification, the scarecrow reminds me of some of the lukewarm and abortive characters, composed of heterogeneous materials, used for the thousandth time, and never worth using, with which romance writers (and myself, no doubt, among the rest) have so overpeopled the world of fiction.\n\nBut the fierce old hag began to get angry and show a glimpse of her diabolic nature (like a snake's head, peeping with a hiss out of her bosom), at this pusillanimous behavior of the thing which she had taken the trouble to put together.\n\n\"Puff away, wretch!\" cried she, wrathfully.\n\n\"Puff, puff, puff, thou thing of straw and emptiness! thou rag or two! thou meal bag! thou pumpkin head! thou nothing! Where shall I find a name vile enough to call thee by? Puff, I say, and suck in thy fantastic life with the smoke! else I snatch the pipe from thy mouth and hurl thee where that red coal came from.\"\n\nThus threatened, the unhappy scarecrow had nothing for it but to puff away for dear life. As need was, therefore, it applied itself lustily to the pipe, and sent forth such abundant volleys of tobacco smoke that the small cottage kitchen became all vaporous. The one sunbeam struggled mistily through, and could but imperfectly define the image of the cracked and dusty window pane on the opposite wall. Mother Rigby, meanwhile, with one brown arm akimbo and the other stretched towards the figure, loomed grimly amid the obscurity with such port and expression as when she was won't to heave a ponderous nightmare on her victims and stand at the bedside to enjoy their agony. In fear and trembling did this poor scarecrow puff. But its efforts, it must be acknowledged, served an excellent purpose; for, with each successive whiff, the figure lost more and more of its dizzy and perplexing tenuity and seemed to take denser substance. Its very garments, moreover, partook of the magical change, and shone with the gloss of novelty and glistened with the skilfully embroidered gold that had long ago been rent away. And, half revealed among the smoke, a yellow visage bent its lustreless eyes on Mother Rigby.\n\nAt last the old witch clinched her fist and shook it at the figure. Not that she was positively angry, but merely acting on the principle\u2014perhaps untrue, or not the only truth, though as high a one as Mother Rigby could be expected to attain\u2014that feeble and torpid natures, being incapable of better inspiration, must be stirred up by fear. But here was the crisis. Should she fail in what she now sought to effect, it was her ruthless purpose to scatter the miserable simulacre into its original elements.\n\n\"Thou hast a man's aspect,\" said she, sternly.\n\n\"Have also the echo and mockery of a voice! I bid thee speak!\"\n\nThe scarecrow gasped, struggled, and at length emitted a murmur, which was so incorporated with its smoky breath that you could scarcely tell whether it were indeed a voice or only a whiff of tobacco. Some narrators of this legend hold the opinion that Mother Rigby's conjurations and the fierceness of her will had compelled a familiar spirit into the figure, and that the voice was his.\n\n\"Mother,\" mumbled the poor stifled voice,\n\n\"be not so awful with me! I would fain speak; but being without wits, what can I say?\"\n\n\"Thou canst speak, darling, canst thou?\" cried Mother Rigby, relaxing her grim countenance into a smile.\n\n\"And what shalt thou say, quoth-a! Say, indeed! Art thou of the brotherhood of the empty skull, and demandest of me what thou shalt say? Thou shalt say a thousand things, and saying them a thousand times over, thou shalt still have said nothing! Be not afraid, I tell thee! When thou comest into the world (whither I purpose sending thee forthwith) thou shalt not lack the wherewithal to talk. Talk! Why, thou shall babble like a mill-stream, if thou wilt. Thou hast brains enough for that, I trow!\"\n\n\"At your service, mother,\" responded the figure.\n\n\"And that was well said, my pretty one,\" answered Mother Rigby.\n\n\"Then thou speakest like thyself, and meant nothing. Thou shalt have a hundred such set phrases, and five hundred to the boot of them. And now, darling, I have taken so much pains with thee and thou art so beautiful, that, by my troth, I love thee better than any witch's puppet in the world; and I've made them of all sorts\u2014clay, wax, straw, sticks, night fog, morning mist, sea foam, and chimney smoke. But thou art the very best. So give heed to what I say.\"\n\n\"Yes, kind mother,\" said the figure,\n\n\"with all my heart!\"\n\n\"With all thy heart!\" cried the old witch, setting her hands to her sides and laughing loudly.\n\n\"Thou hast such a pretty way of speaking. With all thy heart! And thou didst put thy hand to the left side of thy waistcoat as if thou really hadst one!\"\n\nSo now, in high good humor with this fantastic contrivance of hers, Mother Rigby told the scarecrow that it must go and play its part in the great world, where not one man in a hundred, she affirmed, was gifted with more real substance than itself. And, that he might hold up his head with the best of them, she endowed him, on the spot, with an unreckonable amount of wealth. It consisted partly of a gold mine in Eldorado, and of ten thousand shares in a broken bubble, and of half a million acres of vineyard at the North Pole, and of a castle in the air, and a chateau in Spain, together with all the rents and income therefrom accruing. She further made over to him the cargo of a certain ship, laden with salt of Cadiz, which she herself, by her necromantic arts, had caused to founder, ten years before, in the deepest part of mid-ocean. If the salt were not dissolved, and could be brought to market, it would fetch a pretty penny among the fishermen. That he might not lack ready money, she gave him a copper farthing of Birmingham manufacture, being all the coin she had about her, and likewise a great deal of brass, which she applied to his forehead, thus making it yellower than ever.\n\n\"With that brass alone,\" quoth Mother Rigby,\n\n\"thou canst pay thy way all over the earth. Kiss me, pretty darling! I have done my best for thee.\"\n\nFurthermore, that the adventurer might lack no possible advantage towards a fair start in life, this excellent old dame gave him a token by which he was to introduce himself to a certain magistrate, member of the council, merchant, and elder of the church (the four capacities constituting but one man), who stood at the head of society in the neighboring metropolis. The token was neither more nor less than a single word, which Mother Rigby whispered to the scarecrow, and which the scarecrow was to whisper to the merchant.\n\n\"Gouty as the old fellow is, he'll run thy errands for thee, when once thou hast given him that word in his ear,\" said the old witch.\n\n\"Mother Rigby knows the worshipful Justice Gookin, and the worshipful Justice knows Mother Rigby!\"\n\nHere the witch thrust her wrinkled face close to the puppet's, chuckling irrepressibly, and fidgeting all through her system, with delight at the idea which she meant to communicate.\n\n\"The worshipful Master Gookin,\" whispered she,\n\n\"hath a comely maiden to his daughter. And hark ye, my pet! Thou hast a fair outside, and a pretty wit enough of thine own. Yea, a pretty wit enough! Thou wilt think better of it when thou hast seen more of other people's wits. Now, with thy outside and thy inside, thou art the very man to win a young girl's heart. Never doubt it! I tell thee it shall be so. Put but a bold face on the matter, sigh, smile, flourish thy hat, thrust forth thy leg like a dancing-master, put thy right hand to the left side of thy waistcoat, and pretty Polly Gookin is thine own!\"\n\nAll this while the new creature had been sucking in and exhaling the vapory fragrance of his pipe, and seemed now to continue this occupation as much for the enjoyment it afforded as because it was an essential condition of his existence. It was wonderful to see how exceedingly like a human being it behaved. Its eyes (for it appeared to possess a pair) were bent on Mother Rigby, and at suitable junctures it nodded or shook its head. Neither did it lack words proper for the occasion:\n\n\"Really! Indeed! Pray tell me! Is it possible! Upon my word! By no means! Oh! Ah! Hem!\" a\n\nnd other such weighty utterances as imply attention, inquiry, acquiescence, or dissent on the part of the auditor. Even had you stood by and seen the scarecrow made, you could scarcely have resisted the conviction that it perfectly understood the cunning counsels which the old witch poured into its counterfeit of an ear. The more earnestly it applied its lips to the pipe, the more distinctly was its human likeness stamped among visible realities, the more sagacious grew its expression, the more lifelike its gestures and movements, and the more intelligibly audible its voice. Its garments, too, glistened so much the brighter with an illusory magnificence. The very pipe, in which burned the spell of all this wonderwork, ceased to appear as a smoke-blackened earthen stump, and became a meerschaum, with painted bowl and amber mouthpiece.\n\nIt might be apprehended, however, that as the life of the illusion seemed identical with the vapor of the pipe, it would terminate simultaneously with the reduction of the tobacco to ashes. But the beldam foresaw the difficulty.\n\n\"Hold thou the pipe, my precious one,\" said she, \"while I fill it for thee again.\"\n\nIt was sorrowful to behold how the fine gentleman began to fade back into a scarecrow while Mother Rigby shook the ashes out of the pipe and proceeded to replenish it from her tobacco-box.\n\n\"Dickon,\" cried she, in her high, sharp tone,\n\n\"another coal for this pipe!\"\n\nNo sooner said than the intensely red speck of fire was glowing within the pipe-bowl; and the scarecrow, without waiting for the witch's bidding, applied the tube to his lips and drew in a few short, convulsive whiffs, which soon, however, became regular and equable.\n\n\"Now, mine own heart's darling,\" quoth Mother Rigby,\n\n\"whatever may happen to thee, thou must stick to thy pipe. Thy life is in it; and that, at least, thou knowest well, if thou knowest nought besides. Stick to thy pipe, I say! Smoke, puff, blow thy cloud; and tell the people, if any question be made, that it is for thy health, and that so the physician orders thee to do. And, sweet one, when thou shalt find thy pipe getting low, go apart into some corner, and (first filling thyself with smoke) cry sharply, 'Dickon, a fresh pipe of tobacco!' and, 'Dickon, another coal for my pipe!' and have it into thy pretty mouth as speedily as may be. Else, instead of a gallant gentleman in a gold-laced coat, thou wilt be but a jumble of sticks and tattered clothes, and a bag of straw, and a withered pumpkin! Now depart, my treasure, and good luck go with thee!\"\n\n\"Never fear, mother!\" said the figure, in a stout voice, and sending forth a courageous whiff of smoke,\n\n\"I will thrive, if an honest man and a gentleman may!\"\n\n\"Oh, thou wilt be the death of me!\" cried the old witch, convulsed with laughter.\n\n\"That was well said. If an honest man and a gentleman may! Thou playest thy part to perfection. Get along with thee for a smart fellow; and I will wager on thy head, as a man of pith and substance, with a brain and what they call a heart, and all else that a man should have, against any other thing on two legs. I hold myself a better witch than yesterday, for thy sake. Did not I make thee? And I defy any witch in New England to make such another! Here; take my staff along with thee!\"\n\nThe staff, though it was but a plain oaken stick, immediately took the aspect of a gold-headed cane.\n\n\"That gold head has as much sense in it as thine own,\" said Mother Rigby,\n\n\"and it will guide thee straight to worshipful Master Gookin's door. Get thee gone, my pretty pet, my darling, my precious one, my treasure; and if any ask thy name, it is Feathertop. For thou hast a feather in thy hat, and I have thrust a handful of feathers into the hollow of thy head, and thy wig, too, is of the fashion they call Feathertop,\u2014so be Feathertop thy name!\"\n\nAnd, issuing from the cottage, Feathertop strode manfully towards town. Mother Rigby stood at the threshold, well pleased to see how the sunbeams glistened on him, as if all his magnificence were real, and how diligently and lovingly he smoked his pipe, and how handsomely he walked, in spite of a little stiffness of his legs. She watched him until out of sight, and threw a witch benediction after her darling, when a turn of the road snatched him from her view.\n\nBetimes in the forenoon, when the principal street of the neighboring town was just at its acme of life and bustle, a stranger of very distinguished figure was seen on the sidewalk. His port as well as his garments betokened nothing short of nobility. He wore a richly-embroidered plum-colored coat, a waistcoat of costly velvet, magnificently adorned with golden foliage, a pair of splendid scarlet breeches, and the finest and glossiest of white silk stockings. His head was covered with a peruke, so daintily powdered and adjusted that it would have been sacrilege to disorder it with a hat; which, therefore (and it was a gold-laced hat, set off with a snowy feather), he carried beneath his arm. On the breast of his coat glistened a star. He managed his gold-headed cane with an airy grace, peculiar to the fine gentlemen of the period; and, to give the highest possible finish to his equipment, he had lace ruffles at his wrist, of a most ethereal delicacy, sufficiently avouching how idle and aristocratic must be the hands which they half concealed.\n\nIt was a remarkable point in the accoutrement of this brilliant personage that he held in his left hand a fantastic kind of a pipe, with an exquisitely painted bowl and an amber mouthpiece. This he applied to his lips as often as every five or six paces, and inhaled a deep whiff of smoke, which, after being retained a moment in his lungs, might be seen to eddy gracefully from his mouth and nostrils.\n\nAs may well be supposed, the street was all astir to find out the stranger's name.\n\n\"It is some great nobleman, beyond question,\" said one of the townspeople.\n\n\"Do you see the star at his breast?\"\n\n\"Nay; it is too bright to be seen,\" said another.\n\n\"Yes; he must needs be a nobleman, as you say. But by what conveyance, think you, can his lordship have voyaged or travelled hither? There has been no vessel from the old country for a month past; and if he have arrived overland from the southward, pray where are his attendants and equipage?\"\n\n\"He needs no equipage to set off his rank,\" remarked a third.\n\n\"If he came among us in rags, nobility would shine through a hole in his elbow. I never saw such dignity of aspect. He has the old Norman blood in his veins, I warrant him.\"\n\n\"I rather take him to be a Dutchman, or one of your high Germans,\" said another citizen.\n\n\"The men of those countries have always the pipe at their mouths.\"\n\n\"And so has a Turk,\" answered his companion.\n\n\"But, in my judgment, this stranger hath been bred at the French court, and hath there learned politeness and grace of manner, which none understand so well as the nobility of France. That gait, now! A vulgar spectator might deem it stiff\u2014he might call it a hitch and jerk\u2014but, to my eye, it hath an unspeakable majesty, and must have been acquired by constant observation of the deportment of the Grand Monarque. The stranger's character and office are evident enough. He is a French ambassador, come to treat with our rulers about the cession of Canada.\"\n\n\"More probably a Spaniard,\" said another,\n\n\"and hence his yellow complexion; or, most likely, he is from the Havana, or from some port on the Spanish main, and comes to make investigation about the piracies which our government is thought to connive at. Those settlers in Peru and Mexico have skins as yellow as the gold which they dig out of their mines.\"\n\n\"Yellow or not,\" cried a lady,\n\n\"he is a beautiful man!\u2014so tall, so slender! such a fine, noble face, with so well-shaped a nose, and all that delicacy of expression about the mouth! And, bless me, how bright his star is! It positively shoots out flames!\"\n\n\"So do your eyes, fair lady,\" said the stranger, with a bow and a flourish of his pipe; for he was just passing at the instant.\n\n\"Upon my honor, they have quite dazzled me.\"\n\n\"Was ever so original and exquisite a compliment?\" murmured the lady, in an ecstasy of delight.\n\nAmid the general admiration excited by the stranger's appearance, there were only two dissenting voices. One was that of an impertinent cur, which, after snuffing at the heels of the glistening figure, put its tail between its legs and skulked into its master's back yard, vociferating an execrable howl. The other dissentient was a young child, who squalled at the fullest stretch of his lungs, and babbled some unintelligible nonsense about a pumpkin.\n\nFeathertop meanwhile pursued his way along the street. Except for the few complimentary words to the lady, and now and then a slight inclination of the head in requital of the profound reverences of the bystanders, he seemed wholly absorbed in his pipe. There needed no other proof of his rank and consequence than the perfect equanimity with which he comported himself, while the curiosity and admiration of the town swelled almost into clamor around him. With a crowd gathering behind his footsteps, he finally reached the mansion-house of the worshipful Justice Gookin, entered the gate, ascended the steps of the front door, and knocked. In the interim, before his summons was answered, the stranger was observed to shake the ashes out of his pipe.\n\n\"What did he say in that sharp voice?\" inquired one of the spectators.\n\n\"Nay, I know not,\" answered his friend. \"But the sun dazzles my eyes strangely. How dim and faded his lordship looks all of a sudden! Bless my wits, what is the matter with me?\"\n\n\"The wonder is,\" said the other,\n\n\"that his pipe, which was out only an instant ago, should be all alight again, and with the reddest coal I ever saw. There is something mysterious about this stranger. What a whiff of smoke was that! Dim and faded did you call him? Why, as he turns about the star on his breast is all ablaze.\"\n\n\"It is, indeed,\" said his companion;\n\n\"and it will go near to dazzle pretty Polly Gookin, whom I see peeping at it out of the chamber window.\"\n\nThe door being now opened, Feathertop turned to the crowd, made a stately bend of his body like a great man acknowledging the reverence of the meaner sort, and vanished into the house. There was a mysterious kind of a smile, if it might not better be called a grin or grimace, upon his visage; but, of all the throng that beheld him, not an individual appears to have possessed insight enough to detect the illusive character of the stranger except a little child and a cur dog.\n\nOur legend here loses somewhat of its continuity, and, passing over the preliminary explanation between Feathertop and the merchant, goes in quest of the pretty Polly Gookin. She was a damsel of a soft, round figure, with light hair and blue eyes, and a fair, rosy face, which seemed neither very shrewd nor very simple. This young lady had caught a glimpse of the glistening stranger while standing on the threshold, and had forthwith put on a laced cap, a string of beads, her finest kerchief, and her stiffest damask petticoat in preparation for the interview. Hurrying from her chamber to the parlor, she had ever since been viewing herself in the large looking-glass and practising pretty airs-now a smile, now a ceremonious dignity of aspect, and now a softer smile than the former, kissing her hand likewise, tossing her head, and managing her fan; while within the mirror an unsubstantial little maid repeated every gesture and did all the foolish things that Polly did, but without making her ashamed of them. In short, it was the fault of pretty Polly's ability rather than her will if she failed to be as complete an artifice as the illustrious Feathertop himself; and, when she thus tampered with her own simplicity, the witch's phantom might well hope to win her.\n\nNo sooner did Polly hear her father's gouty footsteps approaching the parlor door, accompanied with the stiff clatter of Feathertop's high-heeled shoes, than she seated herself bolt upright and innocently began warbling a song.\n\n\"Polly! daughter Polly!\" cried the old merchant.\n\n\"Come hither, child.\"\n\nMaster Gookin's aspect, as he opened the door, was doubtful and troubled.\n\n\"This gentleman,\" continued he, presenting the stranger,\n\n\"is the Chevalier Feathertop,\u2014nay, I beg his pardon, my Lord Feathertop,\u2014who hath brought me a token of remembrance from an ancient friend of mine. Pay your duty to his lordship, child, and honor him as his quality deserves.\"\n\nAfter these few words of introduction, the worshipful magistrate immediately quitted the room. But, even in that brief moment, had the fair Polly glanced aside at her father instead of devoting herself wholly to the brilliant guest, she might have taken warning of some mischief nigh at hand. The old man was nervous, fidgety, and very pale. Purposing a smile of courtesy, he had deformed his face with a sort of galvanic grin, which, when Feathertop's back was turned, he exchanged for a scowl, at the same time shaking his fist and stamping his gouty foot\u2014an incivility which brought its retribution along with it. The truth appears to have been that Mother Rigby's word of introduction, whatever it might be, had operated far more on the rich merchant's fears than on his good will. Moreover, being a man of wonderfully acute observation, he had noticed that these painted figures on the bowl of Feathertop's pipe were in motion. Looking more closely he became convinced that these figures were a party of little demons, each duly provided with horns and a tail, and dancing hand in hand, with gestures of diabolical merriment, round the circumference of the pipe bowl. As if to confirm his suspicions, while Master Gookin ushered his guest along a dusky passage from his private room to the parlor, the star on Feathertop's breast had scintillated actual flames, and threw a flickering gleam upon the wall, the ceiling, and the floor.\n\nWith such sinister prognostics manifesting themselves on all hands, it is not to be marvelled at that the merchant should have felt that he was committing his daughter to a very questionable acquaintance. He cursed, in his secret soul, the insinuating elegance of Feathertop's manners, as this brilliant personage bowed, smiled, put his hand on his heart, inhaled a long whiff from his pipe, and enriched the atmosphere with the smoky vapor of a fragrant and visible sigh. Gladly would poor Master Gookin have thrust his dangerous guest into the street; but there was a constraint and terror within him. This respectable old gentleman, we fear, at an earlier period of life, had given some pledge or other to the evil principle, and perhaps was now to redeem it by the sacrifice of his daughter.\n\nIt so happened that the parlor door was partly of glass, shaded by a silken curtain, the folds of which hung a little awry. So strong was the merchant's interest in witnessing what was to ensue between the fair Polly and the gallant Feathertop that, after quitting the room, he could by no means refrain from peeping through the crevice of the curtain.\n\nBut there was nothing very miraculous to be seen; nothing\u2014except the trifles previously noticed\u2014to confirm the idea of a supernatural peril environing the pretty Polly. The stranger it is true was evidently a thorough and practised man of the world, systematic and self-possessed, and therefore the sort of a person to whom a parent ought not to confide a simple, young girl without due watchfulness for the result. The worthy magistrate who had been conversant with all degrees and qualities of mankind, could not but perceive every motion and gesture of the distinguished Feathertop came in its proper place; nothing had been left rude or native in him; a well-digested conventionalism had incorporated itself thoroughly with his substance and transformed him into a work of art. Perhaps it was this peculiarity that invested him with a species of ghastliness and awe. It is the effect of anything completely and consummately artificial, in human shape, that the person impresses us as an unreality and as having hardly pith enough to cast a shadow upon the floor. As regarded Feathertop, all this resulted in a wild, extravagant, and fantastical impression, as if his life and being were akin to the smoke that curled upward from his pipe.\n\nBut pretty Polly Gookin felt not thus. The pair were now promenading the room: Feathertop with his dainty stride and no less dainty grimace, the girl with a native maidenly grace, just touched, not spoiled, by a slightly affected manner, which seemed caught from the perfect artifice of her companion. The longer the interview continued, the more charmed was pretty Polly, until, within the first quarter of an hour (as the old magistrate noted by his watch), she was evidently beginning to be in love. Nor need it have been witchcraft that subdued her in such a hurry; the poor child's heart, it may be, was so very fervent that it melted her with its own warmth as reflected from the hollow semblance of a lover. No matter what Feathertop said, his words found depth and reverberation in her ear; no matter what he did, his action was heroic to her eye. And by this time it is to be supposed there was a blush on Polly's cheek, a tender smile about her mouth and a liquid softness in her glance; while the star kept coruscating on Feathertop's breast, and the little demons careered with more frantic merriment than ever about the circumference of his pipe bowl. O pretty Polly Gookin, why should these imps rejoice so madly that a silly maiden's heart was about to be given to a shadow! Is it so unusual a misfortune, so rare a triumph?\n\nBy and by Feathertop paused, and throwing himself into an imposing attitude, seemed to summon the fair girl to survey his figure and resist him longer if she could. His star, his embroidery, his buckles glowed at that instant with unutterable splendor; the picturesque hues of his attire took a richer depth of coloring; there was a gleam and polish over his whole presence betokening the perfect witchery of well-ordered manners. The maiden raised her eyes and suffered them to linger upon her companion with a bashful and admiring gaze. Then, as if desirous of judging what value her own simple comeliness might have side by side with so much brilliancy, she cast a glance towards the full-length looking-glass in front of which they happened to be standing. It was one of the truest plates in the world and incapable of flattery. No sooner did the images therein reflected meet Polly's eye than she shrieked, shrank from the stranger's side, gazed at him for a moment in the wildest dismay, and sank insensible upon the floor. Feathertop likewise had looked towards the mirror, and there beheld, not the glittering mockery of his outside show, but a picture of the sordid patchwork of his real composition stripped of all witchcraft.\n\nThe wretched simulacrum! We almost pity him. He threw up his arms with an expression of despair that went further than any of his previous manifestations towards vindicating his claims to be reckoned human, for perchance the only time since this so often empty and deceptive life of mortals began its course, an illusion had seen and fully recognized itself.\n\nMother Rigby was seated by her kitchen hearth in the twilight of this eventful day, and had just shaken the ashes out of a new pipe, when she heard a hurried tramp along the road. Yet it did not seem so much the tramp of human footsteps as the clatter of sticks or the rattling of dry bones.\n\n\"Ha!\" thought the old witch,\n\n\"what step is that? Whose skeleton is out of its grave now, I wonder?\"\n\nA figure burst headlong into the cottage door. It was Feathertop! His pipe was still alight; the star still flamed upon his breast; the embroidery still glowed upon his garments; nor had he lost, in any degree or manner that could be estimated, the aspect that assimilated him with our mortal brotherhood. But yet, in some indescribable way (as is the case with all that has deluded us when once found out), the poor reality was felt beneath the cunning artifice.\n\n\"What has gone wrong?\" demanded the witch.\n\n\"Did yonder sniffling hypocrite thrust my darling from his door? The villain! I'll set twenty fiends to torment him till he offer thee his daughter on his bended knees!\"\n\n\"No, mother,\" said Feathertop despondingly;\n\n\"it was not that.\"\n\n\"Did the girl scorn my precious one?\" asked Mother Rigby, her fierce eyes glowing like two coals of Tophet.\n\n\"I'll cover her face with pimples! Her nose shall be as red as the coal in thy pipe! Her front teeth shall drop out! In a week hence she shall not be worth thy having!\"\n\n\"Let her alone, mother,\" answered poor Feathertop;\n\n\"the girl was half won; and methinks a kiss from her sweet lips might have made me altogether human. But,\" he added, after a brief pause and then a howl of self-contempt,\n\n\"I've seen myself, mother! I've seen myself for the wretched, ragged, empty thing I am! I'll exist no longer!\"\n\nSnatching the pipe from his mouth, he flung it with all his might against the chimney, and at the same instant sank upon the floor, a medley of straw and tattered garments, with some sticks protruding from the heap, and a shrivelled pumpkin in the midst. The eyeholes were now lustreless; but the rudely-carved gap, that just before had been a mouth still seemed to twist itself into a despairing grin, and was so far human.\n\n\"Poor fellow!\" quoth Mother Rigby, with a rueful glance at the relics of her ill-fated contrivance.\n\n\"My poor, dear, pretty Feathertop! There are thousands upon thousands of coxcombs and charlatans in the world, made up of just such a jumble of wornout, forgotten, and good-for-nothing trash as he was! Yet they live in fair repute, and never see themselves for what they are. And why should my poor puppet be the only one to know himself and perish for it?\"\n\nWhile thus muttering, the witch had filled a fresh pipe of tobacco, and held the stem between her fingers, as doubtful whether to thrust it into her own mouth or Feathertop's.\n\n\"Poor Feathertop!\" she continued.\n\n\"I could easily give him another chance and send him forth again tomorrow. But no; his feelings are too tender, his sensibilities too deep. He seems to have too much heart to bustle for his own advantage in such an empty and heartless world. Well! well! I'll make a scarecrow of him after all. 'Tis an innocent and useful vocation, and will suit my darling well; and, if each of his human brethren had as fit a one, 't would be the better for mankind; and as for this pipe of tobacco, I need it more than he.\"\n\nSo saying Mother Rigby put the stem between her lips.\n\n\"Dickon!\" cried she, in her high, sharp tone,\n\n\"another coal for my pipe!\"Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/281510", "artist_names": "Grand Funk Railroad", "full_title": "Some Kind of Wonderful by\u00a0Grand\u00a0Funk Railroad", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e6b6d4cea9f9ebd662dc0b08bbfacffa.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e6b6d4cea9f9ebd662dc0b08bbfacffa.600x600x1.jpg", "id": 281510, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1553, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1656100603, "path": "/Grand-funk-railroad-some-kind-of-wonderful-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 6, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Grand-funk-railroad-some-kind-of-wonderful-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1974, "month": 12, "day": 1}, "release_date_for_display": "December 1, 1974", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Dec. 1, 1974", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e6b6d4cea9f9ebd662dc0b08bbfacffa.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e6b6d4cea9f9ebd662dc0b08bbfacffa.600x600x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 15802}, "title": "Some Kind of Wonderful", "title_with_featured": "Some Kind of Wonderful", "updated_by_human_at": 1656100604, "url": "https://genius.com/Grand-funk-railroad-some-kind-of-wonderful-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/37783", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/af1e1954ab9f3035e4389f312dc6a88d.770x770x1.jpg", "id": 37783, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/af1e1954ab9f3035e4389f312dc6a88d.770x770x1.jpg", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Grand Funk Railroad", "slug": "Grand-funk-railroad", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Grand-funk-railroad"}, "artist": "Grand Funk Railroad", "lyrics": "Some Kind of Wonderful Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI don't need a whole lots of money\nI don't need a big fine car\nI got everything that a man could want\nI got more than I could ask for\nI don't have to run around\nI don't have to stay out all night\n'Cause I got me a sweet, a sweet, lovin' woman\nAnd she knows just how to treat me right\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, my baby, she's alright\nWell, my baby, she's clean out-of-sight\nDon't you know that she's, she's some kind of wonderful?\nShe's some kind of wonderful, yes, she is, she's\nShe's some kind of wonderful, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n[Verse 2]\nWhen I hold her in my arms\nYou know she sets my soul on fire\nOoh, when my baby kisses me\nMy heart becomes filled with desire\nWhen she wraps her lovin' arms around me\nAbout drives me out of my mind\nYeah, when my baby kisses me\nChills run up and down my spine\n\n[Chorus]\nWell, my baby, she's alright\nWell, my baby, she's clean out-of-sight\nDon't you know that she is, she's some kind of wonderful?\nShe's some kind of wonderful, yes, she is\nShe's some kind of wonderful, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Bridge]\nNow is there anybody, got a sweet little woman like mine?\nThere got to be somebody, got a, got a sweet little woman like mine?

'hound broke down and left us all stranded\nIn downtown Birmingham\n[Verse 3: Elvis Presley]\nRight away I bought me a through train ticket\nRiding across Mississippi clean\nI was on that Midnight Flyer out of Birmingham\nSmoking into New Orleans\n\n[Verse 4: Elvis Presley]\nSomebody help me get out of Louisiana\nJust help me get to Houston town\nThere are people there who care a little about me\nAnd they won't let the poor boy down\n\n[Verse 5: Elvis Presley]\nSure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit\nAnd put luggage in my hand\nAnd I woke up high over Albuquerque\nOn a jet to the promised land\n\n[Verse 6: Elvis Presley]\nWorking on a T-bone steak a la carte\nFlying over to the Golden State\nWhen the pilot told us in thirteen minutes\nHe would set us at the terminal

singing and drummers drumming and the archer split\nThe tree\nThere was a fanfare blowing to the sun that was floating on the breeze\nLook at mother nature on the run in the nineteen-seventies\nI was lying in a burned out basement with a full moon in my eyes\nI was hoping for a replacement when the sun burst through the skies\nThere was a band playing in my head and I felt like getting high\nI was thinking about what a friend had said I was hoping it was a lie\nThinking about what a friend had said I was hoping it was a lie\nWell I dreamed i saw the silver spaceships flying in the yellow haze of\nThe sun\nThere were children crying and colors flying all around the chosen one\nAll in a dream, all in a dream the loading had begun\nThey were flying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sun\nFlying mother nature's silver seed to a new home in the sunYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/3406355", "artist_names": "Gerald Haywood",

When Columbus and his sailors came ashore, carrying swords, speaking oddly, the Arawaks ran to greet them, brought them food, water, gifts. He later wrote of this in his log:\n\"They ... brought us parrots and balls of cotton and spears and many other things, which they exchanged for the glass beads and hawks' bells. They willingly traded everything they owned... . They were well-built, with good bodies and handsome features.... They do not bear arms, and do not know them, for I showed them a sword, they took it by the edge and cut themselves out of ignorance. They have no iron. Their spears are made of cane... They would make fine servants.... With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want.\"\n\nThese Arawaks of the Bahama Islands were much like Indians on the mainland, who were remarkable (European observers were to say again and again) for their hospitality, their belief in sharing. These traits did not stand out in the Europe of the Renaissance, dominated as it was by the religion of popes, the government of kings, the frenzy for money that marked Western civilization and its first messenger to the Americas, Christopher Columbus.\n\nColumbus wrote:\n\n\"As soon as I arrived in the Indies, on the first Island which I found, I took some of the natives by force in order that they might learn and might give me information of whatever there is in these parts.\"\nThe information that Columbus wanted most was: Where is the gold? He had persuaded the king and queen of Spain to finance an expedition to the lands, the wealth, he expected would be on the other side of the Atlantic-the Indies and Asia, gold and spices. For, like other informed people of his time, he knew the world was round and he could sail west in order to get to the Far East.\nSpain was recently unified, one of the new modern nation-states, like France, England, and Portugal. Its population, mostly poor peasants, worked for the nobility, who were 2 percent of the population and owned 95 percent of the land. Spain had tied itself to the Catholic Church, expelled all the Jews, driven out the Moors. Like other states of the modern world, Spain sought gold, which was becoming the new mark of wealth, more useful than land because it could buy anything.\n\nThere was gold in Asia, it was thought, and certainly silks and spices, for Marco Polo and others had brought back marvelous things from their overland expeditions centuries before. Now that the Turks had conquered Constantinople and the eastern Mediterranean, and controlled the land routes to Asia, a sea route was needed. Portuguese sailors were working their way around the southern tip of Africa. Spain decided to gamble on a long sail across an unknown ocean.\n\nIn return for bringing back gold and spices, they promised Columbus 10 percent of the profits, governorship over new-found lands, and the fame that would go with a new title: Admiral of the Ocean Sea. He was a merchant's clerk from the Italian city of Genoa, part-time weaver (the son of a skilled weaver), and expert sailor. He set out with three sailing ships, the largest of which was the Santa Maria, perhaps 100 feet long, and thirty-nine crew members.\n\nColumbus would never have made it to Asia, which was thousands of miles farther away than he had calculated, imagining a smaller world. He would have been doomed by that great expanse of sea. But he was lucky. One-fourth of the way there he came upon an unknown, uncharted land that lay between Europe and Asia-the Americas. It was early October 1492, and thirty-three days since he and his crew had left the Canary Islands, off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Now they saw branches and sticks floating in the water. They saw flocks of birds.\n\nThese were signs of land. Then, on October 12, a sailor called Rodrigo saw the early morning moon shining on white sands, and cried out. It was an island in the Bahamas, the Caribbean sea. The first man to sight land was supposed to get a yearly pension of 10,000 maravedis for life, but Rodrigo never got it. Columbus claimed he had seen a light the evening before. He got the reward.\n\nSo, approaching land, they were met by the Arawak Indians, who swam out to greet them. The Arawaks lived in village communes, had a developed agriculture of corn, yams, cassava. They could spin and weave, but they had no horses or work animals. They had no iron, but they wore tiny gold ornaments in their ears.\n\nThis was to have enormous consequences: it led Columbus to take some of them aboard ship as prisoners because he insisted that they guide him to the source of the gold. He then sailed to what is now Cuba, then to Hispaniola (the island which today consists of Haiti and the Dominican Republic). There, bits of visible gold in the rivers, and a gold mask presented to Columbus by a local Indian chief, led to wild visions of gold fields.\n\nOn Hispaniola, out of timbers from the Santa Maria, which had run aground, Columbus built a fort, the first European military base in the Western Hemisphere. He called it Navidad (Christmas) and left thirty-nine crewmembers there, with instructions to find and store the gold. He took more Indian prisoners and put them aboard his two remaining ships. At one part of the island he got into a fight with Indians who refused to trade as many bows and arrows as he and his men wanted. Two were run through with swords and bled to death. Then the Nina and the Pinta set sail for the Azores and Spain. When the weather turned cold, the Indian prisoners began to die.\n\nColumbus's report to the Court in Madrid was extravagant. He insisted he had reached Asia (it was Cuba) and an island off the coast of China (Hispaniola). His descriptions were part fact, part fiction:\n\nHispaniola is a miracle. Mountains and hills, plains and pastures, are both fertile and beautiful ... the harbors are unbelievably good and there are many wide rivers of which the majority contain gold. . . . There are many spices, and great mines of gold and other metals....\n\nThe Indians, Columbus reported, \"are so naive and so free with their possessions that no one who has not witnessed them would believe it. When you ask for something they have, they never say no. To the contrary, they offer to share with anyone....\" He concluded his report by asking for a little help from their Majesties, and in return he would bring them from his next voyage \"as much gold as they need ... and as many slaves as they ask.\" He was full of religious talk: \"Thus the eternal God, our Lord, gives victory to those who follow His way over apparent impossibilities.\"\n\nBecause of Columbus's exaggerated report and promises, his second expedition was given seventeen ships and more than twelve hundred men. The aim was clear: slaves and gold. They went from island to island in the Caribbean, taking Indians as captives. But as word spread of the Europeans' intent they found more and more empty villages. On Haiti, they found that the sailors left behind at Fort Navidad had been killed in a battle with the Indians, after they had roamed the island in gangs looking for gold, taking women and children as slaves for sex and labor.\n\nNow, from his base on Haiti, Columbus sent expedition after expedition into the interior. They found no gold fields, but had to fill up the ships returning to Spain with some kind of dividend. In the year 1495, they went on a great slave raid, rounded up fifteen hundred Arawak men, women, and children, put them in pens guarded by Spaniards and dogs, then picked the five hundred best specimens to load onto ships. Of those five hundred, two hundred died en route. The rest arrived alive in Spain and were put up for sale by the archdeacon of the town, who reported that, although the slaves were \"naked as the day they were born,\" they showed \"no more embarrassment than animals.\" Columbus later wrote: \"Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity go on sending all the slaves that can be sold.\"\nBut too many of the slaves died in captivity. And so Columbus, desperate to pay back dividends to those who had invested, had to make good his promise to fill the ships with gold. In the province of Cicao on Haiti, where he and his men imagined huge gold fields to exist, they ordered all persons fourteen years or older to collect a certain quantity of gold every three months. When they brought it, they were given copper tokens to hang around their necks. Indians found without a copper token had their hands cut off and bled to death.\n\nThe Indians had been given an impossible task. The only gold around was bits of dust garnered from the streams. So they fled, were hunted down with dogs, and were killed.\n\nTrying to put together an army of resistance, the Arawaks faced Spaniards who had armor, muskets, swords, horses. When the Spaniards took prisoners they hanged them or burned them to death. Among the Arawaks, mass suicides began, with cassava poison. Infants were killed to save them from the Spaniards. In two years, through murder, mutilation, or suicide, half of the 250,000 Indians on Haiti were dead.\n\nWhen it became clear that there was no gold left, the Indians were taken as slave labor on huge estates, known later as encomiendas. They were worked at a ferocious pace, and died by the thousands. By the year 1515, there were perhaps fifty thousand Indians left. By 1550, there were five hundred. A report of the year 1650 shows none of the original Arawaks or their descendants left on the island.\n\nThe chief source-and, on many matters the only source-of information about what happened on the islands after Columbus came is Bartolome de las Casas, who, as a young priest, participated in the conquest of Cuba. For a time he owned a plantation on which Indian slaves worked, but he gave that up and became a vehement critic of Spanish cruelty. Las Casas transcribed Columbus's journal and, in his fifties, began a multivolume History of the Indies. In it, he describes the Indians. They are agile, he says, and can swim long distances, especially the women. They are not completely peaceful, because they do battle from time to time with other tribes, but their casualties seem small, and they fight when they are individually moved to do so because of some grievance, not on the orders of captains or kings.\n\nWomen in Indian society were treated so well as to startle the Spaniards. Las Casas describes sex relations:\n\nMarriage laws are non-existent men and women alike choose their mates and leave them as they please, without offense, jealousy or anger. They multiply in great abundance; pregnant women work to the last minute and give birth almost painlessly; up the next day, they bathe in the river and are as clean and healthy as before giving birth. If they tire of their men, they give themselves abortions with herbs that force stillbirths, covering their shameful parts with leaves or cotton cloth; although on the whole, Indian men and women look upon total nakedness with as much casualness as we look upon a man's head or at his hands.\n\nThe Indians, Las Casas says, have no religion, at least no temples. They live in\n\nlarge communal bell-shaped buildings, housing up to 600 people at one time ... made of very strong wood and roofed with palm leaves.... They prize bird feathers of various colors, beads made of fishbones, and green and white stones with which they adorn their ears and lips, but they put no value on gold and other precious things. They lack all manner of commerce, neither buying nor selling, and rely exclusively on their natural environment for maintenance. They are extremely generous with their possessions and by the same token covet the possessions of their friends and expect the same degree of liberality. ...\n\nIn Book Two of his History of the Indies, Las Casas (who at first urged replacing Indians by black slaves, thinking they were stronger and would survive, but later relented when he saw the effects on blacks) tells about the treatment of the Indians by the Spaniards. It is a unique account and deserves to be quoted at length:\n\nEndless testimonies . .. prove the mild and pacific temperament of the natives.... But our work was to exasperate, ravage, kill, mangle and destroy; small wonder, then, if they tried to kill one of us now and then.... The admiral, it is true, was blind as those who came after him, and he was so anxious to please the King that he committed irreparable crimes against the Indians....\n\nLas Casas tells how the Spaniards \"grew more conceited every day\" and after a while refused to walk any distance. They \"rode the backs of Indians if they were in a hurry\" or were carried on hammocks by Indians running in relays. \"In this case they also had Indians carry large leaves to shade them from the sun and others to fan them with goose wings.\"\n\nTotal control led to total cruelty. The Spaniards \"thought nothing of knifing Indians by tens and twenties and of cutting slices off them to test the sharpness of their blades.\" Las Casas tells how \"two of these so-called Christians met two Indian boys one day, each carrying a parrot; they took the parrots and for fun beheaded the boys.\"\nThe Indians' attempts to defend themselves failed. And when they ran off into the hills they were found and killed. So, Las Casas reports, \"they suffered and died in the mines and other labors in desperate silence, knowing not a soul in the world to whom they could turn for help.\" He describes their work in the mines:\n\n... mountains are stripped from top to bottom and bottom to top a thousand times; they dig, split rocks, move stones, and carry dirt on their backs to wash it in the rivers, while those who wash gold stay in the water all the time with their backs bent so constantly it breaks them; and when water invades the mines, the most arduous task of all is to dry the mines by scooping up pansful of water and throwing it up outside....\n\nAfter each six or eight months' work in the mines, which was the time required of each crew to dig enough gold for melting, up to a third of the men died.\n\nWhile the men were sent many miles away to the mines, the wives remained to work the soil, forced into the excruciating job of digging and making thousands of hills for cassava plants.\n\nThus husbands and wives were together only once every eight or ten months and when they met they were so exhausted and depressed on both sides ... they ceased to procreate. As for the newly born, they died early because their mothers, overworked and famished, had no milk to nurse them, and for this reason, while I was in Cuba, 7000 children died in three months. Some mothers even drowned their babies from sheer desperation.... in this way, husbands died in the mines, wives died at work, and children died from lack of milk . .. and in a short time this land which was so great, so powerful and fertile ... was depopulated. ... My eyes have seen these acts so foreign to human nature, and now I tremble as I write. ...\n\nWhen he arrived on Hispaniola in 1508, Las Casas says, \"there were 60,000 people living on this island, including the Indians; so that from 1494 to 1508, over three million people had perished from war, slavery, and the mines. Who in future generations will believe this? I myself writing it as a knowledgeable eyewitness can hardly believe it....\"\n\nThus began the history, five hundred years ago, of the European invasion of the Indian settlements in the Americas. That beginning, when you read Las Casas-even if his figures are exaggerations (were there 3 million Indians to begin with, as he says, or less than a million, as some historians have calculated, or 8 million as others now believe?)-is conquest, slavery, death. When we read the history books given to children in the United States, it all starts with heroic adventure-there is no bloodshed-and Columbus Day is a celebration.\n\nPast the elementary and high schools, there are only occasional hints of something else. Samuel Eliot Morison, the Harvard historian, was the most distinguished writer on Columbus, the author of a multivolume biography, and was himself a sailor who retraced Columbus's route across the Atlantic. In his popular book Christopher Columbus, Mariner, written in 1954, he tells about the enslavement and the killing: \"The cruel policy initiated by Columbus and pursued by his successors resulted in complete genocide.\"\n\nThat is on one page, buried halfway into the telling of a grand romance. In the book's last paragraph, Morison sums up his view of Columbus:\n\nHe had his faults and his defects, but they were largely the defects of the qualities that made him great-his indomitable will, his superb faith in God and in his own mission as the Christ-bearer to lands beyond the seas, his stubborn persistence despite neglect, poverty and discouragement. But there was no flaw, no dark side to the most outstanding and essential of all his qualities-his seamanship.\n\nOne can lie outright about the past. Or one can omit facts which might lead to unacceptable conclusions. Morison does neither. He refuses to lie about Columbus. He does not omit the story of mass murder; indeed he describes it with the harshest word one can use: genocide.\n\nBut he does something else-he mentions the truth quickly and goes on to other things more important to him. Outright lying or quiet omission takes the risk of discovery which, when made, might arouse the reader to rebel against the writer. To state the facts, however, and then to bury them in a mass of other information is to say to the reader with a certain infectious calm: yes, mass murder took place, but it's not that important-it should weigh very little in our final judgments; it should affect very little what we do in the world.\n\nIt is not that the historian can avoid emphasis of some facts and not of others. This is as natural to him as to the mapmaker, who, in order to produce a usable drawing for practical purposes, must first flatten and distort the shape of the earth, then choose out of the bewildering mass of geographic information those things needed for the purpose of this or that particular map.\n\nMy argument cannot be against selection, simplification, emphasis, which are inevitable for both cartographers and historians. But the map-maker's distortion is a technical necessity for a common purpose shared by all people who need maps. The historian's distortion is more than technical, it is ideological; it is released into a world of contending interests, where any chosen emphasis supports (whether the historian means to or not) some kind of interest, whether economic or political or racial or national or sexual.\n\nFurthermore, this ideological interest is not openly expressed in the way a mapmaker's technical interest is obvious (\"This is a Mercator projection for long-range navigation-for short-range, you'd better use a different projection\"). No, it is presented as if all readers of history had a common interest which historians serve to the best of their ability. This is not intentional deception; the historian has been trained in a society in which education and knowledge are put forward as technical problems of excellence and not as tools for contending social classes, races, nations.\n\nTo emphasize the heroism of Columbus and his successors as navigators and discoverers, and to de-emphasize their genocide, is not a technical necessity but an ideological choice. It serves- unwittingly-to justify what was done. My point is not that we must, in telling history, accuse, judge, condemn Columbus in absentia. It is too late for that; it would be a useless scholarly exercise in morality. But the easy acceptance of atrocities as a deplorable but necessary price to pay for progress (Hiroshima and Vietnam, to save Western civilization; Kronstadt and Hungary, to save socialism; nuclear proliferation, to save us all)-that is still with us. One reason these atrocities are still with us is that we have learned to bury them in a mass of other facts, as radioactive wastes are buried in containers in the earth. We have learned to give them exactly the same proportion of attention that teachers and writers often give them in the most respectable of classrooms and textbooks. This learned sense of moral proportion, coming from the apparent objectivity of the scholar, is accepted more easily than when it comes from politicians at press conferences. It is therefore more deadly.\n\nThe treatment of heroes (Columbus) and their victims (the Arawaks)-the quiet acceptance of conquest and murder in the name of progress-is only one aspect of a certain approach to history, in which the past is told from the point of view of governments, conquerors, diplomats, leaders. It is as if they, like Columbus, deserve universal acceptance, as if they-the Founding Fathers, Jackson, Lincoln, Wilson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, the leading members of Congress, the famous Justices of the Supreme Court-represent the nation as a whole. The pretense is that there really is such a thing as \"the United States,\" subject to occasional conflicts and quarrels, but fundamentally a community of people with common interests. It is as if there really is a \"national interest\" represented in the Constitution, in territorial expansion, in the laws passed by Congress, the decisions of the courts, the development of capitalism, the culture of education and the mass media.\n\n\"History is the memory of states,\" wrote Henry Kissinger in his first book, A World Restored, in which he proceeded to tell the history of nineteenth-century Europe from the viewpoint of the leaders of Austria and England, ignoring the millions who suffered from those statesmen's policies. From his standpoint, the \"peace\" that Europe had before the French Revolution was \"restored\" by the diplomacy of a few national leaders. But for factory workers in England, farmers in France, colored people in Asia and Africa, women and children everywhere except in the upper classes, it was a world of conquest, violence, hunger, exploitation-a world not restored but disintegrated.\n\nMy viewpoint, in telling the history of the United States, is different: that we must not accept the memory of states as our own. Nations are not communities and never have been, The history of any country, presented as the history of a family, conceals fierce conflicts of interest (sometimes exploding, most often repressed) between conquerors and conquered, masters and slaves, capitalists and workers, dominators and dominated in race and sex. And in such a world of conflict, a world of victims and executioners, it is the job of thinking people, as Albert Camus suggested, not to be on the side of the executioners.\n\nThus, in that inevitable taking of sides which comes from selection and emphasis in history, I prefer to try to tell the story of the discovery of America from the viewpoint of the Arawaks, of the Constitution from the standpoint of the slaves, of Andrew Jackson as seen by the Cherokees, of the Civil War as seen by the New York Irish, of the Mexican war as seen by the deserting soldiers of Scott's army, of the rise of industrialism as seen by the young women in the Lowell textile mills, of the Spanish-American war as seen by the Cubans, the conquest of the Philippines as seen by black soldiers on Luzon, the Gilded Age as seen by southern farmers, the First World War as seen by socialists, the Second World War as seen by pacifists, the New Deal as seen by blacks in Harlem, the postwar American empire as seen by peons in Latin America. And so on, to the limited extent that any one person, however he or she strains, can \"see\" history from the standpoint of others.\n\nMy point is not to grieve for the victims and denounce the executioners. Those tears, that anger, cast into the past, deplete our moral energy for the present. And the lines are not always clear. In the long run, the oppressor is also a victim. In the short run (and so far, human history has consisted only of short runs), the victims, themselves desperate and tainted with the culture that oppresses them, turn on other victims.\n\nStill, understanding the complexities, this book will be skeptical of governments and their attempts, through politics and culture, to ensnare ordinary people in a giant web of nationhood pretending to a common interest. I will try not to overlook the cruelties that victims inflict on one another as they are jammed together in the boxcars of the system. I don't want to romanticize them. But I do remember (in rough paraphrase) a statement I once read: \"The cry of the poor is not always just, but if you don't listen to it, you will never know what justice is.\"\n\nI don't want to invent victories for people's movements. But to think that history-writing must aim simply to recapitulate the failures that dominate the past is to make historians collaborators in an endless cycle of defeat. If history is to be creative, to anticipate a possible future without denying the past, it should, I believe, emphasize new possibilities by disclosing those hidden episodes of the past when, even if in brief flashes, people showed their ability to resist, to join together, occasionally to win. I am supposing, or perhaps only hoping, that our future may be found in the past's fugitive moments of compassion rather than in its solid centuries of warfare.\n\nThat, being as blunt as I can, is my approach to the history of the United States. The reader may as well know that before going on.\n\nWhat Columbus did to the Arawaks of the Bahamas, Cortes did to the Aztecs of Mexico, Pizarro to the Incas of Peru, and the English settlers of Virginia and Massachusetts to the Powhatans and the Pequots.\n\nThe Aztec civilization of Mexico came out of the heritage of Mayan, Zapotec, and Toltec cultures. It built enormous constructions from stone tools and human labor, developed a writing system and a priesthood. It also engaged in (let us not overlook this) the ritual killing of thousands of people as sacrifices to the gods. The cruelty of the Aztecs, however, did not erase a certain innocence, and when a Spanish armada appeared at Vera Cruz, and a bearded white man came ashore, with strange beasts (horses), clad in iron, it was thought that he was the legendary Aztec man-god who had died three hundred years before, with the promise to return-the mysterious Quetzalcoatl. And so they welcomed him, with munificent hospitality.\n\nThat was Hernando Cortes, come from Spain with an expedition financed by merchants and landowners and blessed by the deputies of God, with one obsessive goal: to find gold. In the mind of Montezuma, the king of the Aztecs, there must have been a certain doubt about whether Cortes was indeed Quetzalcoatl, because he sent a hundred runners to Cortes, bearing enormous treasures, gold and silver wrought into objects of fantastic beauty, but at the same time begging him to go back. (The painter Durer a few years later described what he saw just arrived in Spain from that expedition-a sun of gold, a moon of silver, worth a fortune.)\n\nCortes then began his march of death from town to town, using deception, turning Aztec against Aztec, killing with the kind of deliberateness that accompanies a strategy-to paralyze the will of the population by a sudden frightful deed. And so, in Cholulu, he invited the headmen of the Cholula nation to the square. And when they came, with thousands of unarmed retainers, Cortes's small army of Spaniards, posted around the square with cannon, armed with crossbows, mounted on horses, massacred them, down to the last man. Then they looted the city and moved on. When their cavalcade of murder was over they were in Mexico City, Montezuma was dead, and the Aztec civilization, shattered, was in the hands of the Spaniards.\n\nAll this is told in the Spaniards' own accounts.\n\nIn Peru, that other Spanish conquistador Pizarro, used the same tactics, and for the same reasons- the frenzy in the early capitalist states of Europe for gold, for slaves, for products of the soil, to pay the bondholders and stockholders of the expeditions, to finance the monarchical bureaucracies rising in Western Europe, to spur the growth of the new money economy rising out of feudalism, to participate in what Karl Marx would later call \"the primitive accumulation of capital.\" These were the violent beginnings of an intricate system of technology, business, politics, and culture that would dominate the world for the next five centuries.\n\nIn the North American English colonies, the pattern was set early, as Columbus had set it in the islands of the Bahamas. In 1585, before there was any permanent English settlement in Virginia, Richard Grenville landed there with seven ships. The Indians he met were hospitable, but when one of them stole a small silver cup, Grenville sacked and burned the whole Indian village.\n\nJamestown itself was set up inside the territory of an Indian confederacy, led by the chief, Powhatan. Powhatan watched the English settle on his people's land, but did not attack, maintaining a posture of coolness. When the English were going through their \"starving time\" in the winter of 1610, some of them ran off to join the Indians, where they would at least be fed. When the summer came, the governor of the colony sent a messenger to ask Powhatan to return the runaways, whereupon Powhatan, according to the English account, replied with \"noe other than prowde and disdaynefull Answers.\" Some soldiers were therefore sent out \"to take Revenge.\" They fell upon an Indian settlement, killed fifteen or sixteen Indians, burned the houses, cut down the corn growing around the village, took the queen of the tribe and her children into boats, then ended up throwing the children overboard \"and shoteinge owit their Braynes in the water.\" The queen was later taken off and stabbed to death.\n\nTwelve years later, the Indians, alarmed as the English settlements kept growing in numbers, apparently decided to try to wipe them out for good. They went on a rampage and massacred 347 men, women, and children. From then on it was total war.\n\nNot able to enslave the Indians, and not able to live with them, the English decided to exterminate them. Edmund Morgan writes, in his history of early Virginia, American Slavery, American Freedom:\n\nSince the Indians were better woodsmen than the English and virtually impossible to track down, the method was to feign peaceful intentions, let them settle down and plant their com wherever they chose, and then, just before harvest, fall upon them, killing as many as possible and burning the corn... . Within two or three years of the massacre the English had avenged the deaths of that day many times over.\n\nIn that first year of the white man in Virginia, 1607, Powhatan had addressed a plea to John Smith that turned out prophetic. How authentic it is may be in doubt, but it is so much like so many Indian statements that it may be taken as, if not the rough letter of that first plea, the exact spirit of it:\n\nI have seen two generations of my people die.... I know the difference between peace and war better than any man in my country. I am now grown old, and must die soon; my authority must descend to my brothers, Opitehapan, Opechancanough and Catatough-then to my two sisters, and then to my two daughters-I wish them to know as much as I do, and that your love to them may be like mine to you. Why will you take by force what you may have quietly by love? Why will you destroy us who supply you with food? What can you get by war? We can hide our provisions and run into the woods; then you will starve for wronging your friends. Why are you jealous of us? We are unarmed, and willing to give you what you ask, if you come in a friendly manner, and not so simple as not to know that it is much better to eat good meat, sleep comfortably, live quietly with my wives and children, laugh and be merry with the English, and trade for their copper and hatchets, than to run away from them, and to lie cold in the woods, feed on acorns, roots and such trash, and be so hunted that I can neither eat nor sleep. In these wars, my men must sit up watching, and if a twig break, they all cry out \"Here comes Captain Smith!\" So I must end my miserable life. Take away your guns and swords, the cause of all our jealousy, or you may all die in the same manner.\n\nWhen the Pilgrims came to New England they too were coming not to vacant land but to territory inhabited by tribes of Indians. The governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, John Winthrop, created the excuse to take Indian land by declaring the area legally a \"vacuum.\" The Indians, he said, had not \"subdued\" the land, and therefore had only a \"natural\" right to it, but not a \"civil right.\" A \"natural right\" did not have legal standing.\n\nThe Puritans also appealed to the Bible, Psalms 2:8: \"Ask of me, and I shall give thee, the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\" And to justify their use of force to take the land, they cited Romans 13:2: \"Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.\"\n\nThe Puritans lived in uneasy truce with the Pequot Indians, who occupied what is now southern Connecticut and Rhode Island. But they wanted them out of the way; they wanted their land. And they seemed to want also to establish their rule firmly over Connecticut settlers in that area. The murder of a white trader, Indian-kidnaper, and troublemaker became an excuse to make war on the Pequots in 1636.\n\nA punitive expedition left Boston to attack the Narraganset Indians on Block Island, who were lumped with the Pequots. As Governor Winthrop wrote:\n\nThey had commission to put to death the men of Block Island, but to spare the women and children, and to bring them away, and to take possession of the island; and from thence to go to the Pequods to demand the murderers of Captain Stone and other English, and one thousand fathom of wampum for damages, etc. and some of their children as hostages, which if they should refuse, they were to obtain it by force.\n\nThe English landed and killed some Indians, but the rest hid in the thick forests of the island and the English went from one deserted village to the next, destroying crops. Then they sailed back to the mainland and raided Pequot villages along the coast, destroying crops again. One of the officers of that expedition, in his account, gives some insight into the Pequots they encountered: \"The Indians spying of us came running in multitudes along the water side, crying, What cheer, Englishmen, what cheer, what do you come for? They not thinking we intended war, went on cheerfully... -\"\n\nSo, the war with the Pequots began. Massacres took place on both sides. The English developed a tactic of warfare used earlier by Cortes and later, in the twentieth century, even more systematically: deliberate attacks on noncombatants for the purpose of terrorizing the enemy. This is ethno historian Francis Jennings's interpretation of Captain John Mason's attack on a Pequot village on the Mystic River near Long Island Sound: \"Mason proposed to avoid attacking Pequot warriors, which would have overtaxed his unseasoned, unreliable troops. Battle, as such, was not his purpose. Battle is only one of the ways to destroy an enemy's will to fight. Massacre can accomplish the same end with less risk, and Mason had determined that massacre would be his objective.\"\n\nSo the English set fire to the wigwams of the village. By their own account: \"The Captain also said, We must Burn Them; and immediately stepping into the Wigwam ... brought out a Fire Brand, and putting it into the Matts with which they were covered, set the Wigwams on Fire.\" William Bradford, in his History of the Plymouth Plantation written at the time, describes John Mason's raid on the Pequot village:\n\nThose that scaped the fire were slaine with the sword; some hewed to peeces, others rune throw with their rapiers, so as they were quickly dispatchte, and very few escaped. It was conceived they thus destroyed about 400 at this time. It was a fearful sight to see them thus frying in the fyer, and the streams of blood quenching the same, and horrible was the stincke and sente there of, but the victory seemed a sweete sacrifice, and they gave the prayers thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to inclose their enemise in their hands, and give them so speedy a victory over so proud and insulting an enimie.\n\nAs Dr. Cotton Mather, Puritan theologian, put it: \"It was supposed that no less than 600 Pequot souls were brought down to hell that day.\"\n\nThe war continued. Indian tribes were used against one another, and never seemed able to join together in fighting the English. Jennings sums up:\n\nThe terror was very real among the Indians, but in time they came to meditate upon its foundations. They drew three lessons from the Pequot War: (1) that the Englishmen's most solemn pledge would be broken whenever obligation conflicted with advantage; (2) that the English way of war had no limit of scruple or mercy; and (3) that weapons of Indian making were almost useless against weapons of European manufacture. These lessons the Indians took to heart.\n\nA footnote in Virgil Vogel's book This Land Was Ours (1972) says: \"The official figure on the number of Pequots now in Connecticut is twenty-one persons.\"\n\nForty years after the Pequot War, Puritans and Indians fought again. This time it was the Wampanoags, occupying the south shore of Massachusetts Bay, who were in the way and also beginning to trade some of their land to people outside the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Their chief, Massasoit, was dead. His son Wamsutta had been killed by Englishmen, and Wamsuttas brother Metacom (later to be called King Philip by the English) became chief. The English found their excuse, a murder which they attributed to Metacom, and they began a war of conquest against the Wampanoags, a war to take their land. They were clearly the aggressors, but claimed they attacked for preventive purposes. As Roger Williams, more friendly to the Indians than most, put it: \"All men of conscience or prudence ply to windward, to maintain their wars to be defensive.\"\n\nJennings says the elite of the Puritans wanted the war; the ordinary white Englishman did not want it and often refused to fight. The Indians certainly did not want war, but they matched atrocity with atrocity. When it was over, in 1676, the English had won, but their resources were drained; they had lost six hundred men. Three thousand Indians were dead, including Metacom himself. Yet the Indian raids did not stop.\n\nFor a while, the English tried softer tactics. But ultimately, it was back to annihilation. The Indian population of 10 million that lived north of Mexico when Columbus came would ultimately be reduced to less than a million. Huge numbers of Indians would die from diseases introduced by the whites. A Dutch traveler in New Netherland wrote in 1656 that \"the Indians ... affirm, that before the arrival of the Christians, and before the smallpox broke out amongst them, they were ten times as numerous as they now are, and that their population had been melted down by this disease, whereof nine-tenths of them have died.\" When the English first settled Martha's Vineyard in 1642, the Wampanoags there numbered perhaps three thousand. There were no wars on that island, but by 1764, only 313 Indians were left there. Similarly, Block Island Indians numbered perhaps 1,200 to 1,500 in 1662, and by 1774 were reduced to fifty-one.\n\nBehind the English invasion of North America, behind their massacre of Indians, their deception, their brutality, was that special powerful drive born in civilizations based on private property. It was a morally ambiguous drive; the need for space, for land, was a real human need. But in conditions of scarcity, in a barbarous epoch of history ruled by competition, this human need was transformed into the murder of whole peoples. Roger Williams said it was\n\na depraved appetite after the great vanities, dreams and shadows of this vanishing life, great portions of land, land in this wilderness, as if men were in as great necessity and danger for want of great portions of land, as poor, hungry, thirsty seamen have, after a sick and stormy, a long and starving passage. This is one of the gods of New England, which the living and most high Eternal will destroy and famish.\n\nWas all this bloodshed and deceit-from Columbus to Cortes, Pizarro, the Puritans-a necessity for the human race to progress from savagery to civilization? Was Morison right in burying the story of genocide inside a more important story of human progress? Perhaps a persuasive argument can be made-as it was made by Stalin when he killed peasants for industrial progress in the Soviet Union, as it was made by Churchill explaining the bombings of Dresden and Hamburg, and Truman explaining Hiroshima. But how can the judgment be made if the benefits and losses cannot be balanced because the losses are either unmentioned or mentioned quickly?\n\nThat quick disposal might be acceptable (\"Unfortunate, yes, but it had to be done\") to the middle and upper classes of the conquering and \"advanced\" countries. But is it acceptable to the poor of Asia, Africa, Latin America, or to the prisoners in Soviet labor camps, or the blacks in urban ghettos, or the Indians on reservations-to the victims of that progress which benefits a privileged minority in the world? Was it acceptable (or just inescapable?) to the miners and railroaders of America, the factory hands, the men and women who died by the hundreds of thousands from accidents or sickness, where they worked or where they lived-casualties of progress? And even the privileged minority-must it not reconsider, with that practicality which even privilege cannot abolish, the value of its privileges, when they become threatened by the anger of the sacrificed, whether in organized rebellion, unorganized riot, or simply those brutal individual acts of desperation labeled crimes by law and the state?\n\nIf there are necessary sacrifices to be made for human progress, is it not essential to hold to the principle that those to be sacrificed must make the decision themselves? We can all decide to give up something of ours, but do we have the right to throw into the pyre the children of others, or even our own children, for a progress which is not nearly as clear or present as sickness or health, life or death?\n\nWhat did people in Spain get out of all that death and brutality visited on the Indians of the Americas? For a brief period in history, there was the glory of a Spanish Empire in the Western Hemisphere. As Hans Koning sums it up in his book Columbus: His Enterprise:\n\nFor all the gold and silver stolen and shipped to Spain did not make the Spanish people richer. It gave their kings an edge in the balance of power for a time, a chance to hire more mercenary soldiers for their wars. They ended up losing those wars anyway, and all that was left was a deadly inflation, a starving population, the rich richer, the poor poorer, and a ruined peasant class.\n\nBeyond all that, how certain are we that what was destroyed was inferior? Who were these people who came out on the beach and swam to bring presents to Columbus and his crew, who watched Cortes and Pizarro ride through their countryside, who peered out of the forests at the first white settlers of Virginia and Massachusetts?\n\nColumbus called them Indians, because he miscalculated the size of the earth. In this book we too call them Indians, with some reluctance, because it happens too often that people are saddled with names given them by their conquerors.\n\nAnd yet, there is some reason to call them Indians, because they did come, perhaps 25,000 years ago, from Asia, across the land bridge of the Bering Straits (later to disappear under water) to Alaska. Then they moved southward, seeking warmth and land, in a trek lasting thousands of years that took them into North America, then Central and South America. In Nicaragua, Brazil, and Ecuador their petrified footprints can still be seen, along with the print of bison, who disappeared about five thousand years ago, so they must have reached South America at least that far back\n\nWidely dispersed over the great land mass of the Americas, they numbered approximately 75 million people by the time Columbus came, perhaps 25 million in North America. Responding to the different environments of soil and climate, they developed hundreds of different tribal cultures, perhaps two thousand different languages. They perfected the art of agriculture, and figured out how to grow maize (corn), which cannot grow by itself and must be planted, cultivated, fertilized, harvested, husked, shelled. They ingeniously developed a variety of other vegetables and fruits, as well as peanuts and chocolate and tobacco and rubber.\n\nOn their own, the Indians were engaged in the great agricultural revolution that other peoples in Asia, Europe, Africa were going through about the same time.\n\nWhile many of the tribes remained nomadic hunters and food gatherers in wandering, egalitarian communes, others began to live in more settled communities where there was more food, larger populations, more divisions of labor among men and women, more surplus to feed chiefs and priests, more leisure time for artistic and social work, for building houses. About a thousand years before Christ, while comparable constructions were going on in Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Zuni and Hopi Indians of what is now New Mexico had begun to build villages consisting of large terraced buildings, nestled in among cliffs and mountains for protection from enemies, with hundreds of rooms in each village. Before the arrival of the European explorers, they were using irrigation canals, dams, were doing ceramics, weaving baskets, making cloth out of cotton.\n\nBy the time of Christ and Julius Caesar, there had developed in the Ohio River Valley a culture of so-called Moundbuilders, Indians who constructed thousands of enormous sculptures out of earth, sometimes in the shapes of huge humans, birds, or serpents, sometimes as burial sites, sometimes as fortifications. One of them was 3 1/2 miles long, enclosing 100 acres. These Moundbuilders seem to have been part of a complex trading system of ornaments and weapons from as far off as the Great Lakes, the Far West, and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAbout A.D. 500, as this Moundbuilder culture of the Ohio Valley was beginning to decline, another culture was developing westward, in the valley of the Mississippi, centered on what is now St. Louis. It had an advanced agriculture, included thousands of villages, and also built huge earthen mounds as burial and ceremonial places near a vast Indian metropolis that may have had thirty thousand people. The largest mound was 100 feet high, with a rectangular base larger than that of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. In the city, known as Cahokia, were toolmakers, hide dressers, potters, jewelry makers, weavers, salt makers, copper engravers, and magnificent ceramists. One funeral blanket was made of twelve thousand shell beads.\n\nFrom the Adirondacks to the Great Lakes, in what is now Pennsylvania and upper New York, lived the most powerful of the northeastern tribes, the League of the Iroquois, which included the Mohawks (People of the Flint), Oneidas (People of the Stone), Onondagas (People of the Mountain), Cayugas (People at the Landing), and Senecas (Great Hill People), thousands of people bound together by a common Iroquois language.\n\nIn the vision of the Mohawk chief Iliawatha, the legendary Dekaniwidah spoke to the Iroquois: \"We bind ourselves together by taking hold of each other's hands so firmly and forming a circle so strong that if a tree should fall upon it, it could not shake nor break it, so that our people and grandchildren shall remain in the circle in security, peace and happiness.\"\n\nIn the villages of the Iroquois, land was owned in common and worked in common. Hunting was done together, and the catch was divided among the members of the village. Houses were considered common property and were shared by several families. The concept of private ownership of land and homes was foreign to the Iroquois. A French Jesuit priest who encountered them in the 1650s wrote: \"No poorhouses are needed among them, because they are neither mendicants nor paupers.. . . Their kindness, humanity and courtesy not only makes them liberal with what they have, but causes them to possess hardly anything except in common.\"\n\nWomen were important and respected in Iroquois society. Families were matrilineal. That is, the family line went down through the female members, whose husbands joined the family, while sons who married then joined their wives' families. Each extended family lived in a \"long house.\" When a woman wanted a divorce, she set her husband's things outside the door.\n\nFamilies were grouped in clans, and a dozen or more clans might make up a village. The senior women in the village named the men who represented the clans at village and tribal councils. They also named the forty-nine chiefs who were the ruling council for the Five Nation confederacy of the Iroquois. The women attended clan meetings, stood behind the circle of men who spoke and voted, and removed the men from office if they strayed too far from the wishes of the women.\n\nThe women tended the crops and took general charge of village affairs while the men were always hunting or fishing. And since they supplied the moccasins and food for warring expeditions, they had some control over military matters. As Gary B. Nash notes in his fascinating study of early America, Red, White, and Black: \"Thus power was shared between the sexes and the European idea of male dominancy and female subordination in all things was conspicuously absent in Iroquois society.\"\n\nChildren in Iroquois society, while taught the cultural heritage of their people and solidarity with the tribe, were also taught to be independent, not to submit to overbearing authority. They were taught equality in status and the sharing of possessions. The Iroquois did not use harsh punishment on children; they did not insist on early weaning or early toilet training, but gradually allowed the child to learn self-care.\n\nAll of this was in sharp contrast to European values as brought over by the first colonists, a society of rich and poor, controlled by priests, by governors, by male heads of families. For example, the pastor of the Pilgrim colony, John Robinson, thus advised his parishioners how to deal with their children: \"And surely there is in all children ... a stubbornness, and stoutness of mind arising from natural pride, which must, in the first place, be broken and beaten down; that so the foundation of their education being laid in humility and tractableness, other virtues may, in their time, be built thereon.\"\n\nGary Nash describes Iroquois culture:\n\nNo laws and ordinances, sheriffs and constables, judges and juries, or courts or jails-the apparatus of authority in European societies-were to be found in the northeast woodlands prior to European arrival. Yet boundaries of acceptable behavior were firmly set. Though priding themselves on the autonomous individual, the Iroquois maintained a strict sense of right and wrong.... He who stole another's food or acted invalourously in war was \"shamed\" by his people and ostracized from their company until he had atoned for his actions and demonstrated to their satisfaction that he had morally purified himself.\n\nNot only the Iroquois but other Indian tribes behaved the same way. In 1635, Maryland Indians responded to the governor's demand that if any of them killed an Englishman, the guilty one should be delivered up for punishment according to English law. The Indians said:\n\nIt is the manner amongst us Indians, that if any such accident happen, wee doe redeeme the life of a man that is so slaine, with a 100 armes length of Beades and since that you are heere strangers, and come into our Countrey, you should rather conform yourselves to the Customes of our Countrey, than impose yours upon us....\n\nSo, Columbus and his successors were not coming into an empty wilderness, but into a world which in some places was as densely populated as Europe itself, where the culture was complex, where human relations were more egalitarian than in Europe, and where the relations among men, women, children, and nature were more beautifully worked out than perhaps any place in the world.\n\nThey were people without a written language, but with their own laws, their poetry, their history kept in memory and passed on, in an oral vocabulary more complex than Europe's, accompanied by song, dance, and ceremonial drama. They paid careful attention to the development of personality, intensity of will, independence and flexibility, passion and potency, to their partnership with one another and with nature.\n\nJohn Collier, an American scholar who lived among Indians in the 1920s and 1930s in the American Southwest, said of their spirit: \"Could we make it our own, there would be an eternally inexhaustible earth and a forever lasting peace.\"\n\nPerhaps there is some romantic mythology in that. But the evidence from European travelers in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, put together recently by an American specialist on Indian life, William Brandon, is overwhelmingly supportive of much of that \"myth.\" Even allowing for the imperfection of myths, it is enough to make us question, for that time and ours, the excuse of progress in the annihilation of races, and the telling of history from the standpoint of the conquerors and leaders of Western civilization.10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1708328", "artist_names": "Three

Won't you understand\nWhy don't 'cha tell someone to meet me\nI'm coming home\nTell someone to meet me, why don't 'cha\nCame to this old town seeking fortune and some fame\nI never got the chance to prove myself\nThough I tried to play their game\nUsing people just ain't my thing\nAnd I won't dangle from any string\nTo please some fool that don't care about\nThey turned me inside out\n\nI'm going home\nThat's a fact, you know.  (Going home.)\nI know what I'm gonna do\nI'll tell someone to meet me\nGoing home, yes I am\nWill ya meet me?\n(Tell someone to meet me.) When you're down and out, hey, hey\n\nI gotta admit it\nI'm not really ashamed of half the things I said\nAnd I don't want nobody trying to show me pity\n'Cause I've had more than I can stand\nAnd better woman, I'll be a better man\nI'll ty to rearrange my life\nMight even find me a pretty wife\nHey, hey, hey\n\n(I'm going home,) Won't 'cha wait for me\nStarts to get me moving\n(Going home.) Oh, Lord have mercy\nTry to be, try to be a good man\n(I'm gonna tell someone to meet me.)\nGonna try to get me something together\nI'm going home, yes I am\nHey, hey, hey\n(Going home.)

deceased\nMy name Shawn Boothe\nAcknowledgements:\nFirst off I wanna thank Nas {UH!}\nAnd I wanna thank everybody for helping me out with this\nCouldn't do it without you\n\n{1, 2, 3, 4 - hit it!}\nMay 3rd, 1933\nJames Brown is born - stillborn delivery\nRevived by resuscitation\nHis childhood was nothin amazing\nAbandoned at 4\nMama took a dash for that, door\nGuess it's hard bein that poor\nRaised by his aunt in Augusta, Georgia\nSixteen wound up cuffed up\nArmed robbery\nSpend three years state property, but at least he ate properly\nBefore that, he was dancin for change\nPolishin shoes, really nuttin to lose\nLocked up he joined a band called the Flames\nAnd reconnected with his gospel roots\nUh, leadin the band was a man by the name Bobby Byrd\nAnd his family helped get Brown parolled\nAfter countless shows on the Chitlin Circuit\nThe Flames agreed and James became lead\nSwitchin from gospel to R&B\nTheir first song released was \"Please, Please, Please\"\nUh, that was '56\nTwo years later, they had a #1 hit\nSee they ain't never seen feet that quick\nOr the elaborate theatrics that he patented\nLike the cape routine, even the way he screamed\nBecame a part of his personal trademark {HAOW!!}\nBut he wasn't nationally known\n'Til after he released the Live at The Apollo LP\nYou might also like[*\"The Boss\" by James Brown plays*]\n\nIn '63, but originally\nThe label didn't see it sellin, they was like, \"Why chance, it?\"\nSo he financed, it\nAnd before you knew it, it was gigan-tic\n\"Paid the cost to be the boss,\" he said\nAnd later on it became one of his songs, uh\nCredited for turnin gospel to soul, then soul to funk\nWhen his band emphasized the One\nHad 'em screamin \"I'm Black and I'm Proud!\"\nFrom old to young, told his people don't hold your tongue\nThat was '68 in the summer\nBefore that we were callin each other colored\nIn '72 the Black leader\nWas asked to score the film, Black Ceasar\nWhich was about Black mobsters and so\nIn fun they called him the Godfather of Soul\n...And he stuck with it\nJust tellin you how they came up with it\n\n[*\"Blind Man Can See It\" by James Brown plays*]\n\nNow with everybody jackin his swagger\nFrom Jackson to Jagger, his influence kept music improvin\nFunkmaster, even Elvis wanted his band for back-up\nTwo times he revolutionized Black music\nThen he did it with rap music\n[*\"Funky Drummer\" by James Brown plays*]\n\nThey took his grooves, used them as they own\nSearchin his songs like siftin for gold\nIronically the nuggets they did chop\nCreated the Golden Era of hip-hop\n\n[*\"The Payback\" by James Brown plays]\n\nHe ran the whole scene\nHad 'em searchin for that James Brown soul like dope fiends\nBut it wasn't all rosy {HEY!!}\nFlattered, but when you don't see proceeds... {You got ta, got ta pay back!}\nIt pissed him off, {REVENGE!} they would get rich and not hit him off\nWhen it's him that they samplin\nHe didn't hate rap, he just wanted +Payback+\nLike \"Damn, I made that!\" {I'M MAD!}\nBut now top of the list is he\nThe most sampled artist in history\nSampled by nearly every veteran in rap\nHis mark in Hip-Hop another feather in his cap, uh\n\n[Outro]\nThe unauthorized biography of James Brown {UH!}\nEpilogue... {UH!}\nLeavin a legacy of over 115 charted hits, and I believe six children {UH!}\nHe is considered perhaps the most influencial person in music history {UH!}\nNot without flaw, but who is? {UH!}\nDeceased December 25th, 2006, the end\nNext chapter: Bob Marely\nPEACEEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

flower\nYou gotta let it, you gotta let it grow\n[Verse 2]\nSo keep on playing those mind games together\nFaith in the future, out of the now\nYou just can't beat on those mind guerillas\nAbsolute elsewhere, in the stones of your mind\nYeah, we're playing those mind games forever\nProjecting our images in space and in time\n\n[Bridge]\nYes is the answer\nAnd you know that for sure\nYes is surrender\nYou gotta let it, you gotta let it go\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo keep on playing those mind games together\nDoing the ritual, dance in the sun\nMillions of mind guerillas\nPutting their soul power to

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThat's not a street that you can walk\nYou gotta watch just who you're talking to\nThey're out to getcha!\nCan't turn your back on a smiling face\nNext thing you know, there ain't no trace, of you\nAnd this I betcha, some people lose and some folks win\nIt's a matter of what they do\n\n[Chorus]\nAre you man enough, big and bad enough?\nAre you gonna let 'em shoot you down?\nWhen the evil flies and your brother cries\nAre you gonna be around?\nSomeone needs a friend, just around the bend\nDon't you think you should be there?\nAre you man enough when the going's rough?\nIs it in your heart to care?\n[Verse 2]\nThere's no pretending it goes away\nWith every step that you take, you pay your dues\nAnd I ain't lying!\nYou got to struggle to see the light\n'Cause someone's looking to steal your right to choose\nAnd they don't stop trying!\nIt's like a jungle outside the door and it's keeping you so confused\n\n[Chorus]\nAre you man enough, big and bad enough?\nAre you gonna let 'em shoot you down?\nWhen the evil flies and your brother cries\nAre you gonna be around?\n\n[Bridge]\nGotta keep your eye on the passers-by, better watch your step\n'Cause you never know where the knife will go\nAnd they ain't missed yet\nThe strong survive, they stay alive, they always cool\nBut that they never teach you in school\n\n[Chorus]\nAre you man enough, big and bad enough?\nAre you gonna let 'em shoot you down?\nWhen the evil flies, and your brother cries\nAre you gonna be around?\nSomeone needs a friend, just around the bend\nDon't you think you should be

I\n(What you're telling me) I want you to go, baby\n(Baby) Listen here\n[Verse 2]\nLately, I felt that you\nAvoided my conversations\nYou would turn on the TV, yes you would\nGive me an aggravation\nI just don't know, I just don't know\nWhat I've done to you\nBut whatever it is, child\nI hope one thing can't be true\nAnd that is\n\n[Chorus]\n(Leaving me) Ooh, mom\n(Can't be) Ah, ah\n(What you're telling me) Ooh, yes I do\n(Baby) Sometimes I moan\n(Leaving me) Mmm, ho, Lord\n(Can't be) You don't know\n(What you're telling me) Don't know what it's doing to me, baby\n(Can't be) Oh, Lord\n\n[Verse 3]\nGirl, if you only knew what\nWhat was going through my mind\nYou'd stop fooling around, yes you would\nAnd give me all your time\nThe best years I've had\nI spent 'em all with you\nIf you left me one day\nI'd be through\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n(Leaving me) I'm sick, baby\n(Can't be) Somebody, somebody\n(What you're telling me) Somebody know what I'm talkin' about out

crashed them Hemi\nWay before this rap shit Lil Roc knew i had it in me\nWay before this rap shit white folks knew i had it in me\nFreestyling on that hot shit block shit few blocks past the enemy\nFully autos we got plenty bitch we blast at any\nStart sipping 8s of act with kobe made me break my kidneys\nAnd now I still might sip a 4 way just because I miss him\nAnd i rap about that trap shit i was in the kitchen\nFolk nem copped their first book i was right there my left wrist a 50\nAnd if the feds come I won't write them I might forget to mention\nThey ain't cut from my cloth they ain't like that man these niggas bitches\nI don't want no fuck niggas around me thats a disposition\nI don't do no rap beef nigga try me pistol whip or strip him\nPussy better mind your business my little killas itching\nDisrespect No Limit thats a bad decision\nLil bro tote that glizzy and he got precision\nTold him just get money and play your position\nBitch i been that nigga ever since elementary\nAlways in the mix I used to get suspensions\nNow my whips like bitches cause thats how I switch em\nGot my bitches switching kissing lied say that i missed them\nGrowing up I ran the streets I learned a lot of wisdom\nAlways use your head and duck that prison system\nBroski told me take care of business I can't lie I listened\nHe supposed to be still here right with me and thats

today\nI look at the teller I ain't know what to tell her I need something to do with my day\nShe like okay if you don't spend it all please bring it back in\nAnd you know how that story went I might as well threw it away\nEvery weekend I just pull up and go get that back in\nSomewhere for 5 to 15k and i just did 2 in a day\nImma keep on pulling up making them sick until they get blue in their

amusement hall\nThat deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball\n\nHe stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine\nFeeling all the bumpers, always playing clean\nHe plays by intuition, the digit counters fall\nThat deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pin ball\n\nHe's a pinball wizard, there has got to be a twist\nA pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist\nHow do you think he does it? I don't know\nWhat makes him so good?\nHe ain't got no distractions, can't hear those buzzers and bells\nDon't see lights a flashin', plays by sense of smell\nAlways has a replay 'n' never tilts at all\nThat deaf dumb and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball\n\nI thought I was the Bally table king\nBut I just handed my pinball crown to him\n\nEven on my usual table, he can beat my best\nHis

with an irrelevant conversation\nBut you see, darling, it's about time for me to get real serious about you\nBecause if someone was to rip me off you\nI couldn't account for my actions after all\nAnd knowing the way I feel, knowing that you should be mine all the time\nBut you see, I not only want you, baby, I need you\nAnd the need is so strong, it's almost like that of a junkie\nIn other words, baby, I just got to have you\nListen to me, darling\nPlease listen to me\nLove jones\nI got a love jones\nI got a love jones for you\nOooh, oooh, oooh\nLove jones\nI got a love jones\nI got a love jones for you\n\nWhat, baby?  What is a love jones?\nShucks, darling\nIt's when you love someone very, very much\nAnd you just can't seem to get yourself together\nLike last Friday in class, when Mr. Russell was giving us the test\nI was sitting up staring at you and daydreaming\nI know I failed a test paper with nothing but my name on it\nI guess anybody can have a love jones\nIt's just love, the true love\nThe way I feel about you\nThat's a love jones\n\nLove jones\nI got a love jones\nI got a love jones for you\nOooh, oooh, oooh\nLove jones\nI got a love jones\nI got a love jones for you\nYou might also likeAhhh\nOooh, oooh, oooh, ahhh\nOooh, oooh, ahhh\nOooh, oooh, oooh\nAhhh\nOooh, oooh, oooh, ahhh\nOooh, oooh, ahhh\nOooh, oooh, oooh\n\nIf you've comprehend to anything I said to you\nAnd you find that you do love me\nThen all I wanna hear from you, darling, is that you too have a love jones\n\n(Love jones.) Oh, my baby\n(I got a love jones.) Uh huh\nI got a love jones for nobody but you\nI can't really help it, baby\n(Love jones.)

Story Lyrics[Intro]\nGirl, my love is really strong\nI can't ever really be wrong\nThat's a message I receive directly from God\nYou ain't that naive\nMaybe I'll find you in Spain with your wad\nFor that's where my dick it is you crave\n\n[Chorus]\nWe want the same thing, baby\nWe basically think the same\nHow could I ever be taken seriously?\nWith me wandering into your brain\nI hear you want to know if you are the one?\nIs that a question?\nOnly one simple thing is true\nI can draw a straight line between the two of you\nThat's you, I'm holding here\nLiving with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer\nAs far as your question goes\nThere ain't no such thing as the one\nIt's one world, one life\nWe solemnly love\n[Verse 1]\nWhat may seem as redundant spasms\nAre actually multiple orgasms\nYou make me touch ecstasy, pleasure's crest\nA jolt passes down my spine when my hand is on your supple breast\nYou always are stubborn, looking for ways to elude\nBut girl I'll snap my fingers and set you in the mood\nI may be rough, sometimes hard and crass\nBut baby its heaven when I hold that fine ass\nIts an explosion of lust, love and emotions all in a boom\nBaby, we made epic love in that hotel room\nYou call me vampire, hard, cold and pretty\nI'm a different breed of monster in flesh, blood..m gritty\nThank god the room service didn't get the pen\nOr else they would have heard a loud n horny Edward Cullen\nWe laughed and joked and the cam went click click\nBut baby doll it\u2019s a different joy altogether when our bodies writhed like sweet music\nYou have no anger\nYou have no hate\nYou love the soul and not the money\nBlessed I am to be gifted with a piece of paradise, that you honey\nYou made your way into my heart\nMy soul you did maraud\nBaby Girl, I love it when you laugh, your heart pauses and says ohhh gaawwwdd...!!!\nYou\u2019re my love; you\u2019re my life, my essence of life, in the love vortex i finally did fall\nMy darling, my angel, my sweetheart, my maiden, you will always be my porkydoll\nAnd I will be your satan\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWe want the same thing, baby\nWe basically think the same\nHow could I ever be taken seriously?\nWith me wandering into your brain\nI hear you want to know if you are the one?\nIs that a question?\nOnly one simple thing is true\nI can draw a straight line between the two of you\nThat's you, I'm hoarding here\nLiving with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer\nAs far as your question goes\nThere ain't no such thing as a one\nIt's one world, one life\nWe solemnly love\n\n[Verse 2]\nThey can't get what they are truly after, cause it's not you\nYou are my concern\nWe will genuinely go solid, he'll be too busy to focus on you\nThere are games I created to get to penetrate you\nBut it was my greed and selfishness, I hadn't a clue\nMy pursuit of you doesn't change in this manhood\nI was broke at the time\nYou told me Marshall make something out of your brokenness now, so I wrote this for you\nBut you don't want to read, that was the last thing on your mind too lou\nI'm not a comedian to just witter and not say a thing that I wouldn't mean, with every I mean, I mean\nI'm doing my best to get my life together so you find someone serious to settle with\nI'll get a clap for every time I crack a joke\nBut then too their will be serious glares for there ain't no shitty jokes with you\nAll those three things are in a sync so I'll sync in with the one who doesn't want to make you into a woebegone\nIt was all madness, it got me waddling off for macaroons\nI won't vulgarize this, it's like sugar on vanilla, it's amorous\nMy animus is vaporized\nI'm answerable to no one, it's being in supremo command\nI might have bit my tongue, but there is no suppressing thing for you\nI'll open up and shout it out, get wild, maybe hurt myself too\nIt's a bruise, not a Bruce, a Bruce wouldn't let that happen too\nI'd re-hydrate and keep saying all that happens till I die for you\nCall it magical when I'm with you, till then it's nothing but how wieners maim\nCheck your calender for tuesdays, Mardi gras is around the corner you might want to lurk in\nYou think you want to look marred and out, I can see they have surrounded you, climbing you on a pyre right there to burn you\nI'll take my boat to a marina and bring some water to put it out\nRelax, there ain't no fire, it's the fire within you\nIt's burning so fast that you can't even think about your stomach too\nIt's so painful to see you without any loving\n[Chorus]\nWe want the same thing, baby\nWe basically think the same\nHow could I ever be taken seriously?\nWith me wandering into your brain\nI hear you want to know if you are the one?\nIs that a question?\nOnly one simple thing is true\nI can draw a straight line between the two of you\nThat's you, I'm holding here\nLiving with the smokes, fuck bears, it's beer\nAs far as your question goes\nThere ain't no such thing as the one\nIt's one world, one life\nWe solemnly loveEmbed"},

own\nJust to have you back again\n[Verse 2]\nYou taught me how to love\nWhat it's of, what it's of\nYou never said too much\nBut still you showed the way\nAnd I knew from watching you\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nNobody else could ever know\nThe part of me that can't let go\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I would give anything I own\nWould give up my life, my heart, my home\nI would give everything I own\nJust to have you back again\n\n[Bridge]\nIs there someone you know\nYou're loving them so\nBut taking them all for granted?\nYou may lose them one day\nSomeone takes them away\nAnd they don't hear the words\nYou long to say\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI would give anything I own\nWould give up my life, my heart, my home\nI would give everything I own\nJust to have you back
