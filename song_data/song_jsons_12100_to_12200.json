don't seem so proud\nAbout having to be scrounging your next meal\n[Chorus]\nHow does it feel?\nHow does it feel?\nTo be without a home?\nLike a complete unknown?\nLike a rolling stone?\n\n[Verse 2]\nAw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely\nBut ya know ya only used to get juiced in it\nNobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street\nAnd now you\u2019re gonna have to get used to it\nYou say you never compromise\nWith the mystery tramp, but now you realize\nHe's not selling any alibis\nAs you stare into the vacuum of his eyes\nAnd say, \u201cDo you want to make a deal?\"\n[Chorus]\nHow does it feel?\nHow does it feel?\nTo be on your own\nWith no direction home\nA complete unknown\nLike a rolling stone?\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nAw, you never turned around to see the frowns\nOn the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you\nNever understood that it ain't no good\nYou shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you\nYou used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat\nWho carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat\nAin't it hard when you discover that\nHe really wasn't where it's at\nAfter he took from you everything he could steal?\n\n[Chorus]\nHow does it feel?\nHow does it feel?\nTo hang on your own\nWith no direction home\nLike a complete unknown\nLike a rolling stone?\n\n[Verse 4]\nAw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people\nThey're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made\nExchangin' all precious gifts\nBut you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe\nYou used to be so amused\nAt Napoleon in rags and the language that he used\nGo to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse\nWhen ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose\nYou're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal\n[Chorus]\nHow does it feel?\nAw, how does it feel?\nTo be on your own\nWith no direction home\nLike a complete unknown\nLike a rolling stone?63Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count":

such a beautiful sight (corn)\nWell, he looked at her\nAnd she looked at him\nAnd she almost passed out from fright\nHe looked at her Thought, \"what a dilly\"\nHe touched her once She slapped him silly\nThis was something He had never sensed\nHe looked at her As she commenced\nNow listen, pal This ain't no fluke\nI can't see goin' with a big green kook\"\n\nYou've heard about the Jolly Green Giant (eggplant)\nDon't let his troubles cross your mind (celery stalks)\nHe couldn't get Sally, so went back to his valley\nThe cat was color-blind\n\nMUSIC TO FADEYou might also likeEmbed"},

remember always in life\n\n[Verse 1]\nInto each heart some tears must fall\nThough you love and lose\nYou must stand tall\n'Cause we all got to cry sometimes\nI said\nSigh sometimes\nPull yourself together\nNo use crying forever\n[Chorus]\nBecause there's too many fish in the sea\nToo many fish in the sea\nI said, there's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones\nToo many fish in the sea\nDu-du-du-duu-duduu\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy mother once told me something\nAnd every word is true\nDon't waste your time on a fella\nWho doesn't love you\nHe'll only mislead you\nOnly grieve you\nDon't worry about him, let him go\nDo without him\n\n[Chorus]\nBecause there's too many fish in the sea, uh-huh\nToo many fish in the sea\nI said\nThere's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones\nToo many fish in the sea\nDu-du-du-duu-duduu\n\n[Bridge]\nWell, if the fish isn't on your line\nBait your hook and keep on trying\nDon't let him get you down\nThere's other boys around\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBecause there's too many fish in the sea, uh-huh\nToo many fish in the sea\nI said\nThere's short ones, tall ones, fine ones, kind ones\nToo many fish in the sea\nDu-du-du-duu-duduu\n\n[Outro]\nI don't want nobody that don't want me\n'Cause there's too many fish in the sea\nAin't gonna love nobody that don't love me, now\n'Cause there's too many fish in the sea\n\nI don't need nobody that don't need me\n'Cause there's too many fish in the sea\nI don't want nobody that don't love me, now\n'Cause there's too many fish in the seaEmbed"}, {"_type":

burned so I used my knife\nAnd late that night I saved the life of Ringo\n\n(Ringo... Ringo...)\n\nI nursed him till the danger passed\nThe days went by, he mended fast\nThen from dawn till setting sun\nHe practiced with that deadly gun\nAnd hour on hour I watched in awe\nNo human being could match the draw of Ringo\n(Ringo... Ringo...)\n\nOne day we rode the mountain crest\nAnd I went east and he went west\nI took to law and wore a star\nWhile he spread terror near and far\nWith lead and blood he gained such fame\nAll through the West they feared the name of Ringo\n\n(Ringo... Ringo...)\n\nI knew someday I'd face the test\nWhich one of us would be the best\nAnd sure enough the word came down\nThat he was holed up in the town\nI left the posse out in the street\nAnd I went in alone to meet Ringo\n\n(Ringo... Ringo...)\n\nThey said my speed was next to none\nBut my lightning draw had just begun\nWhen I heard a blast that stunned my wrist\nThe gun went flying from my fist\nAnd I was looking down the bore\nOf the deadly .44 of Ringo\nYou might also like(Ringo... Ringo...)\n\nThey say that was the only time\nThat anyone had seen him smile\nHe slowly lowered his gun and then\nHe said to me \"We're even, friend\"\nAnd so at last I understood\nThat there was still a spark of good in Ringo\n\n(Ringo... Ringo...)\n\nI blocked the path of his retreat\nHe turned and stepped into the street\nA dozen guns spit fire and lead\nA moment later, he lay dead\nThe town began to shout and cheer\nNowhere was there shed a tear for Ringo\n\n(Ringo... Ringo...)\n\nThe story spread throughout the land\nThat I had beaten Ringo's hand\nAnd it was just the years, they say\nThat made me put my guns away\nBut on his grave they can't explain\nThe tarnished star above the name of Ringo\n(Ringo...

passar\n[Refr\u00e3o: Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]\nAh, por que estou t\u00e3o sozinho?\nAh, por que tudo \u00e9 t\u00e3o triste?\nAh, a beleza que existe\nA beleza que n\u00e3o \u00e9 s\u00f3 minha\nQue tamb\u00e9m passa sozinha\n\n[Verso 2: Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]\nAh, se ela soubesse\nQue quando ela passa\nO mundo sorrindo se enche de gra\u00e7a\nE fica mais lindo por causa do amor\n\n[Verse 1: Astrud Gilberto]\nTall and tan and young and lovely\nThe girl from Ipanema goes walking\nAnd when she passes, each one she passes goes \"ah!\"\nWhen she walks she's like a samba that\nSwings so cool and sways so gently\nThat when she passes, each one she passes goes \"ah!\"\n\n[Chorus: Astrud Gilberto]\nOh, but he watches her sadly\nHow can he tell her he loves her?\nYes, he would give his heart gladly\nBut each day when she walks to the sea\nShe looks straight ahead not at he\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Astrud Gilberto]\nTall and tan and young and lovely\nThe girl from Ipanema goes walking\nAnd when she passes he smiles\nBut she doesn't see\n\n[Instrumental Bridge]\n\n[Chorus: Astrud Gilberto]\nOh, but he sees her so sadly\nHow can he tell her he loves her?\nYes, he would give his heart gladly\nBut each day when she walks to the sea\nShe looks straight ahead not at he\n\n[Verse 2: Astrud Gilberto]\nTall and tan and young and lovely\nThe girl from Ipanema goes walking\nAnd when she passes he smiles\nBut she doesn't see\n\n[Outro]\nShe just doesn't see\nNo, she doesn't see\nBut she doesn't see\nShe doesn't see\nNo, she doesn't see10Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

alone\nThinking about my past\nWondering how I made it\nAnd how long it's gonna last\nSuccess has come to lots of them\nFailure is always there\nTime, time waits for no one\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wish\nHow I wish someone would care\nOoh-hoo, yeah\nOoh-hoo-ooh, ooh-hoo, ooh-hoo\n\n[Verse 2]\nSome folks think you're happy\nWhen you wear your smile\nWhat about your tribulations\nAnd all, all of your trials\nSmiles, smiles hide lots of things\nThe good, the bad, the hurt\nAll of this goes too\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I wish\nHow I wish, how I wish someone would care\nI wish someone would care\nDon't you think someone should care?\nAh, don't you need someone to care?\nSit down and think about yourself\n\n[Interlude]\nYes, baby, sit down and think about yourselves\nIn all of my travels from town to town\nCity to city and country to country\nI've had the opportunity to talk to a lot of ladies\nAnd I've discovered that we women do have a lot in common\nWe worry about the same things: men and money\nAnd we've also discovered that a man is a helluva thing\nI think I'll say that again: a man is a helluva thing\nAh, but we women are a helluva thing, too\nAnything you men can do, we manage to do it better\nYou know, as kids we all have our aspirations\nYou know, the things we wanna do when we grow up\nThe little boys having one-track minds, you know\nBut little girls are a little bit different\nWe wanted to grow up to be stewardesses, nurses, doctors, lawyers, and mothers\nNot necessarily with children, but that little fella, different story\nAll he wanted was he first car and his first piece\nAnd he knew if he could get that car, he know he gon' get that piece\nYeah, but, now that they've gotten older, nothing has changed\nBut we women call that two-timing\nJust remember, fellas, two can play that game\nAnd every time you men two-time, we women can three\nNow, there are some of you fellas who have to have your Wheaties\nYou must eat your Cheerios, and you must have your One-a-Day vitamin with iron\nThis is so you can go out and three-time\nWell, go right ahead, honey, go right ahead\nBecause every time you men three-time, we women can six\nAnd our back don't hurt when we get through\nFurthermore, honey, keep one thing in mind:\nYours is a non-profit item and ours is a profit-making item, haha\nYou know, ladies, I've also discovered that men are avid liars\nFurthermore, they do it with a smile on their face\nHow many times you went out, came home, and your man wasn't there?\nSooner or later, here he come, rising with the sun\nSmiling from ear to ear\nAnd when you ask him, \"Baby, where you been?\"\nHe look at you grinning, saying, \"Oh, I've been out with the boys\"\nI'd sure like to know what those boys look like to put a smile on his face like that\nHave our mouth stuck out to the back door\nBut I found the perfect solution to that problem:\nThe very next time that man does that\nYou meet him in the door with nothing on\nAnd have your clothes lying on the bed\nAnd just for a wee bit of color, have a rose in your teeth\nAnd when he comes in that door and looks at you standing there with nothing on\nAnd those clothes on the bed and that rose in your teeth\nHe won't know if that man just left or you were just coming in\nGuarantee he won't hang out again\nBut now ladies, I highly recommend that you do take a course in karate\n'Cause he might come in that door and decide to knock that rose out your teeth\nBut now I've also discovered something else about them fellas:\nThey don't know what they want\nYou'll hear 'em all sitting down rapping together, talking about, you know, sports and stuff like that\nBut you'll hear 'em always getting around to the subject of women\nYou'll hear one man not to be outdone, you know\nHe'll stand up real proud and say, \"Man, I love my women with big legs\"\nNow, honestly, I don't know why 'cause that's the first thing they throw on each side\nThen you get that other fella, he's the one that likes his lady with big hips\nNow, that makes sense, because if he's a little bitty man, he's gotta have something to hang on to\nNow, you get that other fella, he's the one that likes that lady with long hair\nSomething flowing in the wind, something he can run his fingers through and hope like hell it doesn't come off\nWell, I'll tell you, honey, I don't know about him, because in all these years, other than that I bought, I ain't never had long hair\nBut I'll tell you something else, in all these years, I ain't never had a man that asked me for hair yet\nThen you get that next fella, he's the one that never got weaned\nHe loves 'em large, loves to be smothered\nYou know, you take him and kinda lay him upside his ears\nAnd then you take one and you slap 'cross the nose with it\nMm, they call him \"The Titty Man\"\nWell, all I got to say to him is this\nGirls, those of us who are not so well endowed, don't you dare get upset\nBecause I was told that anything over a mouthful, it's a waste anyhow\nYou might also like[Outro]\nSmiles, smiles hide lots of things\nThe good, the bad, the hurt\nAll of this goes, too\nAnd I wish, I wish\nI wish someone would care\nI wish someone would care\nDon't you think someone should care?\nAh, don't you need someone to care?\nSit down and think about yourself\nAh yeah\nUh-huh\nAh yeahEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before. For now the shadow of a real trouble had come, the little books were full of help and comfort, and as they dressed, they agreed to say goodbye cheerfully and hopefully, and send their mother on her anxious journey unsaddened by tears or complaints from them. Everything seemed very strange when they went down, so dim and still outside, so full of light and bustle within. Breakfast at that early hour seemed odd, and even Hannah's familiar face looked unnatural as she flew about her kitchen with her nightcap on. The big trunk stood ready in the hall, Mother's cloak and bonnet lay on the sofa, and Mother herself sat trying to eat, but looking so pale and worn with sleeplessness and anxiety that the girls found it very hard to keep their resolution. Meg's eyes kept filling in spite of herself, Jo was obliged to hide her face in the kitchen roller more than once, and the little girls wore a grave, troubled expression, as if sorrow was a new experience to them.\n\nNobody talked much, but as the time drew very near and they sat waiting for the carriage, Mrs. March said to the girls, who were all busied about her, one folding her shawl, another smoothing out the strings of her bonnet, a third putting on her overshoes, and a fourth fastening up her travelling bag...\n\n\"Children, I leave you to Hannah's care and Mr. Laurence's protection. Hannah is faithfulness itself, and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own. I have no fears for you, yet I am anxious that you should take this trouble rightly. Don't grieve and fret when I am gone, or think that you can be idle and comfort yourselves by being idle and trying to forget. Go on with your work as usual, for work is a blessed solace. Hope and keep busy, and whatever happens, remember that you never can be fatherless.\"\n\n\"Yes, Mother.\"\n\n\"Meg, dear, be prudent, watch over your sisters, consult Hannah, and in any perplexity, go to Mr. Laurence. Be patient, Jo, don't get despondent or do rash things, write to me often, and be my brave girl, ready to help and cheer all. Beth, comfort yourself with your music, and be faithful to the little home duties, and you, Amy, help all you can, be obedient, and keep happy safe at home.\"\n\n\"We will, Mother! We will!\"\nThe rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen. That was the hard minute, but the girls stood it well. No one cried, no one ran away or uttered a lamentation, though their hearts were very heavy as they sent loving messages to Father, remembering, as they spoke that it might be too late to deliver them. They kissed their mother quietly, clung about her tenderly, and tried to wave their hands cheerfully when she drove away.\n\nLaurie and his grandfather came over to see her off, and Mr. Brooke looked so strong and sensible and kind that the girls christened him 'Mr. Greatheart' on the spot.\n\n\"Good-by, my darlings! God bless and keep us all!\" whispered Mrs. March, as she kissed one dear little face after the other, and hurried into the carriage.\n\nAs she rolled away, the sun came out, and looking back, she saw it shining on the group at the gate like a good omen. They saw it also, and smiled and waved their hands, and the last thing she beheld as she turned the corner was the four bright faces, and behind them like a bodyguard, old Mr. Laurence, faithful Hannah, and devoted Laurie.\n\n\"How kind everyone is to us!\" she said, turning to find fresh proof of it in the respectful sympathy of the young man's face.\n\n\"I don't see how they can help it,\" returned Mr. Brooke, laughing so infectiously that Mrs. March could not help smiling. And so the journey began with the good omens of sunshine, smiles, and cheerful words.\n\n\"I feel as if there had been an earthquake,\" said Jo, as their neighbors went home to breakfast, leaving them to rest and refresh themselves.\n\n\"It seems as if half the house was gone,\" added Meg forlornly.\n\nBeth opened her lips to say something, but could only point to the pile of nicely mended hose which lay on Mother's table, showing that even in her last hurried moments she had thought and worked for them. It was a little thing, but it went straight to their hearts, and in spite of their brave resolutions, they all broke down and cried bitterly.\n\nHannah wisely allowed them to relieve their feelings, and when the shower showed signs of clearing up, she came to the rescue, armed with a coffeepot.\n\n\"Now, my dear young ladies, remember what your ma said, and don't fret. Come and have a cup of coffee all round, and then let's fall to work and be a credit to the family.\"\n\nCoffee was a treat, and Hannah showed great tact in making it that morning. No one could resist her persuasive nods, or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot. They drew up to the table, exchanged their handkerchiefs for napkins, and in ten minutes were all right again.\n\n\"'Hope and keep busy', that's the motto for us, so let's see who will remember it best. I shall go to Aunt March, as usual. Oh, won't she lecture though!\" said Jo, as she sipped with returning spirit.\n\"I shall go to my Kings, though I'd much rather stay at home and attend to things here,\" said Meg, wishing she hadn't made her eyes so red.\n\n\"No need of that. Beth and I can keep house perfectly well,\" put in Amy, with an important air.\n\n\"Hannah will tell us what to do, and we'll have everything nice when you come home,\" added Beth, getting out her mop and dish tub without delay.\n\n\"I think anxiety is very interesting,\" observed Amy, eating sugar pensively.\n\nThe girls couldn't help laughing, and felt better for it, though Meg shook her head at the young lady who could find consolation in a sugar bowl.\n\nThe sight of the turnovers made Jo sober again; and when the two went out to their daily tasks, they looked sorrowfully back at the window where they were accustomed to see their mother's face. It was gone, but Beth had remembered the little household ceremony, and there she was, nodding away at them like a rosyfaced mandarin.\n\n\"That's so like my Beth!\" said Jo, waving her hat, with a grateful face. \"Goodbye, Meggy, I hope the Kings won't strain today. Don't fret about Father, dear,\" she added, as they parted.\n\n\"And I hope Aunt March won't croak. Your hair is becoming, and it looks very boyish and nice,\" returned Meg, trying not to smile at the curly head, which looked comically small on her tall sister's shoulders.\n\n\"That's my only comfort.\" And, touching her hat a la Laurie, away went Jo, feeling like a shorn sheep on a wintry day.\n\nNews from their father comforted the girls very much, for though dangerously ill, the presence of the best and tenderest of nurses had already done him good. Mr. Brooke sent a bulletin every day, and as the head of the family, Meg insisted on reading the dispatches, which grew more cheerful as the week passed. At first, everyone was eager to write, and plump envelopes were carefully poked into the letter box by one or other of the sisters, who felt rather important with their Washington correspondence. As one of these packets contained characteristic notes from the party, we will rob an imaginary mail, and read them.\n\nMy dearest Mother:\n\nIt is impossible to tell you how happy your last letter made us, for the news was so good we couldn't help laughing and crying over it. How very kind Mr. Brooke is, and how fortunate that Mr. Laurence's business detains him near you so long, since he is so useful to you and Father. The girls are all as good as gold. Jo helps me with the sewing, and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs. I should be afraid she might overdo, if I didn't know her 'moral fit' wouldn't last long. Beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock, and never forgets what you told her. She grieves about Father, and looks sober except when she is at her little piano. Amy minds me nicely, and I take great care of her. She does her own hair, and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings. She tries very hard, and I know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come. Mr. Laurence watches over us like a motherly old hen, as Jo says, and Laurie is very kind and neighborly. He and Jo keep us merry, for we get pretty blue sometimes, and feel like orphans, with you so far away. Hannah is a perfect saint. She does not scold at all, and always calls me Miss Margaret, which is quite proper, you know, and treats me with respect. We are all well and busy, but we long, day and night, to have you back. Give my dearest love to Father, and believe me, ever your own...\n\nMEG\nThis note, prettily written on scented paper, was a great contrast to the next, which was scribbled on a big sheet of thin foreign paper, ornamented with blots and all manner of flourishes and curly-tailed letters.\n\nMy precious Marmee:\n\nThree cheers for dear Father! Brooke was a trump to telegraph right off, and let us know the minute he was better. I rushed up garret when the letter came, and tried to thank god for being so good to us, but I could only cry, and say, \"I'm glad! I'm glad!\" Didn't that do as well as a regular prayer? For I felt a great many in my heart. We have such funny times, and now I can enjoy them, for everyone is so desperately good, it's like living in a nest of turtledoves. You'd laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish. She gets prettier every day, and I'm in love with her sometimes. The children are regular archangels, and I\u2014well, I'm Jo, and never shall be anything else. Oh, I must tell you that I came near having a quarrel with Laurie. I freed my mind about a silly little thing, and he was offended. I was right, but didn't speak as I ought, and he marched home, saying he wouldn't come again till I begged pardon. I declared I wouldn't and got mad. It lasted all day. I felt bad and wanted you very much. Laurie and I are both so proud, it's hard to beg pardon. But I thought he'd come to it, for I was in the right. He didn't come, and just at night I remembered what you said when Amy fell into the river. I read my little book, felt better, resolved not to let the sun set on my anger, and ran over to tell Laurie I was sorry. I met him at the gate, coming for the same thing. We both laughed, begged each other's pardon, and felt all good and comfortable again.\n\nI made a 'pome' yesterday, when I was helping Hannah wash, and as Father likes my silly little things, I put it in to amuse him. Give him my lovingest hug that ever was, and kiss yourself a dozen times for your...\n\nTOPSY-TURVY JO\n\n\nA SONG FROM THE SUDS\nQueen of my tub, I merrily sing,\nWhile the white foam rises high,\nAnd sturdily wash and rinse and wring,\nAnd fasten the clothes to dry.\nThen out in the free fresh air they swing,\nUnder the sunny sky.\nI wish we could wash from our hearts and souls\nThe stains of the week away,\nAnd let water and air by their magic make\nOurselves as pure as they.\nThen on the earth there would be indeed,\nA glorious washing day!\nAlong the path of a useful life,\nWill heart's-ease ever bloom.\nThe busy mind has no time to think\nOf sorrow or care or gloom.\nAnd anxious thoughts may be swept away,\nAs we bravely wield a broom.\nI am glad a task to me is given,\nTo labor at day by day,\nFor it brings me health and strength and hope,\nAnd I cheerfully learn to say,\n\"Head, you may think, Heart, you may feel,\nBut, Hand, you shall work alway!\"\n\nDear Mother,\n\nThere is only room for me to send my love, and some pressed pansies from the root I have been keeping safe in the house for Father to see. I read every morning, try to be good all day, and sing myself to sleep with Father's tune. I can't sing 'LAND OF THE LEAL' now, it makes me cry. Everyone is very kind, and we are as happy as we can be without you. Amy wants the rest of the page, so I must stop. I didn't forget to cover the holders, and I wind the clock and air the rooms every day.\n\nKiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine. Oh, do come soon to your loving...\n\nLITTLE BETH\n\nMa Chere Mamma,\n\nWe are all well I do my lessons always and never corroberate the girls\u2014Meg says I mean contradick so I put in both words and you can take the properest. Meg is a great comfort to me and lets me have jelly every night at tea its so good for me Jo says because it keeps me sweet tempered. Laurie is not as respeckful as he ought to be now I am almost in my teens, he calls me Chick and hurts my feelings by talking French to me very fast when I say Merci or Bon jour as Hattie King does. The sleeves of my blue dress were all worn out, and Meg put in new ones, but the full front came wrong and they are more blue than the dress. I felt bad but did not fret I bear my troubles well but I do wish Hannah would put more starch in my aprons and have buckwheats every day. Can't she? Didn't I make that interrigation point nice? Meg says my punchtuation and spelling are disgraceful and I am mortyfied but dear me I have so many things to do, I can't stop. Adieu, I send heaps of love to Papa. Your affectionate daughter...\n\nAMY CURTIS MARCH\n\n\nDear Mis March,\n\nI jes drop a line to say we git on fust rate. The girls is clever and fly round right smart. Miss Meg is going to make a proper good housekeeper. She hes the liking for it, and gits the hang of things surprisin quick. Jo doos beat all for goin ahead, but she don't stop to cal'k'late fust, and you never know where she's like to bring up. She done out a tub of clothes on Monday, but she starched 'em afore they was wrenched, and blued a pink calico dress till I thought I should a died a laughin. Beth is the best of little creeters, and a sight of help to me, bein so forehanded and dependable. She tries to learn everything, and really goes to market beyond her years, likewise keeps accounts, with my help, quite wonderful. We have got on very economical so fur. I don't let the girls hev coffee only once a week, accordin to your wish, and keep em on plain wholesome vittles. Amy does well without frettin, wearin her best clothes and eatin sweet stuff. Mr. Laurie is as full of didoes as usual, and turns the house upside down frequent, but he heartens the girls, so I let em hev full swing. The old gentleman sends heaps of things, and is rather wearin, but means wal, and it aint my place to say nothin. My bread is riz, so no more at this time. I send my duty to Mr. March, and hope he's seen the last of his Pewmonia.\n\nYours respectful,\nHannah Mullet\n\nHead Nurse of Ward No. 2,\n\nAll serene on the Rappahannock, troops in fine condition, commisary department well conducted, the Home Guard under Colonel Teddy always on duty, Commander in Chief General Laurence reviews the army daily, Quartermaster Mullet keeps order in camp, and Major Lion does picket duty at night. A salute of twenty-four guns was fired on receipt of good news from Washington, and a dress parade took place at headquarters. Commander in chief sends best wishes, in which he is heartily joined by...\n\nCOLONEL TEDDY\n\n\nDear Madam:\n\nThe little girls are all well. Beth and my boy report daily. Hannah is a model servant, and guards pretty Meg like a dragon. Glad the fine weather holds. Pray make Brooke useful, and draw on me for funds if expenses exceed your estimate. Don't let your husband want anything. Thank God he is mending.\n\nYour sincere friend and servant, JAMES LAURENCEEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1575429", "artist_names": "Baby Washington", "full_title": "That's How Heartaches Are Made by\u00a0Baby\u00a0Washington", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3a9197213f6ba38ee7c0f5df5485b52b.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3a9197213f6ba38ee7c0f5df5485b52b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 1575429, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429898023, "path": "/Baby-washington-thats-how-heartaches-are-made-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Baby-washington-thats-how-heartaches-are-made-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3a9197213f6ba38ee7c0f5df5485b52b.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3a9197213f6ba38ee7c0f5df5485b52b.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "That\u2019s How Heartaches Are Made", "title_with_featured": "That's How Heartaches Are Made", "updated_by_human_at": 1481929943, "url": "https://genius.com/Baby-washington-thats-how-heartaches-are-made-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/377760", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/712d51527a18dc6f7814224d5e45e467.215x215x1.jpg", "id": 377760, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/712d51527a18dc6f7814224d5e45e467.215x215x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Baby Washington", "slug": "Baby-washington", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Baby-washington"}, "artist": "Baby Washington", "lyrics": "That\u2019s How Heartaches Are Made Lyrics(That's how heartaches are made, that's how heartaches are made)\n\nThey told me I was such a fool to love you\nThey say that you're the kind who'd never be true\nPretty soon the day would come when I'd be the sorry one\nBut I said that I'm not afraid;

Radio\n\nPoon Patrol Radio\nIs it good? I don't know\nGet 'em high, get 'em low\nI don't know, I don't know\nPoon Patrol Radio\nPoon Patrol Radio\nI don't know\nHave you heard the story of Icarus?\nThe sun killed him 'cause he got too high\nPoon Patrol is pretty similar\nExcept we will never die\n\nGET READY TO BUST OPEN THAT PUSSY!!\n\n(God, fuck, fuck, fucked up this fucking song again, fuck!)\nThis one's for all the lonely dads out there\nYou know who you are\n\n[The Verse, 2:00-8:42]\nName's Hank Hill, propaner insaner\nOut the brainer, been known to snort the cocainer\nAnd my dick's as long as a couple of toothpicks\nAnd my asshole can only fit two dicks\nMaybe three, if I eat some casserole\nWe could cram another into my fat asshole\nI'm startin' to get burly, I'm a little bit lost\nHow much did the holla cost?\nAbout six million, and I got a billion\n'Cause I can do whatever I set my mind to\nExcept blow shit up with it, only when I'm not trying to\nAnd all I want in life is a collection of lawn chairs\nAnd some gummy bears\nThrow in some gay sex like American History X\nLike I'm Ed Norton, Pusha to the T\nWhen I'm [?] some earthquake\nOr maybe even a vanilla milkshake\nLet's hear some Seinfeld bass and eat some toothpaste\nNothing about me is kind\nLike trying to high-five the blind\nLike if I was Mister Seacrest\nSelling one-hundred-twenty-dollar hip-hop shirts\nLike I was Kanye West\nLike I'm always losing, like a-ha, honey\nAnd there's nothing funny about the Easter Bunny\nIn the middle of July\nPinocchio knows and I just can't lie\nYou might also likeMaybe it's just my heritage\nI want to grow up to be as fake as Lamar Odom's marriage is\nWhile I stare at his sister-in-laws' carriages\nWhile I spout out some ray-jays and shoot some AKs\n'Cause it's the return of the P-double-O-N\nWe're as Bad as the Sin, that's a joke about the comedian\nSomebody please stop feeding him\nWhy's it always sunny in Philly? Please fill me in, Charlie Day\nBut who knew Mac was gay?\nBut I'm all about pride, and I love kittens\nSo let's give him some little kitten mittens\nWhile I'm spittin' like Walt Whitman\nLike I'm on the toilet but I will not spoil it\nJust watch season five\nShoot some heroin and listen to Dive\nAnd the sky sure is blue\nAnd if you asked me my favorite day of the week\nI'd have to choose two\nThe two where I eat cheese pizza and chill with my crew\nAlways on the patrol for poon, play that pussy like a bassoon\n\nAnd I'll eat your whole asshole, you'll go \"holy mackerel\"\nWhen I come out lookin' like a raccoon\nExcept the mask is just your shit\nAnd I'll apologize to your armpit\nFor foreseeing me sneezing in it, just spray some Febreze in it\nAnd when I say I'm sorry know I meant it\nAnd know that your gooch was splendid\nThat's the path between your cooch and your butt crack\nAnd I know my compliments are wack\nAnd I know my pick-up lines are wack\nBut you know you like the One Man Wolf Pack\nThat's what I call my ball sack\n'Cause I've only got one teste\nAnd if he was gay he'd slap his two besties\nWhat happened when the cow's dad touched him?\nHe got moo-lested, just like your patience is getting tested\nThis song isn't even about pizza with cheese\nHe's just rapping about the birds and the bees\nLadies, be quiet, let me see your knees\nAnd I'll blow you some kisses\nAnd I won't stop until R. Kelly pisses me off\nLike when old ladies say no, guess it just goes to show\nI can blow low when I go low 'cause I'm so fucking good at limbo\nWhy's the pizza so aggressive, Jimbo?\nI don't know, Sheen, I just don't know\nWhat's your favorite medicine?\n'Cause there's nothing better than\nMe inside of your butt socks\nI hope you're a fan of guys with two cocks\nRemember when Poon Patrol was good fun?\nDo you remember when I stuck my Donut Stick\nBetween your Honey Buns?\nI want to get on a bike and fly away like I'm E.T\nBut I can't go outside 'cause the mailman beats me\nWhy? I don't know, it beats me, but he'll never defeat me\n'Cause i've got the spirit of the dragon\nEven if its balls are saggin'\nAnd it's as old as Bob Saget and if I had a tail I'd wag it\nAnd I'd fly really really really far away\nLike some deranged half-boy half-dog faggot\nAnd I'd live off the maggots of maggots\nHey do you have any matches?

too shy\nBut I was looking at you so hard\nUntil you must have had a hunch\nSo you came up to me and asked me my name\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou beat me to the punch that time\nYou beat me to the punch\nYou beat me to the punch\n[Verse 2]\nAfter I had known you for it seems like a long, long time\nI wanted, wanted to ask you, would you please, please be mine\nWhenever you came around, my heart would pound\nSo you must have had a hunch\nSo you came up to me and asked me to be yours\n\n[Chorus 1]\nYou beat me to the punch that time\nYou beat me to the punch\nYou beat me to the punch\n\n[Bridge]\nSince I love you, I thought you would be true and love me tender\nSo I let my heart surrender - to you, yes, I did\nBut I found out beyond a doubt one day, boy, you were a playboy\nWho would go away and leave me - blue\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo I ain't gonna wait around for you to put me down\nThis time I'm gonna play my hunch\nAnd walk away this very day\n\n[Chorus 2]\nAnd beat you to the punch this time\nAnd beat you to the punch this time\nI'll beat you to the punch, yes, I will\nAnd let you know, know, how it feelsYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",
