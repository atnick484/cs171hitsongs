even a holiday\nNothin' to celebrate ('Brate, 'brate, 'brate)\nYou give a hundred reasons why\nAnd say you're really gonna try\nIf I had a nickel for every time\nI'd own the bank (Bank, bank, bank)\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThought that I was the exception\nI could reroute your addiction\nYou could've been the greatest\nBut you'd rather get wasted\n[Chorus]\nYou fall asleep during foreplay\n'Cause the pills you take are more your fort\u00e9\nI'm not stickin' around to watch you go down\nWanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother\nCan't be your savior, I don't have the power\nI'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the drain\nWatch you circle the drain, watch you circle the drain\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou say it helps you write your rhymes\nWhatever helps you sleep at night\nYou become what you despise\nA stereotype-type-type-type\nYou think you're so rock and roll\nBut you're really just a joke\nHad the world in the palm of your hands\nBut you fuckin' cho-o-o-oked\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nShould've been my teammate\nCould've changed your fate\nYou say that you love me\nYou won't remember in the morning\n\n[Chorus]\nYou fall asleep during foreplay\n'Cause the pills you take are more your fort\u00e9\nI'm not stickin' around to watch you go down\nWanna be your lover, not your fuckin' mother\nCan't be your savior, I don't have the power\nI'm not gonna stay and watch you circle the

what seems like a century\nAnd now I can barely breathe\n[Chorus]\nJust like a crow chasing the butterfly\nDandelions lost in the summer sky\nWhen you and I were gettin' high as outer space\nI never thought you'd slip away\nI guess I was just a little too late\n\n[Verse 3]\nYour words still serenade me\nYour lullabies won't let me sleep\nI've never heard such a haunting melody\nOh, it's killin'

go\nFrom the concrete who knew that a flower would grow\nLooking down from the top and it's crowded below\nMy fifteen minutes started an hour ago\nTruth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit\nWhen I hear 'em talking, I just don't know what to make of it\nHate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it\nDoesn't come natural, bear with me, it could take a bit\nYeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with\nBut you can see I'm pacing it so that I'm always chasing it\nWayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with\nI hope that my success never alters our relationship\nYeah, this life is something I would die for\nOctober's Own but it's looking like July 4\nI just wish they'd let you try it first\nThis time I'm really going off, fireworks\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\nOh, today it begins\nI've missed them before\nBut won't miss them again\nI keep having the same dream\nAnd I think that I just realized what it means\n\n[Chorus: Alicia Keys]\nAll I see is

2: Drake]\nI'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me\nLook at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery\nI could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd fuck with me\nWho could've predicted Lucky Strike would have you stuck with me\nDamn, I kept my wits about me luckily\nWhat happened between us that night?\nIt always seems to trouble me\nNow all of a sudden, these gossip rags want to cover me\nAnd you making it seem like it happened that way because of me\nBut I was curious\nAnd I'll never forget it, baby, what an experience\nYou could've been the one but it wasn't that serious\nThere was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it\nThat felt good, all in all, I learned a lesson from it though\nYou never see it coming, you just get to see it go\nYeah, I should've looked up in the sky at first\nNow I can see it in her eyes, fireworks\nSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\nOh, today it begins\nI've missed them

different\nMy dad called me up knowing that I still listen\nAnd he's still got his foot out, guilt tripping\nIt's been years though, I just learn to deal with it\nFor real, me and my realtor, we built up a better rapport\nGot my mother in a place with some better decor\nShe searched the entire city, I let her explore\nAnd now she's saying she more lonely than ever before\nHow many of our parents marriages lasted?\nI was only 5, I bet I barely reacted\nI'm flying back home for the Heritage Classic\nSearching for that feeling, tell me where is the magic\nLet's stay together 'til we're ghosts\nI want to witness love, I never seen it close\nYeah, but I guess I gotta find it first\nThat's why I'm really going off, fireworks\n[Pre-Chorus: Drake]\nOh, today it begins\nI've missed them before\nBut

these girls, I've heard the same conversations\nCab driver, cab driver, take me away\n'Cause I already know all the words that she'll say\nAnd I'll be creeping out the window at the first sight of

greaser in the jacket's gonna pick a fight\nAnd they'll probably kick my ass 'cause I'm drunk every night\nOfficer, officer, tell me the truth\nHow many times can I get in trouble with you\nBefore they lock me up for all the bad things that I do?\nBut you don't and that's why this feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\n\n[Chorus]\nI think I've been here before\nI think I've run into you\nI know the

the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey\nButane in my veins, so I'm out to get the junkie\nWith the plastic eyeballs, spraypaint the vegetables\nDog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose\n\n[FINN]\nKill the headlights and put it in neutral\nStockcar flaming with a loser in the cruise control\nBaby's in Reno with the vitamin D\nGot a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat\n[PUCK]\nSomeone came sayin' I'm insane\nTo complain about\nA shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt\n\n[FINN]\nDon't believe everything that you breathe\nYou got a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve\nSo shave your face with some mace in the dark\n\n[FINN & PUCK]\nSaving all your food stamps for burning down the trailer park\n\n[HOWARD]\nYo\n\n[FINN]\nCut it!\n\n[ALL]\nSoy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me\nSoy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me\n\n[PUCK]\nForces of evil on a bozo nightmare\nBan all the music with a phony gas chamber\nCause one's got a weasel and others got a flag\nOne's on the pole, shove the other in a bag\nWith the rerun shows and cocaine nose job\nThe daytime crap of the folk singers slop\nHe hung himself with a guitar string\nA slab of turkey neck and it's hangin' from a pigeon wing\nYou might also like[FINN]\nYa' can't write if ya' can't relate\nTrade the cash for the beef for the body for the hate\nAnd my time is a piece of wax, fallen on a termite\nWho's chokin' on the splinters?\n\n[ALL]\nSoy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby (Terri: I'm a loser baby) so why don't you kill me\n(Finn: Get crazy with the cheezwhiz)\nSoy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me (Finn: Drive, by, body pierce)\n\n[HOWARD]\nYo bring it on down\n\n[ALL]\nSoy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me\n\n[FINN]\nI'm a driver, I'm a winner things are gonna' change I can feel it\n\n[ALL]\nSoy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby (Terri: I'm a loser baby) so why don't you kill me\n(Why don't you kill me) (Puck: I can't believe you!)\nSoy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby so why don't you kill me\nSo why don't you kill me?\nSoy un perdedor, I'm a loser baby (Terri: I'm a loser baby) so

all clean\nMaybe there's a chance for me to go back\nNow that I have some direction\nIt sure would be nice to be back home\nWhere there's love and affection\n\nThen just maybe I can convince time to slow up\nGivin' me enough time in my life to grow up\nTime be my friend (Let me start again)\nLet me start again\n\nSuddenly, my world has gone and changed its face\nBut I still know where I'm going (Where I'm going)\nI have had my mind spun around in space\nYet I've watched it glowing\n\nOh, if you're listening, God, please don't make it hard\nTo know if we should believe in the things that we see\nTell us should we try and stay or should we run away (Should we stay)\nOr would it be better just to let things be\n\nLiving here in this brand new realm (Brand new realm)\nMight be a fantasy, ohh (Fantasy, ohh)\nBut it taught me to love\nSo it's real, real, real to me\n\nAnd I've learned we must look\nLook inside our hearts to find\nYeah, a world full of love (World full of love)\nLike yours, like mine (Like mine)\nYou might also like[APRIL with NEW DIRECTIONS]\nLike home!\nHome!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/208768", "artist_names": "Big Time

guess I'm, just here for the ride, I swear it\nFeels like I'm dreamin', it's vividly defined, yeah\nSo call me whatever you want, title me whatever you like\nBut let's get one thing straight, you know my name\nSo I run this town, when I'm on this mic, yeah\nSo here I go, B.o.B, Bobby Ray, I don't know, need I know\nBut I know, that I flow, rack 'em up, knock 'em down, dominoes\nThen I go, as my story goes\nI know I've done been down here before\nProduct of my East Decatur home\n'Cause I was in the cold, tryna keep my toes unfroze\nNow I'm in your house, now I'm in your soul\nNow I'm

is\n'Cause there ain't no parachute that they can make for this\n'Cause I put my pain, my heart, my soul, my faith in this\nDoes anyone feel like how I feel? Then you can relate to this\nOr just blaze to this, maybe roll one up, then take a hit\nToast to the good life then take a sip\nVacay everyday, yeah take a trip\nIt's easy to see I was made for this\nFrom the womb all the way to the grave I spit\nJust to show y'all niggas what greatness is, yeah\nI'm talkin' very lucid, like makin' movies\nTo picture my life boy, you need a higher resolution\nI used to cut class in the day, then run away at night\nBut now I'm ruler of the upper class and I don't even write\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWell, it was just a dream, just a moment ago\nI was up so high, lookin' down at the sky, don't let me fall\nI was shootin' for stars, on a Saturday night\nThey say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall\nDon't let me fall, don't let me fall\nThey say what goes up, must come down but don't let me fall\nDon't let me fall19Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/4429", "artist_names": "T-Pain", "full_title": "Reverse Cowgirl by\u00a0T-Pain", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a3c5af7503d342764dd0694e7c1c47b0.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a3c5af7503d342764dd0694e7c1c47b0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 4429, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 4191, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": null, "path": "/T-pain-reverse-cowgirl-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/T-pain-reverse-cowgirl-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2010, "month": 3, "day": 19}, "release_date_for_display": "March 19, 2010", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Mar. 19, 2010", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a3c5af7503d342764dd0694e7c1c47b0.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a3c5af7503d342764dd0694e7c1c47b0.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 8453}, "title": "Reverse Cowgirl", "title_with_featured": "Reverse Cowgirl", "updated_by_human_at": 1606515221, "url": "https://genius.com/T-pain-reverse-cowgirl-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/337", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5f2e9a0fce5f6eb6e7ab605d69e880ee.824x470x1.jpg", "id": 337, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6efed4f2f043ca2d708512a157481569.720x720x1.jpg", "index_character": "t", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": true, "name": "T-Pain", "slug": "T-pain", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/T-pain", "iq": 418}, "artist": "T-Pain", "lyrics": "Reverse Cowgirl Lyrics[Ad libs for first 32 seconds]\n\n[T-Pain]\nWelcome to my rodeo\nHold on, to meeeeee\nBaby I will take it slow\nHow you ride, is the keyyyyy\nYou're gonna go left, right, front, back -
