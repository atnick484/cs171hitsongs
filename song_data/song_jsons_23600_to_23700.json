Jayvin) Lyrics(KIRK)\nI'm done with shenanigans\nI get to the root of the problem\nPull up and I handle it\nWant it, I get it\nI\u2019m all about business\nI'm all about dead presidents\nDon't make me make you a candidate\nBitch, I don\u2019t blame you for panickin'\nWe gone stick you up like a mannequin\nWe gone frame you, then come up with evidence\nDone with shenanigans\n(Jayvin)\nOoh, you don't see what I see in my view\nI'm a fool, I can't think due to the weed that I use\nApe gettin' free, I got the keys to the zoo\nStick together, \u2018caus\u0435 the team, they see m\u0435 as the glue\nWe do art, people tell me to keep it bars\nWe will barge, that really means we charge like fees on a Visa card\nKill the beat then I beat its heart til there's no beat and it's a cappella and I gotta resuscitate and restart its heart with some CPR like \u201cStay with me!\u201d\nStay with me, they give me all the static but I take victories\nMake history, wait, spray semi automatic when they\u2019re facin\u2019 me, yeah\nPushin over daisies, squeeze and \u201cpow\u201d the heater now\nBunch of bubble blowin' babies, we know how to weed \u2018em out, yeah\n\n(KIRK)\nI\u2019m done with shenanigans\nI get to the root of the problem\nPull up and I handle it\nWant it, I get it\nI'm all about business\nI'm all about dead presidents\nDon't make me make you a candidate\nBitch, I don\u2019t blame you for panickin'\nWe gone stick you up like a mannequin\nWe gone frame you, then come up with evidence\nDone with shenanigans\nYou might also likeI come with passion when craftin a rhyme\nSo if you say that we matchin, you lyin\nEven if I gave you half of my skill, it's still just a fraction of mine\nI wish that I could just crack up inside\nAnd see in the back of your vapid lil mind\nWhile you was busy out climbing the capitol, I was just watching my capital climb\nI'm taking rap, you can't have it, it's mine\nI'm stating facts, bitch I'll slap you for trying\nShe told me she love me, I knew she was lying\nThat booty was crazy, that ass a nine\nI'll grip on it, then I pointed to my lap and told the bitch to sit on it, and she told me that she loves it when I spit-\n\n(Jayvin)\n-hypnotic lit phonics when I hit targets\nWanna collab and send me beats like \u201cJayvin gonna wanna spit on it\u201d\nWithout payin', like I'm gonna do that shit for free and just get on it\nLook at my ID, does that shit say \u201cLittle Fuckin' Bitch\u201d on it\nIn case you actually missed it\nWe're the best; it ain't a damn opinion\nThis shit's a fact, if a rapper disses\nThen I really get to thinkin' he masochistic\nIt's cataclysmic, not a rapper livin' on this planet spinnin' can spit it with me and not look wack with it\nExcept one...you ask who is it?\n\n(KIRK)\n-and I ain't even really one to brag, but when I spaz and I'm really gettin' in my bag, I'm gifted\nGat, gone lift it, any little rapper treatin' wack as a fashion, then ya ass gone get it\nHe don't even really think I'm packin\nI got a MAC, and a couple AKs that'll blast; I'm with it\nAnd my props are like gettin' caught lackin' at a jackin' or a snatchin'; you have to give it\nWhen I pull the pen, then you made your fate\nReally want beef, well I'll raise the stakes\nFuck with me, you'll get your name read wrong\nOn your mothafuckin headstone, that's a grave mistake\nI hold it down like a paperweight, you made to break like a fuckin paper plate\nOkay, you straight\nBut you lames ain't as great as\nKIRK, Khaos, Jayvin and Asa Jake\nSo you ain't as cold as me, may as well go to sleep\nReppin the Golden Fleece, they treat me like royalty, they get my loyalty\nYou just a lil boy to me without a toy to squeeze\nYou know you're weak\nSo you better hold your piece\nOr forever hold your peace\nI'm done with shenanigans\nI get to the root of the problem\nPull up and I handle it\nWant it, I get it\nI'm all about business\nI'm all about dead presidents\nDon't make me make you a candidate\nBitch, I don't blame you for panickin'\nWe gone stick you up like a mannequin\nWe gone frame you, then come up with evidence\nDone with shenanigansEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

secret she's a dirty whore\nWe fucked in the cooler, my ass was cold\n'Cause I laid on the floor as my dick she rode\n\nThree sister, Lola, Lea and Lana\nTwo was nineteen the other older than Madonna\nAll fine as hell, fuck 'em all I wanna\nThrew my dick in their faces like a Hurricanrana\n\nMike E. Clark, Legz Diamond too\nThey can vouch, these rhymes are true\nAll my homies have heard us brag\nThey know about the hoes we tag\n\nOur young homie Clay heard us rap\nAnd said he had way more freaks than that\nWe told 'em like this, they might be freakin'\nBut boy you never had ICP treatment1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/2172695", "artist_names": "Spose (Ft.

Lyrics[Verse 1: Spose]\nYou should see these Nike SB\u2019s that I copped online\nI turned the AC on then I wrote a hot rhyme\nThe girl who made my sneakers sobbin\u2019 all the time\nIndonesian sweatshop makin\u2019 pennies and she\u2019s nine\nI took a clean towel out the closet\nShowered half an hour took a sip up out the faucet\nA mother in Nigeria, I wouldn\u2019t wanna be ya\nNo clean water, so her daughter died of diarrhea\nI typed a post about my government, was critical\nAnd they didn\u2019t arrest me even though it sounded liberal\nIn Russia, punishment for that isn\u2019t reciprocal\nYou question \u2018bout the man, then your lifespan\u2019s minimal\nWhen I was six, my biggest worry if I can reminisce\nWas that I\u2019d have a Super Nintendo but not a Genesis\nSix year old in Rwanda blood what he\u2019s wearin\u2019\nThey cut his arm off when he wouldn\u2019t kill his parents\nI made babies out of wedlock\nI read Ladybug Girl then get stoned in the basement by the bedrock\nShe defied arranged marriage, her betrayed parents\nStoned her to death on the terrace with the cleric\nI took a bite of pizza told them, \u201cGive the chef my accolades\u201d\nI eat a couple slices then I threw the other half away\nA child stomach squealing, begging, he ain\u2019t eat in days\nHe collapsed with a thud, sounded like a 808\nI don\u2019t go to church or the mosque, or the synagogue\nIf there is a God, he isn\u2019t in my thoughts\nA Kurd didn\u2019t fit their definition of religion\nGot beheaded in front of his children who lay in prison\nI saw a tweet a girl wrote\nIt said, \u201cI hate school, I\u2019d rather skip it, party, take body shots, and break rules\u201d\nSchool girl got her body shot by the Taliban\nWomen die to be educated out in Pakistan\n[Hook: Renee Coolbrith]\nIf I know how it\u2019s goin\u2019 down\nWhy am I so happy now?\nI don\u2019t know\n\n[Verse 2: Spose]\nI just filmed a video with Bosch\nHe just bought a drone, flew over a soccer game, we looked at it, looked fuckin\u2019 dope\nIraqi kids playin\u2019 soccer live a humble home life\nMom screams as they got killed by a drone strike\nAlthough neither represent my section\nI voted the lesser of two evils in the last election\nSome countries only got one candidate\nQuestion them and you can pick which limb they\u2019re gonna amputate\nI got police protecting my township\nDial up the number, Crown Vic, come around quick\nIn Mexico, cops crooked east of Buena Vista\nJuan had to join the cartel just to protect his sister\nI love my daughter and the smile on her face\nI told her she gotta be thirty-five before she start to date\nSyrian girls abducted by the caliphate\nThey\u2019re fourteen, sold as sex slaves in the Islamic state\nI feel so alive bumpin\u2019 dead rappers\nLife could be like lice, it\u2019s a head scratcher\n\u201cWhy am I so happy?\u201d, I don\u2019t gotta answer that\n\u201cWhy are you so miserable?\u201d Is the question that I need to ask\nYou might also like[Hook: Renee Coolbrith]\nIf I know how it\u2019s goin\u2019 down\nWhy am I so happy now?\nI don\u2019t knowEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0,

Braddock to become the heavy-weight champion of the world. And all the Negroes in Lansing, like Negroes everywhere, went wildly happy with the greatest celebration of race pride our generation had ever known. Every Negro boy old enough to walk wanted to be the next Brown Bomber. My brother Philbert, who had already become a pretty good boxer in school, was no exception. (I was trying to play basketball. I was gangling and tall, but I wasn't very good at it -- too awkward.) In the fall of that year, Philbert entered the amateur bouts that were held in Lansing's Prudden Auditorium.\n\nHe did well, surviving the increasingly tough eliminations. I would go down to the gym and watch him train. It was very exciting. Perhaps without realizing it I became secretly envious; for one thing, I know I could not help seeing some of my younger brother Reginald's lifelong admiration for me getting siphoned off to Philbert.\nPeople praised Philbert as a natural boxer. I figured that since we belonged to the same family, maybe I would become one, too. So I put myself in the ring. I think I was thirteen when I signed up for my first bout, but my height and rawboned frame let me get away with claiming that I was sixteen, the minimum age -- and my weight of about 128 pounds got me classified as a bantamweight.\n\nThey matched me with a white boy, a novice like myself, named Bill Peterson. I'll never forget him. When our turn in the next amateur bouts came up, all of my brothers and sisters were there watching, along with just about everyone else I knew in town. They were there not so much because of me but because of Philbert, who had begun to build up a pretty good following, and they wanted to see how his brother would do.\n\nI walked down the aisle between the people thronging the rows of seats, and climbed in the ring. Bill Peterson and I were introduced, and then the referee called us together and mumbled all of that stuff about fighting fair and breaking clean. Then the bell rang and we came out of our corners. I knew I was scared, but I didn't know, as Bill Peterson told me later on, that he was scared of me, too. He was so scared I was going to hurt him that he knocked me down fifty times if he did once.\n\nHe did such a job on my reputation in the Negro neighborhood that I practically went into hiding. A Negro just can't be whipped by somebody white and return with his head up to the neighborhood, especially in those days, when sports and, to a lesser extent show business, were the only fields open to Negroes, and when the ring was the only place a Negro could whip a white man and not be lynched. When I did show my face again, the Negroes I knew rode me so badly I knew I had to do something.\nBut the worst of my humiliations was my younger brother Reginald's attitude: he simply never mentioned the fight. It was the way he looked at me -- and avoided looking at me. So I went back to the gym, and I trained -- hard. I beat bags and skipped rope and grunted and sweated all over the place. And finally I signed up to fight Bill Peterson again. This time, the bouts were held in his hometown of Alma, Michigan.\n\nThe only thing better about the rematch was that hardly anyone I knew was there to see it; I was particularly grateful for Reginald's absence. The moment the bell rang, I saw a fist, then the canvas coming up, and ten seconds later the referee was saying \"Ten!\" over me. It was probably the shortest \"fight\" in history. I lay there listening to the full count, but I couldn't move. To tell the truth, I'm not sure I wanted to move.\n\nThat white boy was the beginning and the end of my fight career. A lot of times in these later years since I became a Muslim, I've thought back to that fight and reflected that it was Allah's work to stop me: I might have wound up punchy.\n\nNot long after this, I came into a classroom with my hat on. I did it deliberately. The teacher, who was white, ordered me to keep the hat on, and to walk around and around the room until he told me to stop. \"That way,\" he said, \"everyone can see you. Meanwhile, we'll go on with class for those who are here to learn something.\"\n\nI was still walking around when he got up from his desk and turned to the blackboard to write something on it. Everyone in the classroom was looking when, at this moment, I passed behind his desk, snatched up a thumbtack and deposited it in his chair. When he turned to sit back down, I was far from the scene of the crime, circling around the rear of the room. Then he hit the tack, and I heard him holler and caught a glimpse of him spraddling up as I disappeared through the door.\n\nWith my deportment record, I wasn't really shocked when the decision came that I had been expelled.\n\nI guess I must have had some vague idea that if I didn't have to go to school, I'd be allowed to stay on with the Gohannases and wander around town, or maybe get a job if I wanted one for pocket money. But I got rocked on my heels when a state man whom I hadn't seen before came and got me at the Gohannases' and took me down to court.\n\nThey told me I was going to go to a reform school. I was still thirteen years old.\n\nBut first I was going to the detention home. It was in Mason, Michigan, about twelve miles from Lansing. The detention home was where all the \"bad\" boys and girls from Ingham County were held, on their way to reform school -- waiting for their hearings.\n\nThe white state man was a Mr. Maynard Allen. He was nicer to me than most of the state Welfare people had been. He even had consoling words for the Gohannases and Mrs. Adcock and Big Boy; all of them were crying. But I wasn't. With the few clothes I owned stuffed into a box, we rode in his car to Mason. He talked as he drove along, saying that my school marks showed that if I would just straighten up, I could make something of myself. He said that reform school had the wrong reputation; he talked about what the word \"reform\" meant -- to change and become better. He said the school was really a place where boys like me could have time to see their mistakes and start a new life and become somebody everyone would be proud of. And he told me that the lady in charge of the detention home, a Mrs. Swerlin, and her husband were very good people.\n\nThey were good people. Mrs. Swerlin was bigger than her husband, I remember, a big, buxom, robust, laughing woman, and Mr. Swerlin was thin, with black hair, and a black mustache and a red face, quiet and polite, even to me.\n\nThey liked me right away, too. Mrs. Swerlin showed me to my room, my own room -- the first in my life. It was in one of those huge dormitory-like buildings where kids in detention were kept in those days -- and still are in most places. I discovered next, with surprise, that I was allowed to eat with the Swerlins. It was the first time I'd eaten with white people -- at least with grown white people -- since the Seventh Day Adventist country meetings. It wasn't my own exclusive privilege, of course. Except for the very troublesome boys and girls at the detention home, who were kept locked up -- those who had run away and been caught and brought back, or something like that -- all of us ate with the Swerlins sitting at the head of the long tables.\n\nThey had a white cook-helper, I recall -- Lucille Lathrop. (It amazes me how these names come back, from a time I haven't thought about for more than twenty years.) Lucille treated me well, too. Her husband's name was Duane Lathrop. He worked somewhere else, but he stayed there at the detention home on the weekends with Lucille.\nI noticed again how white people smelled different from us, and how their food tasted different, not seasoned like Negro cooking. I began to sweep and mop and dust around in the Swerlins' house, as I had done with Big Boy at the Gohannases'.\n\nThey all liked my attitude, and it was out of their liking for me that I soon became accepted by them -- as a mascot, I know now. They would talk about anything and everything with me standing right there hearing them, the same way people would talk freely in front of a pet canary. They would even talk about me, or about \"niggers,\" as though I wasn't there, as if I wouldn't understand what the word meant. A hundred times a day, they used the word \"nigger.\" I suppose that in their own minds, they meant no harm; in fact they probably meant well. It was the same with the cook, Lucille, and her husband, Duane. I remember one day when Mr. Swerlin, as nice as he was, came in from Lansing, where he had been through the Negro section, and said to Mrs. Swerlin right in front of me, \"I just can't see how those niggers can be so happy and be so poor.\" He talked about how they lived in shacks, but had those big, shining cars out front.\nAnd Mrs. Swerlin said, me standing right there, \"Niggers are just that way. . . .\" That scene always stayed with me.\n\nIt was the same with the other white people, most of them local politicians, when they would come visiting the Swerlins. One of their favorite parlor topics was \"niggers.\" One of them was the judge who was in charge of me in Lansing. He was a close friend of the Swerlins. He would ask about me when he came, and they would call me in, and he would look me up and down, his expression approving, like he was examining a fine colt, or a pedigreed pup. I knew they must have told him how I acted and how I worked.\n\nWhat I am trying to say is that it just never dawned upon them that I could understand, that I wasn't a pet, but a human being. They didn't give me credit for having the same sensitivity, intellect, and understanding that they would have been ready and willing to recognize in a white boy in my position. But it has historically been the case with white people, in their regard for black people, that even though we might be with them, we weren't considered of them. Even though they appeared to have opened the door, it was still closed. Thus they never did really see me.\n\nThis is the sort of kindly condescension which I try to clarify today, to these integration-hungry Negroes, about their \"liberal\" white friends, these so-called \"good white people\" -- most of them anyway. I don't care how nice one is to you; the thing you must always remember is that almost never does he really see you as he sees himself, as he sees his own kind. He may stand with you through thin, but not thick; when the chips are down, you'll find that as fixed in him as his bone structure is his sometimes subconscious conviction that he's better than anybody black.\n\nBut I was no more than vaguely aware of anything like that in my detention-home years. I did my little chores around the house, and everything was fine. And each weekend, they didn't mind my catching a ride over to Lansing for the afternoon or evening. If I wasn't old enough, I sure was big enough by then, and nobody ever questioned my hanging out, even at night, in the streets of the Negro section.\n\nI was growing up to be even bigger than Wilfred and Philbert, who had begun to meet girls at the school dances, and other places, and introduced me to a few. But the ones who seemed to like me, I didn't go for -- and vice versa. I couldn't dance a lick, anyway, and I couldn't see squandering my few dimes on girls. So mostly I pleasured myself these Saturday nights by gawking around the Negro bars and restaurants. The jukeboxes were wailing Erskine Hawkins' \"Tuxedo Junction,\" Slim and Slam's \"Flatfoot Floogie,\" things like that. Sometimes, big bands from New York, out touring the one-night stands in the sticks, would play for big dances in Lansing. Everybody with legs would come out to see any performer who bore the magic name \"New York.\" Which is how I first heard Lucky Thompson and Milt Jackson, both of whom I later got to know well in Harlem.\n\nMany youngsters from the detention home, when their dates came up, went off to the reform school. But when mine came up -- two or three times -- it was always ignored. I saw new youngsters arrive and leave. I was glad and grateful. I knew it was Mrs. Swerlin's doing. I didn't want to leave.\n\nShe finally told me one day that I was going to be entered in Mason Junior High School. It was the only school in town. No ward of the detention home had ever gone to school there, at least while still a ward. So I entered their seventh grade. The only other Negroes there were some of the Lyons children, younger than I was, in the lower grades. The Lyonses and I, as it happened, were the town's only Negroes. They were, as Negroes, very much respected. Mr. Lyons was a smart, hardworking man, and Mrs. Lyons was a very good woman. She and my mother, I had heard my mother say, were two of the four West Indians in that whole section of Michigan.\n\nSome of the white kids at school, I found, were even friendlier than some of those in Lansing had been. Though some, including the teachers, called me \"nigger,\" it was easy to see that they didn't mean any more harm by it than the Swerlins. As the \"nigger\" of my class, I was in fact extremely popular -- I suppose partly because I was kind of a novelty. I was in demand, I had top priority. But I also benefited from the special prestige of having the seal of approval from that Very Important Woman about the town of Mason, Mrs. Swerlin. Nobody in Mason would have dreamed of getting on the wrong side of her. It became hard for me to get through a school day without someone after me to join this or head up that -- the debating society, the Junior High basketball team, or some other extracurricular activity. I never turned them down.\n\nAnd I hadn't been in the school long when Mrs. Swerlin, knowing I could use spending money of my own, got me a job after school washing the dishes in a local restaurant. My boss there was the father of a white classmate whom I spent a lot of time with. His family lived over the restaurant. It was fine working there. Every Friday night when I got paid, I'd feel at least ten feet tall. I forget how much I made, but it seemed like a lot. It was the first time I'd ever had any money to speak of, all my own, in my whole life. As soon as I could afford it, I bought a green suit and some shoes, and at school I'd buy treats for the others in my class -- at least as much as any of them did for me.\n\nEnglish and history were the subjects I liked most. My English teacher, I recall -- a Mr. Ostrowski -- was always giving advice about how to become something in life. The one thing I didn't like about history class was that the teacher, Mr. Williams, was a great one for \"nigger\" jokes. One day during my first week at school, I walked into the room and he started singing to the class, as a joke, \"'Way down yonder in the cotton field, some folks say that a nigger won't steal.\" Very funny. I liked history, but I never thereafter had much liking for Mr. Williams. Later, I remember, we came to the textbook section on Negro history. It was exactly one paragraph long. Mr. Williams laughed through it practically in a single breath, reading aloud how the Negroes had been slaves and then were freed, and how they were usually lazy and dumb and shiftless. He added, I remember, an anthropological footnote on his own, telling us between laughs how Negroes' feet were \"so big that when they walk, they don't leave tracks, they leave a hole in the ground.\"\n\nI'm sorry to say that the subject I most disliked was mathematics. I have thought about it. I think the reason was that mathematics leaves no room for argument. If you made a mistake, that was all there was to it.\nBasketball was a big thing in my life, though. I was on the team; we traveled to neighboring towns such as Howell and Charlotte, and wherever I showed my face, the audiences in the gymnasiums \"niggered\" and \"cooned\" me to death. Or called me \"Rastus.\" It didn't bother my teammates or my coach at all, and to tell the truth, it bothered me only vaguely. Mine was the same psychology that makes Negroes even today, though it bothers them down inside, keep letting the white man tell them how much \"progress\" they are making. They've heard it so much they've almost gotten brainwashed into believing it -- or at least accepting it.\n\nAfter the basketball games, there would usually be a school dance. Whenever our team walked into another school's gym for the dance, with me among them, I could feel the freeze. It would start to ease as they saw that I didn't try to mix, but stuck close to someone on our team, or kept to myself. I think I developed ways to do it without making it obvious. Even at our own school, I could sense it almost as a physical barrier, that despite all the beaming and smiling, the mascot wasn't supposed to dance with any of the white girls.\n\nIt was some kind of psychic message -- not just from them, but also from within myself. I am proud to be able to say that much for myself, at least. I would just stand around and smile and talk and drink punch and eat sandwiches, and then I would make some excuse and get away early.\n\nThey were typical small-town school dances. Sometimes a little white band from Lansing would be brought in to play. But most often, the music was a phonograph set up on a table, with the volume turned up high, and the records scratchy, blaring things like Glenn Miller's \"Moonlight Serenade\" -- his band was riding high then -- or the Ink Spots, who were also very popular, singing \"If I Didn't Care.\"\n\nI used to spend a lot of time thinking about a peculiar thing. Many of these Mason white boys, like the ones at the Lansing school -- especially if they knew me well, and if we hung out a lot together -- would get me off in a corner somewhere and push me to proposition certain white girls, sometimes their own sisters. They would tell me that they'd already had the girls themselves -- including their sisters -- or that they were trying to and couldn't. Later on, I came to understand what was going on: If they could get the girls into the position of having broken the terrible taboo by slipping off with me somewhere, they would have that hammer over the girls' heads, to make them give in to them.\n\nIt seemed that the white boys felt that I, being a Negro, just naturally knew more about \"romance,\" or sex, than they did -- that I instinctively knew more about what to do and say with their own girls. I never did tell anybody that I really went for some of the white girls, and some of them went for me, too. They let me know in many ways. But anytime we found ourselves in any close conversations or potentially intimate situations, always there would come up between us some kind of a wall. The girls I really wanted to have were a couple of Negro girls whom Wilfred or Philbert had introduced me to in Lansing. But with these girls, somehow, I lacked the nerve.\n\nFrom what I heard and saw on the Saturday nights I spent hanging around in the Negro district I knew that race-mixing went on in Lansing. But strangely enough, this didn't have any kind of effect on me. Every Negro in Lansing, I guess, knew how white men would drive along certain streets in the black neighborhoods and pick up Negro streetwalkers who patrolled the area. And, on the other hand, there was a bridge that separated the Negro and Polish neighborhoods, where white women would drive or walk across and pick up Negro men, who would hang around in certain places close to the bridge, waiting for them. Lansing's white women, even in those days, were famous for chasing Negro men. I didn't yet appreciate how most whites accord to the Negro this reputation for prodigious sexual prowess. There in Lansing, I never heard of any trouble about this mixing, from either side. I imagine that everyone simply took it for granted, as I did.\n\nAnyway, from my experience as a little boy at the Lansing school, I had become fairly adept at avoiding the white-girl issue -- at least for a couple of years yet.\nThen, in the second semester of the seventh grade, I was elected class president. It surprised me even more than other people. But I can see now why the class might have done it. My grades were among the highest in the school. I was unique in my class, like a pink poodle. And I was proud; I'm not going to say I wasn't. In fact, by then, I didn't really have much feeling about being a Negro, because I was trying so hard, in every way I could, to be white. Which is why I am spending much of my life today telling the American black man that he's wasting his time straining to \"integrate.\" I know from personal experience. I tried hard enough.\n\n\"Malcolm, we're just so proud of you!\" Mrs. Swerlin exclaimed when she heard about my election. It was all over the restaurant where I worked. Even the state man, Maynard Allen, who still dropped by to see me once in a while, had a word of praise. He said he never saw anybody prove better exactly what \"reform\" meant. I really liked him -- except for one thing: he now and then would drop something that hinted my mother had let us down somehow.\n\nFairly often, I would go and visit the Lyonses, and they acted as happy as though I was one of their children. And it was the same warm feeling when I went into Lansing to visit my brothers and sisters, and the Gohannases.\n\nI remember one thing that marred this time for me: the movie \"Gone with the Wind.\" When it played in Mason, I was the only Negro in the theater, and when Butterfly McQueen went into her act, I felt like crawling under the rug.\n\nEvery Saturday, just about, I would go into Lansing. I was going on fourteen, now. Wilfred and Hilda still lived out by themselves at the old family home. Hilda kept the house very clean. It was easier than my mother's plight, with eight of us always underfoot or running around. Wilfred worked wherever he could, and he still read every book he could get his hands on. Philbert was getting a reputation as one of the better amateur fighters in this part of the state; everyone really expected that he was going to become a professional.\n\nReginald and I, after my fighting fiasco, had finally gotten back on good terms. It made me feel great to visit him and Wesley over at Mrs. Williams'. I'd offhandedly give them each a couple of dollars to just stick in their pockets, to have something to spend. And little Yvonne and Robert were doing okay, too, over at the home of the West Indian lady, Mrs. McGuire. I'd give them about a quarter apiece; it made me feel good to see how they were coming along.\n\nNone of us talked much about our mother. And we never mentioned our father. I guess none of us knew what to say. We didn't want anybody else to mention our mother either, I think. From time to time, though, we would all go over to Kalamazoo to visit her. Most often we older ones went singly, for it was something you didn't want to have to experience with anyone else present, even your brother or sister.\n\nDuring this period, the visit to my mother that I most remember was toward the end of that seventh-grade year, when our father's grown daughter by his first marriage, Ella, came from Boston to visit us. Wilfred and Hilda had exchanged some letters with Ella, and I, at Hilda's suggestion, had written to her from the Swerlins'. We were all excited and happy when her letter told us that she was coming to Lansing.\n\nI think the major impact of Ella's arrival, at least upon me, was that she was the first really proud black woman I had ever seen in my life. She was plainly proud of her very dark skin. This was unheard of among Negroes in those days, especially in Lansing.\n\nI hadn't been sure just what day she would come. And then one afternoon I got home from school and there she was. She hugged me, stood me away, looked me up and down. A commanding woman, maybe even bigger than Mrs. Swerlin. Ella wasn't just black, but like our father, she was jet black. The way she sat, moved, talked, did everything, bespoke somebody who did and got exactly what she wanted. This was the woman my father had boasted of so often for having brought so many of their family out of Georgia to Boston. She owned some property, he would say, and she was \"in society.\" She had come North with nothing, and she had worked and saved and had invested in property that she built up in value, and then she started sending money to Georgia for another sister, brother, cousin, niece or nephew to come north to Boston. All that I had heard was reflected in Ella's appearance and bearing. I had never been so impressed with anybody. She was in her second marriage; her first husband had been a doctor.\n\nElla asked all kinds of questions about how I was doing; she had already heard from Wilfred and Hilda about my election as class president. She asked especially about my grades, and I ran and got my report cards. I was then one of the three highest in the class. Ella praised me. I asked her about her brother, Earl, and her sister, Mary. She had the exciting news that Earl was a singer with a band in Boston. He was singing under the name of Jimmy Carleton. Mary was also doing well.\n\nElla told me about other relatives from that branch of the family. A number of them I'd never heard of; she had helped them up from Georgia. They, in their turn, had helped up others. \"We Littles have to stick together,\" Ella said. It thrilled me to hear her say that, and even more, the way she said it. I had become a mascot; our branch of the family was split to pieces; I had just about forgotten about being a Little in any family sense. She said that different members of the family were working in good jobs, and some even had small businesses going. Most of them were homeowners.\n\nWhen Ella suggested that all of us Littles in Lansing accompany her on a visit to our mother, we all were grateful. We all felt that if anyone could do anything that could help our mother, that might help her get well and come back, it would be Ella. Anyway, all of us, for the first time together, went with Ella to Kalamazoo.\n\nOur mother was smiling when they brought her out. She was extremely surprised when she saw Ella. They made a striking contrast, the thin near-white woman and the big black one hugging each other. I don't remember much about the rest of the visit, except that there was a lot of talking, and Ella had everything in hand, and we left with all of us feeling better than we ever had about the circumstances. I know that for the first time, I felt as though I had visited with someone who had some kind of physical illness that had just lingered on.\n\nA few days later, after visiting the homes where each of us were staying, Ella left Lansing and returned to Boston. But before leaving, she told me to write to her regularly. And she had suggested that I might like to spend my summer holiday visiting her in Boston. I jumped at that chance.\n2.\n\nThat summer of 1940, in Lansing, I caught the Greyhound bus for Boston with my cardboard suitcase, and wearing my green suit. If someone had hung a sign, \"HICK,\" around my neck, I couldn't have looked much more obvious. They didn't have the turnpikes then; the bus stopped at what seemed every corner and cowpatch. From my seat in -- you guessed it -- the back of the bus, I gawked out of the window at white man's America rolling past for what seemed a month, but must have been only a day and a half.\n\nWhen we finally arrived, Ella met me at the terminal and took me home. The house was on Waumbeck Street in the Sugar Hill section of Roxbury, the Harlem of Boston. I met Ella's second husband, Frank, who was now a soldier; and her brother Earl, the singer who called himself Jimmy Carleton; and Mary, who was very different from her older sister. It's funny how I seemed to think of Mary as Ella's sister, instead of her being, just as Ella is, my own half-sister. It's probably because Ella and I always were much closer as basic types; we're dominant people, and Mary has always been mild and quiet, almost shy.\n\nElla was busily involved in dozens of things. She belonged to I don't know how many different clubs; she was a leading light of local so-called \"black society.\" I saw and met a hundred black people there whose big-city talk and ways left my mouth hanging open.\n\nI couldn't have feigned indifference if I had tried to. People talked casually about Chicago, Detroit, New York. I didn't know the world contained as many Negroes as I saw thronging downtown Roxbury at night, especially on Saturdays. Neon lights, nightclubs, poolhalls, bars, the cars they drove! Restaurants made the streets smell -- rich, greasy, down-home black cooking! Jukeboxes blared Erskine Hawkins, Duke Ellington, Cootie Williams, dozens of others. If somebody had told me then that some day I'd know them all personally, I'd have found it hard to believe. The biggest bands, like these, played at the Roseland State Ballroom, on Boston's Massachusetts Avenue -- one night for Negroes, the next night for whites.\n\nI saw for the first time occasional black-white couples strolling around arm in arm. And on Sundays, when Ella, Mary, or somebody took me to church, I saw churches for black people such as I had never seen. They were many times finer than the white church I had attended back in Mason, Michigan. There, the white people just sat and worshiped with words; but the Boston Negroes, like all other Negroes I had ever seen at church, threw their souls and bodies wholly into worship.\n\nTwo or three times, I wrote letters to Wilfred intended for everybody back in Lansing. I said I'd try to describe it when I got back.\n\nBut I found I couldn't.\n\nMy restlessness with Mason -- and for the first time in my life a restlessness with being around white people -- began as soon as I got back home and entered eighth grade.\n\nI continued to think constantly about all that I had seen in Boston, and about the way I had felt there. I know now that it was the sense of being a real part of a mass of my own kind, for the first time.\n\nThe white people -- classmates, the Swerlins, the people at the restaurant where I worked -- noticed the change. They said, \"You're acting so strange. You don't seem like yourself, Malcolm. What's the matter?\"\n\nI kept close to the top of the class, though. The topmost scholastic standing, I remember, kept shifting between me, a girl named Audrey Slaugh, and a boy named Jimmy Cotton.\n\nIt went on that way, as I became increasingly restless and disturbed through the first semester. And then one day, just about when those of us who had passed were\nabout to move up to 8-A, from which we would enter high school the next year, something happened which was to become the first major turning point of my life.\n\nSomehow, I happened to be alone in the classroom with Mr. Ostrowski, my English teacher. He was a tall, rather reddish white man and he had a thick mustache. I had gotten some of my best marks under him, and he had always made me feel that he liked me. He was, as I have mentioned, a natural-born \"advisor,\" about what you ought to read, to do, or think -- about any and everything. We used to make unkind jokes about him: why was he teaching in Mason instead of somewhere else, getting\nfor himself some of the \"success in life\" that he kept telling us how to get?\n\nI know that he probably meant well in what he happened to advise me that day. I doubt that he meant any harm. It was just in his nature as an American white man. I was one of his top students, one of the school's top students -- but all he could see for me was the kind of future \"in your place\" that almost all white people see for black people.\n\nHe told me, \"Malcolm, you ought to be thinking about a career. Have you been giving it thought?\"\n\nThe truth is, I hadn't. I never have figured out why I told him, \"Well, yes, sir, I've been thinking I'd like to be a lawyer.\" Lansing certainly had no Negro lawyers -- or doctors either -- in those days, to hold up an image I might have aspired to. All I really knew for certain was that a lawyer didn't wash dishes, as I was doing.\n\nMr. Ostrowski looked surprised, I remember, and leaned back in his chair and clasped his hands behind his head. He kind of half-smiled and said, \"Malcolm, one of life's first needs is for us to be realistic. Don't misunderstand me, now. We all here like you, you know that. But you've got to be realistic about being a nigger. A lawyer -- that's no realistic goal for a nigger. You need to think about something you can be. You're good with your hands -- making things. Everybody admires your carpentry shop work. Why don't you plan on carpentry? People like you as a person -- you'd get all kinds of work.\"\n\nThe more I thought afterwards about what he said, the more uneasy it made me. It just kept treading around in my mind.\n\nWhat made it really begin to disturb me was Mr. Ostrowski's advice to others in my class -- all of them white. Most of them had told him they were planning to become farmers. But those who wanted to strike out on their own, to try something new, he had encouraged. Some, mostly girls, wanted to be teachers. A few wanted other professions, such as one boy who wanted to become a county agent; another, a veterinarian; and one girl wanted to be a nurse. They all reported that Mr. Ostrowski had encouraged what they had wanted. Yet nearly none of them had earned marks equal to mine.\n\nIt was a surprising thing that I had never thought of it that way before, but I realized that whatever I wasn't, I was smarter than nearly all of those white kids. But apparently I was still not intelligent enough, in their eyes, to become whatever I wanted to be.\n\nIt was then that I began to change -- inside.\n\nI drew away from white people. I came to class, and I answered when called upon. It became a physical strain simply to sit in Mr. Ostrowski's class.\n\nWhere \"nigger\" had slipped off my back before, wherever I heard it now, I stopped and looked at whoever said it. And they looked surprised that I did.\n\nI quit hearing so much \"nigger\" and \"What's wrong?\" -- which was the way I wanted it. Nobody, including the teachers, could decide what had come over me. I knew I was being discussed.\n\nIn a few more weeks, it was that way, too, at the restaurant where I worked washing dishes, and at the Swerlins'.\n\n3.\n\nOne day soon after, Mrs. Swerlin called me into the living room, and there was the state man, Maynard Allen. I knew from their faces that something was about to happen. She told me that none of them could understand why -- after I had done so well in school, and on my job, and living with them, and after everyone in Mason had come to like me -- I had lately begun to make them all feel that I wasn't happy there anymore.\n\nShe said she felt there was no need for me to stay at the detention home any longer, and that arrangements had been made for me to go and live with the Lyons family, who liked me so much.\n\nShe stood up and put out her hand. \"I guess I've asked you a hundred times, Malcolm -- do you want to tell me what's wrong?\"\nI shook her hand, and said, \"Nothing, Mrs. Swerlin.\" Then I went and got my things, and came back down. At the livingroom door I saw her wiping her eyes. I felt very bad. I thanked her and went out in front to Mr. Allen, who took me over to the Lyons'.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Lyons, and their children, during the two months I lived with them -- while finishing eighth grade -- also tried to get me to tell them what was wrong. But somehow I couldn't tell them, either.\n\nI went every Saturday to see my brothers and sisters in Lansing, and almost every other day I wrote to Ella in Boston. Not saying why, I told Ella that I wanted to come there and live.\n\nI don't know how she did it, but she arranged for official custody of me to be transferred from Michigan to Massachusetts, and the very week I finished the eighth grade, I again boarded the Greyhound bus for Boston.\n\nI've thought about that time a lot since then. No physical move in my life has been more pivotal or profound in its repercussions.\n\nIf I had stayed on in Michigan, I would probably have married one of those Negro girls I knew and liked in Lansing. I might have become one of those state capitol building shoeshine boys, or a Lansing Country Club waiter, or gotten one of the other menial jobs which, in those days, among Lansing Negroes, would have been considered \"successful\" -- or even become a carpenter.\n\nWhatever I have done since then, I have driven myself to become a success at it. I've often thought that if Mr. Ostrowski had encouraged me to become a lawyer, I would today probably be among some city's professional black bourgeoisie, sipping cocktails and palming myself off as a community spokesman for and leader of the suffering black masses, while my primary concern would be to grab a few more crumbs from the groaning board of the two-faced whites with whom they're begging to \"integrate.\"\n\nAll praise is due to Allah that I went to Boston when I did. If I hadn't, I'd probably still be a brainwashed black Christian.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/494663", "artist_names": "Rolling Stone", "full_title": "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time by\u00a0Rolling\u00a0Stone", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0fd143311476d3460782b97407cd8f47.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0fd143311476d3460782b97407cd8f47.500x500x1.png", "id": 494663, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 21564, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1499623656, "path": "/Rolling-stone-the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-annotated", "pyongs_count": 13, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Rolling-stone-the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2004, "month": 12, "day": 9}, "release_date_for_display": "December 9, 2004", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Dec. 9, 2004", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0fd143311476d3460782b97407cd8f47.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/0fd143311476d3460782b97407cd8f47.500x500x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 90395}, "title": "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time", "title_with_featured": "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time", "updated_by_human_at": 1585102754, "url": "https://genius.com/Rolling-stone-the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/69844", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/92dadbe1d0913a5ff55f8993ab6a3255.1000x525x1.jpg", "id": 69844, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e12ea098c2bbe9d5a0f48615c30519d4.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Rolling Stone", "slug": "Rolling-stone", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Rolling-stone"}, "artist": "Rolling Stone", "lyrics": "The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time Lyrics1.

As a lion, in the African\nbush, severely hurt by huntsmen with a wound to the chest,\nonly then rouses himself to battle, tosses his shaggy mane\nover his neck, in joy, and, unafraid, snaps off the spear\nsome poacher has planted in him, roaring from blood-stained jaws:\nso the violence grew in Turnus\u2019s inflamed heart.\nThen he spoke to the king, beginning turbulently like this:\n\u2018There\u2019s no reluctance here, in Turnus: there\u2019s no reason\nfor Aeneas\u2019s coward crew to take back their words\nor renounce their pact: I go to meet him. Carry out\nthe holy rite, father, and draw up the marriage contract.\nI\u2019ll either send this Trojan, this Asian deserter,\nto Tartarus, (let the Latins sit and watch) and\nwith my sword, alone, dispel the nation\u2019s shame,\nor let him possess the defeated, let Lavinia go then as his bride.\u2019\nLatinus replied to him with calm in his heart:\n\u2018O youth of noble spirit, the more you excel\nin fierce courage, the more it is right for me to take\ncareful thought, and weigh every event with caution.\nYou have your father Daunus\u2019s kingdom, you have\nthe many fortresses you captured by force,\nand Latinus is not short of gold and generosity:\nthere are other unmarried girls, not ignoble in birth,\nin the fields of Latium and Laurentium. Allow me to say this,\nun-gently, openly stripped of all guile, and take it to heart:\nit was forbidden for me to ally my daughter to any\nof her former suitors, and all gods and men decreed it.\nConquered by love for you, conquered by kinship, and the tears\nof a sorrowful wife, I broke all bounds: I snatched the betrothed\ngirl from my son-in-law to be, and drew the impious sword.\nYou see, Turnus, what events, what war dogs me,\nwhat a heavy burden you above all bear.\nDefeated in two great battles we can hardly preserve\nthe hopes of Italy in our city: Tiber\u2019s streams are yet warm\nwith our blood, the vast plains whitened by our bones.\nWhy did I waver so often? What madness changed my decision?\nIf I\u2019d be ready to accept the Trojans as allies with Turnus\ndead, why not rather end the conflict while he\u2019s alive?\nWhat would your Rutulian kin say, and the rest of Italy,\nif I betrayed you to death (let chance deny those words!)\nwhile seeking my daughter in marriage?\nConsider the fortunes of war: pity your aged father,\nwhom his native Ardea keeps apart from us, sorrowing.\u2019\nTurnus\u2019s fury was unaffected by these words:\nit mounted higher, inflamed by the treatment.\nAs soon as he was able to speak, he began like this:\n\u2018Most gracious one, that concern you feel for me, I beg you,\nfor me, set it aside, and allow me to barter death for glory.\nI too can scatter spears and no lack of steel, from my hand,\nfather, and blood flows from the wounds I make as well.\nHis goddess mother will be far from him, she who covers\nhis flight with mist, like a woman, and hides in empty shadows.\u2019\nBkXII:54-80 He Proposes Single Combat\n\nBut the queen wept, terrified by the new terms of conflict,\nand clung to her ardent son, as if she were dying:\n\u2018Turnus, one thing I beg of you, by these tears, by any respect\nfor Amata that touches your heart: you are my only hope,\nthe peace of my sad old age, the honour and power of Latinus\nis in your hands, our whole tottering house rests on you:\ndo not engage in combat with the Trojans.\nWhatever danger awaits you in that battle awaits me too,\nTurnus: I would leave this hateful light with you\nand will never, as a prisoner, see Aeneas as my son-in-law.\u2019\nLavinia listened to her mother\u2019s words, her burning\ncheeks wet with tears, while a deep blush kindled\ntheir fire, and spread over her glowing face.\nHer virgin looks showed such colour as when one\nstains Indian ivory with crimson dye, or as\nwhite lilies redden when mixed with many a rose.\nLove stirred Turnus, and he fixed his gaze on the girl:\nfired still more for battle, he spoke briefly to Amata:\n\u2018O mother, I beg you not to send me off with tears,\nor like ill omens, as I leave for the battles of a bitter war:\nTurnus is not free to delay his hour of death.\nIdmon, as a messenger, carry my unwelcome words\nto the Trojan leader. When tomorrow\u2019s Dawn, riding\nher crimson chariot, reddens in the sky, do not lead\nTrojans against Rutulians, let Trojan and Rutulian\nweapons rest: let us resolve this war with our own blood,\non that field let Lavinia be sought as bride.\u2019\nBkXII:81-112 He Prepares For Battle\n\nWhen he had spoken, and returned quickly to the palace, he called\nfor his horses, and delighted in seeing them, neighing before him,\nhorses Orithyia herself gave Pilumnus, as a glory,\nsurpassing the snow in whiteness, and the wind for speed.\nTheir charioteers stood around eagerly patting their echoing chests,\nwith the flat of their hands, and combing their flowing manes.\nTurnus drew a breastplate, stiff with gold and pale bronze,\nover his shoulders, fitted his sword and shield in position,\nand the horns with their crimson crest: the god with the power\nof fire had wrought the sword for his father, Daunus,\nand dipped it, glowing, in the waters of the Styx.\nThen Turnus gripped his strong spear firmly, that stood\nleaning on a great column in the middle of the hall,\na spoil won from the Auruncan, Actor, shook it till it quivered\nand shouted: \u2018Now, o spear that never failed my call,\nnow the time has come: Actor, the mightiest, carried you,\nand now the right hand of Turnus: allow me to lay low\nthe body of that Phrygian eunuch, tear off and shatter\nhis breastplate with my powerful hand, and defile his hair\nwith dust, that\u2019s curled with a heated iron, and drowned in myrrh.\u2019\nHe was driven by frenzy, glowing sparks shot\nfrom his whole aspect, fire flashed from his fierce eyes,\nlike a bull, before a fight, that starts its formidable\nbellowing and, trying its anger with its horns,\ncharges a tree-trunk, lashes the air with its blows,\nand scatters the sand, as it practises for the battle.\nMeanwhile Aeneas, no less fierce, armed with the weapons,\nhis mother\u2019s gift, sharpened himself for conflict, and roused\nhis anger, happy the war might be settled by the means on offer.\nThen he comforted his friends, and Iulus\u2019s anxious fears,\nspeaking of destiny, and ordered them to take a firm reply\nto King Latinus, and declare his conditions for peace.\nBkXII:113-160 Juno Speaks to Juturna\n\nThe next dawn had scarcely begun to sprinkle the mountain\nsummits with its rays, at that time when the horses of the sun\nfirst rise from the deep ocean, and breathe light from lifted nostrils:\nthe Rutulians and Trojans had measured out the field\nof combat, under the massive walls of the city,\nand were preparing hearths and turf altars for their mutual gods.\nOthers wearing priest\u2019s aprons, their foreheads wreathed\nwith vervain, brought spring water and fiery embers.\nThe Ausonian army marched out, and their ranks, armed\nwith spears, poured through the crowded gates. All the host\nof Trojans and Tuscans streamed out on the other side, arrayed\nin their various armour, equipped with steel, as if the bitter conflict\nof war called out to them. And the captains too, among their many\nthousands, darted about, brilliant in gold and purple,\nMnestheus of Assaracus\u2019s line, brave Asilas,\nand Messapus, tamer of horses, son of Neptune.\nAs soon as each had retired to their own ground, at the given signal,\nthey planted their spears in the earth, and leant their shields on them.\nThen women, and weak old men, and the unarmed crowd,\npoured out eagerly, and gathered on towers\nand rooftops, or stood on the summit of the gates.\nBut Juno, gazed at the plain, looking from the top of a hill\n(called Alban now, then without name, honour or glory)\nat the twin ranks of Laurentum and Troy, and Latinus\u2019s city.\nImmediately, goddess to goddess, she spoke to Turnus\u2019s sister,\nwho ruled over lakes and echoing rivers (Jupiter, the king\nof high heaven, gave her that honour for stealing her virginity):\n\u2018Nymph, glory of rivers, dearest of all to my heart,\nyou know how I\u2019ve preferred you alone of all the Latin girls\nwho\u2019ve mounted unwelcome to the couch of great-hearted Jove,\nand I have freely granted you a place in a part of the sky:\nlest you blame me, Juturna, learn of impending grief.\nWhenever Fortune allowed, and the Fates permitted\nthe Latin state to prosper, I protected Turnus and your city.\nNow I see a warrior meeting with an unequal destiny,\nand a day of Fate and inimical force draws near.\nI cannot look at this combat, they agreed to, with my eyes.\nIf you dare do anything more for your brother in person,\ngo on: it\u2019s fitting. Perhaps better things will follow for the wretched.\u2019\nShe had scarcely spoken, when Juturna\u2019s eyes flowed with tears,\nand her hand struck her lovely breast three or four times.\n\u2018This is not the moment for tears,\u2019 said Saturnian Juno:\n\u2018Run, and, if there\u2019s a way, snatch your brother from death:\nor stir conflict and shatter the treaty they\u2019ve made.\nI teach you daring.\u2019 Having urged her thus, she left her\nuncertain and troubled, sadly hurt at heart.\n\nBkXII:161-215 Aeneas and Latinus Sacrifice\n\nMeanwhile the kings drove out: Latinus in a four-horsed chariot\nof massive size (twelve golden rays circling his shining brow,\nemblems of his ancestor, the Sun), Turnus behind a snow-white\nteam, brandishing two spears with broad steel blades in his hand.\nOn the other side, Aeneas, the leader, ancestor of the Roman race,\ncame from the camp, ablaze with starry shield and heavenly\narmour, Ascanius with him, Rome\u2019s second great hope,\nwhile a priest in pure robes brought the offspring\nof a bristly boar, and also an unshorn two-year sheep,\nand tethered the animals next to the blazing altars.\nThe heroes turned their gaze towards the rising sun, sprinkled\nsalt meal with their hands, marked the victims\u2019 foreheads\nwith a knife, and poured libations from cups onto the altars.\nThen pious Aeneas, with sword drawn, prayed like this:\n\u2018Sun, be my witness, and this country that I call on,\nfor which I have been able to endure such labours,\nand the all-powerful Father, and you Juno, his wife,\n(now goddess, now, be kinder, I pray) and you, glorious Mars,\nyou, father, who control all warfare with your will:\nI call on founts and rivers, on all the holiness\nof high heaven, and the powers in the blue ocean:\nif by chance Victory falls to Turnus of Italy,\nit is agreed the defeated will withdraw to Evander\u2019s city,\nIulus will leave the land, and the people of Aeneas will never\nbring renewed war in battle, or attack this realm with the sword.\nBut if victory agrees that our contest is mine (as I think\nmore likely, and may the gods by their will prove it so),\nI will not command the Italians to submit to Trojans nor do I\nseek a kingdom for myself: let both nations, undefeated,\nput in place an eternal treaty. I will permit your gods\nand their rites: Latinus my father-in-law will keep his weapons,\nmy father-in-law will keep his accustomed power: the Trojans\nwill build walls for me, and Lavinia will give her name to a city.\nSo Aeneas was first to speak, then Latinus followed him, thus,\nraising his eyes to heaven, and stretching his right hand to the sky:\n\u2018I also swear, Aeneas, by the same earth, sea, and sky,\nby Latona\u2019s twin offspring, and by two-faced Janus,\nby the power of the gods below, and the shrines of cruel Dis:\nmay the Father, who ratifies treaties with his lightning, hear me.\nI touch the altar: I call as witness the gods, and the flames\nbetween us, no day shall break this peace or truce on Italy\u2019s side,\nhowever things may fall out: nor will any power\ndeflect my will, not if it plunges the earth, drowned\nin flood, into the waves, and dissolves heaven in hell,\njust as this sceptre (since he chanced to hold the sceptre in his hand)\nhewn, once and for all, from the lowest stem in the woods,\nhaving lost its parent trunk, and shedding its leaves and twigs\nto the knife, will never, now the craftsman\u2019s hand has sheathed it\nin fine bronze, and given it to the elders of Latium\nto carry, extend shoots or shade from light foliage.\u2019\nThey sealed the treaty between them with these words\nin full view of the leaders. Then with due rite they slaughtered\nthe sacrificial beasts over the flames, tore out the entrails,\nwhile they were alive, and piled the alters with heaped dishes.\n\nBkXII:216-265 The Rutulians Break The Treaty\n\nBut the duel had for a long time seemed unfair to the Rutulians,\nand their hearts were torn by varied emotions, more so\nwhen they saw the combatants\u2019 unequal strength near to.\nTurnus added to the unrest, in advancing with silent tread\nand venerating the altar humbly, with downcast eyes,\nand by his wasted cheeks and the pallor of his youthful body.\nAs soon as his sister, Juturna, was aware that talk was spreading\nand the minds of the multitude were wavering in doubt,\nshe entered the heart of the army, in the guise of Camers,\nwhose birth was of noble ancestry, his father\u2019s name\nfamous for virtue, and he himself of the bravest in arms,\nshe entered the heart of the army, not ignorant of her task,\nsowing various rumours and speaking as follows:\n\u2018O Rutulians, aren\u2019t you ashamed to sacrifice one life\non behalf of so many of you ? Aren\u2019t we their equals\nin numbers and might? See, all the Trojans and Arcadians\nare here, and the Etrurian band led by fate, and hostile to Turnus:\nif every other man attacks, there\u2019s barely an opponent for each of them.\nTurnus will climb in glory to the gods, at whose altars\nhe has dedicated his life, and live borne on men\u2019s lips:\nbut we will be forced to submit to proud masters,\nour country lost, we who now sit inactive in the field.\u2019\nThe will of the young men was roused by these words,\nmore and more so, and a murmur spread through the ranks:\neven the Laurentines and the Latins changed their minds.\nThose who had lately hoped for rest from battle, and a safe existence,\nnow longed for weapons, prayed for the treaty to be broken,\nand pitied Turnus\u2019s unjust fate. Juturna added another greater spur,\nshowing a sign in the depths of the sky, none more significant\nto disturb Italian minds, and charm them by the wonder of it.\nJove\u2019s tawny eagle, flying through reddened air,\nstirred the shore-birds, with noisy confusion\nin their winged ranks, when suddenly diving to the water\nhe seized the most outstanding swan cruelly in his curved talons.\nThe Italians paid attention, and (amazing to see)\nall the birds wheeled, clamouring, in flight and, in a cloud,\ndrove their enemy through the air, darkening the sky\nwith their wings, until, defeated by force and the weight,\nthe bird gave way, and, dropping the prey\nfrom his talons into the river, fled deep into the clouds.\nThen the Rutulians truly hailed this omen with a shout\nand spread wide their hands, and Tolumnius the augur was first\nto cry out: \u2018This, this was what my prayers have often sought.\nI understand it, and recognise the gods: snatch up the sword\nwith me, with me at your head, o unhappy race, fragile birds,\nwhom a cruel foreigner terrifies with war, ravaging\nyour coast with violence. He will take flight and sail\nfar away over the deep. Close ranks, together, and defend\nthe king who has been snatched from you, in battle.\n\nBkXII:266-310 Renewed Fighting\n\nHe spoke, and running forward hurled his spear\nat the enemy: the hissing cornel shaft sang, and cut unerringly\nthrough the air, At one with this, at one, was a mighty shout\nthe army all in uproar, and hearts hot with the turmoil.\nThe spear flew on, to where, by chance, nine handsome brothers\nstood in its path, all of whom one faithful\nTuscan wife had borne to Arcadian Gylippus,\nIt struck one of them, a youth of great beauty, in shining armour,\nat the waist, where a stitched belt rubbed against\nhis stomach, and the buckle bit into the overlapping ends,\npierced his ribs, and hurled him to the yellow sand.\nBut his spirited band of brothers, fired by grief,\ndrew their swords or snatched their iron spears,\nand rushed forward blindly. The Laurentine ranks\ncharged them: Trojans and Agyllines and Arcadians\nin decorated armour, poured in from the other side:\nso all had one longing, to let the sword decide.\nThey stripped the altars, there was a fierce storm\nof spears in the whole sky, and a steely rain fell:\nwine-bowls and hearthstones were carried off:\nLatinus himself fled, taking his defeated gods,\nthe treaty void. Others harnessed their chariots or leapt\non their horses, and waited with drawn swords.\nMessapus, keen to destroy the truce, charging on his horse,\nscared off Auletes, an Etruscan king with a king\u2019s emblems:\nthe unfortunate man, as he backed away, entangled, fell,\nhead and shoulders, on to the altar behind him: and Messapus\nflew at him furiously, spear in hand, and from his horse\u2019s height\nstruck mightily at him with the massive weapon,\nas Auletes begged piteously, and spoke like this, over him:\n\u2018He\u2019s done for: this nobler victim is given to the great gods.\u2019\nThe Italians crowded round and stripped the warm body.\nAgainst them, Corynaeus snatched a charred brand\nfrom an altar, and aiming a blow at the charging Ebyso\ndashed flames in his face: his great beard flared\nand gave off a smell of burning. Corynaeus following through\nhis blow, clutched the hair of his stunned enemy in his left hand\nand brought him to earth with a thrust of his bent knee:\nthen stabbed him in the side with his straight sword.\nPodalirius, towered over the shepherd Alsus, pursuing him\nwith naked steel as he ran through the shower of spears\nin the front rank: but Alsus swung his axe back,\nand sliced through the front of his enemy\u2019s brow and chin,\ndrenching his armour with widely spouting blood.\nHarsh repose and iron slumber pressed on his eyes\nand their light was sunk in everlasting night.\n\nBkXII:311-382 Aeneas Wounded: Turnus Rampant\n\nBut virtuous Aeneas his head bared, unarmed, stretched out\nhis right hand, and called loudly to his troops:\n\u2018Where are you running to? Why this sudden tide of discord?\nO, control your anger! The agreement has already been struck,\nand its terms fixed. I alone have the right to fight:\nLet me do so: banish your fears. I\u2019ll prove the treaty sound\nwith this right hand: these rites mean Turnus is already mine.\u2019\nAmidst these cries and words, see, a hissing arrow\nwinged its way towards him, launched by what hand,\nsent whirling by whom, was unknown, as was the chance\nor god that brought the Rutulians such honour:\nthe glorious pride in it was kept concealed,\nand no one boasted of wounding Aeneas.\nAs soon as Turnus saw Aeneas leave the ranks, his captains\nin confusion, he blazed with the fervour of sudden hope:\nhe called for weapons and horses as one, leapt proudly\ninto his chariot, and gripped the reins in his hands.\nHe gave many a brave man death in his swift passage.\nMany he overturned half-alive, crushed the ranks under his chariot,\nor seizing his spears showered them on those fleeing.\nJust as when blood-drenched Mars is roused, and clashes\nhis shield, by the icy streams of Hebrus and, inciting war,\ngives rein to his frenzied horses, so that they fly over the open plain\noutrunning the south and west winds, and farthest Thrace groans\nto the beat of their hooves, while around him the forms of black\nTerror, Anger and Treachery, speed, the companions of the god:\nwith the same swiftness Turnus lashed his horses,\nsmoking with sweat, through the midst of the conflict,\ntrampling on enemies piteously slain, while the galloping hooves\nsplashed bloody dew, and trampled the gore mixed with sand.\nNext he gave Sthenelus to death, Thamyrus, and Pholus, the latter\nclose to, the former at a distance, from a distance too\nboth sons of Imbrasas, Glaucus and Laudes, whom Imbrasus\nhimself had raised in Lycia, and equipped with matching armour,\nto fight hand to hand, or outstrip the wind on horseback.\nElsewhere Eumedes rode through the midst of the battle,\nfamous in warfare, the son of aged Dolon,\nrecalling the grandfather in name, his father in courage\nand skill, he who, in going as a spy that time to the Greek camp,\ndared to ask for Achilles\u2019s chariot as his reward:\nbut Diomedes paid him a different reward for his daring\nand he no longer aspired to Achilles\u2019s team.\nWhen Turnus saw Eumedes, far over the open plain, he first\nsent a light javelin after him across the long space between,\nthen halted his paired horses, leapt from his chariot,\nonto the half-dead, fallen man, and, planting his foot on his neck,\ntore the sword from his hand, and bloodied the bright blade\ndeep in his throat, adding these words as well:\n\u2018See the fields, that Western Land, you sought in war:\nlie there and measure it: this is the prize for those\nwho dare to cross swords with me, thus they build their walls.\u2019\nThen with a cast of his spear he sent Asbytes to keep him company,\nChloreus and Sybaris, Dares and Thersilochus, and Thymoetes\nwho was flung from the neck of his rearing horse.\nAs when the blast of the Edonian northerly sounds\nover the Aegean deep, and drives the breakers to shore,\nwhile brooding gusts in the sky put the clouds to flight,\nso, wherever Turnus cut a path, the lines gave way,\nand the ranks turned and ran: his own speed carried him on,\nand, as the chariot met it, the wind tossed his flowing plume.\nPhegeus could not endure his attack or his spirited war-cry:\nhe threw himself at the chariot and with his right hand wrenched\nthe heads of the swift horses aside, as they foamed at the bit.\nWhile he was dragged along, hanging from the yoke,\nTurnus\u2019s broad-headed lance reached for his exposed flank,\ntore open the double-stranded mail where it entered,\nand grazed the surface of the flesh in a wound.\nPhegeus still turned towards his enemy, his shield raised,\nand was trying to protect himself with his drawn sword,\nwhen the wheel and the onrush of the spinning axle\nsent him headlong, throwing him to the ground, and Turnus,\nfollowing through, struck off his head with a sweep of his blade\nbetween the rim of the helmet and the chain-mail\u2019s\nupper edge, and left the body lying on the sand.\n\nBkXII:383-467 Venus Heals Aeneas\n\nWhile Turnus was victoriously dealing death over the plain,\nMnestheus and loyal Achates, with Ascanius\nby their side, set Aeneas down inside the camp,\nbleeding, supporting alternate steps with his long spear.\nhe struggled furiously to pull out the head of the broken\nshaft, and called for the quickest means of assistance:\nto cut open the wound with a broadsword, lay open\nthe arrow-tip\u2019s buried depths, and send him back to war.\nNow Iapyx, Iasus\u2019s son, approached, dearest of all to Apollo,\nto whom the god himself, struck by deep love, long ago\noffered with delight his own arts, his own gifts,\nhis powers of prophecy, his lyre, and swift arrows.\nBut Iapyx, in order to delay the fate of his dying father,\nchose knowledge of the virtues of herbs, and the use\nof medicine, and, without fame, to practise the silent arts.\nAeneas stood leaning on his great spear, complaining bitterly,\namongst a vast crowd of soldiers, with Iulus sorrowing,\nhimself unmoved by the tears. The aged Iapyx, his robe rolled back\nin Paeonian fashion, tried hard in vain with healing fingers\nand Apollo\u2019s powerful herbs: he worked at the arrow uselessly\nwith his hand, and tugged at the metal with tightened pincers.\nNo luck guided his course, nor did Apollo his patron help,\nwhile cruel terror grew greater and greater over the plain,\nand evil drew near. Now they saw the sky standing on\ncolumns of dust: the horsemen neared and arrows fell\nthickly in the midst of the camp. A dismal cry rose to heaven\nof men fighting and falling under Mars\u2019s harsh hand.\nAt this Aeneas\u2019s mother, Venus, shaken by her son\u2019s\ncruel pain, culled a dittany plant from Cretan Ida,\nwith downy leaves and purple flowers: a herb\nnot unknown to the wild goats when winged\narrows have fixed themselves in their sides.\nThis Venus brought, her face veiled in dark mist,\nthis, with its hidden curative powers, she steeped\nin river water, poured into a glittering basin, and sprinkled\nthere healing ambrosial juice and fragrant panacea.\nAged Iapyx bathed the wound with this liquid,\nnot knowing its effect, and indeed all pain fled\nfrom Aeneas\u2019s body, all the flow of blood ceased deep\nin the wound. Now, without force, the arrowhead\nslipped from the wound, following the motion of his hand,\nand fresh strength returned to Aeneas, such as before.\nIapyx cried: \u2018Quickly, bring our hero weapons. Why are you\nstanding there?\u2019  and was first to excite their courage against\nthe enemy. \u2018Aeneas, this cure does not come by human aid,\nnor guiding art, it is not my hand that saved you: a god,\na greater one, worked this, and sends you out again to glorious deeds.\u2019\nAeneas, eager for battle, had sheathed his legs in gold,\nleft and right, and scornful of delay, brandished his spear.\nAs soon as his shield was fixed at his side, the chain mail\nto his back, he clasped Ascanius in his armed embrace,\nand, kissing his lips lightly through the helmet, said:\n\u2018My son, learn courage from me and true labour:\ngood fortune from others. Now my hand will protect you\nin war, and lead you to great rewards. Make sure later,\nwhen your years have reached maturity, that you remember:\nlet your father Aeneas, and your uncle Hector\ninspire your soul, by recalling their example.\u2019\nWhen he spoken these words, he rushed out through the gate,\nin all his strength, brandishing a great spear in his hand:\nAntheus and Mnestheus with him, and their massed ranks, and all\nthe army streamed from the camp. Then the plain was a chaos\nof blinding dust, and the quaking earth shook under the tramp of feet.\nTurnus saw them advance, from the rampart opposite:\nthe Ausonians saw, and a cold tremor ran to the marrow\nof their bones: Juturna was the first of all the Latins\nto hear and recognise the sound, and she fled in fear.\nAeneas flew ahead, racing his dark ranks over the open plain,\nAs when the weather breaks and a storm cloud moves towards\nland, over the deep ocean (ah, the hearts of wretched farmers\nknow if from far off, and shudder: it brings ruin to trees,\nand havoc to harvests, everything far and wide is destroyed),\nthe gales run before it and carry their roar to the shore:\nso the Trojan leader drove his ranks against the foe,\nthickly they all gathered to him in dense columns.\nThymbreus struck mighty Osiris with his sword,\nMnestheus killed Arcetius: Achates killed Epulo,\nGyas killed Ufens: even Tolumnius the augur fell,\nfirst to hurl his spear straight at the enemy.\nA shout rose to heaven, and in turn the routed Rutulians\nturned their backs in a cloud of dust, fleeing over the field.\nAeneas himself did not deign to send the fugitives to their death,\nnor did he attack the foot-soldiers, cavalry or those hurling\nmissiles: he tracked only Turnus, searching through\nthe dense gloom, Turnus alone he summoned to combat.\n\nBkXII:468-499 Juturna Foils Aeneas\n\nJuturna, the warrior maiden, her mind stricken with fear,\nknocked Turnus\u2019s charioteer, Metiscus, from the reins, at this,\nso that he slipped from the beam, and left him far behind:\nshe herself took his place, and guided the flowing reins\nwith her hands, assuming Meniscus\u2019s voice, form, weapons, all.\nAs when a dark swallow flies through the great house\nof some rich lord, winging her way through lofty halls\ngathering tiny crumbs and scraps of food for her noisy young,\nnow twittering in the empty courtyards, now by the damp ponds:\nso Juturna was drawn by the horses through the enemy centre\nand, flying in her swift chariot, criss-crossed the whole plain,\nnow here, now there, she gives evidence of her triumphant brother,\nnot allowing him close combat, flying far away.\nNevertheless Aeneas traversed her winding course to meet him,\ntracking him, calling him loudly among the ranks.\nAs often as he set eyes on his enemy, and tried to match\nthe flight of the swift horses in his course, as often\nJuturna turned and wheeled the chariot.\nAh, what to do? Vainly he fluctuated on the shifting tide,\nand diverse concerns called his thoughts away.\nMessapus, who happened to be carrying two strong spears\ntipped with steel, advanced lightly towards him,\nlevelled one, and hurled it with unerring aim.\nAeneas stopped, and gathered himself behind his shield\nsinking on one knee: the swift spear still took off the tip\nof his helmet, and knocked the plumes from the crest.\nThen his anger truly surged, and incited by all this treachery,\nseeing his enemy\u2019s chariot and horses driven far off,\ncalling loudly on Jove, and the altars of the broken treaty,\nas witness, he plunged at last into the fray,\nand, aided by Mars, he awoke dreadful, savage,\nindiscriminate slaughter, and gave full rein to his wrath.\n\nBkXII:500-553 Aeneas And Turnus Amongst The Slaughter\n\nWhat god can now relate for me such bitter things as these,\nwho can tell of such varied slaughter, the deaths of generals,\nwhom Turnus now, and now the Trojan hero, drove in turn\nover the field? Jupiter was it your will that races who would live\ntogether in everlasting peace should meet in so great a conflict?\nAeneas meeting Rutulian Sucro (in the first battle\nthat brought the Trojan attack to a halt) quickly struck him\nin the side, and drove the cruel steel through the ribs\nthat protect the heart, where death come fastest.\nTurnus threw Amycus from his horse, and Diores his brother,\nattacking them on foot, striking one with the long lance\nas he advanced, the other with his sword, then hanging both\ntheir severed heads from his chariot carried them away\ndripping with blood. Aeneas sent Talos and Tanais\nand brave Cethegus to death, three in one attack,\nand sad Onites of Theban name, whose mother was Peridia:\nTurnus killed the brothers sent from Lycia, Apollo\u2019s fields,\nand Menoetes of Arcadia, who had hated war, but in vain:\nhis humble home and his living were round Lerna\u2019s\nfish-filled streams, never knowing the patronage\nof the great, and his father farmed rented land.\nLike fires set burning from opposite sides of a dry forest\ninto the thickets of crackling laurel, or foaming rivers\nfalling swiftly from the mountain heights, roaring\nand racing seawards, each leaving its path of destruction,\nso Aeneas and Turnus with no less fury swept through the battle:\nnow anger surged within: now their hearts which knew no defeat\nwere bursting: now with all their strength they set out to do harm.\nAs he boasted of his fathers, and the antiquity of his ancestors\u2019\nnames, and all his race traced back through Latin kings,\nAeneas sent Murranus headlong with a stone, a great whirling rock,\nand hurled him to the ground: beneath the reins and yoke,\nthe wheels churned him round, and the horses\u2019 hooves,\nforgetful of their master, trampled him under with many a blow.\nTurnus met Hyllus as he charged, roaring with boundless pride,\nand hurled a spear at his gilded forehead: piercing\nthe helmet the weapon lodged in his brain. Cretheus,\nbravest of Greeks, your right hand did not save you\nfrom Turnus, nor did the gods hide Cupencus when Aeneas\ncame: he set his chest against the weapon\u2019s track,\nand the bronze shield\u2019s resistance profited the wretch nothing.\nThe Laurentine field saw you fall also, Aeolus,\non your back, sprawled wide on the ground.\nYou fell, whom the Greek battalions could not lay low, nor Achilles\nwho overturned Priam\u2019s kingdom: here was the boundary\nof death for you: your noble house was below Mount Ida,\nthat noble house at Lyrnesus, your grave in Laurentine soil.\nAll the lines turned towards battle, the whole of the Latins,\nthe whole of the Trojans, Mnestheus and fierce Serestus,\nMessapus, tamer of horses, and brave Asilas,\nthe Tuscan phalanx, Evander\u2019s Arcadian squadron,\neach for himself, men straining with all their strength:\nno respite and no rest: exerting themselves in one vast conflict.\n\nBkXII:554-592 Aeneas Attacks The City\n\nNow his loveliest of mothers set in his mind the idea\nof moving against the walls, and turning his army on the city,\nswiftly, to confound the Latins with sudden ruin.\nWhile he tracked Turnus here and there through the ranks\nand swept his glance this way and that, he could see\nthe city, free of fierce warfare and peacefully unharmed.\nSuddenly an image of a more ambitious act of war inflamed him:\nhe called the generals Mnestheus, Sergestus and brave Serestus,\nand positioned himself on a hillock, where the rest of the Trojan army\ngathered round in a mass, without dropping their shields or spears.\nStanding amongst them on the high mound he cried:\n\u2018Let nothing impede my orders, Jupiter is with us, and let\nno one be slower to advance because this attempt is so sudden.\nToday I will overthrow that city, a cause of war, Latinus\u2019s\ncapital itself, and lay its smoking roofs level with the ground,\nunless they agree to accept our rule, and submit, in defeat.\nDo you think I can wait until Turnus can face battle with me,\nand chooses to meet with me again, though defeated before?\nO citizens, this man is the fountainhead and source of this wicked war.\nQuickly, bring burning brands, and re-establish the treaty, with fire.\u2019\nHe spoke, and all his troops adopted wedge-formation, hearts\nequal in emulation, and advanced in a dense mass towards the walls:\nin a flash, scaling ladders and sudden flames appeared.\nSome ran to the gates and cut down the leading defenders,\nothers hurled steel, and darkened the sky with missiles.\nAeneas himself, among the leaders, raised his hand, at the foot\nof the wall, accused Latinus in a loud voice, and called the gods\nto witness that he was being forced into battle again,\nthat the Italians were doubly enemies, another treaty was broken.\nDissension rose among the fearful citizens: some commanded\nthe city be opened, and the gates be thrown wide\nto the Trojans, and they dragged the king himself to the ramparts:\nothers brought weapons and hurried to defend the walls,\nas when a shepherd, who\u2019s tracked a swarm to its lair\nconcealed in the rock, fills it with acrid smoke:\nthe bees inside, anxious for safety, rush round\ntheir wax fortress, and sharpen their anger in loud buzzing:\nthe reeking darkness rolls through their hive, the rocks\necho within to a blind humming, and fumes reach the clear air.\n\nBkXII:593-613 Queen Amata\u2019s Suicide\n\nNow further misfortune befell the weary Latins,\nand shook the whole city to its foundations with grief.\nWhen Queen Amata, from the palace, saw the enemy\napproaching, the walls assaulted, flames mounting to the roofs,\nbut no opposing Rutulian lines, nor Turnus\u2019s army,\nthe unhappy queen thought Turnus had been killed\nin combat, and, her mind distraught, in sudden anguish,\nshe cried out that she was the cause, the guilty one, the source\nof evil, and uttering many wild words in the frenzy\nof grief, wanting to die, she tore her purple robes,\nand fastened a hideous noose of death to a high beam.\nAs soon as the wretched Latin women knew of the disaster,\nfirst her daughter Lavinia fell into a frenzy, tearing at her golden\ntresses and rosy cheeks with her hands, then all the crowd\naround her: the wide halls echoed to their lamentations.\nFrom there the unhappy rumour spread throughout the city:\nSpirits sank: Latinus went about with rent clothing,\nstunned by his wife\u2019s fate and his city\u2019s ruin,\nfouling his white hair with clouds of vile dust,\nreproaching himself again and again for not having freely\nreceived Trojan Aeneas, and adopted him as his son-in-law.\n\nBkXII:614-696 Turnus Hears Of Amata\u2019s Death\n\nMeanwhile Turnus, fighting at the edge of the plain,\nwas pursuing the stragglers now, more slowly,\nand rejoicing less and less in his horses\u2019 advance.\nThe breeze bore a clamour to him mingled\nwith an unknown dread, and the cheerless sounds\nof a city in chaos met his straining ears.\n\u2018Ah, what is this great grief that shakes the walls?\nWhat is this clamour that rises from the distant city?\u2019\nSo he spoke, anxiously grasping the reins and halting.\nAt this his sister, controlling chariot, horses and reins\ndisguised in the shape of his charioteer, Metiscus,\ncountered with these words: \u2018Turnus, this way, let us chase\nthe sons of Troy, where victory forges the way ahead:\nthere are others with hands to defend our homes.\nAeneas is attacking the Italians, and stirring conflict:\nlet our hands too deal cruel death to the Trojans.\nYou will not leave the field inferior in battle honours\nor the number you have killed\u2019 Turnus replied to this:\n\u2018O sister, I recognised you long ago, when you first\nwrecked the truce with your guile, and dedicated yourself to warfare,\nand now too you hide your divinity in vain. But who desired\nyou to be sent down from Olympus to suffer such labours?\nWas it so you might see your unlucky brother\u2019s death?\nWhat can I do? What chance can offer me life?\nI saw Murranus fall, before my very eyes, calling out\nto me, loudly, no one more dear to me than him remains,\na mighty man, and overwhelmed by a mighty wound.\nUnfortunate Ufens fell, so he might not witness our shame:\nthe Trojans captured his body and his armour.\nShall I endure the razing of our homes (the one thing left)\nand not deny Drances\u2019s words with my sword?\nShall I turn my back, and this country see Turnus run?\nIs it indeed so terrible to die? Oh be good to me, you Shades\nbelow, since the gods above have turned their faces from me.\nI will descend to you, a virtuous soul, innocent\nof blame, never unworthy of my great ancestors.\u2019\nHe had barely spoken when Saces sped by, carried on a foaming\nhorse through the thick of the enemy, wounded full in the face\nby an arrow, and calling to Turnus by name as he rushed on:\n\u2018Turnus, in you our last hope lies, pity your people.\nAeneas is explosive in arms, and threatens to throw down\nItaly\u2019s highest citadel and deliver it to destruction, even now\nburning brands fly towards the roofs. The Latins turn their faces\nto you, their eyes are on you: King Latinus mutters to himself,\nwavering as to whom to call his sons, towards what alliance to lean.\nMoreover the queen, most loyal to you, has fallen\nby her own hand, and fled, in horror of the light.\nMessapus and brave Atinas, alone in front of the gates\nsustain our lines. Around them dense squadrons stand\non every side, a harvest of steel that bristles with naked swords,\nwhile you drive your chariot over the empty turf.\u2019\nStunned and amazed by this vision of multiple disaster,\nTurnus stood silently gazing: fierce shame surged\nin that solitary heart, and madness mingled with grief,\nlove stung to frenzy, consciousness of virtue.\nAs soon as the shadows dispersed, and light returned to his mind,\nhe turned his gaze, with blazing eyes, towards the walls,\nand looked back on the mighty city from his chariot.\nSee, now, a spiralling crest of flame fastened\non a tower, and rolled skyward through the stories,\na tower he had built himself with jointed beams,\nset on wheels, and equipped with high walkways.\nHe spoke: \u2018Now, sister, now fate triumphs: no more delays:\nwhere god and cruel fortune calls, let me follow.\nI\u2019m determined on meeting Aeneas, determined to suffer\ndeath, however bitter: you\u2019ll no longer see me ashamed, sister.\nI beg you let me rage before I am maddened.\u2019\nAnd, leaping swiftly from his chariot to the ground,\nhe ran through enemy spears, deserting his grieving sister,\nand burst, in his quick passage, through the ranks.\nAs when a rock torn from the mountaintop by a storm\nhurtles downward, washed free by a tempest of rain\nor loosened in time by the passage of the years,\nand the wilful mass plunges down the slope in a mighty rush\nand leaps over the ground, rolling trees, herds and men\nwith it: so Turnus ran to the city walls through the broken ranks,\nwhere the soil was most drenched with blood, and the air\nshrill with spears, signalled with his hand and began shouting aloud:\n\u2018Rutulians stop now, and you Latins hold back your spears.\nWhatever fate is here, is mine: it is better that I alone\nmake reparation for the truce and decide it with the sword.\u2019\nAll drew back, and left a space in their midst.\n\nBkXII:697-765 The Final Duel Begins\n\nNow Aeneas the leader hearing the name of Turnus\nleft the walls, and left the high fortress,\ncast aside all delay, broke off from every task,\nand exultant with delight clashed his weapons fiercely:\nvast as Mount Athos, or Mount Eryx, or vast as old Apennine\nhimself when he roars through the glittering holm-oaks\nand joys in lifting his snowy summit to heaven.\nNow all truly turned their eyes, stripping the armour\nfrom their shoulders, Rutulians, Trojans and Italians,\nthose who held the high ramparts and those whose ram\nbattered at the walls beneath. Latinus himself was amazed\nat these mighty men, born at opposite ends of the world,\nmeeting and deciding the outcome with their swords.\nAs soon as the field was clear on the open plain,\nthey both dashed quickly forward, hurling their spears first\nfrom a distance, rushing, with shield and ringing bronze,\nto battle. The earth groaned: they redoubled their intense\nsword-strokes, chance and skill mingled together.\nAnd as when two bulls charge head to head in mortal battle,\non mighty Sila or on Taburnus\u2019s heights, and in terror\ntheir keepers retreat, the whole herd stand silent with fear,\nand the heifers wait, mute, to see who will be\nlord of the forest, whom all the herds will follow,\nas they deal wounds to each other with immense force,\ngore with butting horns, and bathe neck and shoulders\nin streaming blood, while all the wood echoes to their bellowing:\nso Trojan Aeneas and the Daunian hero, Turnus,\nclashed their shields, and the mighty crash filled the sky.\nJupiter himself held up two evenly balanced scales\nbefore him, and placed in them the diverse fates of the two,\nto see whom the effort doomed, with whose weight death sank down.\nTurnus leapt forward thinking himself safe, rose to the full height\nof his body with uplifted sword, and struck: the Trojans\nand the anxious Latins cried out, both armies were roused.\nBut the treacherous blade snapped, and would have left the eager\nwarrior defenceless in mid-stroke, if immediate flight\nhad not saved him. He ran swifter than the east wind,\nwhen he saw that strange hilt in his exposed right hand.\nThe tale is that in headlong haste, when he first mounted\nbehind his yoked team for battle, he left his father\u2019s sword\nbehind, and snatched up the blade of his charioteer, Metiscus:\nand that served him for a long while as the straggling Trojans\nturned their backs, but the mortal blade flew apart\nlike brittle ice at the stroke, on meeting Vulcan\u2019s\ndivine armour: and the fragments gleamed on the yellow sand.\nSo Turnus ran madly this way and that over the plain, winding\naimless circles here and there: on all sides the Trojans\nimprisoned him in their crowded ring, and a vast marsh\npenned him on one side, on the other the steep ramparts.\nAenaeas, no less, though his knees, slowed at times\nby the arrow wound, failed him and denied him speed,\npursued and pressed his anxious enemy hotly, foot to foot:\nas when a hound in the hunt presses on a stag, chasing\nand barking, one found trapped by the river or hedged in\nby fear of the crimson feathers: the stag, terrified\nby the snares and the high banks, flies backwards and forwards\na thousand ways, but the eager Umbrian clings close\nwith gaping mouth, almost has him, and snaps his jaws\nas though he holds him, baffled and biting empty air:\nThen a clamour breaks out indeed, the pools and banks\naround echo, and the whole sky rings with the tumult.\nAs he fled Turnus chided the Rutulians, calling on each\nby name and calling out for his own familiar sword.\nAeneas in turn threatened death and immediate destruction\nif any one approached, and terrified his trembling enemies\nthreatening to raze the city, and pressing on though wounded.\nThey completed five circuits, and unwound as many,\nthis way and that: since they sought for no paltry prize\nat the games, but vied for Turnus\u2019s life blood.\n\nBkXII:766-790 The Goddesses Intervene\n\nBy chance this was the place where a bitter-leaved\nwild olive, sacred to Faunus, had stood, a tree revered\nby sailors of old, where, when saved from the sea, they used\nto hang their gifts to the Laurentine god, and the votive garments:\nbut the Trojans had removed the sacred trunk, allowing\nof no exceptions, in order to fight on open ground.\nHere stood Aeneas\u2019s spear, its impetus had carried it there,\nfixed and held fast by the tough roots. The Trojan halted,\nintending to pluck out the steel with his hand,\nand pursue the man he couldn\u2019t catch by running,\nwith his javelin. Then Turnus mad with anxiety indeed cried:\n\u2018Faunus, pity me, I pray, and you, most gracious Earth\nif I have every honoured your rites that the sons of Aeneas\nhave instead defiled by war, retain the steel.\u2019\nHe spoke, and did not invoke the power of heaven in vain,\nsince Aeneas could not prise open the wood\u2019s grip,\nby any show of strength, though he wrestled long and lingered\nover the strong stump. While he tugged and strained fiercely, Juturna,\nthe Daunian goddess, changing again to the shape of Metiscus,\nthe charioteer, ran forward and restored his sword to her brother.\nBut Venus, enraged that this was allowed the audacious nymph,\napproached, and plucked the javelin from the deep root.\nRefreshed with weapons and courage, one relying on his sword,\nthe other towering fiercely with his spear, both breathing hard,\nthey stood, tall, face to face, in martial conflict.\n\nBkXII:791-842 Jupiter And Juno Decide The Future\n\nThe king of almighty Olympus meanwhile was speaking\nto Juno, as she gazed at the fighting from a golden cloud:\n\u2018Wife, what will the end be now? What will be left in the end?\nYou know yourself, and confess you know, that Aeneas,\nis destined for heaven as the nation\u2019s god: the Fates raise him to the stars.\nWhat are you planning? What hope do you cling to in the cold clouds?\nWas it right that this god be defiled by a mortal\u2019s wound?\nOr that the lost sword (for what could Juturna achieve without you?)\nbe restored to Turnus, the defeated gaining new strength?\nNow cease, at last, and give way to my entreaties,\nlest such sadness consume you in silence, and your bitter\nwoes stream back to me often from your sweet lips.\nIt has reached its end. You have had the power to drive\nthe Trojans over land and sea, to stir up evil war,\nto mar a house, and mix marriage with grief:\nI forbid you to attempt more.\u2019 So Jupiter spoke:\nso, with humble look, the Saturnian goddess replied:\n\u2018Great Jupiter, truly, it was because I knew it was your wish\nthat I parted reluctantly from Turnus and the Earth:\nor you would not see me alone now, on my celestial perch,\nenduring the just and the unjust, but I\u2019d be standing, wreathed in flame,\nin the battle line itself, and drawing the Trojans into deadly combat.\nI counselled Juturna (I confess) to help her unfortunate brother\nand approved greater acts of daring for the sake of his life,\nyet not for her to contend with the arrow or the bow:\nI swear it by the implacable fountainhead of Styx,\nthat alone is held in awe by the gods above.\nAnd now I yield, yes, and leave the fighting I loathe.\nYet I beg this of you, for Latium\u2019s sake, for the majesty\nof your own kin: since it is not prohibited by any law of fate:\nwhen they soon make peace with happy nuptials (so be it)\nwhen they join together soon in laws and treaties,\ndon\u2019t order the native Latins to change their ancient name,\nto become Trojans or be called Teucrians,\nor change their language, or alter their clothing.\nLet Latium still exist, let there be Alban kings through the ages,\nlet there be Roman offspring strong in Italian virtue:\nTroy has fallen, let her stay fallen, along with her name.\u2019\nSmiling at her, the creator of men and things replied:\n\u2018You are a true sister of Jove, another child of Saturn,\nsuch waves of anger surge within your heart.\nCome, truly, calm this passion that was needlessly roused:\nI grant what you wish, and I relent, willingly defeated.\nAusonia\u2019s sons will keep their father\u2019s speech and manners,\nas their name is, so it will be: the Trojans shall sink, merged\ninto the mass, only. I will add sacred laws and rites,\nand make them all Latins of one tongue.\nFrom them a race will rise, merged with Ausonian blood,\nthat you will see surpass men and gods in virtue,\nno nation will celebrate your rites with as much devotion.\u2019\nJuno agreed it, and joyfully altered her purpose:\nthen left her cloud, and departed from the sky.\n\nBkXII:843-886 Jupiter Sends Juturna A Sign\n\nThis done the Father turns something else over in his mind\nand prepares to take Juturna from her brother\u2019s side.\nMen speak of twin plagues, named the Dread Ones,\nwhom Night bore untimely, in one birth with Tartarean Megaera,\nwreathing them equally in snaky coils, and adding wings swift\nas the wind. They wait by Jove\u2019s throne on the fierce king\u2019s\nthreshold, and sharpen the fears of weak mortals\nwhenever the king of the gods sends plagues\nand death\u2019s horrors, or terrifies guilty cities with war.\nJupiter sent one of them quickly down from heaven\u2019s heights\nand ordered her to meet with Juturna as a sign:\nshe flew, and darted to earth in a swift whirlwind.\nLike an arrow loosed from the string, through the clouds,\nthat a Parthian, a Parthian or a Cydonian, fired,\nhissing, and leaping unseen through the swift shadows,\na shaft beyond all cure, armed with cruel poison\u2019s venom:\nso sped the daughter of Night, seeking the earth.\nAs soon as she saw the Trojan ranks and Turnus\u2019s troops,\nshe changed her shape, suddenly shrinking to the form of that\nsmall bird that perching at night on tombs or deserted rooftops,\noften sings her troubling song so late among the shadows \u2013\nand the fiend flew screeching to and fro in front\nof Turnus\u2019s face, and beat at his shield with her wings.\nA strange numbness loosed his limbs in dread,\nhis hair stood up in terror, and his voice clung to his throat.\nBut when his wretched sister Juturna recognised the Dread One\u2019s\nwhirring wings in the distance, she tore at her loosened hair, marring\nher face with her nails, and her breasts with her clenched hands:\n\u2018What help can your sister give you now, Turnus?\nWhat is left for me who have suffered so? With what art\ncan I prolong your life? Can I stand against such a portent?\nNow at last I leave the ranks. Bird of ill-omen, do not you\nterrify me who already am afraid: I know your wing-beats\nand their fatal sound, and I do not mistake the proud command\nof great-hearted Jupiter. Is this his reward for my virginity?\nWhy did he grant me eternal life? Why is the mortal condition\ntaken from me? Then, at least, I could end such pain\nand go through the shadows at my poor brother\u2019s side!\nAn immortal, I? Can anything be sweet to me without you\nmy brother? Oh what earth can gape deep enough for me,\nto send a goddess down to the deepest Shades?\u2019\nSo saying she veiled her head in a grey mantle, and the goddess,\nwith many a cry of grief, plunged into the river\u2019s depths.\n\nBkXII:887-952 The Death Of Turnus\n\nAeneas pressed on, brandishing his great spear like a tree,\nand, angered at heart, he cried out in this way:\n\u2018Why now yet more delay? Why do you still retreat, Turnus?\nWe must compete hand to hand with fierce weapons, not by running.\nChange into every form: summon up all your powers\nof mind and art, wing your way if you wish\nto the high stars, or hide in earth\u2019s hollow prison.\u2019\nTurnus shook his head: \u2018Fierce man, your fiery words\ndon\u2019t frighten me: the gods terrify me and Jupiter\u2019s enmity.\u2019\nSaying no more he looked round seeing a great rock,\na vast ancient stone, that happened to lie there in the plain,\nset up as a boundary marker, to distinguish fields in dispute.\nTwelve picked men, men of such form as Earth\nnow produces, could scarcely have lifted it on their shoulders,\nbut the hero, grasping it quickly, rising to his full height\nand as swiftly as he could, hurled it at his enemy.\nBut he did not know himself, running or moving\nraising the great rock in his hands, or throwing:\nhis knees gave way, his blood was frozen cold.\nThe stone itself, whirled by the warrior through the empty air,\nfailed to travel the whole distance, or drive home with force.\nAs in dreams when languid sleep weighs down our eyes at night,\nwe seem to try in vain to follow our eager path,\nand collapse helpless in the midst of our efforts,\nthe tongue won\u2019t work, the usual strength is lacking\nfrom our limbs, and neither word nor voice will come:\nso the dread goddess denied Turnus success,\nhowever courageously he sought to find a way.\nThen shifting visions whirled through his brain:\nhe gazed at the Rutulians, and at the city, faltered\nin fear, and shuddered at the death that neared,\nhe saw no way to escape, no power to attack his enemy,\nnor sign of his chariot, nor his sister, his charioteer.\nAs he wavered, Aeneas shook his fateful spear,\nseeing a favourable chance, and hurled it from the distance\nwith all his might. Stone shot from a siege engine\nnever roared so loud, such mighty thunder never burst\nfrom a lightning bolt. Like a black hurricane the spear flew on\nbearing dire destruction, and pierced the outer circle\nof the seven-fold shield, the breastplate\u2019s lower rim,\nand, hissing, passed through the centre of the thigh.\nGreat Turnus sank, his knee bent beneath him, under the blow.\nThe Rutulians rose up, and groaned, and all the hills around\nre-echoed, and, far and wide, the woods returned the sound.\nHe lowered his eyes in submission and stretched out his right hand:\n\u2018I have earned this, I ask no mercy\u2019 he said,\n\u2018seize your chance. If any concern for a parent\u2019s grief\ncan touch you (you too had such a father, in Anchises)\nI beg you to pity Daunus\u2019s old age and return me,\nor if you prefer it my body robbed of life, to my people.\nYou are the victor, and the Ausonians have seen me\nstretch out my hands in defeat: Lavinia is your wife,\ndon\u2019t extend your hatred further.\u2019 Aeneas stood, fierce\nin his armour, his eyes flickered, and he held back his hand:\nand even now, as he paused, the words began to move him\nmore deeply, when high on Turnus\u2019s shoulder young Pallas\u2019s\nluckless sword-belt met his gaze, the strap glinting with its familiar\ndecorations, he whom Turnus, now wearing his enemy\u2019s emblems\non his shoulder, had wounded and thrown, defeated, to the earth.\nAs soon as his eyes took in the trophy, a memory of cruel grief,\nAeneas, blazing with fury, and terrible in his anger, cried:\n\u2018Shall you be snatched from my grasp, wearing the spoils\nof one who was my own? Pallas it is, Pallas, who sacrifices you\nwith this stroke, and exacts retribution from your guilty blood.\u2019\nSo saying, burning with rage, he buried his sword deep\nin Turnus\u2019s breast: and then Turnus\u2019s limbs grew slack\nwith death, and his life fled, with a moan, angrily, to the Shades.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1015438", "artist_names":

want\nAnd have it any time\nKnowing this you found a thought for me that told you just what I should be\nAnd there I stood behind\nWith all the ones that went before and memories that always seems to\nTear me from my mind\n\n[Chorus]\nIt isn't how it was set up to be but I've set you free this time\n\n[Verse 3]\nI could never find a chance to choose between a way to win or a\nThing to lose because there was your stand\nOn top of all the love you took\nThere was only something you can look at lying in your hand\nNow who's wondering what has changed and why it can not be arranged\nTo have

Overkill: Appendix of Case Studies LyricsParamilitary drug raids have been growing in number for 25 years. As they\u2019ve become more frequent, so too have incidents in which these raids have gone wrong. Criminologist Peter Kraska says his research shows that between 1989 and 2001, at least 780 cases of flawed paramilitary raids reached the appellate level, a dramatic increase over the 1980s, where such cases were rare, or earlier, when they were practically nonexistent.280 Yet despite the ongoing reporting of botched raids in media outlets, the phenomenon is still consistently dismissed by supporters of paramilitary policing as a series of \u201cisolated incidents.\u201d The truth is, mistaken raids continue to happen with disturbing regularity. They can\u2019t all be isolated incidents. This section will catalogue an extensive list of botched raids between 1995 and April 2006 found over the course of several months of research. It is by no means comprehensive. The Cato Institute has also plotted an expanded list of cases on an interactive map, which can be found at http://www.cato.org /raidmap. The aim of this section is to demonstrate that botched paramilitary drug raids\u2014and the death, injury, and terrorizing of innocents that come with them\u2014aren\u2019t merely a regrettable, infrequent consequence of an otherwise effective police tactic. Rather, they\u2019re the inevitable consequence of a flawed, overbearing, and unnecessary form of drug policing. Wrong Address The botched drug raids that seem to generate the most public outrage are those in which police force entry into a home that turns out to be the wrong address. It\u2019s bad enough to have a system in place that is needlessly violent and provocative for known or suspected drug offenders. But it\u2019s particularly frustrating to see wholly innocent people terrorized, injured, and killed because police, policymakers, and judges cling to a flawed policy.281 No case better illustrates the preventable, tragic consequences of this flawed system than the death of Alberta Spruill. Alberta Spruill.On May 16, 2003, a dozen New York City police officers stormed an apartment building in Harlem on a no-knock warrant. They were acting on a tip from a confidential informant who told them a convicted felon was dealing drugs and guns from the sixth floor. There was no felon. The only resi-dent in the building was Alberta Spruill, described by friends as a \u201cdevout churchgoer.\u201d282 Before entering, police deployed a flashbang grenade. The blinding, deafening explosion stunned the 57-year-old city worker. As the officers realized their mistake and helped Spruill to her feet, the woman slipped into cardiac arrest. She died two hours later. A police investigation would later find that the drug dealer the raid team was looking for had been arrested days earlier and was still in police custody. He couldn\u2019t possibly have been at Spruill\u2019s apartment. The officers who conducted the raid did no investigation whatsoever to corroborate the informant\u2019s tip.283 Worse, a police source later told the New York Daily News that the informant had offered police tips on several occasions, none of which had led to an arrest. His record was so poor, in fact, that he was due to be dropped from the city\u2019s informant list.284 Nevertheless, police took his tip on the excon in Spruill\u2019s building to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, which approved the application for a no-knock entry. A judge then issued the warrant resulting in Spruill\u2019s death. The entire process took only a matter of hours. After the Spruill case, the media began to take notice of other victims of botched noknocks, including the following three cases in the fall of 2002, about six months before the raid that killed Spruill.\n\n\u2022 Williemae Mack. On September 3, 2002, police broke down the door of Brooklyn resident Williemae Mack in a pre-dawn drug raid. Her twin 13-yearold sons were asleep at the time. One, frightened by the noise and the explosive device police used to gain entry, hid under the bed. Police pulled him out and put a gun to his head. Police then handcuffed both boys at gunpoint. They found no drugs. They had raided the wrong address.285\n\n\u2022 Robert and Marie Rogers.On October 15, 2002, about 20 police armed with pistols and shotguns served a no-knock warrant on the home of retired police officer Robert Rogers and his wife Marie. The two were watching television when the officers stormed their home in Queens. Mr. Rogers initially grabbed his handgun, believing the police to be intruders. Once he recognized they were law enforcement, he dropped his weapon and covered it with his body. Rogers later told Newsday that had the raiding officers seen his gun, \u201cI\u2019d be dead.\u201d Again, the police had the wrong address.286Marie Rogers would take the news of Alberta Spruill\u2019s death especially hard. \u201cWhen I heard about what happened to this woman, I broke down and cried,\u201d Rogers later told the New York Post, \u201cYou would have thought that I knew her. Then I was angry.\u201d287\n\n\u2022 Michael Thompson. A day before the raid on the Rogerses, police also burst into the home of Michael Thompson, also of Queens. That raid left the man\u2019s large mahogany front door broken into pieces. The police then trained their guns on Thompson\u2019s chest while they searched his home and the upstairs apartment of a tenant for drugs. Once again, they had raided the wrong address.288 The victims of the above three raids were represented in civil suits filed by Norman Siegel, former director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. Mr. Siegel told the New York Times in the fall of 2003 that according to police data, police were conducting about 460 such searches of private residences each month, with the vast majority of those served under no-knock warrants.289 In fact, just days after the raid on the Rogerses\u2019 home, Siegel held a press conference and pled with police to end the practice of no-knock raids. Nearly predicting the Spruill raid that would happen a year later, Siegel warned: \u201cWe must do a better job of no-knock search warrants. Otherwise, someone might wind up dead as a result of how we implement this procedure.\u201d290\n\n\u2022 Timothy Brockman.Just two days before the Spruill raid, police from NYPD and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms displayed extraordinary ineptitude in executing another botched no-knock raid, this time on the home of former Marine Timothy Brockman. Acting on a tip from a confused anonymous informant, police stormed the public housing apartment of the 61-year-old Brockman, who used a walker to get around. Police deployed a flashbang grenade, setting Brockman\u2019s carpet on fire, then handcuffed the man and threw him to the floor while they searched his home for drugs. They had the wrong address. Brockman would later be cleared of all charges.291 The Brockman case is another illustration of how the mishmash of court precedents governing the use of no-knock raids can lead to errors. In Brockman\u2019s case, New York police wanted to raid the apartment on the basis of the testimony of a single informant who had visited the targeted residence on just one occasion. State law required more evidence for a no-knock warrant. Federal law, however, is more deferential to police and, in this case, allowed for a no-knock entry. New York investigators merely called the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, who sent an agent from Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms along for the raid. The Brockman raid was now a federal case, governed by federal guidelines. Miscommunication between local and federal police led to series of errors that caused the police to mistakenly break down Brockman\u2019s door. Though a potentially grave and inexcusable error on the part of federal and local police, the Brockman case was ignored by the media and treated with indifference by the police. As the Times writes, \u201cAt the time, the incident received no publicity and no serious attention from the police leadership.\u201d292 In a follow-up piece published months after Spruill\u2019s death, the Village Voicereported that complaints about police abuses with respect to no-knocks had been pouring in for years. \u201cUntil Spruill\u2019s death, the NYPD had done nothing to stem the number of incidents,\u201d the Voice wrote, \u201cdespite receiving a memo from the Citizen Complaint Review Board in January noting the high number of raid complaints. Last March, the NAACP also approached NYPD commissioner Raymond W. Kelly about the raids.\u201d293 Indeed, the New York Times ran a story back in 1998, a full five years before Spruill\u2019s death, headlined, \u201cAs Number of Police Raids Increase, So Do Questions.\u201d294 The paper noted that the number of narcotics search warrants issued in New York City doubled from 1,447 in 1994 to 2,977 in 1998. Most of these, according to the Times, were no-knock warrants.295 The Times also profiled several cases of botched no knocks from the late 1990s. Among them were the following:\n\n\u2022 Mary and Cornelius Jefferson. The article began with a description of a botched no-knock on the home of Cornelius and Mary Jefferson, a couple in their 60s, in which police used a battering ram to obliterate the front door of an apartment \u201cwhere plastic slipcovers protect the sofas and diplomas and awards line the walls.\u201d Cornelius told the Times, \u201cI thought they were coming to rob us, coming to kill us.\u201d They had the wrong address.296\n\u2022 Ellis Elliott. On February 27, 1998, police conducted a no-knock raid on the Bronx home of Elliott, on the basis of information they later determined to be \u201cmiscommunication with an informant.\u201d As police attempted to break down his door, Elliott feared he was being attacked and fired a shot through the door. Police responded with a barrage of 26 bullets, all of which miraculously missed Elliott. Elliott was then dragged out of his home, naked, allegedly peppered with racial epithets, then arrested on charges of possessing an unlicensed weapon. Police later admitted their error and paid $1,000 to have Elliott\u2019s door repaired.297Elliott pled guilty to disorderly conduct for firing at the officers and was given a conditional discharge. No police officers were charged or disciplined for the error.298\n\n\u2022 The Crown Heights Raid. On May 1, 1998, police broke down the door to a home in Brooklyn\u2019s Crown Heights neighborhood in a no-knock raid that was based on the word of a single confidential informant. They expected to find a drug den. Instead, according to the Times, police found \u201ca retired banker, a home health attendant, and their two daughters.\u201d One of the daughters was mentally disabled, and was showering at the time of the raid. Police pulled her from the shower, handcuffed her, and despite her pleas to the officers that she was menstruating, refused to give her a sanitary pad until she began visibly bleeding.299\n\n\u2022 Sandra Soto. On June 5, 1997, police carried out a no-knock warrant based on information from an anonymous informant in the East New York area of Brooklyn. The warrant instructed them to raid a gray door marked \u201c2M.\u201d Finding no such door, they simply broke down the nearest door, which was red and marked \u201c2L.\u201d They found a woman, Sandra Soto, and her two children\u2014but no drugs.300\n\n\u2022Shaunsia Patterson. New York Times columnist Bob Herbert later reported that on the same dayas the raid on Ellis Elliott\u2019s home, New York City police raided the Bronx apartment of Shaunsia Patterson and her two children, ages three and two. Patterson was eight months pregnant. Police first grabbed Patterson\u2019s sister Misty, 15, who was also in the room, and threw her to the floor. They then confronted Patterson, who was sitting on her bed. One officer pushed Patterson onto her back. Another jumped on top of her. Patterson was eventually pushed to the floor and handcuffed while, in Patterson\u2019s words, \u201cone of the cops stepped on the side of my face and pressed my face into the floor.\u201d When Patterson asked what the police wanted, she says, she was told to \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d Police handcuffed Patterson while she wore only her underwear. Officers then screamed expletives at the two women while they scoured the apartment for drugs\u2014demolishing the furniture, kitchen, and floor in the process. The raid so frightened Patterson, she urinated on herself. The police refused to allow her to change. Police also refused to show her a warrant. Hours later, an officer told her, \u201cWe got the wrong apartment,\u201d and released her from her handcuffs. One confidential police source told New York Times columnist Bob Herbert, referring to the Patterson and Elliott raids, \u201cTwo in one day\u2014that\u2019s bad. But I\u2019ll tell you what I honestly believe\u2014I don\u2019t think this happens that often.\u201d301 Those kinds of assurances from police officials are common in New York and elsewhere. Despite repeated media reports of \u201cwrong door\u201d raids throughout the late 1990s, city officials continued to insist such incidents were uncommon\u2014and nothing to be alarmed about. But in February 1998, the New York Police Department circulated a memo among the city\u2019s police officers instructing them how to contact locksmiths and door repair services should they break down the door to the wrong address, suggesting that mistakes were in fact fairly common. 302 As discussed earlier, the review procedures New York City had in place to deal with police brutality failed as well. The Civilian Complaint Review Board, hamstrung by bureaucracy, limited jurisdiction, and squabbles with the police union, was helpless to effect any real change to stem the tide of \u201cwrong door\u201d warrants. New York had plenty of warnings that a case like Spruill\u2019s might happen. The city\u2019s public officials did little to heed them.\n\nJust after Spruill\u2019s death and ensuing media coverage, Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields set up a hotline for victims of erroneous no-knock raids. For the first time, city officials encouraged victims of mistaken raids to come forward. The hotline received more than 100 calls in its first week of operation.303Fields\u2019s staff followed up with many of those calls, and her office published a report detailing its findings. Among the cases included in that report are the following:\n\n\u2022 Lewis Caldwell. On March 6, 2003, six police officers in riot gear broke down the door to the home of Lewis Caldwell. Police handcuffed Caldwell, a lung cancer patient, and forced him to the floor. Caldwell\u2019s wife returned home from work to find her home filled with police officers and dogs. She pled with the officers to release her husband from the handcuffs. They kept him restrained for more than an hour. Caldwell says police were \u201claughing and joking\u201d while searching his apartment. When the Caldwells filed a complaint, a lieutenant called to tell them the raid was justified, and \u201cthere\u2019s nothing you can do about it.\u201d No drugs were found, and no criminal charges were ever filed against either of the Caldwells.304\n\n\u2022 Kim Stevenson. On April 9, 2003, about 20 police officers broke down the door of the West Harlem home of Kim Stevenson, asking \u201cwhere the drugs were.\u201d They handcuffed Stevenson and took her to another room, while other officers kept their weapons fixed on her 12-year-old daughter. Stevenson pled with police to explain why they were in her home, but they refused to answer her. A female officer took Stevenson into a bathroom to do a body search. After finding no drugs on her, the officers again handcuffed her while other officers finished searching her apartment. According to Stevenson, officers \u201cmade jokes and ridiculed\u201d her during the search. When they left, they told her to \u201chave management fix her door.\u201d Her landlord refused. At the time the Fields report was published, Stevenson\u2019s door had yet to be repaired. She was never charged with a crime.305\n\n\u2022 Kim Yarbrough.On May 2, 2003, police broke into the Staten Island home of Kim Yarbrough, an employee at the city\u2019s Department of Corrections. No one was home at the time, but Yarbrough\u2019s son was told by his brother-in-law that \u201c20 to 30\u201d police had raided his mother\u2019s home. When her son came to the house to investigate, he was handcuffed and thrown on the couch. Yarbrough came home from work with a supervisor to see that her door had been broken down and her home trashed. She and her son say police laughed and made jokes when she asked for names and badge numbers. Neither Yarbrough nor her son was ever charged with a crime.306\n\n\u2022 Margarita Ortiz.On February 29, 2003, police broke into the home of Margarita Ortiz. Police handcuffed the woman and her 12-year-old son for two and a half hours while searching the apartment. After five hours of searching, police left without explanation. Ortiz says that the police knew \u201cwithin 15 minutes\u201d that her apartment had no drugs and that they never showed her their badges or provided a search warrant. At the time of the Fields report, Ortiz had been unable to get any information from the city regarding the raid on her home.307\n\n\u2022 Sara Perez. On November 27, 2001, police broke into the Harlem home of. Sara Perez and put a shotgun to her head. They held her children and grandchildren at gunpoint, including onemonth-old twins. Police never showed Perez a search warrant, nor did they explain why they were in her home. Perez later learned that the raid was based on faulty information supplied by a 15-year old informant. After five months, the police department paid to repair her door.308\n\n\u2022 Jeanine Jean. On May 7, 1998, police broke down the door and deployed a flashbang grenade in the home of Jeanine Jean. Frightened, Jean ran into a closet with her six-year-old son and called 911. Police pulled Jean from the closet, handcuffed her, then questioned her at gunpoint in front of her son. Jean, who had had surgery the day before, began bleeding when her surgical wound ruptured during the raid. After 90 minutes, police realized they had the wrong apartment and left without explanation. They left Jean\u2019s door hanging from its hinges.309\n\n\u2022 Atlee Swanson.On July 9, 1997, police conducted a 6 a.m. no-knock raid at the East Harlem home of Atlee Swanson. Police broke into Swanson\u2019s home and demanded to know where \u201cJoey, Jason, and Sean\u201d were. Swanson said she knew no one by those names. The officers refused to show Swanson a search warrant, handcuffed her, and told her she faced 7 to 15 years in prison for selling drugs from her home. Police then put her in a holding cell for 31 hours. She returned home to find her apartment \u201ctrashed and vandalized.\u201d Swanson got a copy of the search warrant in the mail three years later. Police had mistakenly entered the wrong apartment building.310 The following raids weren\u2019t mentioned in the Fields report, but they also occurred at about the same time as the Spruill raid.\n\n\u2022 Cynthia Chapman. Chapman was in the shower at about 6 a.m. on April 2, 2003, when police broke open her door and deployed a flashbang grenade. The grenade struck Chapman\u2019s son Bobby, 15, in the foot. Police found Chapman in the bathroom, forced her to the ground, and put a gun to her head. According to Chapman, one officer asked, \u201cWhere is it,\u201d and when Chapman responded that she didn\u2019t know what he was talking about, he replied, \u201cDon\u2019t get smart with me or I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d Chapman and her son were handcuffed, taken to a police station, and released hours later when police discovered they\u2019d raided the wrong home. In 2004, Chapman settled with the city of New York for $100,000.311\n\u2022 Ana Roman.In 2004, the family of Ana Roman filed an $11 million lawsuit against the city of New York. The suit stemed from a September 12, 1996, noknock raid on the home Roman, then 70, shared with her husband and adult son. Police were acting on a faulty tip from a confidential informant that drugs were being dealt from Roman\u2019s home. Roman emerged from her bedroom to find police pointing assault weapons at her, her husband, and her son. Roman had a heart attack and spent the following two weeks in a cardiac unit. Her family maintains that Roman never fully recovered and died of congestive heart failure six years later as a direct result of the attack she suffered during the raid.312\n\n\u2022 Mary Bardy. Bardy went to the city council hearings to give her account of a January 2002 botched raid on her home. Police mistakenly believed her son was dealing drugs. The raiding officers broke down her door and, at gunpoint, ordered everyone inside\u2014including her 2-year-old granddaughter\u2014to lie down.313 \u201cI saw what happened to that poor woman [Spruill] and I said, this is crazy. This can\u2019t keep happening,\u201d Bardy told the New York Daily News. 314 Bardy, who had recently retired after an administrative career with the NYPD, said she wrote \u201cdozens of letters\u201d and \u201cmade lots of phone calls\u201d after the raid on her home but found no one who could give her answers about the circumstances of the investigation leading to the night police broke into her home. Her son was never charged.315 A day after the Spruill city council hear-ings, Manhattan Borough President Fields held hearings of her own. According to the Village Voice: Dozens of black and Latino victims\u2014 nurses, secretaries, and former officers\u2014 packed her chambers airing tales, one more horrifying than the next. Most were unable to hold back tears as they described police ransacking their homes, handcuffing children and grandparents, putting guns to their heads, and being verbally (and often physically) abusive. In many cases, victims had received no follow-up from the NYPD, even to fix busted doors or other physical damage. The Voicethen echoed the Newsday report: Some complainants reported that they had filed grievances with the [Citizen Complaint Review Board] and were told there was no police misconduct. Unless there is proven abuse, the CCRB disregards complaints about warrants that hold a correct address but are faulty because of bad evidence from a [confidential informant].316 The key recommendation from the Fields report was that NYPD produce an annual report detailing \u201call statistics regarding the execution of warrants.\u201d Fields believed such a report would provide some transparency and accountability in the issuance and execution of drug warrants, particularly those authorizing no-knock raids. NYPD issued no such report in 2005. Less than a year after Spruill\u2019s death, NYPD was back in the headlines with the mistaken raid on Martin and Leona Goldberg, mentioned earlier.317 Another high-profile wrong-door raid that provoked local media and public officials to take a harder look at the use of paramilitary drug raids was the Denver, Colorado, case of Ismael Mena. Ismael Mena. On September 29, 1999, a Denver SWAT team executed a no-knock drug raid on Mena\u2019s home. Mena, a Mexican immigrant, believed he was being robbed and confronted the SWAT team with a gun. Police said they fired the eight shots that killed Mena only after Mena ignored repeated warnings to drop his weapon and first fired at them. Mena\u2019s family says police never announced themselves, and that it was the police who fired first.318 Police later discovered they had raided the wrong home, on the basis of bad information from a confidential informant.319They found no drugs in Mena\u2019s house, nor were any found in his system.320 Subsequent investigations by the city police department\u2019s internal affairs division and by a special prosecutor found no wrongdoing on the part of the SWAT team. But weeks later, new details began to emerge about the Mena case. An aide to the special prosecutor, for example, said that Mena\u2019s body had been moved at least 18 inches after he was shot. A lab report then found that the gunshot residue found on Mena\u2019s hand didn\u2019t match Mena\u2019s gun but was instead only consistent with the residue given off by the submachine guns the SWAT team uses. Police found no fingerprints on Mena\u2019s gun, or on the ammunition inside it, raising speculation that the gun was tampered with or planted.321 An internal affairs investigation cleared the SWAT team of wrongdoing but did find that the officer who prepared the search warrant for Mena\u2019s home falsified information.322As the shooting gained traction in the media, Denver city officials began to portray Mena as a Mexican criminal refugee wanted for murder (Mena had shot a man in Mexico in self-defense but had been cleared of any wrongdoing), a \u201cblame the victim\u201d strategy unfortunately common in police brutality cases. 323 Members of the police department also later started what local media would call a \u201cspy file\u201d on a citizens\u2019 organization agitating for a more thorough investigation of Mena\u2019s death. Worse, the head of the police intelligence unit that kept a \u201cspy file\u201d on Mena\u2019s supporters was also the head of the SWAT team that conducted the raid on Mena\u2019s home.324\n\nMena\u2019s family eventually hired former FBI agent James Kearney to conduct a private investigation. Over the course of that investigation, Kearney became convinced that Denver police murdered Mena, then planted the gun to cover up the botched raid. Kearney found evidence not uncovered by previous investigations, including two slugs in the floor of Mena\u2019s apartment that suggest the raid didn\u2019t happen as SWAT officials said it did. Kearney made his accusations on a local radio station, leading to a lawsuit against the station and Kearney by members of the SWAT team. The radio station settled. Kearney in turn filed suit against the SWAT team and sought to prove his allegations of a cover-up in court.325 The suit was thrown out in federal court, but as of November 2005 Kearney was still waiting on word of his appeal.326 Mena\u2019s family ultimately settled with the city of Denver for $400,000.327 To its credit, the city of Denver instituted some strong reforms in response to Mena\u2019s death. The reforms drastically cut down on the number of no-knock warrants carried out in the city, though reforms stopped short of an outright prohibition on no-knock warrants for drug raids.328 Denver is the exception, however. Most high-profile SWAT tragedies temporarily put reporters on the scent for similar abuses, light a fire under activists, and put policymakers on the defensive. But that public scrutiny is usually followed by a return to business as usual. The case that spurred the Capital Times indepth investigation of SWAT team proliferation to small-town Wisconsin stemmed from an incident in tiny Dalton, a rural town 50 miles north of Madison. Wendy and Jesus Olveda. Wendy Olveda, who was five months pregnant, her husband Jesus, and their three-year-old daughter Zena were at home one evening in October 2000 when a black-clad SWAT team broke down their front door and threw the couple facefirst to the floor. Zena Olveda looked on from the couch. Jesus Olveda told the paper that as he lifted his head to tell police they had the wrong address, \u201cone of them put a knee on my head and ground it into the floor.\u201d329 Police had the wrong address. When they realized their error, they rushed through the Olveda\u2019s garage door to the home next door. The Times reported that one officer went back to the Olveda\u2019s home minutes later to retrieve the search warrant. The Olvedas filed a claim for compensation against the police departments in charge of carrying out the raid. The claim was rejected.330 Two years before the Olveda raid, police in another small Wisconsin town mistakenly raided the home of Daniel and Cythia Cuervo, holding the couple at gunpoint while the officers ransacked their home. The Cuervos eventually accepted a settlement in their lawsuit against the responsible local police agencies. The mistaken raid on their home inspired a significant reorganization of the Multi-jurisdictional Enforcement Group narcotics unit in the Lake Winnebago area of Wisconsin.331 But the rash of media reports of botched raids in Wisconsin in the year 2000 came a full five years after the state had already done some introspection on paramilitary police tactics when such tactics had ended with a man\u2019s death. Scott Bryant. On April 17, 1995, police in Dodge County, Wisconsin, forcefully entered the mobile home of Scott Bryant after finding traces of marijuana in his garbage. The officers would later say they knocked and announced before entering, but neighbors who witnessed the raid say police entered without doing either. Moments later, Detective Robert Neuman shot an unarmed Bryant in the chest, killing him. Bryant\u2019s eight-yearold son was asleep in the next room. Neuman told investigators he \u201ccan\u2019t remember\u201d pulling the trigger.332 Dodge County sheriff Stephen Fitzgerald compared the shooting to a hunting accident.333 Two years later, Bryant\u2019s family was awarded a $950,000 settlement by Dodge County.334 After the Bryant case made headlines, three victims of a similar raid by the Dodge County Sheriff\u2019s Department also filed suit. According to that lawsuit, police raided a home in Juneau, Wisconsin, after finding traces of marijuana and material \u201csuspected of packing cocaine\u201d in garbage bags outside the house. Police entered the home \u201csuddenly and violently\u201d at 2:45 a.m., threw the three occupants to the floor, and handcuffed them. Police then searched the house for more than three hours. No charges were filed.335 After the settlement in the Bryant case, and a year after the shooting, Sheriff Fitzgerald seemed remorseful. He told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel that his own department would make substantial changes to the way it conducts searches. \u201cIt\u2019s safe to say any time there\u2019s a tragic accident like this that people would want to do things differently,\u201d he said.336 Unfortunately, that message didn\u2019t make it to other small towns in Wisconsin. According to the Capital Times, 18 new SWAT teams have been formed across the state since the Bryant shooting.337 Although the case studies listed here cut off in the mid-1990s, the epidemic of botched military-style drug raids goes back to the early 1980s.338 As far back as 1990, an article in Playboy magazine took note of a curious rise in media accounts of botched drug raids and published a list of more than a dozen documented \u201cwrong door\u201d raids from the 1980s.339 In 2004, USA Today ran an editorial citing the Spruill and Goldberg raids and calling for reform in the execution of drug warrants. But the same paper ran a similar story more than a decade earlier, in 1993 (and even earlier, in 1989), ticking off a list of botched raids and a critique of noknock and paramilitary raids in general, including the problems with confidential informants, asset forfeiture, lack of oversight, and the militarization of civilian policing described in this study.340 The editorial also included responses from law enforcement officials dismissing botched raids as \u201cisolated incidents.\u201d341 So not only is the problem of mistaken raids not new, neither is the cycle of media and public officials temporarily taking notice of them, then neglecting to enact any real reforms. Here, in reverse chronological order, is a partial list of other documented wrongdoor raids dating back to 1995:\n\n\u2022 H. Victor Buerosse. On December 30, 2005, police in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, broke into the home of 68-year-old H. Victor Buerosse in a predawn raid. Buerosse was thrown into a closet door, then to the ground, and hit in the head with a police shield. Despite his protests that police had the wrong address, they didn\u2019t concede their mistake until a sergeant arrived later. They left without an apology. The SWAT team eventually raided the correct residence, where they found a small amount of marijuana. Buerosse, a retired attorney, told a local reporter: \u201cSWAT teams are not meant for simple pot possession cases. The purpose of SWAT teams it to give police departments a specially trained unit to react to a violent situation, not to create one. This should not happen in America. To me you can\u2019t justify carrying out simple, routine police work this way.\u201d342\n\n\u2022 Michelle Clancy. At 5:30 a.m. on December 21, 2005, police in Paterson, New Jersey, stormed the home of Michelle Clancy on a drug warrant, breaking off her doorknob. Clancy, her 65-year-old father, and her 13-year-old daughter were home at the time. Police later confirmed they had raided the wrong apartment. Police spokesman Lt. Anthony Traina told one reporter, \u201cThese things do happen.\u201d343\n\n\u2022 The Baker Family. Early in the morning on September 30, 2005, police in Stockbridge, Georgia, conducted a noknock raid on the home of Roy and Belinda Baker. Officers broke down the couple\u2019s front door with a battering ram and tossed in flashbang grenades. The police held the couple at gunpoint, handcuffed them, and then sent them out onto their porch, only partially clothed. Police ruined a family Bible and antique coffee table during the raid. The raiding officers eventually realized the intended target of their raid lived next door. Police Chief Russ Abernathy called the raid \u201cinexcusable\u201d and \u201cnot acceptable\u201d and blamed poor street lighting for the mistaken address. But Abernathy added that no one would be fired and that the raids would go on, albeit after \u201creviewing procedures.\u201d The Bakers are considering a lawsuit.344\n\n\u2022 Harold and Carolyn Smith. In September 2005, police in Bel Aire, Kansas, raided the home of Harold Smith, the town\u2019s former mayor, after mistaking sunflowers in the man\u2019s backyard for marijuana plants. Police had taken pictures of the plants and showed them to a judge, who then approved the search warrant. Police rifled through the mayor and his wife\u2019s belongings and took videotape of their home before realizing their mistake.345\n\n\u2022 David Scheper. On August 18, 2005, police in Baltimore, Maryland, forced their way into the home of David Scheper and Sascha Wagner. Thinking they were being robbed, Wagner called 911, telling the operator, \u201cThere\u2019s someone breaking into my house.\u201d Scheper had already slammed the door on the officer, who never announced they were police. The police then shattered the glass on the home\u2019s front door. Scheper stood just inside, holding his 12-gauge shotgun. He didn\u2019t have ammunition but hoped that racking the gun within earshot of the door would scare off the intruders. When they wouldn\u2019t leave, Scheper retreated to his basement and grabbed the only functioning weapon in his house, a CZ- 52 semiautomatic. As Scheper struggled to load the weapon, it accidentally discharged, sending a round into the floor of his basement. Police took $1,440 in cash Scheper says he had recently withdrawn to buy a used truck. According to the Baltimore City Paper, police also \u201chit a 70-year-old art-deco-style metal desk with an ax. They took 18 of Scheper\u2019s guns\u2014mostly inoperable antiques, he says. \u2018They threatened to blow up my safe,\u2019 Scheper says, so he opened it for them.\u201d The police were mistaken. They were looking for a tenant Scheper had evicted weeks earlier. Nevertheless, police still put Scheper\u2019s antique gun collection on display for the local news as part of a \u201croundup\u201d of illegal weapons they\u2019d found in two raids. Police charged Scheper for firing the weapon in his basement, a charge that carried a possible $1,000 fine and a year in prison. Prosecutors eventually dropped that charge, but only after Scheper\u2019s lawyer successfully fought to get Wagner\u2019s 911 call admitted as evidence.346\n\n\u2022 Cedelie Pompee.In August 2005, police in Newark, New Jersey, raided a home owned by 59-year-old Cedelie Pompee while looking for drugs and guns. Pompee, her family, and the family to whom she rents an apartment said police cursed them while ravaging through their belongings. Officials from the state police SWAT team and the DEA later realized they had raided the wrong address. The Associated Press reports that state police had made a similar mistake four months earlier.347\n\n\u2022 John Simpson. On June 15, 2005, Nampa, Idaho, police serving a search warrant tossed a flashbang grenade into the home of Vietnam veteran John Simpson. The frightened Simpson first took cover and attempted to protect his wife. He then composed himself, assumed he was being attacked by intruders, and ventured out with the only weapon he could find, the hose from his vacuum cleaner. The police had targeted the wrong side of Simpson\u2019s duplex. \u201cI guess we\u2019re going to have to seek psychological help, I hate to say that,\u201d Simpson told the Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m not nuts or anything, but I\u2019m still shaking. Put a shotgun next to your ear and pull the trigger to get an idea of the noise.\u201d Police later picked up Simpson\u2019s neighbor with four ounces of marijuana.348\n\n\u2022 The Chidester Family.In May 2005 in Utah County, Utah, Larry Chidester awoke to hear explosions at the home next to his. He went outside and saw members of a local SWAT team preparing to raid his neighbor\u2019s home. According to a lawsuit filed by the Chidester family, one of the SWAT officers spotted Larry Chidester, pointed at him, and exclaimed, \u201cThere\u2019s one!\u201d Chidester threw his hands in the air and repeatedly said, \u201cI\u2019m not resisting.\u201d The officer tackled Chidester and, according to Chidester, \u201cshoved his face into the ground and rocks.\u201d Larry Chidester was later taken to the emergency room for treatment. Police then kicked open a side door to the Chidester home and swarmed the bedroom where Lawrence Chidester\u2014Larry\u2019s father\u2014was dressing. They threw him to the floor and trained a gun to the back of his head. SWAT officers later conceded they had raided the wrong home. Utah County sheriff Jim Tracy later admitted the Chidester home wasn\u2019t the original target of the raid, but that police decided to raid their home as \u201can ancillary issue.\u201d He said police disputed the accuracy of the Chidesters\u2019 account of the raid, but wouldn\u2019t give details.349\n\n\u2022 Queen Moore. On October 10, 2004, police in Omaha, Nebraska, conducted a narcotics raid on the home of Queen Moore, an elderly woman. When Moore filed suit for the damage officers did to her home, the police initially refused to be interviewed, on advice from the police union. Worse, the police department told Moore her complaint wasn\u2019t valid because union rules required it to be handwritten, not typewritten. Moore\u2019s lawyer responded that requiring her to personally write out her complaint \u201cis not only illegal, but unduly burdensome and harassing,\u201d as Moore could barely sign her own name. Police found no contraband in Moore\u2019s home. She was never charged or arrested.350\n\n\u2022 Teresa Guiler and James Elliott. In September 2004, a SWAT team in Clarksville, Tennessee, erroneously raided the home of Teresa Guiler, 55, and James Elliott, 54. Elliot, who is deaf, was recovering from a liver transplant at the time of the raid. The warrant had identified the wrong home. Police Chief Mark Smith said he would investigate to make sure the same mistake didn\u2019t happen again.351\n\u2022 Blair Davis. On July 27, 2004, police in Houston, Texas, broke open the door of Blair Davis, a landscape contractor. Police screamed \u201cDown on the Floor! Down on the Floor!\u201d while pointing an assault weapon at Davis\u2019s head. Davis\u2019s first thought was that the invaders were criminals dressed as police, a continuing problem in the Houston area. A team of 8\u201310 police officers pushed Davis to the ground and handcuffed him while they searched his home. They were acting on a tip from a confidential informant who said Davis was growing marijuana in his home. The plants in question turned out to be hibiscus plants. Police never apologized to Davis. Dan Webb, operations commander for the police team that conducted the raid, later said it was \u201cunfortunate\u201d that Davis \u201cgot caught up in this situation,\u201d but that \u201cif the situation came up today, we would\u2019ve probably done the same thing.\u201d Webb added, \u201cIt\u2019s not a mistaken search warrant . . . if we believe it\u2019s marijuana, until we go look at it, we\u2019re not really going to know for sure,\u201d overlooking the fact that an innocent person was needlessly terrorized due to his unit \u201cnot knowing for sure.\u201d352\n\n\u2022 Donald and Amber Mundy. In February 2004, police in San Bernardino, California, looking for cocaine broke open the door to an apartment occupied by Donald Mundy and his twin sister, Amber. When officers realized they had raided apartment \u201c204\u201d instead of apartment \u201c214\u201d as specified in the warrant, they conducted a search anyway and arrested Amber Mundy on charges of misdemeanor marijuana possession.353\n\n\u2022 Marion Waltman. In September 2003, an informant\u2019s tip led police in Gulfport, Mississippi, to raid land leased by Marion Waltman. Waltman was growing kenaf plants, which are commonly used for deer food. Police raided the property and mistakenly destroyed more than 500 plants, believing they were marijuana. A judge later ruled that the city wasn\u2019t obligated to compensate Waltman for the destruction of his property because the sheriff\u2019s department made an \u201chonest mistake.\u201d354\n\n\u2022 Earline Jackson.At 3 a.m. on September 5, 2003, a dozen Chicago police officers used a battering ram to break down the door of 73-year-old widow Earline Jackson\u2019s apartment. \u201cI asked them, \u2018What did I do?\u2019 And they told me to get out of the way because they were looking for drugs,\u201d Jackson told the Chicago Tribune. A warrant for Jackson\u2019s address said police believed a man was using her apartment to sell drugs. Police had mistaken Jackson\u2019s apartment for an apartment one block south.355\n\n\u2022 Francisca Perez. On August 2, 2003, police from the Bexar County, Texas, sheriff\u2019s department raided the home of Francisca Perez and her children. The raid was based on a tip from an informant that a woman named Rosalinda Mendez was selling cocaine from the house. Police handcuffed Perez and her 13-year-old daughter, while her 11-yearold daughter and three-year-old son watched in horror as police destroyed her house looking for drugs. They found nothing incriminating. Four weeks later, police still hadn\u2019t told Perez whether or not she was under investigation. According to the latest media reports available, Perez, the widow of a Gulf War veteran, was still attempting to get the police to clear her name. She told a local newspaper that she was reluctant to take legal action because her children were terrified that if she did, the police would come back to raid their home again.356\n\n\u2022 Gabrielle Wescott. On July 29, 2003, police in Montana raided the home of Gabrielle Wescott and her daughter Annabelle Heasley. According to a 2005 lawsuit, agents from the Northwest Drug Task Force donned black hoods and SWAT gear and raided their home at 7:30 a.m. on a marijuana warrant. Police forced the two to the ground, handcuffed them, and according to the lawsuit, \u201cmistreated, threatened, cursed at, and terrorized\u201d them, while police \u201cransacked the house\u201d and \u201ccut pieces of drywall out of the basement.\u201d The complaint alleges that the police affidavit leading to the search warrant \u201ccontains half-truths and inaccuracies and clearly was not completed in good faith,\u201d and that police never identified themselves. The women were never charged.357\n\n\u2022 The Phoenix Hell\u2019s Angels.In July 2003, police in Phoenix, Arizona, conducted a pre-dawn drug raid on a Hell\u2019s Angels club. Police knocked, then waited just six seconds before deploying a flashbang grenade and forcing their way into the clubhouse. Michael Wayne Coffelt, who was asleep at the time, awoke to the grenade and quickly armed himself with a pistol. When Coffelt, who thought the clubhouse was being robbed, approached the door, Officer Laura Beeler shot and wounded him. Beeler claims Coffelt fired at her, though a ballistics test later confirmed that Coffelt never discharged his gun. Police did not find any drugs in the clubhouse. Prosecutors later brought charges against Coffelt for assaulting a police officer. In dismissing the charges, Maricopa Superior Court judge Michael Wilkinson described the raid as an \u201cattack\u201d in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and said Coffelt\u2019s actions were \u201creasonable behavior, given the hour and the fact that the house was under attack.\u201d Wilkinson also determined that Beeler\u2019s mistaken belief that Coffelt had fired at her was also understandable, given the volatility of such a raid and that the officer may have misinterpreted the flashbang grenade for a gunshot.358\n\n\u2022 The Holguin Family.According to court documents filed in conjunction with a lawsuit, the Holguin family of Albuquerque, New Mexico, say police blew their door off its hinges, deployed flashbang grenades, then stormed their home on June 5, 2003. Carmen Holguin, 80, required medical treatment for injuries she sustained during the raid. The lawsuit also alleges that Julia Holguin, 55, was injured when an officer stepped on her back, and that police kicked an unnamed 14-year-old girl while executing the warrant. None of the four were charged, and police seized nothing from the home. A paralegal for the family\u2019s lawyer told the Associated Press that police had made a controlled cocaine buy on the street where the Holguins lived and indicated they may have mistaken the family\u2019s home for the place they had bought the drugs.359\n\n\u2022 Sandy Cohen. In 2002, police in Philadelphia raided the home of 85- year-old Sandy Cohen as she was taking a shower. Cohen got to her door just as police were blowing it off its hinges. When she protested to police that they had raided the wrong home, one replied, \u201cThat\u2019s what they all say.\u201d Police later conceded they\u2019d made a mistake. Cohen\u2019s neighbors had told the raiding officers they were making a mistake while they were planting the explosives outside her door.360\n\n\u2022 The Huerta Family. On November 20, 2002, a San Antonio, Texas, SWAT team deployed tear gas canisters, shattered a glass door with bullets, then stormed an apartment occupied by three Hispanic men. \u201cWe were kicked and punched at least 20 times. I couldn\u2019t talk. I was good and scared,\u201d Salvador Huerta told the San Antonio News-Express. His cousin Marcos Huerta was taken to the hospital with a cut face and bruised head. Vincent Huerta added, \u201cThe way they entered, I never thought it could be police.\u201d All three thought the raid was a robbery. Police had the wrong address.361 Police later blamed the mistake on darkness, and \u201ca cluster of look-alike buildings,\u201d despite the fact that officers stated on the warrant that they had conducted surveillance on the suspected residence for two days.362\n\n\u2022 Irene Gilliam Hensley. On August 14, 2002, police in La Porte, Texas, stormed the home of 88-year-old Irene Gilliam Hensley on a paramilitary raid after a tip that her grandson Charles Gilliam was growing marijuana in her backyard. The tip came from an aunt who had had an argument with Gilliam, and police decided to raid after an officer peeked over Hensley\u2019s fence and confirmed the presence of marijuana. According to the Houston Chronicle, the warrant specifically stated that the officer who peeked over the fence had experience identifying marijuana plants. The plants turned out to be okra. Police found no drugs in the home.363\n\n\u2022 The Gilbertson Family. In February 2002, a SWAT team in Denver\u2019s Highland neighborhood shattered a window in anticipation of a raid. Upon looking inside, they discovered they had broken into the wrong townhouse. They were preparing to deploy a flashbang grenade in the home, occupied by Erik Gilbertson and his pregnant wife. The couple was at the opera at the time of the raid. A police spokesman called the raid an \u201cunderstandable mistake.\u201d364\n\n\u2022 Maria Flores. In May 2001, police in Austin, Texas, raided the home of Maria Flores, a grandmother. A flashbang grenade shattered her window, and the SWAT team entered behind by kicking in her door. Police shoved Flores to the ground, bound her, and held her at gunpoint while they tore apart her home in a search for cocaine. They had mistaken her house for the house next door. Flores was taken to the hospital with internal bruising. \u201cFor about 20 minutes, I was on the floor crying, wondering \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d Flores told the Austin American Statesman. \u201cI\u2019m just glad my grandkids weren\u2019t here.\u201d Six months after the raid, police acknowledged the raid was a \u201cterrible mistake.\u201d Assistant Police Chief Jim Fealy said, \u201cWe violated that woman\u2019s privacy and needlessly [sic] by mistake.\u201d He attributed the error to \u201csloppy police work.\u201d365\n\n\u2022 Estelle Newcomb. In October 2001, a drug task force in Middlesex, Virginia, broke down the door of 50-year-old Estelle Newcomb and her 80-year-old aunt. Police had targeted the wrong home after miscommunicating with an informant. The investigating officer told the Associated Press: \u201cI knew this was not right. To be honest with you, it was sloppy police work\u2014not being thorough enough.\u201d The previous July, the same task force, along with the National Guard and state police, conducted a raid on a suspect they thought was growing marijuana. The plants turned out to be tomatoes.366\n\n\u2022 Charles and Debora Alexander. On August 17, 2001, police in Waco, Texas, served a drug warrant on the home of Debora and Charles Alexander. According to the Waco Tribune-Herald, police charged the residence with guns drawn, yelling \u201cPolice, search warrant!\u201d before realizing they had entered the wrong apartment. The Alexanders\u2019 visiting nine-year-old grandson, who has Down\u2019s Syndrome, went into a seizure. Debora Alexander fainted. Charles Alexander says that upon realizing their mistake, police left without apologizing, or offering to help either Debora or the grandson. Just seconds before the raid, Debora had been unpacking boxes, one of which contained her husband\u2019s gun. Charles told the TribuneHerald, \u201cGod only knows what would have happened if they would have walked down that hall with her holding that gun.\u201d Remarkably, on August 20\u2014three days after the raid\u2014Lieutenant Gary McCully told the paper he wasn\u2019t aware that his own officers had entered the wrong apartment until a reporter had called and told him.367\n\n\u2022 Sandra Smith. In May 2001, a Travis County, Texas, SWAT team conducted a raid on the home of Sandra Smith for suspicion of growing marijuana. After departing from a helicopter, storming Smith\u2019s home, kicking her dog, ransacking her belongings, and holding her and three visitors at gunpoint, police discovered the plants were ragweed. \u201cThis is the most terrifying thing that\u2019s ever happened to me in my life,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in trouble with the law.\u201d Smith filed a lawsuit against the city for damage to her home. At the time the suit was filed in 2002, her name was in the department\u2019s database as a narcotics offender. Travis County settled with Smith and her visitors for $40,000. The Travis County SWAT team was later dissolved after a series of questionable raids.368\n\n\u2022 Henry and Denise McKnight. On February 27, 2001, at about 10:30 p.m., police in Topeka, Kansas, kicked open the front door, detonated a flashbang grenade, and held Henry and Denise McKnight and their seven children at gunpoint on a drug warrant. They had mistaken the McKnight\u2019s home for the home next door. The McKnights\u2019 subsequent lawsuit alleged that police questioned them at gunpoint and continued to search the home even after realizing they\u2019d made a mistake. Police Chief Ed Klumpp acknowledged the mistake and said that the police department would make \u201cminor adjustments\u201d to its procedures, though he wouldn\u2019t say what those adjustments would be \u201cbecause it would jeopardize the safety of our officers.\u201d The Topeka City Council eventually settled with the family for $95,000.369\n\n\u2022 Susan Wilson. On February 15, 2001, a SWAT team dressed in full-assault attire stormed the home of Muskego, Wisconsin, resident Susan Wilson, 49. Wilson was standing in her driveway with her dog when the Waukesha County Metro Drug Enforcement Group apprehended her. Police forced her face down on her snowcovered drive, handcuffed her, and held her at gunpoint while police searched her home. They had the wrong address.370\n\n\u2022 Sandra Hillman.On January 19, 2001, police from Russellville and Franklin County, Alabama, raided the home of Sandra Hillman and her daughter Marquita. Agents with a no-knock warrant kicked down the door to Hillman\u2019s apartment and held the two women handcuffed and at gunpoint while conducting their search. Police never identified themselves. Hillman made two subsequent trips to an emergency room for heart problems related to the raid. Police had the wrong address.371\n\n\u2022 John Adams. On October 4, 2000, at about 10 p.m., police in Lebanon, Tennessee, raided the home of 64-year-old John Adams on a drug warrant. In what Lebanon police chief Billy Weeks would later say was a \u201csevere, costly mistake,\u201d police had identified the wrong house. According to Adams\u2019s wife, police would not identify themselves after knocking on the couple\u2019s door. After she refused to let them in, they broke down the door and handcuffed her. Adams met the police in another room with a sawed-off shotgun. Police opened fire and shot Adams dead. One officer was fired after the incident, and several others were suspended, but no criminal charges were filed.372 Adams\u2019s widow eventually won a $400,000 settlement from the city.373\n\n\u2022 Daniel and Rosa Unis.In 2000, federal agents in Pueblo, Colorado, stormed the home of Daniel and Rosa Unis after suspecting their sons of cocaine distribution. With no warrant, police in black ski masks broke into the Unis home at gunpoint and arrested Marcos and David Unis. The two were kept in custody for two days but were never charged. When the Unis family filed a federal lawsuit in 2005, the lawyer for the agent in charge of the raid conceded that the raid was illegal. One officer described the incident as \u201cunfortunate\u201d and said \u201cmiscommunication\u201d led to the wrongful raid, arrests, and detainments.374\n\n\u2022 William and Geneva Summers. On May 22, 2000, police in Pulaski, Virginia, conducted a 4 a.m. raid on the home of William and Geneva Summers. The SWAT team broke through the couple\u2019s back door, woke them, and held them at gunpoint. Police had the wrong address. They had raided the home on the basis of a tip from a \u201creliable\u201d informant that there was a methamphetamine lab inside. Magistrate Judge Jill Long concluded that police assertions that the informant was \u201creliable\u201d were sufficient to establish probable cause for a pre-dawn, forced-entry search. The informant later admitted he had lied.375\n\n\u2022 Brandon and Richelle Savage.On April 6, 2000, police in Chicago raided the apartment of Brandon and Richelle Savage on bad information from an informant. Police broke down the door and ordered the couple out of bed at gunpoint before realizing their mistake. Police officials then ignored the Savages\u2019 request to pay for damage done to their apartment until a columnist reported the incident in the Chicago Sun-Times. 376\n\n\u2022 Dovie Walker. On December 4, 1999, police in El Dorado, Arkansas, conducted a drug raid on the home of Dovie Walker. Officers tore the woman\u2019s front door from its hinges with a battering ram, damaged another door to her bed-room, broke a latch on a third door, overturned and broke Walker\u2019s furniture, and generally \u201cdemolished\u201d her house. Police officers had handcuffed Walker\u2019s three children at gunpoint before realizing they had mistaken her house for the one next door. Walker was also babysitting children of ages one, two, and three at the time of the raid. When a police department spokesman told a local newspaper police had no intention of paying for the damage they did to Walker\u2019s home, El Dorado\u2019s mayor promised four days later to begin work on the damage to Walker\u2019s house \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d377\n\n\u2022 The Tyson Family. On October 20, 1999, police from the DEA, the FBI, and Connecticut Department of Public Safety conducted 30 drug raids at locations around the Hartford area. One of those raids was on the home of 59-yearold Emma Tyson, her daughter-in-law, and her 13-year-old grandson. Twelve police officers broke into Tyson\u2019s home, causing her to have an asthma attack. Police were looking for a suspected drug dealer who had moved out of the home four months earlier, when Tyson bought it. Tyson filed a lawsuit two years later, when federal and local police authorities had yet to apologize or make an effort to clear her name.378\n\n\u2022 Mario Paz. On August 9, 1999, 20 police officers from the El Monte, California, SWAT team conducted a late-night raid on the home of 65-yearold Mario Paz. By the end of the raid, Paz had been fatally shot in the back by police. The police version of events changed several times from the night of the raid. Police first said Paz was armed. They next said he wasn\u2019t armed but was reaching for a gun. Their final account was that Paz was reaching not for a gun but to open a drawer where a gun was located. Paz was unarmed when he was shot. Police later revealed that they had conducted the raid after finding the Paz address on the driver\u2019s license, vehicle registration, and an old cell phone bill of suspected drug dealer Marcos Beltran Lizarraga (charges against Lizarraga were subsequently dropped, in part because the videotape that was supposed to contain a recording of the search of his home turned up blank).379 As mentioned earlier, one El Monte police official would later say that anticipated \u201cproceeds\u201d from the Paz family in asset forfeiture also played a part in the raid. The Paz family explained that Lizarraga had lived next to them in the 1980s and had convinced Mario Paz to let him receive mail at their residence after he moved. Three weeks after the raid, the El Monte Police Department announced that they had no evidence that anyone in the Paz family was involved in any illicit drug activity, nor did the SWAT team have any reason to think so on the night Paz was shot.380 During the raid, police seized more than $10,000 in cash and announced plans to claim the money for themselves via asset forfeiture laws. Police backed off those plans when the Paz family proved the money to be their life savings. Shortly after the Paz shooting made headlines, El Monte police conducted another raid on the home of an immigrant family. Police confronted Rosa Felix on September 22, 1999, after breaking into her home. According to a lawsuit Felix would later file, the officers told her that they knew her family was trafficking drugs, that they had information that she knew Paz, and that unless she gave them incriminating information about Paz, they would handcuff her, arrest her, and take away her children. Felix refused, insisting that her only interaction with Paz was from buying used cars from him. Charges were never filed against Felix.381 In October 2001, the officer who shot Paz was exonerated in investigations by both the Department of Justice and the LAPD. A county prosecutor insisted that Officer George Hopkins \u201cacted lawfully in self-defense\u201d during the raid.382 El Monte\u2019s police department was known to be highly militaristic\u2014but also effective. The town\u2019s police department boasted an assault vehicle with gun turret dubbed the \u201cpeacekeeper,\u201d as well as a helicopter. In 1992\u2014five years before the Paz shooting\u2014a federal appeals court had found \u201cChief Wayne Clayton, as a policymaker, acquiesced in a custom of complacency, if not hostility, toward allegations of misconduct by the department\u2019s officers.\u201d One mayor who tried to clean up the police department was voted out of office with help from the town\u2019s police union. \u201cThey run city hall. Nobody has control over the police,\u201d former El Monte mayor Pat Wallach told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cThey can do as they damn well please. They have a helicopter, a tank. They have carte blanche.\u201d383 In 2002, the city of El Monte settled with the Paz family for $3 million. The city also agreed to 13 conditions put forth by the family, mostly reforms in the way it carries out search warrants and deploys its SWAT team. Even in agreeing to the settlement, however, many city officials insisted the police did nothing wrong. \u201cWe don\u2019t view it as whether we were liable for his death,\u201d said city attorney Clarke Moseley. \u201cWe believe the family was involved [in narcotics trafficking] to some extent.\u201d No member of the Paz family was ever charged with a crime.384\n\n\u2022 Ralph Garrison. On December 16, 1996, a SWAT team wearing black balaclavas raided a rental property owned by 69-yearold Ralph Garrison. Police were acting on a tip that the property contained equipment being used by methamphetamine addicts to print counterfeit checks and currency. Police conducted the 6 a.m. raid with the aid of a helicopter from U.S. Customs and two K-9 units. As the raid commenced, Garrison confronted the police and asked why they were on his property. Raiding officers claim they told Garrison they were police executing a warrant. Just how clear they were is in dispute. Garrison immediately returned to his home to call 911. He asked the dispatcher to send police, because vandals with \u201caxes and all kinds of stuff\u201d were breaking into his rental property. Garrison later told the dispatcher, \u201cI\u2019ve got my gun. I\u2019ll shoot the son of a bitch.\u201d According to raiding officers, Garrison then emerged from his house with a gun, whereupon three officers opened fire on him with AR-15 assault rifles, killing him. Police handcuffed Garrison after shooting him, then searched his home. They also shot his dog, a 14-year-old chow, and handcuffed his wife, 69-year-old Molly Garrison, who said police didn\u2019t remove their hoods or identify themselves until after the raid. Police made no arrests. One of the officers involved in the Garrison raid, Howard Neal Terry, had been subject to three federal excessiveforce lawsuits in the previous six years, causing the city of Albuquerque to pay a total of $375,000 in settlements. In 1999, a federal court dismissed the Garrison estate\u2019s lawsuit against the police department, holding that the officers had \u201cqualified immunity,\u201d which protects them from civil damages in any lawsuit where it is determined that police did not clearly violate any established constitutional protections.385\n\n\u2022 Catherine Capps and James Cates. In May 1999, police stormed the Durham, North Carolina, home of 73-year-old Catherine Capps. Also in the house at the time was Capps\u2019s friend, 71-year-old James Cates. Police say they obtained a warrant for the home after a confidential informant bought crack cocaine there. Capps had poor vision, was deaf, and according to her family, \u201ccould not even cook an egg without being extremely out of breath.\u201d When police raided the home, they ordered Cates to stand. Hobbled by a war wound and frightened, Cates stumbled at the order and fell into a police officer. Sgt. L. C. Smith apparently mistook Cates\u2019s stumble as a lunge for the officer\u2019s pistol. Smith responded by punching the elderly man twice in the face. Cates, 79, wasn\u2019t permitted to use the bathroom during the search, causing him to urinate on himself. Both Cates and Capps were also strip-searched. No drugs were found in the home or on Capps\u2019s or Cates\u2019s person.386 Capps later died from health maladies her family says she incurred during the raid. She was never charged with selling crack cocaine to the informant because, according to prosecutors, trying her would have required them to release the informant\u2019s name.387Subsequent investigations conducted by the Durham Police Department, the FBI, and the local district attorney found no wrongdoing on the part of police.388 About six months prior to the CappsCates raid, the city of Durham had set up a citizens\u2019 review board, in part due to community complaints about other allegations of excessive force on the part of police. But like similar review boards in other parts of the country, proceedings were often conducted in secret, complainants weren\u2019t given access to witnesses or evidence, and laws regarding search warrants kept vital information sealed. When Capps\u2019s family attempted to file a complaint with the review board, the board instituted a new rule denying a hearing to any complainant who had previously sought financial compensation from the city, and applied the rule retroactively. Though neither Capps nor her family had asked for compensation, Cates had, giving the review board cause to refuse to even listen to a complaint about the raid.389\n\n\u2022 Tina and Margie Peterson.On April 4, 1999, police conducted a drug raid on a home in Kaysville, Utah, four days after obtaining the warrant and three weeks after obtaining the information to get the warrant. Despite the fact that a moving van sat in front of the apartment the officers carried on with the raid. They burst in on Tina and Margie Peterson, two sisters who were just moving into the apartment. Police charged in with guns drawn, and ordered the sisters and their two guests to the floor. According to the Petersons, officers continued to detain and question them even after they showed identification and proof that they were new tenants. The sisters filed suit against the police department in 2004.390\n\n\u2022 Edwin and Catherine Bernhardt. On February 9, 1999, police in Hallandale, Florida, conducted a late-night raid on the home of Catherine and Edwin Bernhardt. Edwin, whose job requires him to get up at 4 a.m., was asleep. Catherine was on the couch. Police busted open the Bernhardt\u2019s window and jammed an assault rifle inside. Edwin Bernhardt woke up and ran downstairs in the nude. Police pushed Catherine to the floor and handcuffed her at gunpoint. They then subdued, handcuffed, and forced Edwin Bernhardt down into a chair, while a police officer outfitted him with a pair of his wife\u2019s underwear. He was arrested and spent several hours in jail, still clad only in the underwear, until police realized their mistake and drove him home. When the couple later filed suit, the city of Hallandale fought back. City attorney Richard Kane told the Miami Herald that citizens should expect such tactics as the price of the drug war. \u201cThey made a mistake. There\u2019s no one to blame for a mistake,\u201d Kane said. \u201cThe way these people were treated has to be judged in the context of a war.\u201d When asked to comment on the suit, Fort Lauderdale police captain Tom Tiderington said: \u2018\u2018There\u2019s no perfect formula for success. It could happen at any time.\u2019\u2019 The Herald reported recent similar \u201cwrong door\u201d raids in Seminole County (twice), Largo, and Tampa.391 A year later, police in Hallandale made another botched raid, storming the home of a pregnant woman and her three young children. Police insisted they had the correct house, based on a tip from an informant who said he\u2019d bought drugs there. They didn\u2019t find any drugs. The woman whose home was raided, Tracy Bell, had complained to police about drug activity in the neighborhood and says police had confused her home with the one next door. Bell\u2019s neighbor, who had a criminal record, admitted to having friends involved in drug distribution. Bell had no record. Hallandale police insisted that this time, unlike with the Bernhardt raid, they had the correct address. Bell\u2019s attorney noted that police seem to have made the same mistakes, and offered the same excuse, for this raid as they had with the Bernhardt raid. Attorney Gary Kollin told the Miami Herald, \u201cIt appears that they continue to use informants as their scapegoats when they mess up and then they hide behind the confidentiality of the informants to avoid a proper investigation into who is telling the truth.\u201d392\n\n\u2022 Earl Richardson. In June 1998, police in Raleigh, North Carolina, broke down the door of 66-year-old Earl Richardson in a mistaken drug raid. Police ordered Richardson to the floor while they rummaged through his belongings. They had meant to raid an unmarked apartment to the rear of Richardson\u2019s home. After an apology from Raleigh mayor Tom Fetzer, Richardson said: \u201cI don\u2019t have anything against the city. I\u2019m just glad I didn\u2019t get shot.\u201d393 Five months later, Raleigh police would conduct another botched raid at the home of Priscilla Clark. \u201cI looked out my bedroom door and saw this big gun coming down the hall and a man dressed in black,\u201d said Clark, who was pregnant at the time. Police locked Clark and her two children in a bedroom for more than hour before realizing they\u2019d raided the wrong home.394\n\n\u2022 LaDana Ford. In March 1998, state troopers and local police in Harvey, Illinois, deployed a flashbang grenade then initiated a no-knock raid on the home of LaDana Ford. Police handcuffed Ford\u2019s 13-year-old and questioned her 7-year-old, while keeping the entire family at gunpoint. They later realized they\u2019d raided the wrong address. Harvey police chief Phil Hardiman was unapologetic. \u201cWe make out search warrants when we get information from drug informants,\u201d he told the Chicago SunTimes. \u201cSometimes they give us incorrect information, and warrants are made out for one house when we\u2019re really looking for the house next door. I think that\u2019s what happened here. That happens from time to time in any police department.\u201d When asked if the department would apologize, Hardiman replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019d apologize. It\u2019s not unusual for that to happen sometimes, but I will say it doesn\u2019t happen that often.\u201d395\n\n\u2022 The Fulton Family.On March 18, 1998, police raided the Bronx apartment of a grandmother, her daughter, and her sixyear-old grandson. The Fulton family was watching television when police pounded on the door, then broke it open and began tearing through the apartment looking for drugs. They had the wrong apartment.396\n\n\u2022 Jennifer Switalski and Tenants. On February 2, 1998, police in Milwaukee conducted a 6:30 a.m. raid on a building owned by Jennifer Switalski. Switalski wasn\u2019t home at the time, but her two tenants were. After breaking down the door, police handcuffed the two tenants while a terrified two-year-old girl looked on. Police had the wrong address. Switalksi later tried to sue the city for emotional distress and loss of income after her frightened tenants moved out. City officials balked. \u201cIf it happened to me, I would be upset, too,\u201d said city attorney Louis Elder. \u201cBut the taxpayer should not have to pay for hurt feelings because those deputies inadvertently entered the wrong home.\u201d Elder also said Switalski was filled with \u201cgrandiose ideas\u201d for attempting to sue the city, though she herself hadn\u2019t witnessed the raid.397\n\n\u2022 The Baines Family. On November 8, 1997, police in Suffolk County, New York, received a tip from a drug suspect that residents of a home in Wyandanch were stashing \u201c a black automatic pistol, two machine guns, a stainless steel sawed-off shotgun, ammunition, bulletproof vests, crack cocaine, proceeds from drugs sales and drug paraphernalia.\u201d Within hours of the tip, and with no corroborating investigation, a judge issued a no-knock warrant and police executed a raid on the address given by the informant. The address turned out to be the home of Denise Baines and her two sons. Baines\u2019s 10-year-old son\u2019s bedroom was trashed in the raid. Police apologized to the Baineses upon realizing they\u2019d raided the wrong home but defended the practice of executing quick, no-knock raids based on the tip of a single informant, even one who himself was a drug suspect.398\n\n\u2022 June Nixon. On August 19, 1997, police in Kaufman County, Texas, kicked down the door to the home of June Nixon, her daughter Melissa Cheek, and her granddaughter. Police handcuffed the women and strip-searched them at gunpoint before realizing they\u2019d raided the wrong house. The same sheriff\u2019s department was forced to apologize to two families in 1989 for mistaken drug raids that, according to the Dallas Morning News, \u201cturned up no drugs, but left houses damaged and family members shaken.\u201d399\n\n\u2022 Salt Lake Tortilla Factory Raid. In 1997, police in Salt Lake City, Utah, raided a tortilla factory and restaurant owned by Rafael Gomez, a naturalized citizen. Seventy-five heavily armed police officers stormed the business on a tip from a confidential informant. Expecting to find heroin and cocaine, they found only two 24-pill packs of the painkiller Darvon and two bottles of penicillin. Gomez says he was struck in the face and knocked to the floor, and that police trained a gun on his six-yearold son. One secretary says she was dragged to the floor by her hair. Police handcuffed 80 people, mostly Hispanic, in the raid and forced them to lie down for up to three hours as police searched the premises. Gomez spent a large sum of money fighting charges resulting from the raid, which were later dismissed. Bad publicity from the raid and the length of time it took to clear his name killed Gomez\u2019s business and dashed his hopes of opening a large shopping center in the area. He settled with the city of Salt Lake in 2004 for $290,000.400\n\n\u2022 The Tarkus Dillard Family. In June 1996, police raided the Pontoon Beach, Illinois, home of Tarkus Dillard, Vickie Blakely, and the couple\u2019s two young children. According to Dillard and Blakely, one officer pointed a gun directly in the face of their three-year-old daughter. Police had mistakenly raided their home instead of the home next door. Police Chief Michael Crouch apologized to Dillard and Blakely but insisted police had done nothing wrong. A federal judge threw out a $1 million lawsuit against the police department in 1998. A lawyer for the police officers called the suit\u2019s dismissal a \u201ctremendous vindication\u201d of the officers\u2019 actions and said he was contemplating suing Dillard and Blakely, to recoup the city\u2019s legal costs.401\n\n\u2022 Jeffrey and Phyllis Hampton. In May 1995, police in Concord, North Carolina, mistakenly stormed the home of Jeffrey and Phyllis Hampton. The Hamptons were relaxing at around 9:30 p.m. when police broke down the Hamptons\u2019 door, came into the house with assault weapons, and ordered the couple to the floor. Police realized their mistake after about a half hour of interrogation.402 Three years later, Concord police would wrongly raid another home, that of Leonard Mackin, Charlene Howie, and their four children. Police burst into that home with guns drawn on the night of May 22, 1998, and ordered the family to the floor. After repeated pleas by Mackin to police that they had the wrong house, Detective Larry Welch recognized Mackin as a co-worker with the city and asked, \u201cLeonard, is that you?\u201d A confidential informant had given police the wrong address.403 In 1999, police in the same town shot 15-year-old Thomas Edwards Jr. in the back while he was on his hands and knees under orders from another police paramilitary unit on a drug raid. Edwards and five other children, all aged 13\u201317, were at the house playing video games when police conducted the raid. Officer Lennie Rivera shot Edwards just below the hip when, according to an internal police investigation, \u201ca sudden movement jolted his gun, causing him to tighten his grip on it and pull the trigger.\u201d Police found a small amount of marijuana and cocaine at the home. Police Chief Robert E. Cansler said that his officers had done surveillance on the home an hour or two prior to the raid and that \u201cat that time there were no indications of a group of children present.\u201d Officer Rivera was found to have improperly held his finger on the gun\u2019s trigger and was assigned to more training.404\n\n\u2022 Richard Brown.On March 12, 1996, acting on a tip from an informant, a Miami SWAT team fired 122 rounds into the home of 73-year-old Richard Brown, while his 14 year-old great-granddaughter feared for her life in the bathroom. Brown was killed in the gunfire.405 Police found no drugs in Brown\u2019s home. The city has since paid a $2.5 million settlement to Brown\u2019s survivors, and police on the SWAT team that raided Brown\u2019s home were later indicted for lying about the details of the raid. Internal Affairs supervisor and 25-year police veteran John Dalton, now retired, told the Herald that the head of internal affairs at the time, a former SWAT team member, discouraged a thorough investigation of the Brown case. \u201cThey were very defensive about this shooting from the beginning,\u201d Dalton said, adding that he\u2019d been \u201cchewed out\u201d for asking difficult questions.\n\n\u2022 Charles Inscor.In March 1995, police in Oldsmar, Florida, smashed through a glass door, deployed flashbang grenades, and stormed what they thought was the apartment of a drug dealer. Instead, they found 31-year-old Charles Inscor, a wheelchair-bound man with a respiratory problem. The SWAT team soon realized it had raided the wrong home. Inscor was hospitalized for a week as a result of the raid. An ensuing investigation found that though deputies made many mistakes during the investigation and raid, no disciplinary action would be taken because no rules were broken. According to the St. Petersburg Times, police couldn\u2019t be disciplined because \u201cthe Sheriff\u2019s office had no policies concerning how the SWAT team should serve search warrants.\u201d406 Caught in the Crossfire Even when police have the correct address and have identified the correct suspect, and even if the suspect is correctly considered dangerous, too often they don\u2019t take note of innocent relatives, acquaintances, neighbors, or children who may be present during the raid and unnecessarily put in harm\u2019s way. Perhaps the most notable example of an innocent caught in drug raid crossfire is the case of 11-year-old Alberto Sepulveda. Alberto Sepulveda.Early in the morning on September 13, 2000, agents from the DEA, the FBI, and the Stanislaus County, California, drug enforcement agency conducted raids on 14 homes in and around Modesto, California after a 19-month investigation. According to the Los Angeles Times, the DEA and FBI asked that local SWAT teams enter each home unannounced to secure the area ahead of federal agents, who would then come to serve the warrants and search for evidence. Federal agents warned the SWAT teams that the targets of the warrants, including Alberto Sepulveda\u2019s father Moises, should be considered armed and dangerous.407 After police forcibly entered the Sepulveda home, Alberto, his father, his mother, his sister, and his brother were ordered to lie face down on the floor with arms outstretched. Half a minute after the raid began, the shotgun that officer David Hawn had trained on Alberto accidentally discharged, instantly killing the 11-year-old. No drugs or weapons were found in the home.408 The Los Angeles Times reports that when Modesto police asked federal investigators if there were any children present in the Sepulveda home, they replied, \u201cNot aware of any.\u201d409There were three. A subsequent internal investigation by the Modesto Police Department found that the DEA\u2019s evidence against Moises Sepulveda\u2014who had no previous criminal record\u2014was \u201cminimal.\u201d In 2002 he pled guilty to the last charge remaining against him as a result of the investigation\u2014using a telephone to distribute marijuana.410The city of Modesto and the federal government settled a lawsuit brought by the Sepulvedas for the death of their son for $3 million.411 At first, Modesto police chief Roy Wasden seemed to be moved by Sepulveda\u2019s death toward genuine reform. \u201cWhat are we gaining by serving these drug warrants?\u201d Wasden is quoted as asking in the Modesto Bee. \u201cWe ought to be saying, \u2018It\u2019s not worth the risk. We\u2019re not going to put our officers and community at risk anymore.\u2019\u201d412 Unfortunately, as part of the settlement with the Sepulvedas, while Modesto announced several reforms in the way its SWAT team would carry out drug raids, there was no mention of discontinuing the use of paramilitary units to conduct no-knock or knock-and-announce warrants on nonviolent drug offenders.413 Here are some other cases of people caught in drug-raid crossfire who weren\u2019t suspects:\n\n\u2022 Michael Meluzzi. On July 8, 2005, a Sarasota, Florida, SWAT team conducted a drug raid on a home where several children were playing in the front yard. The SWAT team descended from a van, deployed flashbang grenades in front of and inside the house, then swarmed the home. Forty-four-year-old Michael Meluzzi, who had a criminal record, fled when he saw the armed agents exit the van. Police chased Meluzzi down and fired a Taser gun at him, only partially hitting him. According to Officer Alan Devaney, Meluzzi then reached into his waistband, leading Devaney to believe Meluzzi was armed. Devaney opened fire, killing Meluzzi. Police found no weapon on or near Meluzzi\u2019s body.414\n\n\u2022 Ronnie Goodwin. On May 26, 2005, a SWAT team conducted a drug raid on the Syracuse, New York, home of Sonya Goodwin while looking for drug suspect Angelo Jenkins. Police had Ronnie Goodwin, 13, on the living room floor at gunpoint when a deputy on the SWAT team fired off several shots at the Goodwin\u2019s dog. One of those bullets ricocheted, striking the boy in the leg. Goodwin\u2019s mother later filed a lawsuit, claiming the boy suffered \u201csevere and debilitating\u201d injuries as a result of the bullet.415\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Lynn Noel. On January 21, 2005, Baltimore County, Maryland, police raided the Dundalk neighborhood home of Charles and Cheryl Noel at around 5 a.m. on a narcotics warrant. They\u2019d obtained the warrant after finding marijuana seeds and stems in the Noels\u2019 trash. They deployed a flashbang grenade, then quickly subdued the firstfloor occupants\u2014a man and two young adults. When officers entered the second-floor bedroom of Cheryl Lynn Noel, they broke open her door to find the middle-aged woman in her bed, frightened, pointing a handgun at them. One officer fired three times. Noel died at the scene.416 Friends and acquaintances described Noel as \u201ca wonderful person.\u201d One man collected 200 signatures from friends, neighbors, and coworkers vouching for her character.417 One possible reason Noel brandished a gun to defend herself: Nine years earlier, her stepdaughter had been murdered.418 Police charged Noel\u2019s husband and two children with misdemeanor possession of marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia.419 A subsequent investigation found no wrongdoing on the part of the police.420\n\n\u2022Rhiannon Kephart. In January 2005, 18-year-old Rhiannon Kephart was hospitalized in serious condition after she received severe burns during a pre-dawn paramilitary raid on a Niagara Falls apartment. Kephart\u2014who wasn\u2019t the target of the raid\u2014suffered second- and third-degree burns on her chest and stomach after the flashbang grenade tossed through a window by the raiding officers landed on the bed where she was sleeping. The grenade ignited the bed sheets, setting off a fire in the apartment.421\n\n\u2022James Hoskins. On February 6, 2004, Middletown, Pennsylvania, police stormed the home of James Hoskins on a drug warrant. They were looking for Hoskin\u2019s brother Jim, whom they eventually arrested for possessing \u201ca small amount of marijuana, a glass pipe, and about $622,\u201d according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. 422 When Hoskins heard the loud thud of police breaking into his home, he got up from his bed to investigate, naked and unarmed. As he approached the bedroom door, a Middletown detective pushed his way into Hoskins\u2019 bedroom. Hoskins and his girlfriend say the detective never identified himself. Later explaining that he mistook the T-shirt Hoskins was using to cover his genitalia for a gun, the detective fired. The bullet entered Hoskins\u2019 abdomen, then ripped through his stomach, small intestine, and colon. It eventually lodged in his leg, which later had to be amputated. It wasn\u2019t until weeks later, after he emerged from a coma, that Hoskins learned the man who shot him was a police officer, not a criminal intruder.423 Remarkably, the Middletown Township police department saw no need to conduct an internal investigation of the shooting until prodded by the district attorney.424 The district attorney\u2019s own investigation found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the shooting officer. 425 Hoskins settled a lawsuit with the city of Middletown in 2005 for an undisclosed amount of money. He settled with the local township for $250,000.426\n\n\u2022 Desmond Ray.On December 11, 2002, police in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, were preparing for a SWAT raid on a suspected drug dealer. Just as the raid commenced, Desmond Ray\u2014who wasn\u2019t the target of the raid\u2014got out of a parked car. Cpl. Charles Ramseur says Ray reached for his waistband when exiting the car. Ray says he put his hands in the air. Ramseur fired his weapon at Ray, striking him in the spine and paralyzing him. Ray wasn\u2019t armed and was never charged with a crime. In April 2004, an \u201cExecutive Review Panel\u201d found that Ramseur had no justification for shooting Ray and recommended administrative charges against him for using excessive force. But that recommendation was overruled when the internal police review board later found no wrongdoing. Ramseur was reinstated. The county police settled a civil suit with Ray for an undisclosed sum of money.427\n\n\u2022 Meredith \u201cBuddy\u201d Sutherland. On October 4, 2002, police raided a home in Windsor, Pennsylvania, on suspicion of drug activity. According to news reports, the raid was doomed from the start\u2014the SWAT team was aware that someone inside the home had spotted them, meaning they\u2019d lost the element of surprise SWAT proponents say is the main reason for conducting paramilitary drug raids in the first place. Police raided anyway. Once inside, police went from room to room in the dark home. Trooper Gregory Broaddus entered a bedroom where Meredith \u201cBuddy\u201d Sutherland Jr. was sleeping. Sutherland didn\u2019t live in the house, but was visiting a friend. Officer Broaddus mistakenly thought Sutherland was clutching a weapon when he entered the room, and fired, striking Sutherland. Sutherland had no weapon and was never charged with a crime. Other occupants were eventually charged with drug crimes. Sutherland sued in June 2004 for compensation for his injuries. The state attorney general asked that the suit be dismissed, arguing that the officer in question had immunity and that Sutherland was ultimately responsible for his own injuries.428\n\n\u2022 Julius Powell. On August 22, 2001, police conducted a paramilitary marijuana raid on the Powell family in North Minneapolis, Minnesota. As they were approaching the house to conduct the raid, police shot and killed a pit bull a man was walking just outside the house. One of the bullets ricocheted and struck the forearm of 11-year-old Julius Powell, who at the time was taking out the family trash. Police did find some marijuana in the home. The incident\u2014the latest in a series of police shootings in the city\u2014 sparked riots and protests.429 \u2022 Tony Martinez. On December 20, 2001, police in Travis County, Texas, stormed a mobile home on a no-knock drug warrant. Nineteen-year-old Tony Martinez, nephew of the man named in the warrant, was asleep on the couch. When Martinez rose from the couch as police broke into the home, deputy Derek Hill shot him in the chest, killing him.430 Martinez was unarmed and never suspected of a crime. A grand jury later declined to indict Hill in the shooting.431 The shooting occurred less than a mile from the spot of a botched drug raid that cost Deputy Keith Ruiz his life a year earlier. Hill was also on the raid that ended with the death of Ruiz.432The same Travis County paramilitary unit would later erroneously raid a woman\u2019s home after mistaking ragweed for marijuana plants.\n\n\u2022 Lynette Gayle Jackson. On September 22, 2000, police in Riverdale, Georgia, shot and killed Lynette Gayle Jackson in an early morning, no-knock drug raid. A few weeks earlier, Jackson had been at home alone when burglars broke into her house. She escaped out a window and called the police while the intruders ransacked her home. When police arrived to answer the burglary call, they found a small amount of cocaine in the bedroom, which belonged to Jackson\u2019s boyfriend. While the quantity of cocaine wasn\u2019t sufficient to press charges, police began a subsequent investigation of Jackson\u2019s boyfriend. That investigation led to the September no-knock raid. Jackson, believing she was again being robbed, was holding a gun in her bedroom when the SWAT team entered. Her maintenance man said Jackson had been frightened by the previous burglary, telling the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, \u201cI think she was scared and she probably thought it was another break-in.\u201d433\n\n\u2022 Willie and Charles Alford.On February 27, 2002, police raided the home of 77- year-old Willie Alford on a narcotics warrant issued for his daughter and two grandchildren. Police from the federal Drug Enforcement Agency; the Cumberland County, North Carolina, Sheriff\u2019s Office; and the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation broke into the home at 8 p.m. and, according to Alford, \u201ccame in shooting.\u201d Two children were also present in the home. Police shot Alford\u2019s son Charles, a truck driver visiting from out of town who wasn\u2019t a suspect, in the arm, legs, and side. Police found no weapons in the home. Two suspects named in the warrant were arrested at the site of the raid, and one was arrested the following day.434\n\n\u2022 Jose Colon. On April 19, 2002, police were preparing to conduct a heavily armed late-night drug raid (it included a helicopter) on a home in Bellport, New York. As four paramilitary unit officers rushed across the front lawn, 19-year-old Jose Colon emerged from the targeted house. According to the police account of the raid, as officers approached, one officer tripped over a tree root, then fell forward and into the lead officer, causing his gun to accidentally discharge three times.435 One of the three bullets hit Colon in the side of the head, killing him. Police say they screamed at Colon to \u201cget down\u201d as they approached, though two witnesses told a local newscast that (a) their screams were inaudible over the sound of the helicopter. The witnesses also stated that (b) the officers appeared to be frozen before the shooting\u2014no one tripped.436 Though he was visiting the house at the time, Colon was never suspected of buying or selling drugs. Police proceeded with the raid and seized eight ounces of marijuana. A subsequent investigation found no criminal wrongdoing on the part of police.437 Colon had no criminal record and was months away from becoming the first member of his family to earn a bachelor\u2019s degree. His family is pursuing a lawsuit.438\n\n\u2022 Christie Green. In December 1998, police in Richmond, Virginia, conducted a paramilitary drug raid on an apartment whose occupant was suspected of drug activity. During the raid, Sgt. George Ingram fired \u201cbreaching round\u201d shotgun shells\u2014intended to blow the locks off doors\u2014into the door leading to the apartment\u2019s kitchen. Ingram fired five rounds, one of which went through the door, striking 18-year-old Christie Green in the chest. Green later died from the wound. Green didn\u2019t live at the apartment, and police concede they had no reason to believe she was involved in any drug activity or that she knew any was going on in the apartment. Green\u2019s family sued both the city of Richmond and the manufacturer of the round, which is designed to dissolve on impact. In 2002, a circuit court jury found that the manufacturer of the round wasn\u2019t liable for Green\u2019s death. Then, in 2004, a judge in Richmond found that the officer who fired the round wasn\u2019t liable either.439 In March 2005, the Virginia State Supreme Court reinstated the case against the city and the officer, ruling that a jury, not a judge, should make the determination of liability. In January 2006, a jury found Officer Ingram grossly negligent in the raid and awarded the Green family $1.5 million in damages.440\n\n\u2022 Delbert Bonar. On October 15, 1998, deputies in Washington County, Ohio, made an unannounced nighttime entry into the home of 57-year-old Delbert Bonar, a retired school janitor. Police had a search warrant to look for stolen weapons and marijuana in the possession of Albert Bonar, Delbert\u2019s son. Police claim that upon their entering the home, the elder Bonar grabbed a shotgun and ignored orders to release it. Albert Bonar\u2019s wife disputes this account of the raid. Police shot Delbert Bonar eight times, killing him. Police found a small amount of marijuana in the house. Though the Washington County sheriff insisted his men acted properly, the county paid the Bonar family a $450,000 settlement in 2003.441 The Threat to Law Enforcement Because SWAT raids escalate the violence associated with executing a search warrant, they not only increase the odds of unintended civilian casualties, but they can lead\u2014and have led\u2014to tragic consequences for police officers, too. The volatility of these raids means that the slightest of errors\u2014not just in ensuring that the information on the warrants is correct but in the actual execution of the raids\u2014can be catastrophic for everyone involved. The following is a partial list of raids in which police officers were killed or injured:\n\n\u2022 The Jillian King Raid. On January 14, 2003, Jillian D. King shot and wounded a Muncie, Indiana, police officer as a SWAT team in black masks and camouflage conducted a raid on her boyfriend\u2019s home. Officers were serving a no-knock warrant after finding cocaine inside the car of another resident of the house. King, who had been previously robbed at gunpoint, fired at what she thought were intruders.442 \u201cI saw what appeared to be a burglar jerking at the door,\u201d she told the court. \u201cI ran down and got a gun and shot out a window.\u201d King was never charged with drug possession but was charged with felony criminal recklessness. During her trial, King said if she had known the intruders were police, \u201cI would have opened the door.\u201d The prosecutor described her as having \u201can itchy trigger finger.\u201d Though individual Muncie SWAT team members testified they \u201calways\u201d announce themselves and wait before entering a residence, they also said they typically wait just five seconds between knocking and forcing entry, clearly not enough time for a suspect in another room or asleep to answer. Video of the raid in question showed officers prying open doors before knocking or announcing.443 King originally pled guilty to the charge, but a judge refused to accept her plea. The jury deadlocked in her trial.444\n\n\u2022 The Lewis Cauthorne Raid.On January 7, 2003, prosecutors in Baltimore, Maryland, announced they would not seek charges against Lewis S. Cauthorne for firing a .45-caliber handgun at police who broke down his door during a no-knock raid in November 2002. Cauthorne, at home with his mother, girlfriend, and three-year-old daughter, heard screaming when police broke open the door to his home and began searching for drugs without identifying themselves. Prosecutors determined that Cauthorne, who had no arrest record and whose father had been robbed and killed as a cab driver, had reason to believe his life was in danger when he fired and wounded four of the raiding police officers. Police fired back, but fortunately, no one in the family was hurt. Police were acting on a tip from a confidential informant and claim to have found six bags with traces of marijuana, empty vials, a razor with cocaine residue, and two scales in Cauthorne\u2019s home. But the ensuing investigation found peculiarities with the evidence that precluded Cauthorne from being charged with even a misdemeanor. There was no record of where exactly in the home the drugs had been found, for example, and police told crime lab technicians not to photograph the evidence. The officers who conducted the raid were also unavailable for interviews with investigators until days or weeks after the raid took place. Though never charged, Cauthorne served more than six weeks in jail before the charges against him were dismissed.445\n\n\u2022 Officer Ron Jones. On December 26, 2001, police in Prentiss, Mississippi, served search warrants on two apartments in a duplex. One apartment was occupied by Jamie Smith, named in the warrant as a \u201cknown drug dealer.\u201d The other was occupied by Cory Maye, who had no criminal record and wasn\u2019t named in the warrants. At the time of the raid, Maye was asleep with his 18- month-old daughter. After attempting to enter through the front door, police moved to the back and broke down the door to Maye\u2019s bedroom. Officer Ron Jones was the first police officer to enter. Maye, who says he feared for his life, fired three times, striking Jones once. Maye\u2019s bullet hit Jones in the abdomen, just below his bulletproof vest. Jones died a short time later. Police found only traces of marijuana in Maye\u2019s apartment, after first telling reporters they\u2019d found no drugs at all. Officer Jones was the only officer who conducted the investigation leading up to the raid and apparently kept no notes of his investigation. According to the district attorney and prosecutor in the Maye case, all evidence of the investigation leading to the raid on Maye\u2019s home \u201cdied with Officer Jones.\u201d446 In January 2004, Maye was convicted of capital murder for the death of Jones and sentenced to die by lethal injection.447\n\n\u2022 Deputy Keith Ruiz. On February 15, 2001, police raided the Del Valle, Texas, mobile home of Edwin Delamora, where he lived with his wife and two children. As two deputies beat down his door with a battering ram, Delamora fired, fearing he was under attack. One bullet from his gun struck and killed sheriff\u2019s deputy Keith Ruiz. Delamora had no previous criminal record and his defense attorney says the raid on his home was influenced by an anonymous informant who turned out to be the brother of two sheriff\u2019s deputies. Information about the informant\u2019s relationship with the police was suppressed at trial. Delamora was eventually convicted of capital murder and sentenced to life in prison. Police found less than an ounce of methamphetamine and one ounce of marijuana in his home. Prosecutors declined to seek the death penalty because of substantial doubt over whether Delamora knew the officers were police or whether he genuinely believed them to be intruders.448\n\n\u2022 Deputies James Moulson and Philip Anderson; George Timothy Williams. On January 3, 2001, Jerome County, Idaho, sheriff\u2019s deputies James Moulson and Phillip Anderson conducted a raid on the home of George Timothy Williams. The warrant for the raid contained information from a confidential informant asserting that Williams was one of the leading suppliers of marijuana in the county. Moulson and Anderson conducted the raid at night, wearing camouflage. It\u2019s unclear whether they announced themselves before entering. Williams fired when the deputies entered, and the deputies returned fire. All three died in the shootout. A subsequent search turned up less than four grams of marijuana. Lawsuits brought by the families of both slain deputies and by Williams\u2019s family revealed that the informant was a woman who lived with Williams. One suit alleges that the sheriff\u2019s department threatened to take away the woman\u2019s child if she didn\u2019t give them the information they needed to get the warrant. The county settled with the family of one deputy.449 A federal court dismissed the lawsuit brought by Williams\u2019s family. An Idaho state police investigation found no wrongdoing on the part of the sheriff\u2019s department or the deputies who conducted the raid.450\n\n\u2022Officer David Eales.On September 24, 1999, police in Sallisaw, Oklahoma, procured a no-knock warrant on the home of Eugene Barrett, suspected of trafficking methamphetamine. As the police vehicles descended upon his home, Barrett opened fire. One bullet struck and killed Oklahoma Highway Patrol Officer David Eales. Barrett claims he was acting in self defense. After a state jury declined to give Barrett the death penalty, he was tried again in federal court, convicted, and sentenced to death.451\n\n\u2022 The Mary Lou Coonfield Raid. In August 1996, Tulsa police raided the home of 70-year-old Mary Lou Coonfield on a drug warrant. Coonfield awoke to find a man in black standing in her bedroom, holding a gun. She grabbed a .22- caliber pistol and fired, wounding Tulsa County Deputy Sheriff Newt Ellenbarger. The warrant for Coonfield was later thrown out, ruled in both 1996 and 1997 to be illegal. In 1999, a jury acquitted Coonfield of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and feloniously pointing a weapon. Coonfield was acquitted because of Oklahoma\u2019s \u201cMake My Day\u201d law, which states that \u201can occupant of a house is justified in using physical force, including deadly force, against another person who has unlawfully entered the house if the occupant reasonably believes that the other person might use any physical force, no matter how slight, against any occupant of the house.\u201d Coonfield, who\u2019s both hard of hearing and has poor eyesight, says she didn\u2019t hear police announce themselves before entering, and thought she was being robbed.452\n\n\u2022 Officer James Jensen. On March 13, 1996, the Oxnard, California, SWAT team conducted an early morning drug raid on a home that turned out to be unoccupied. In the maze of smoke and light that followed the deployment of a flashbang grenade, a fellow SWAT team member, who would later reveal that his judgment was clouded by Vicodin, mistook Officer James Jensen for a hostile occupant of the house and shot him dead. Jensen\u2019s family won a $3.5 million settlement from the city of Oxnard in 1999.453\n\n\u2022 The Andre Madison Raid.On November 7, 1995, police in North Minneapolis, Minnesota, raided the home of Andre Madison. After local media merely recounted the police version of events, Minneapolis City Pages conducted an indepth investigation. According to the paper\u2019s account, police obtained a noknock warrant on Madison\u2019s home after a confidential informant allegedly purchased some marijuana at the residence.454 At about 8 p.m., the Minneapolis paramilitary unit, called ERU, deployed flashbang grenades at the front of Madison\u2019s home. At the same time, police from the city\u2019s housing unit were entering the home from the rear. Reports at the time say police began firing when Madison fired his shotgun at them. But a forensics team later determined that Madison\u2019s gun was never fired the night of the raid. Instead, an investigation conducted by a police chief from a nearby county speculated that the housing unit officers mistook the flashbang grenades deployed by the ERU unit for gunfire from the suspect and opened fire themselves. The two police units then mistook one another for assailants and began to fire upon one another. When Officer Mark Lanasa went down, shot in the neck by a colleague, the commanding officer called for \u201csuppressive fire,\u201d giving officers carte blanche to shoot at will. Upon hearing that a fellow officer had gone down, more police soon arrived at the scene. They too joined in the shooting. Hundreds of rounds were fired into the building. There were bullet holes found in neighboring buildings, as well. Madison, the suspect, was shot in the neck and the arm. Miraculously, no one was killed.455 Police found only a small amount of marijuana in Madison\u2019s home. He was never charged with a drug crime. He was charged with four felony counts of second-degree assault with a firearm\u2014not for shooting, but for pointing his shotgun at police. He could have been sentenced to 12 years in prison. Madison insists he thought the police were intruders. Prosecutors then offered to let Madison plead to a misdemeanor count of reckless use of a firearm, which carries a sentence of just 90 days. The hitch was that a guilty plea to the lesser charge would have prevented Madison from suing the city. The subsequent investigation and report from the outside police chief concluded that Minneapolis\u2019s ERU unit \u201cexecutes too many warrants and relies too heavily on dynamic (door-ramming) raids,\u201d explaining that \u201cthere are other alternative tactics that ERU is aware of. However when so many raids are conducted using dynamic entry, other tactics may be forgotten.\u201d456 Confronting Nonviolent Offenders with Violent Tactics Drug war supporters and casual observers often find it difficult to criticize paramilitary raids ending in the death or injury of nonviolent drug users or dealers, noting that those people are, after all, breaking the law. If drugs are found at the scene, even raids ending in a suspect\u2019s death are somehow deemed less troubling than raids ending in the deaths of innocents. The case against the suspect and in favor of the decision to raid with a paramilitary unit seems to grow stronger if the suspect also possesses weapons, or worse, points them at or attempts to use them against the raiding police officers. Perhaps it\u2019s true that such scenarios shouldn\u2019t trouble us as much as raids on the homes of innocents. But they\u2019re still troubling, for two reasons. First, by some estimates, more than 96 million Americans have consumed marijuana at some point in their lives.457 The overwhelming majority of them have done so peacefully and at the expense of no one else. Legalizing marijuana is a debate for another time. But it would be absurd to suggest that the 96 million Americans who have tried or continue to smoke marijuana have effectively given up their Fourth Amendment rights. Smoking marijuana, or even selling it to someone else, isn\u2019t a violent crime and, consequently, doesn\u2019t merit a home invasion by police armed with the weaponry and mindset of soldiers. It certainly doesn\u2019t merit death. Yet a troublingly high number of these raids are aimed at marijuana offenders. Second, as discussed earlier, given the tactics associated with no-knock warrants, it isn\u2019t difficult to see why people might grab weapons to defend themselves and their families when police violently storm a home late at night or just before dawn. That a suspect pointed a weapon at police serving a noknock warrant doesn\u2019t prove that the suspect was violent or a threat to the public. It only proves that someone in the privacy of his own home was understandably threatened by the presence of armed intruders. The fact that police find weapons or marijuana at the scene of a raid, then, still doesn\u2019t mean paramilitary tactics and forced entry were justified. It\u2019s possible\u2014likely, even\u2014that millions of Americans are both harmless recreational marijuana users and legal gun owners. The presence of both doesn\u2019t make them a threat to the community. And the only legitimate use of paramilitary units like SWAT teams, indeed the reason they were originally implemented, is to deal with real, immediate, and obvious threats to the public safety. Perhaps the best example of how such violent tactics unleashed on nonviolent drug users invite tragedy is the case of Clayton Helriggle. Clayton Helriggle. Helriggle, 23, lived in a house with four roommates in West Alexandria, Ohio. In September 2002, a local SWAT team conducted a no-knock raid on the house. Local police had only recently put the SWAT team together\u2014the most experienced members of the team had less than four hours of tactical training. Others had never trained with the SWAT team before. A postraid report would later find that \u201cwrong dates were used in an affidavit, and investigators questioned why so little time was provided for surveillance of the house and why there were no controlled narcotic purchases from the house.\u201d458According to the Dayton Daily News, the search warrant was \u201clargely based on overheard conversations, a few hours of surveillance, and the word of a convicted felon who had recently lied to a court to remain free on bond.\u201d Informant Kevin Leitch insisted there were \u201cpounds and pounds\u201d of marijuana at the residence and specifically identified Helriggle as a dealer. Leitch later told investigators he was mistaken. Helriggle\u2019s family says he was a recreational marijuana smoker, though not a dealer.459 On September 27, 2002, 25\u201330 police officers emerged from nearby woods and swarmed the farmhouse. SWAT officers detonated several flashbang grenades on the first floor, then used a battering ram to force their way into the rented farmhouse. As police in shields and body armor subdued three of the house\u2019s occupants, Helriggle, asleep in an upstairs bedroom, was awakened by the commotion and descended the stairs. Police at the scene say he was carrying a handgun at the time. Helriggle\u2019s roommates insist that while Helriggle did own a licensed handgun, he\u2019d left it in the bedroom and was holding a blue cup of water. Whatever Helriggle was holding, his last words\u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u2014indicate he wasn\u2019t aware that the armed intruders in his home were police. A SWAT team member interpreted the item in his hand to be a gun and put a single shotgun blast into Helriggle\u2019s chest. He died at the scene, in the arms of one of his roommates.460 Immediately after the raid, police told local reporters that they\u2019d found marijuana, pills, weapons, drug paraphernalia, and drug \u201cpackaging materials\u201d at the home. The pills proved to be a bottle of prescribed codeine. The weapons were Helriggle\u2019s legal handgun, an old shotgun, and a .22-caliber rifle, not particularly unusual for an Ohio farmhouse. The \u201cpackaging materials\u201d turned out to be a box of sandwich bags. And police found less than an ounce of marijuana. No charges were filed against any of the house\u2019s occupants.461 In addition to the tip from an unreliable informant, police raided the farmhouse on the basis of evidence they say they collected while conducting surveillance. As it turns out, that evidence too was questionable. Officer George Petitt, who both conducted the surveillance and planned the raid, told investigators he concluded the farmhouse was a \u201cdope house, just by the activity\u201d of cars pulling in and out of the driveway. But when pressed, he conceded that he had no firsthand knowledge of a single marijuana deal that took place at the farmhouse.462 The absurdity of using a highly armed, poorly trained SWAT team to carry out a violent, volatile raid on a house rented by recreational marijuana users was captured by Ian Albert, a resident of the farmhouse who also happened to have just completed Navy SEAL training. It was Albert who held Helriggle in his arms as he bled to death. According to the Dayton Daily News Albert\u2019s first thought at the time was \u201cWow, they took down a farm of unarmed hippies.\u201d \u201cIf they would have come to the door and said, \u2018Give us your dope, hippies,\u2019\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019d have gotten about a $100 ticket.\u201d463 A grand jury and internal investigation later found no criminal wrongdoing on the part of police officers but did find the SWAT team \u201cill prepared\u201d and \u201clack[ing] experience in dangerous searches.\u201d464 The grand jury report also noted that the officers who conducted the raid had refused to cooperate with investigators.465 In January 2004, Greene County, Ohio, prosecutor Bill Schenk suggested the possibility of reopening the Helriggle case, saying that he was concerned that Helriggle had been publicly portrayed as a drug dealer. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that there was no drug dealing by Mr. Helriggle,\u201d he told the Dayton Daily News. 466 Despite the fact that he was at the time awaiting sentencing for more than a dozen crimes, including forgery, theft, burglary, breaking and entering, and safecracking, informant Kevin Leitch was never charged for lying to police officers, nor was he charged for lying under oath to the grand jury investigating the raid.467 These kinds of cases are increasingly common. It\u2019s now routine for police to deploy SWAT teams to serve search warrants on nonviolent marijuana suspects for crimes that in many cases barely qualify as misdemeanors. These unnecessari-ly violent and confrontational tactics are, also, increasingly bearing tragic results. Some examples:\n\n\u2022 Leesburg, Virginia. In January 2006, police in Leesburg used flashbang grenades while raiding the home of a marijuana suspect. Police obtained the warrant after sifting through trash bags outside the house. They found one small bag of marijuana.468\n\n\u2022 Decatur, Alabama. In October 2005, police in Decatur raided a family home on a marijuana warrant. Police shot and killed two of the family\u2019s dogs and, according to the targets of the raid, made jokes about the dead pets while the suspects were in custody. Police seized eight grams of marijuana, or about enough to fill a ketchup packet.469\n\n\u2022 Shannon Hills, Arkansas. In February 2005, police in Shannon Hills stormed a home with their guns drawn during a toddler\u2019s birthday party. The target was a pregnant woman attending the party. Police arrested her on suspicion of distributing marijuana. Police Chief Richard Friend told one reporter, referencing the birthday, \u201cWe got them something they wish they could return.\u201d470\n\n\u2022 Angela King. On May 17, 2004, Perry County, Kentucky, police raided the home of Dennis Ray and Angela King on suspicion of marijuana distribution. Deputy Sheriff John Couch shot Angela King twice, once in the head, in the course of the raid. Police say King fired a weapon at them first, though the couple\u2019s 14-year-old-son\u2014also in the home at the time of the raid and who was subdued with a policeman\u2019s foot on his shoulder\u2014says he heard only two shots. The police were cleared of all wrongdoing in the shooting. Dennis Ray was arrested on charges of distributing marijuana.471\n\n\u2022 Linda Florek.On December 7, 2004, at 10 p.m., police in Mundelein, Illinois, broke down the door to the home of 48- year-old Linda Florek. They then ordered Florek and her son to the floor and handcuffed them. Shortly into the raid, Florek\u2014who has a cardiac condition\u2014told police she was having chest pains, possibly a heart attack. According to a lawsuit later filed by Florek, police refused to let her take an aspirin or to call an ambulance. Ninety minutes later, the officers finally believed her and called an ambulance. Florek was eventually admitted to a hospital, where doctors determined she\u2019d had a heart attack and needed immediate surgery. Police issued Florek a ticket and fine for the misdemeanor possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana.472\n\n\u2022 Shay Neace. On March 22, 2003, police in SWAT attire raided a home in Canton, Ohio, on a marijuana warrant, looking for a man with a history of marijuana distribution. There was a party at the home that night. As the raid commenced, Officer William Watson of the Perry Township Police Department made his way to the home\u2019s second floor, and pulled open the door to a bathroom. Inside, 24-year-old Shay Neace and his brother Seth were smoking marijuana. Watson pushed a gun through the door and ordered everyone in the bathroom to the floor. Neace and his brother say Watson never announced himself. They thought they were being robbed. Shay Neace grabbed Watson\u2019s gun and pushed it away. He then pushed the gunman\u2014 Watson\u2014out into the hall. At that point, Watson fired, hitting Neace in the shoulder and in the back. The second shot left Neace paralyzed. Officer Watson was cleared of all charges by a grand jury. Neace was indicted by a separate grand jury, then acquitted in a criminal trial of obstructing an investigation and resisting arrest. Neace\u2019s civil suit against Watson is still pending.473\n\n\u2022 Robert Filgo. On September 2, 2003, police in Fremont, California, forced open the door of 41-year-old marijuana patient Robert Filgo, who had both a doctor\u2019s prescription and a certificate from the city of Oakland permitting him to possess the drug. Police entered, forced Filgo to the floor at gunpoint, then shot his pet Akita nine times, killing it. The Alameda County District Attorney\u2019s Office later declined to press charges against Filgo.474\n\n\u2022 Marcella Monroe and Tam Davage.In October 2002, police in Eugene, Oregon, assembled a massive show of force\u201452 police officers from four agencies in full SWAT attire, assault weapons, shotguns, and an armored vehicle borrowed from the Oregon National Guard\u2014to conduct a raid on three homes in the Whitaker neighborhood they suspected of growing marijuana. All three homes were owned by one couple, Marcella Monroe and Tam Davage. Davage and Monroe lived in one of the homes, with two tenants. They were renovating the other two houses, which had been destroyed in a windstorm. Police officers were aware that there were likely to be only three or four people at most in the three homes, despite the force of 52 officers they brought for the raid.475 The massive SWAT team was dressed in black or in camouflage and wore ski masks. They deployed flashbang grenades, then forced entry into the home occupied by Davage, Monroe, and their tenants without announcing themselves. They pulled the two couples out of bed and wrestled them to the ground. They put assault weapons to residents\u2019 heads, tightly handcuffed them, and refused to let the two women, who were partially nude, cover themselves (they also took photos of the women before allowing them to dress).476 When Monroe asked if she could put on some clothing, one officer put a black bag over her head and tightened it around her neck. Because police at that point had still failed to identify themselves, Monroe says she believed she was about to be executed (as for the black bag tactic, the Eugene Police Department had been warned to discontinue the practice by the National Tactical Officers Association, who cautioned that \u201cthis practice is not acceptable in the law enforcement community,\u201d that it \u201chas no lawful purpose,\u201d and though it is commonly used in military operations, \u201cit has no place in civilian operations\u201d).477 Monroe also sustained a cut on her head after one officer pushed her to the ground and put a boot on the back of her neck.478 Police found no plants, no weapons, and only \u201cresidue\u201d of marijuana in a couple of plastic bags, for which the couple\u2019s tenant was issued a misdemeanor citation. Neither Monroe nor Davage had a criminal record, and none of the occupants had any history of violent crime.479 Nevertheless, police still charged Davage and Monroe with felony manufacture of a controlled substance. They cited the evidence they\u2019d found: fans, fluorescent lights, plastic sheeting, timers, potting equipment, sandwich bags, a scale, 24 electrical outlets, and a shop vacuum. Of course, none of those items is illegal, and in the case of Davage and Monroe, all were perfectly sensible to have around: Davage was a work-athome jeweler, explaining the lights and the outlets. Monroe owned a landscaping business, explaining the potting supplies and vacuum. Of course, as noted, the two were also renovating all three houses, as police could have easily ascertained, both during the raid and during the undercover visit one officer paid to the couple (posing as a potential tenant) before securing a warrant for the raid.480 Monroe had come to the attention of police when they\u2019d busted a marijuana growing operation in Portland, where they found cashier\u2019s checks made payable to her. What the officer failed to mention in the affidavit, however, was that the checks were clearly identified as payment for landscaping services and were made in the name of Monroe\u2019s business. The most recent check was dated 1997, five years before the raid.481 In a subsequent lawsuit, Monroe and Davage outlined a host of other misleading assertions and questionable omissions in the affidavit that led to the raid on their home. The officer, for example, cites unusually the high use of electricity, the presence of potting soil, an electrical cord, and a \u201chumming noise,\u201d as grounds to suspect cultivation of marijuana. The affidavit never mentioned Monroe\u2019s landscaping business, Davage\u2019s jewelry business, or the fact that the couple was repairing their home from storm damage, though the officer was aware of all three. The affidavit also makes no mention of the possibility of weapons, disposability of evidence, or violent tendencies of any of the home\u2019s occupants, all of which would have been required to justify a no-knock raid.482 Police defended the raid as entirely necessary and appropriate, given the well-known danger posed by people who grow marijuana. The spokesman for one of the task forces involved in the raid added that \u201cthe community at large\u201d approved of such tactics. The Whitaker Community Council later condemned the raid at a public neighborhood meeting, as well as in a press release.483\n\n\u2022 Jeffery Robinson. On July 30, 2002, police stormed the home of Jeffery Robinson, a 41-year-old gravedigger in South Memphis, Tennessee. Robinson lived in a small building on the site of the cemetery that employed him. Police conducted the raid on the basis of an anonymous tip that someone was selling marijuana on the cemetery grounds. Raiding officers kicked in Robinson\u2019s bedroom door and immediately shot Robinson in the neck. Robinson died three weeks later. Police say Robinson charged them with a box cutter. They also found a small amount of marijuana near a camper in Robinson\u2019s backyard and charged him with possession, even as he lay in a hospital fighting for his life. A review by the Memphis police department\u2019s internal affairs unit and the Attorney General\u2019s Office found no wrongdoing on the part of the police. For two and a half years, the officers who participated in that raid remained on the Memphis police force. But in October of 2004, the jury in a federal civil suit brought by Robinson\u2019s family made some striking findings: The jury concluded that the box cutter police say Robinson charged them with\u2014which was never fingerprinted\u2014 was planted on Robinson after the raid. During the trial, a medical examiner and blood spatter expert also testified that the shooting couldn\u2019t possibly have happened the way the officers say it did. Further, the shirt Robinson wore, as well as the shirt of the officer who shot him, vanished after the raid. Trial testimony revealed that police bought a new polo shirt, still in its wrapper, and tagged it as the shirt Robinson wore the night he was shot. The federal jury concluded that the officers shot Robinson without justification, then tampered with the evidence to cover up their mistakes. The jury also cast doubt on the ensuing investigation by the police department\u2019s internal affairs division.484 In February 2005, the eight officers involved in the raid were finally suspended, more than two years after the raid.485 Robinson\u2019s family won a $2.85 million verdict against the officers and negotiated a $1 million settlement from the city of Memphis.486\n\n\u2022 Vernard Davis.In January 2001, police in Rochester, New York, conducted a late-night drug raid at the home of Vernard Davis. During the raid, Officer David Gebhardt\u2019s shotgun accidentally discharged as he stumbled through a dark room. The blast hit Davis in the chest, killing him. Davis left behind two toddlers and one six-year-old. Police did find a significant amount of drugs in the room, but no weapons. In 2004, the city of Rochester awarded Davis\u2019s children a $300,000 settlement. The presiding judge called the shooting \u201ca tragic, unintended accident.\u201d487\n\n\u2022 Jacqueline Paasch. In early 2000, a SWAT team from the Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, sheriff\u2019s department broke into the home of Jacqueline Paasch and her two brothers on a no-knock drug warrant for suspicion of marijuana possession. Paasch says she heard footsteps rumbling up the stairs, but before she could figure out what was happening, her door was kicked in, a gun went off, and she was on the floor, bleeding. Paasch was hit in the leg, incurred $19,000 in medical expenses, endured a year of rehabilitation, and was told she\u2019ll always walk with a limp. Police found a \u201cvery small amount of marijuana and a pipe\u201d in the house, according to local news reports, though not enough to press charges against anyone in the house. In 2000, Paasch settled with the Village of West Milwaukee for $700,000. \u201cThe fact that this can happen to me and my family has made me realize that it can happen to anyone,\u201d Paasch told one media outlet. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really frightening because the police are the ones you\u2019re supposed to count on to protect you.\u201d488\n\n\u2022 Troy Davis. On December 15, 1999, police in North Richland Hills, Texas, raided the home of Troy Davis, the son of a well-known \u201ctrue crime\u201d writer. The raid was based on the word of a single, anonymous informant that Davis was growing marijuana in one of the house\u2019s closets. That informant turned out to be Davis\u2019s uncle, who had tipped off police after a long-running dispute with Davis\u2019s mother. A local municipal judge had originally denied Sgt. Andy Wallace\u2019s initial attempt to obtain the no-knock warrant, citing insufficient evidence. So Wallace merely went to a second judge in Fort Worth and got his approval. On the night of the raid one team pried open (with some difficulty) Davis\u2019s back door, while another team went around to the front. According to police, Davis came to investigate the noises outside his home while carrying a gun (his family denies he was holding a weapon). Upon seeing the gun, raiding officers shot Davis in the chest, killing him. According to officers at the scene, Davis\u2019s last words were, \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d Though police did find three marijuana plants, GHB, and a few small bags of marijuana in Davis\u2019s home, ensuing investigations revealed significant problems in the way Richland Hills police executed the search warrant. In fact, further investigation found flaws in the way the same police department conducted nearly all of its drug raids. First, attorneys for the Davis family found that the police department had a policy of conducting no-knock raids for every narcotics search warrant issued, a clear violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Richards. Second, according to the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram, \u201cA year before the [Davis raid], two of the team\u2019s members told superiors they were concerned that lax standards for the unit could leave it vulnerable to lawsuits.\u201d Team leader Joe Walley later told a court that he was \u201cvery uncomfortable\u201d about the Davis raid and that he felt the team was \u201cdoing a tactical operation without anything to go on.\u201d Another officer came back from sniper school and told superiors that nearly everything the North Richland Hills SWAT team was doing was wrong. Yet another later said in a deposition of the Davis raid, \u201cWe should never have been there.\u201d According to court records reviewed by the StarTelegram, Sergeant Wallace did little corroborating investigation after getting the tip from Davis\u2019s uncle. There were no controlled buys or surveillance.489 After the Davis raid, the two officers who had warned superiors about inadequacies with the SWAT team were suspended. Another officer who told the media and the Davis family attorneys about his concerns quit five months after the raid, citing harassment by superiors. Two other officers who were forthcoming with criticism of the police department also quit.490 In 2004, a state appeals court ruled the warrant for the raid that killed Davis was invalid. The court found that the warrant failed to show that the informant for the raid was reliable, and that Sgt. Wallace failed to do any independent investigation to corroborate the informant\u2019s tips.491 Even after the raid and ensuing revelations about poor training and preparation, North Richland Hills officials couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t say what changes police had implemented to be sure a similar mistake wouldn\u2019t occur again. The Forth Worth Star-Telegram reported that in 2005, during depositions for the civil suit brought by Davis\u2019s family, responses from city officials indicated that raid procedures were never examined after the raid. Attorney Mark Haney, representing the Davis family, expressed frustration that no one from the city would claim responsibility for overseeing police procedures. \u201cIs there anybody? . . . Who is it? Who can talk about this topic?\u201d he asked of North Richland Hills city attorney Greg Staples. Staples replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not my problem. That\u2019s your problem.\u201d492 The mayor of North Richland Hills testified that neither he nor the city council were responsible for oversight of the city\u2019s police department. The city manager testified that he oversaw hiring and firing but that police procedures were determined by the police chief. The police chief said he answered to the city manager. When Haney asked the city manger if he had ordered any investigation into the death of Davis, he replied, \u201cNo I did not.\u201d When asked if he had knowledge of any subsequent city investigation, he answered, \u201cI\u2019m not aware of any.\u201d493\n\n\u2022Linda Elsea.Elsea smoked marijuana to treat her fibromylagia after the successful campaign for Initiative 692, a Washington State measure authorizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes. In 1999, she came out of the bathroom to find a team of SWAT soldiers armed with assault weapons barreling up her driveway. She was handcuffed, subject to a body cavity search, and taken to the police station.494\n\n\u2022 Rusty Windle.In early 1999 in Wimberly, Texas, a paid police informant and former felon befriended electrician\u2019s assistant Alexander \u201cRusty\u201d Windle after meeting him at a bar frequented by tradesmen. The informant had been working the area for more than four months, winning friends by throwing parties stocked with beer and food. The informant convinced Windle to get him two half-ounce bags of marijuana, the Texas minimum for a felony charge. When Windle delivered, police obtained an arrest warrant. One witness said of the informant, \u201cHe asked everybody to get him pot, he practically begged you for it.\u201d495 On May 17, 1999, nine police officers conducted a pre-dawn raid on Windle\u2019s home. Officer accounts differ on whether or not they announced they were police, though the other targets of raids that night (based on information gathered from the same informant) say police never announced themselves before executing the warrants. The police who raided Windle\u2019s home were dressed entirely in black. Windle awoke, and came to the door with a gun. Police say that when they heard the slide action of a rifle bolt, Officer Chase Strapp backed away from the door. As he did, he tripped over a potted plant. Seeing armed men in black approaching his house, and watching one retreat from his porch, Windle pointed his weapon at Strapp. Strapp fired four rounds, hitting Windle three times, killing him. Police found less than an ounce of marijuana in Windle\u2019s home.496\n\n\u2022Lisa Swartz and the Medical Marijuana Raids.In August 2004, 38 medical marijuana patients filed simultaneous lawsuits against state law enforcement agencies in California for seizing marijuana from their homes in violation of state law. One of them was Lisa Swartz, who described a raid on her home to the online publication AlterNet: During the conference call, she told of being raided at gunpoint in 1999. \u201cThey came with a narc SWAT team, pointing semi-automatic weapons at my grandkids\u2019 heads,\u201d she said before breaking into tears. \u201cIt was a terrible experience and totally changed my view of everything. I used to believe the police were there to protect and defend us. It is just so bizarre that they do this to people,\u201d said Swartz. \u201cEven if we get our property back, this still takes a terrible toll on our families.\u201d Swartz spent 18 months and $50,000 on her defense before authorities dropped the charges. \u201cThey never apologized and they never gave me my medicine back,\u201d she said.497\n\n\u2022 Willie Heard. On February 13, 1999, police in Osawatomie, Kansas, conducted a 1:30 a.m. raid on the home of 46- year-old Willie Heard. Police say they announced themselves, though Heard\u2019s daughter, who was home at the time, told the Topeka Capital-Journal, \u201c[A]ll I heard them say was \u2018Get Down! Freeze!\u2019\u201d Heard awoke, and met officers in his bedroom with a .22-caliber rifle. Seeing the gun, a raiding officer opened fire and shot Heard dead. Though the search warrant was for crack cocaine and related paraphernalia, police found only the burnt remnants of an herb that couldn\u2019t be tested. If it had been marijuana, it would have barely been enough for two cigarettes.498 Prosecutors declined to press charges against the police who conducted the raid.499 In 2001, Heard\u2019s family won a $3.5 million settlement from Miami County and the cities of Osawatomie and Paola. The lawsuit contended that police had targeted the wrong home. At least one member of the SWAT team later apologized to Heard\u2019s family for their mistakes.500\n\n\u2022 David Doran.In August 1998, police in Kansas City, Missouri, conducted a noknock raid on the home of David Doran on suspicion that he was dealing methamphetamine. Doran says he was asleep when police entered and that because he thought he was being robbed, he came out of his bedroom holding a gun. Police say Doran didn\u2019t comply with orders to get down. Doran says he tried to surrender. Raiding officers shot Doran, inflicting injuries that required a two-week hospital stay and the loss of his only functioning kidney. A jury subsequently awarded Doran $2 million, but in June 2005 the Eighth Circuit Federal Appeals Court overturned the award, concluding that police were justified in conducting a no-knock raid on Doran\u2019s home. Police found no methamphetamine, nor did they find any evidence that Doran had ever operated a methamphetamine lab. They did find a small amount of marijuana.501\n\n\u2022 Michael Swimmer. In the summer of 1998, police in Orange County, Florida, shot and killed 27-year-old Michael Swimmer in a 2:30 a.m. drug raid. Police shot Swimmer six times after he confronted the raiding SWAT team with a handgun. Police conducted the raid after a tip from a confidential informant that Swimmer, an amateur bodybuilder, was selling ecstasy.502\n\n\u2022 Chinue Tao Hashim. On February 21, 1998, a deputy in Greenville County, South Carolina, shot and killed unarmed drug suspect Chinue Tao Hashim during a SWAT raid. While negotiating a drug deal with Hashim, one undercover officer said over the radio that \u201ca gun is on the table,\u201d meaning that a gun was part of the bargain. When the SWAT team raided, Master Deputy John Eldridge interpreted the radio remark about the gun to mean that Hashim was armed. As the raid commenced, Eldridge thought he saw Hashim reaching for a gun and opened fire. A subsequent investigation revealed that what Eldridge thought was a gun was actually the glint from a wristwatch.503 Prosecutors declined to press charges against Eldridge.504\n\n\u2022 Barry Hodge. On August 4, 1997, police in Selmer, Tennessee, broke down the door to the home of Barry and Sheila Hodge on a no-knock drug raid. According to a $25 million lawsuit filed by Hodge\u2019s widow in 1998, police never announced themselves before entering. By the time the raid was over police had shot Barry Hodge in the arm and chest, killing him. Sheila Hodge claims she was thrown to the floor and handcuffed, and the Hodge\u2019s daughter was locked in her bedroom. Press accounts don\u2019t say if police found marijuana in the home.505\n\n\u2022 Richard Paey. In March 1997, police in Pasco County, Florida, arrested Richard Paey on charges of prescription fraud. Paey, a multiple sclerosis patient suffering from the effects of a car accident and subsequent botched back surgery, is wheelchair-bound and paraplegic. His various ailments required him to take significant quantities of painkillers to lead a normal life. Unfortunately, Florida law made it difficult for him to get the medication he needed. Prosecutors accused Paey of forging prescriptions, though they conceded that there\u2019s no evidence he was selling or distributing. Despite Paey\u2019s condition, and the fact that he obviously posed no threat to anyone, prosecutors sent a SWAT team to arrest him. Officers in ski masks and body armor, armed with assault weapons, broke down the door to Paey\u2019s home, needlessly terrorizing him, his wife, and their children.506\n\n\u2022 Doug Carpenter and Carlos LeBron. On January 11, 1996, a SWAT team in Maitland, Florida, used a 60-pound steel ram to break down the door to the apartment of Doug Carpenter and his roommate, Carlos LeBron. Police conducted the raid after a member of Maitland\u2019s police \u201cNew Resident Visitation Team\u201d came to their apartment shortly after the two had moved in and noticed \u201ca strong odor of what he believed to be cannabis.\u201d The two men were handcuffed at gunpoint for three hours while police searched their apartment. The search turned up 3.5 grams of marijuana, and earned each a $150 fine. Police didn\u2019t suspect either man of dealing marijuana, nor were there any complaints from neighbors. Maitland police chief Ed Doyle said the warrant was executed because the two men were new to the area and were renters, which together present \u201ca potential problem to be nipped in the bud.\u201d Doyle added that the raid wasn\u2019t \u201cone we\u2019re going to put on the mantle.\u201d507 Other Incidents of Paramilitary Excess Finally, there are several examples from the past decade in which SWAT teams and paramilitary tactics have been used unnecessarily and recklessly, but that defy easy categorization. Here are a few of those incidents:\n\n\u2022 The Utah Rave Raid. In August 2005, more than 90 police officers from sever-al state and local SWAT teams raided a peaceful outdoor dance party in Utah attended by 1,500 people. Police were armed with assault weapons, full-SWAT attire, police dogs, and tear gas. Many in attendance say police beat, abused, and swore at partygoers. Police deny the allegations, though amateur video audio clearly captures police issuing orders laced with profanity. Police also arrested security guards on drug possession charges, though the guards possessed the drugs because they\u2019d confiscated them from partygoers.508\n\n\u2022 The Easton, Pennsylvania, SWAT Team. The small town of Easton, Pennsylvania, chose to disband its SWAT team in 2005 after a series of incidents, including the shooting death of one SWAT team member. An editorial in the Allentown Morning Call praised the decision, noting that the SWAT team had become \u201crude, arrogant, and disrespectful,\u201d and had \u201clost the confidence of the civilians who supervise them and sign their paychecks.\u201d509\n\n\u2022 The Ahwatukee Raid.In 2004, police in Ahwatukee, Arizona, conducted a massively armed, thoroughly bumbling raid on a home they suspected contained illegal assault weapons and ammunition. In a densely populated, upscale neighborhood, a SWAT team from the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Department, complete with an armored personnel carrier, used grenade launchers to fire at least four rounds of tear gas into the windows of the home. The home then caught fire. As the owners of the home evacuated, police officers actually chased the family\u2019s dog back into the burning house with a fire extinguisher, where it perished in the flames. Andrea Baker, the dog\u2019s owner, says police laughed as she cried at their cruelty. Later, the brakes would fail on the SWAT team\u2019s armored personnel carrier, causing it to lurch down the street and smash into a parked car. The car was owned by Julie Madrigal, who had fled the car just moments earlier with her nine-year-old daughter after the two grew frightened at the sight of the SWAT team as it fired canisters of tear gas. The fire completely destroyed the home, putting homes nearby in the dense neighborhood at risk, too. For all of this, police found no assault weapons. They found only an antique shotgun and a 9-millimeter pistol, both of which were legally owned. They still arrested 26-yearold Erik Kush, on outstanding traffic violations.510 CBS News reported in 1997 that the Maricopa County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s SWAT team was doing an average of one callout per week. In an on-camera interview, one member of the team told reporter Jim Stewart the best part of being on the SWAT team was that, \u201cyou get to play with a lot of guns. That\u2019s what\u2019s fun. You know, everybody on this teams is\u2014 you know, loves guns.\u201d Another added, \u201cHey, the bottom line is it\u2019s friggin\u2019 fun, man. That\u2019s the deal. Nobody wants to take burglary reports.\u201d511\n\n\u2022 The Racine Rave Raid. In 2002, police in Racine, Wisconsin, conducted an early-morning raid on a rave dance party, kicking in doors, dragging young people from bathroom stalls, throwing others to the floor, and holding them all at gunpoint. Police issued more than 450 citations to partygoers for merely attending a party where some drugs were present, but made only 3 arrests. The city of Racine later dismissed nearly all of the charges but still faces a civil lawsuit from attendees who claim police violated their civil rights.512\n\n\u2022 The Farmerville Raids. In 2002, 40 police offices from more than 10 different agencies conducted a pre-dawn raid on a suspected drug hub in Farmerville, Louisiana, in what one local sheriff called \u201ca dream come true.\u201d The raid did yield ten arrests, but the violent tactics enraged the local community. Around 100 people marched through the small town the next day to protest the operation, in which police forced entry into several homes. \u201cThey could have arrested them any time and any day,\u201d protest organizer Sheila Lewis told the Associated Press. \u201cThey are not violent, they are just normal people. . . . It was like a war zone. People were scared to death.\u201d513\n\n\u2022 The Colorado\u2013Colorado State Football Game.In 1999, a SWAT team took the field when rowdy fans attempted to bring down the goalposts\u2014a tradition in college football\u2014after a Colorado State\u2013 Colorado football game. Armed with weapons and mace, police roughed up dozens of fans for 30 minutes after the game, including Colorado State student Britney Michalski, who nearly died after an allergic reaction to the mace. When one of Michalski\u2019s friends attempted to get aid for her from one of the police, she too was maced.514\n\n\u2022 \u201cOperation Jump Start.\u201d In 1997, a multitude of police officers from three separate SWAT teams conducted a massive raid on multiple low-income neighborhoods in New Britain, Connecticut. The New Haven Advocatereported: They wore navy blue camouflage fatigues over their body armor. Kevlar helmets covered their heads; black masks covered all but the noses and eyes of their faces. A state trooper flew above the scene in a small Cessna aircraft, keeping in radio contact with commanders on the ground. The state troops swept onto city streets inside \u201cPeacekeepers,\u201d trucks with battering rams in the front.515 \u201cOperation Jump Start\u201d netted 49 arrests.516\n\n\u2022 Ramon Gallardo.In 1997, a SWAT team from Dinuba, California, a town with just 12 regular police officers and 15,000 people and which hadn\u2019t a single reported homicide in its history, shot and killed 64- year-old farm worker Ramon Gallardo.517 Officers in black masks broke down Gallardo\u2019s bedroom door while he and his wife were sleeping. Carmen Gallardo told the Los Angeles Timesshe thought the police \u201cwere robbers\u201d when they entered. According to police, Gallardo reached for a folding knife to defend himself, though his family says Gallardo didn\u2019t own the knife. Gallardo was shot 12 times. Gallardo had no criminal history. Police were looking for a stolen gun they say was in the possession of Gallardo\u2019s son. The gun was never found. A subsequent investigation by the Tulare County district attorney found no improper behavior on the part of police. A federal jury later ordered the town of Dinuba to pay the Gallardo family $12.5 million in compensation. Dinuba later dissolved its SWAT team.518\n\n\u2022 The Heflin Family. In 1996, a SWAT team in La Plata County, Colorado, descended on a ranch owned by Samuel Heflin. They were looking for evidence related to a bar brawl\u2014a cowboy hat, shirt, and a pack of cigarettes. On the way in to Heflin\u2019s home, police forced two children to the ground at gunpoint. They then trained a laser-sighted assault weapon on Heflin\u2019s four-year-old daughter as she ran screaming into the house. Upon asking to see a search warrant, Heflin was told by SWAT officers to \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d519\n\n\u2022 The Fitchburg SWAT Incidents. In 1996, the Fitchburg, Massachusetts, SWAT team burned down an apartment complex after deploying flashbang grenades in a no-knock raid. The fire left six police officers injured and 24 people homeless.520 In an article on the raid and fire, the Boston Globe noted the that the Fitchberg SWAT team was formed in 1990 with the charge, \u201cTo establish an organized response to unusual high-risk situations, barricaded suspects, hostage situations, and other similar life-threatening events where citizen safety or officer safety is at risk.\u201d521 But the 1996 raid wasn\u2019t the first time the unit had come under criticism. The team had a history of botched raids and faced at least one suit for violating the civil rights of a group of loiterers the SWAT team was called to break up.522Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

II\nM. DE CHARLUS DURING THE WAR, HIS OPINIONS, HIS PLEASURES\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On one of the first evenings after my return to Paris in 1916, wanting to hear about the only thing that interested me, the war, I went out after dinner to see Mme Verdurin, for she was, together with Mme Bontemps, one of the queens of that Paris of the war which reminded one of the Directory. As the leavening by a small quantity of yeast appears to be a spontaneous germination, young women were running about all day wearing cylindrical turbans on their heads as though they were contemporaries of Mme Tallien, As a proof of public spirit they wore straight Egyptian tunics, dark and very \u201cwarlike\u201d above their short skirts, they were shod in sandals, recalling Talma\u2019s buskin or high leggings like those of our beloved combatants. It was, they said, because they did not forget it was their duty to rejoice the eyes of those combatants that they still adorned themselves not only with flou dresses but also with jewels evoking the armies by their decorative theme if indeed their material did not come from the armies and had not been worked by them. Instead of Egyptian ornaments recalling the campaign of Egypt, they wore rings or bracelets made out of fragments of shell or beltings of the \u201cseventy-fives\u201d, cigarette-lighters consisting of two English half-pennies to which a soldier in his dug-out had succeeded in giving a patina so beautiful that the profile of Queen Victoria might have been traced on it by Pisanello. It was again, they said, because they never ceased thinking of their own people, that they hardly wore mourning when one of them fell, the pretext being that he was proud to die, which enabled them to wear a close bonnet of white English cr\u00eape (graceful of effect and encouraging to aspirants) while the invincible certainty of final triumph enabled them to replace the earlier cashmire by satins and silk muslins and even to wear their pearls \u201cwhile observing that tact and discretion of which it is unnecessary to remind French women.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Louvre and all the museums were closed and when one read at the head of an article \u201cSensational Exhibition\u201d one might be certain it was not an exhibition of pictures but of dresses destined to quicken \u201cthose delicate artistic delights of which Parisian women have been too long deprived.\u201d It was thus that elegance and pleasure had regained their hold; fashion, in default of art, sought to excuse itself, just as artists exhibiting at the revolutionary salon in 1793 proclaimed that it would be a mistake if it were regarded as \u201cinappropriate by austere Republicans that we should be engaged in art when coalesced Europe is besieging the territory of liberty.\u201d The dressmakers acted in the same spirit in 1916 and asserted with the self-conscious conceit of the artist, that \u201cto seek what was new, to avoid banality, to prepare for victory, by disengaging a new formula of beauty for the generations after the war, was their absorbing ambition, the chimera they were pursuing as would be discovered by those who came to visit their salons delightfully situated in such and such a street, where the exclusion of the mournful preoccupations of the moment with the restraint imposed by circumstances and the substitution of cheerfulness and brightness was the order of the day. The sorrows of the hour might, it is true, have got the better of feminine\u00bb energy if we had not such lofty examples of courage and endurance to meditate. So, thinking of our combatants in the trenches who dream of more comfort and coquetry for the dear one at home, let us unceasingly labour to introduce into the creation of dresses that novelty which responds to the needs of the moment. Fashion, it must be conceded, is especially associated with the English, consequently with allied firms and this year the really smart thing is the robe-tonneau the charming freedom of which gives to all our young women an amusing and distinguished cachet. \u2018It will indeed be one of the happiest consequences of this sad war\u2019 the delightful chronicler added (while awaiting the recapture of the lost provinces and the rekindling of national sentiment)\u2018to have secured such charming results in the way of dress with so little material and to have created coquetry out of nothing without ill-timed luxury and bad style. At the present time dresses made at home are preferred to those made in several series by great dress-makers, because each one is evidence of the intelligence, taste and individuality of the maker.\u2019\u201d As to charity, when we remember all the unhappiness born of the invasion, of the many wounded and mutilated, obviously it should become \u201cever more ingenious\u201d and compel the ladies in the high turbans to spend the afternoon taking tea at the bridge-table commenting on the news from the front while their automobiles await them at the door with a handsome soldier on the seat conversing with the chasseur. For that matter it was not only the high cylindrical hats which were new but also the faces they surmounted. The ladies in the new hats were young women come one hardly knew whence, who had become the flower of fashion, some during the last six months, others during the last two years, others again during the last four. These differences were as important for them as, when I made my first appearance in society, were those between two families like the Guer-mantes and the Rochefoucaulds with three or four centuries of ancient lineage. The lady who had known the Guer-mantes since 1914 considered another who had been introduced to them in 1916 a parvenue, gave her the nod of a dowager duchess while inspecting her through her lorgnon, and avowed with a significant gesture that no one in society knew whether the lady was even married. \u201cAll this is rather sickening,\u201d concluded the lady of 1914, who would have liked the cycle of the newly-admitted to end with herself. These newcomers whom young men considered decidedly elderly and whom certain old men who had not been exclusively in the best society, seemed to recognise as not being so new as all that, did something more than offer society the diversions of political conversation and music in suitable intimacy; it had to be they who supplied such diversions for, so that things should seem new, whether they are so or not, in art or in medicine as in society, new names are necessary (in certain respects they were very new indeed). Thus Mme Verdurin went to Venice during the war and like those who want at any cost to avoid sorrow and sentiment, when she said it was \u201c\u00e9patant\u201d, what she admired was not Venice nor St. Mark\u2019s nor the palaces, all that had given, me delight and which she cheapened, but the effect of the search-lights in the sky, searchlights about which she gave information supported by figures. (Thus from age to age a sort of realism is reborn out of reaction against the art which has been admired till then.)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sainte-Euverte salon was a back number and the presence there of the greatest artists or the most influential ministers attracted no one. On the other hand, people rushed to hear a word uttered by the Secretary of one Government, by the Under-Secretary of another, at the houses of the new ladies in turbans whose winged and chattering invasions filled Paris. The ladies of the first Directory had a queen who was young and beautiful called Mme Tallien; those of the second had two who were old and ugly and who were called Mme Verdurin and Mme Bontemps. Who reproached Mme Bontemps because her husband had been bitterly criticised by the Echo de Paris for the part he played in the Dreyfus affair? As the whole Chamber had at an earlier period become revisionist, it was necessarily among the old revisionists and the former socialists that the party of social order, of religious toleration and of military efficiency had to be recruited. M. Bontemps would have been detested in former days because the anti-patriots were then given the name of Dreyfusards, but that name had soon been forgotten and had been replaced by that of the adversary of the three-year law. M. Bontemps on the other hand, was one of the authors of that law, therefore he was a patriot. In society (and this social phenomenon is only the application of a much more general psychological law) whether novelties are reprehensible or not, they only excite consternation until they have been assimilated and defended by reassuring elements. As it had been with Dreyfusism, so it was with the marriage of Saint-Loup and Odette\u2019s daughter, a marriage people protested against at first. Now that people met everyone they knew at the Saint-Loups\u2019, Gilberte might have had the morals of Odette herself, people would have gone there just the same and would have agreed with Gilberte in condemning undigested moral novelties like a dowager-duchess. Dreyfusism was now integrated in a series of highly respectable and customary things. As to asking what it amounted to in itself, people now thought as little about accepting as formerly about condemning it. It no longer shocked anyone and that was all about it. People remembered it as little as they do whether the father of a young girl they know was once a thief or not. At most they might say: \u201cThe man you\u2019re talking about is the brother-in-law or somebody of the same name, there was never anything against this one.\u201d In the same way there had been different kinds of Dreyfusism and the man who went to the Duchesse de Montmorency\u2019s and got the Three-Year Law passed could not be a bad sort of man. In any case, let us be merciful to sinners. The oblivion allotted to Dreyfus was a fortiori extended to Dreyfusards. Besides, there was no one else in politics, since everyone had to be Dreyfusards at one time or another if they wanted to be in the Government, even those who represented the contrary of what Dreyfusism had incarnated when it was new and dreadful (at the time that Saint-Loup was considered to be going wrong) namely, anti-patriotism, irreligion, anarchy, etc. Thus M. Bontemps\u2019 Dreyfusism, invisible and contemplative like that of all politicians, was as little observable as the bones under his skin. No one remembered he had been Dreyfusard, for people of fashion are absentminded and forgetful and also because time had passed which they affected to believe longer than it was and it had become fashionable to say that the pre-war period was separated from the war-period by a gulf as deep, implying as much duration, as a geological period; and even Brichot the nationalist in; alluding to the Dreyfus affair spoke of \u201cthose pre-historic days\u201d. The truth is that the great change brought about by the war was in inverse ratio to the value of the minds it touched, at all events, up to a certain point; for, quite at the bottom, the utter fools, the voluptuaries, did not bother about whether there was a war or not; while quite at the top, those who create their own world, their own interior life, are little concerned with the importance of events. What profoundly modifies the course of their thought is rather something of no apparent importance which overthrows the order of time and makes them live in another period of their lives. The song of a bird in the Park of Montboissier, or a breeze laden with the scent of mignonette, are obviously matters of less importance than the great events of the Revolution and of the Empire; nevertheless they inspired in Chateaubriand\u2019s M\u00e9moires d\u2019outre tombe pages of infinitely greater value\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Bontemps did not want to hear peace spoken of until Germany had been divided up as it was during the Middle Ages, the doom of the house of Hohenzollern pronounced, and William II sentenced to be shot. In a word, he was what Brichot called a Diehard; this was the finest brevet of citizenship one could give him. Doubtless, for the three first days Mme Bontemps had been somewhat bewildered to find herself among people who asked Mme Verdurin to present her to them, and it was in a slightly acid tone that Mme Verdurin replied: \u201cthe Comte, my dear,\u201d when Mme Bontemps said to her, \u201cWas that not the Duc d\u2019Haussonville you just introduced to me?\u201d whether through entire ignorance and failure to associate the name of Haussonville with any sort of tide, or whether, on the contrary, by excess of knowledge and the association of her ideas with the Parti des Ducs of which she had been told M. d\u2019Haussonville was one of the Academic members. After the fourth day she began to be firmly established in the faubourg Saint-Germain. Sometimes she could be observed among the fragments of an obscure society which as little surprised those who knew the egg from which Mme Bontemps had been hatched as the debris of a shell around a chick. But after a fortnight, she shook them off and by the end of the first month, when she said, \u201cI am going to the L\u00e9vi\u2019s,\u201d everyone knew, without her being more precise, that she was referring to the L\u00e9vis-Mirepoix and not a single duchesse who was there would have gone to bed without having first asked her or Mme Verdurin, at least by telephone, what was in the evening\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, how things were going with Greece, what offensive was being prepared, in a word, all that the public would only know the following day or later and of which, in this way, they had a sort of dress rehearsal. Mme Verdurin, in conversation, when she communicated news, used \u201cwe\u201d in speaking of France: \u201cNow, you see, we exact of the King of Greece that he should retire from the Pelopon-nesse, etc. We shall send him etc.\u201d And in all her discourses G.H.Q. occurred constantly (\u201cI have telephoned to G.H.Q., etc.\u201d) an abbreviation in which she took as much pleasure as women did formerly who, not knowing the Prince of Agrigente, asked if it was \u201cGrigri\u201d people were speaking of, to show they were au courant, a pleasure known only to society in less troubled times but equally enjoyed by the masses at times of great crisis. Our butler, for instance, when the King of Greece was discussed, was able, thanks to the papers, to allude to him like William II, as \u201cTino\u201d, while until now his familiarity with kings had been more ordinary and invented by himself when he called the King of Spain \u201cFonfonse\u201d. One may further observe that the number of people Mme Verdurin named \u201cbores\u201d diminished in direct ratio with the social importance of those who made advances to her. By a sort of magical transformation, every bore who came to pay her a visit and solicited an invitation, suddenly became agreeable and intelligent. In brief, at the end of a year the number of \u201cbores\u201d was reduced to such proportions that \u201cthe dread and unendurableness of being bored\u201d which occurred so often in Mme Verdurin\u2019s conversation and had played such an important part in her life, almost entirely disappeared. Of late, one would have said that this unendurableness of boredom (which she had formerly assured me she never felt in her first youth) caused her less pain, like headaches and nervous asthmas, which lose their strength as one grows older; and the fear of being bored would doubtless have entirely abandoned Mme Verdurin owing to lack of bores, if she had not in some measure replaced them by other recruits amongst the old \u201cfaithfuls\u201d. Finally, to have done with the duchesses who now frequented Mme Verdurin, they came there, though they were unaware of it, in search of exactly the same thing as during the Dreyfus period, a fashionable amusement so constituted that its enjoyment satisfied political curiosity and the need of commenting privately upon the incidents read in the newspapers. Mme Verdurin would say, \u201cCome in at five o\u2019clock to talk about the war,\u201d as she would have formerly said \u201cto talk about l\u2019affaire and in the interval you shall hear Morel.\u201d Now Morel had no business to be there for he had not been in any way exempted. He had simply not joined up and was a deserter, but nobody knew it. Another star of the Salon, \u201cDans-les-choux\u201d, had, in spite of his sporting tastes, got himself exempted. He had become for me so exclusively the author of an admirable work about which I was constantly thinking, that it was only when, by chance, I established a transversal current between two series of souvenirs, that I realised it was he who had brought about Albertine\u2019s departure from my house. And again this transversal current ended, so far as those reminiscent relics of Albertine were concerned, in a channel which was dammed in full flow several years back. For I never thought any more about her. It was a channel unfrequented by memories, a line I no longer needed to follow. On the other hand the works of \u201cDans-les-choux\u201d were recent and that line of souvenirs was constantly frequented and utilised by my mind\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I must add that acquaintance with the husband of Andr\u00e9e was neither very easy nor very agreeable and that the friendship one offered him was doomed to many disappointments. Indeed he was even then very ill and spared himself fatigues other than those which seemed likely to give him pleasure. He only thus classified meeting people as yet unknown to him whom his vivid imagination represented as being potentially different from the rest. He knew his old friends too well, was aware of what could be expected of them and to him they were no longer worth a dangerous and perhaps fatal fatigue. He was in short a very bad friend. Perhaps, in his taste for new acquaintances, he regained some of the mad daring which he used to display in sport, gambling and the excesses of the table in the old days at Balbec. Each time I saw Mme Verdurin, she wanted to introduce me to Andr\u00e9e, apparently unable to admit that I had known her long before. As it happened, Andr\u00e9e rarely came with her husband but she remained my excellent and sincere friend. Faithful to the aesthetic of her husband, who reacted against Russian ballets, she remarked of the Marquis de Polignac, \u201cHe has had his house decorated by Bakst. How can one sleep in it? I should prefer Dubufe.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover the Verdurins, through that inevitable progress of asstheticism which ends in biting one\u2019s own tail, declared that they could not stand the modern style (besides, it came from Munich) nor white walls and they only liked old French furniture in a sombre setting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was very surprising at this period when Mme Verdurin could have whom she pleased at her house, to see her making indirect advances to a person she had completely lost sight of, Odette, One thought the latter could add nothing to the brilliant circle which the little group had become. But a prolonged separation, in soothing rancour, sometimes revives friendship. And the phenomenon which makes the dying utter only names formerly familiar to them and causes old people\u2019s complaisance with childish memories, has its social equivalent. To succeed in the enterprise of bringing Odette back to her, it must be understood that Mme Verdurin did not employ the \u201cultras\u201d but the less faithful habitu\u00e9s who had kept a foot in each salon. To them she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why she doesn\u2019t come here any more. Perhaps she has quarrelled with me, I haven\u2019t quarrelled with her. What have I ever done to her? It was at my house she met both her husbands. If she wants to come back, let her know that my doors are open to her.\u201d These words, which might have cost the pride of \u201cthe patronne\u201c a good deal if they had not been dictated by her imagination, were passed on but without success. Mme Verdurin awaited Odette but the latter did not come until certain events which will be seen later brought her there for quite other reasons than those which could have been put forward by the embassy of the faithless, zealous as it was; few successes are easy, many checks are decisive\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Things were so much the same, although apparently different, that one came across the former expressions \u201cright thinking\u201d and \u201cill-thinking\u201d quite naturally. And just as the former communards had been anti-revisionist, so the strongest Dreyfusards wanted everybody to be shot with the full support of the generals just as at the time of the Affaire they had been against Galliffet. Mme Verdurin invited to such parties some rather recent ladies, known for their charitable works, who at first came strikingly dressed, with great pearl necklaces. Odette possessed one as fine as any and formerly had rather overdone exhibiting it but now she was in war dress, and imitating the ladies of the faubourg, she eyed them severely. But women know how to adapt themselves. After wearing them three or four times, these ladies observed that the dresses they considered chic were for that very reason proscribed by the people who were chic and they laid aside their golden gowns and resigned themselves to simplicity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme Verdurin said, \u201cIt is deplorable, I shall telephone to Bontemps to do what is necessary to-morrow. They have again \u2018censored\u2019 the whole end of Norpois\u2019 article simply because he let it be understood that they had \u2018limog\u00e9\u2018 Percin.\u201d For all these women got glory out of using the shibboleth current at the moment and believed they were in the fashion, just as a middle-class woman, when M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 or M. de Charlus was mentioned, exclaimed: \u201cWho\u2019s that you\u2019re talking about? Babel de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, M\u00eame de Charlus?\u201d For that matter, duchesses got the same pleasure out of saying \u201climog\u00e9\u201c, for like roturiers un peu po\u00e8tes in that respect, it is the name that matters but they express themselves in accordance with their mental category in which there is a great deal that is middle-class. Those who have minds have no regard for birth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All those telephonings of Mme Verdurin were not without ill-effects. We had forgotten to say that the Verdurin salon though continuing in spirit, had been provisionally transferred to one of the largest hotels in Paris, the lack of coal and light having rendered the Verdurin receptions somewhat difficult in the former very damp abode of the Venetian ambassadors. Nevertheless, the new salon was by no means unpleasant. As in Venice the site selected for its water supply dictates the form the palace shall take, as a bit of garden in Paris delights one more than a park in the country, the narrow dining-room which Mme Verdurin had at the hotel was a sort of lozenge with the radiant white of its screen-like walls against which every Wednesday, and indeed every day, the most various and interesting people and the smartest women in Paris stood out, happy to avail themselves of the luxury of the Verdurins, thanks to their fortune increasing at a time when the richest were restricting their expenditure owing to difficulty in getting their incomes. This somewhat modified style of reception enchanted Brichot who, as the social relations of the Verdurins developed, obtained additional satisfaction from their concentration in a small area, like surprises in a Christmas stocking. On certain days guests were so numerous that the dining-room of the private apartment was too small and dinner had to be served in the enormous dining-room of the hotel below where the \u201cfaithful\u201d, while hypocritically pretending to miss the intimacy of the upper floor, were in reality delighted (constituting a select group as formerly in the little railway) to be a spectacular object of envy to neighbouring tables. In peace-time a society paragraph, surreptitiously sent to the Figaro or the Gaulois, would doubtless have announced to a larger audience than the dining-room of the Majestic could hold that Brichot had dined with the Duchesse de Duras, but since the war, society reporters having discontinued that sort of news (they got home on funerals, investitures and Franco-American banquets), the only publicity attainable was that primitive and restricted one, worthy of the dark ages prior to the discovery of Gutenberg, of being seen at the table of Mme Verdurin. After dinner, people went up to the Pattonne\u2019s suite and the telephoning began again. Many of the large hotels were at that time full of spies, who daily took note of the news telephoned by M. Bontemps with an indiscretion fortunately counterbalanced by the complete inaccuracy of his information which was always contradicted by the event\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the hour when afternoon-teas had finished, at the decline of day, one could see from afar in the still, clear sky, little brown spots which, in the twilight, one might have taken for gnats or birds. Just as, when we see a mountain far away which we might take for a cloud, we are impressed because we know it really to be solid, immense and resistant, so I was moved because the brown spots in the sky were neither gnats nor birds but aeroplanes piloted by men who were keeping watch over Paris. It was not the recollection of the aeroplanes I had seen with Albertine in our last walk near Versailles that affected me for the memory of that walk had become indifferent to me\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At dinner-time the restaurants were full and if, passing in the street, I saw a poor fellow home on leave, freed for six days from the constant risk of death, fix his eyes an instant upon the brilliantly illuminated windows, I suffered as at the hotel at Balbec when the fishermen looked at us while we dined. But I suffered more because I knew that the misery of a soldier is greater than that of the poor for it unites all the miseries and is still more moving because it is more resigned, more noble, and it was with a philosophical nod of his head, without resentment, that he who was ready to return to the trenches, observing the embusqu\u00e9s elbowing each other to reserve their tables, remarked: \u201cOne would not say there was a war going on here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At half-past nine, before people had time to finish their dinner, the lights were suddenly put out on account \u2014 of police regulations and at nine-thirty-five there was a renewed hustling of embusqu\u00e9s seizing their overcoats from the hands of the chasseurs of the restaurant where I had dined with Saint-Loup one evening of his leave, in a mysterious interior twilight like that in which magic lantern slides are shown or films at one of those cinemas towards which men and women diners were now hurrying. But after that hour, for those who, like myself, on the evening of which I am speaking, had remained at home for dinner and went out later to see friends, certain quarters of Paris were darker than the Combray of my youth; visits were like those one made to neighbours in the country. Ah! if Albertine had lived, how sweet it would have been, on the evenings when I dined out, to make an appointment with her under the arcades. At first I should have seen nobody, I should have had the emotion of believing she would not come, when all at once I should have seen one of her dear grey dresses in relief against the black wall, her smiling eyes would have perceived me and we should have been able to walk arm-in-arm without anyone recognising or interfering with us and to have gone home together. Alas, I was alone and it was as though I were making a visit to a neighbour in the country, one of those calls such as Swann used to pay us after dinner, without meeting more passers-by in the obscurity of Tansonville as he walked down that little twisting path to the street of St. Esprit, than I encountered this evening in the alley between the rue Clothilde and the rue Bonaparte, now a sinuous, rustic path. And as sections of countryside played upon by rough weather are unspoiled by a change in their setting, on evenings swept by icy winds, I felt myself more vividly on the shore of an angry sea than when I was at that Balbec of which I so often dreamed. And there were other elements which had not before existed in Paris and made one feel as though one had arrived from the train for a holiday in the open country, such as the contrast of light and shade at one\u2019s feet on moonlit evenings. Moonlight produces effects unknown to towns even in full winter; its rays played on the snow of the Boulevard Haussman unswept by workmen as on an Alpine glacier. The outlines of the trees were sharply reflected against the golden-blue snow as delicately as in certain Japanese pictures or in some backgrounds by Raphael. They lengthened on the ground at the foot of the trees as in nature when the setting sun reflects the trees which rise at regular intervals in the fields. But by a refinement of exquisite delicacy, the meadow upon which these shadows of ethereal trees were cast, was a field of Paradise, not green but of a white so brilliant on account of the moon shedding its rays on the jade-coloured snow, that one would have said it was woven of petals from the blossoms of pear-trees. And in the squares the divinities of the public fountains holding a jet of ice in their hands seemed made of a two-fold substance and, as though the artist had married bronze to crystal to produce it. On such rare days all the houses were black; but in spring, braving the police regulation once in a while, a particular house, perhaps only one floor of a particular house, or even only one room on that floor, did not close its shutters and seemed suspended by itself on impalpable shadows like a luminous projection, like an apparition without consistency. And the woman one\u2019s raised eyes perceived, isolated in the golden penumbra of the night in which oneself seemed lost, in which she too seemed abandoned, was endowed with the veiled, mysterious charm of an Eastern vision. At length one passed on and no living thing interrupted the rhythm of monotonous and hygienic tramping in the darkness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I was reflecting that it was a long time since I had seen any of the personages with whom this work has been concerned. In 1914, during the two months I passed in Paris, I had once perceived M. de Charlus and had met Bloch and Saint-Loup, the latter only twice. It was certainly on the second occasion that he seemed to be most himself, and to have overcome that unpleasant lack of sincerity I had noticed at Tansonville to which I referred earlier. On this occasion, I recognised all his lovable qualities of former days. The first time I had seen him was at the beginning of the week that followed the declaration of war and while Bloch displayed extremely chauvinistic sentiments, Saint-Loup alluded to his own failure to join up with an irony that rather shocked me. Saint-Loup was just back from Balbec. \u201cAll who don\u2019t go and fight,\u201d he exclaimed with forced gaiety, \u201cwhatever reason they give, simply don\u2019t want to be killed, it\u2019s nothing but funk.\u201d And with a more emphatic gesture than when he alluded to others, \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t rejoin my regiment, it\u2019s for the same reason.\u201d Before that, I had noticed in different people that the affectation of laudable sentiments is not the only disguise of unworthy ones, that a more original way is to exhibit the latter so that, at least, one does not seem to be disguising them. In Saint-Loup this tendency was strengthened by his habit, when he had done something for which he might have been censured, of proclaiming it as though it had been done on purpose, a habit he must have acquired from some professor at the War School with whom he had lived on terms of intimacy and for whom he professed great admiration. So I interpreted this outbreak as the affirmation of sentiments he wanted to exhibit as having inspired his evasion of military service in the war now beginning. \u201cHave you heard,\u201d he asked as he left me, \u201cthat my Aunt Oriane is about to sue for divorce? I know nothing about it myself. People have often said it before and I\u2019ve heard it announced so often that I shall wait until the divorce is granted before I believe it. I may add that it isn\u2019t surprising; my uncle is a charming man socially and to his friends and relations and in one way he has more heart than my aunt. She\u2019s a saint, but she takes good care to make him feel it. But he\u2019s an awful husband; he has never ceased being unfaithful to his wife, insulting her, ill-treating her and depriving her of money into the bargain. It would be so natural if she left him that it\u2019s a reason for its being true and also for its not being true just because people keep on saying so. And after all, she has stood it for so long. . . . Of course, I know there are ever so many false reports which are denied and afterwards turn out to be true.\u201d That made me ask him whether, before he married Gilberte, there had ever been any question of his marrying Mlle de Guermantes. He started at this and assured me it was not so, that it was only one of those society rumours born, no one knows how, which disappear as they come, the falsity of which does not make those who believe them more cautious, for no sooner does another rumour of an engagement, of a divorce or of a political nature arise than they give it immediate credence and pass it on. Forty-eight hours had not passed before certain facts proved that my interpretation of Robert\u2019s words was completely wrong when he said, \u201cAll those who are not at the front are in a funk.\u201d Saint-Loup had only said this to show off and appear psychologically original while he was uncertain whether his services would be accepted. But at that very moment he was moving heaven and earth to be accepted, showing less originality in the sense he had given to that word, but that he was more profoundly French, more in conformity with all that was best in the French of St. Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, gentlemen, bourgeois, respectable servants of gentlemen, or those in revolt against gentlemen, two equally French divisions of the same family, a Fran\u00e7oise offshoot and a Sauton offshoot, from which two arrows flew once more to the same target which was the frontier. Bloch was delighted to hear this avowal of cowardice by a Nationalist (who, in truth, was not much of a Nationalist) and when Saint-Loup asked him if he was going to join up, he made a grimace like a high-priest and replied \u201cshortsighted.\u201d But Bloch had completely changed his opinion about the war when he came to see me in despair some days later for, although he was shortsighted, he had been passed for service. I was taking him back to his house when we met Saint-Loup. The latter had an appointment with a former officer, M. de Cambremer, who was to present him to a colonel at the Ministry of War, he told me. \u201cCambremer is an old acquaintance of yours, you know Cancan as well as I do.\u201d I replied that, as a fact, I did know him and his wife too, but that I did not greatly appreciate them. Yet I was so accustomed, ever since I first made their acquaintance, to consider his wife an unusual person with a thorough knowledge of Schopenhauer who had access to an intellectual milieu closed to her vulgar husband, that I was at first surprised when Saint-Loup remarked: \u201cHis wife is an idiot, you can have her; but he\u2019s an excellent fellow, gifted and extremely agreeable,\u201d By the idiocy of the wife, no doubt Saint-Loup meant her mad longing to get into the best society which that society severely condemned and, by the qualities of the husband, those his niece implied when she called him the best of the family. Anyhow, he did not bother himself about duchesses but that sort of intelligence is as far removed from the kind that characterises thinkers as is the intelligence the public respects because it has enabled a rich man \u201cto make his pile.\u201d But the words of Saint-Loup did not displease me since they recalled that pretentiousness is closely allied to stupidity and that simplicity has a subtle but agreeable flavour. It is true I had no occasion to savour that of M. de Cambremer. But that is exactly why one being is so many different beings apart from differences of opinion. I had only known the shell of M. de Cambre-mer and his charm, attested by others, was unknown to me. Bloch left us in front of his door, overflowing with bitterness against Saint-Loup, telling him that those \u201cbeautiful red tabs\u201d parading about at Staff Headquarters run no risk and that he, an ordinary second class private had no wish to \u201cget a bullet through his skin for the sake of William.\u201d \u201cIt seems that the Emperor William is seriously ill,\u201d Saint-Loup answered. Bloch, like all those people who have something to do with the Stock Exchange, received any sensational news with peculiar credulity added, \u201cit is said even that he is dead.\u201d On the Stock Exchange every, sovereign who is ill, whether Edward VII or William II, is dead; every city on the point of being besieged, is taken. \u201cIt is only kept secret,\u201d Bloch went on, \u201cso that German public opinion should not be depressed. But he died last night. My father has it from \u2018the best sources\u2019.\u201d \u201cThe best sources\u201d were the only ones of which M. Bloch senior took notice, when, through the luck of possessing certain \u201cinfluential connections\u201d he received the as yet secret news that the Exterior Debt was going to rise or de Beers fall. Moreover, if at that very moment there was a rise in de Beers or there were offers of Exterior Debt, if the market of the first was \u201cfirm and active\u201d and that of the second \u201chesitating and weak\u201d, \u201cthe best sources\u201d remained nevertheless \u201cthe best sources.\u201d Bloch too announced the death of the Kaiser with a mysteriously important air, but also with rage. He was particularly exasperated to hear Robert say the \u201cEmperor William.\u201d I believe under the knife of the guillotine Saint-Loup and M. de Guermantes would not have spoken of him otherwise. Two men in society who were the only living souls on a desert island where they would not have to give proof of good breeding to anyone, would recognise each other by those marks of breeding just as two Latinists would recognise each other\u2019s qualifications through correct quotations from Virgil. Saint-Loup would never, even under torture, have said other than \u201cEmperor William\u201d; yet the savoir vivre is all the same a bondage for the mind. He who cannot reject it remains a mere man of society. Yet elegant mediocrity is charming \u2014 especially for the generosity and unexpressed heroism that go with it \u2014 in comparison with the vulgarity of Bloch, at once braggart and mountebank, who shouted at Saint-Loup: \u201cCan\u2019t you say simply \u2018William\u2019? That\u2019s it, you\u2019re in a funk, even here you\u2019re ready to crawl on your stomach to him. Pshaw! they\u2019ll make nice soldiers at the front, they\u2019ll lick the boots of the Boches. You red-tabs are fit to parade in a circus, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThat poor Bloch will have it that I can do nothing but parade,\u201d Saint-Loup remarked with a smile when we left our friend. And I felt that parading was not at all what Robert was after, though I did not then realise his intention as I did later when the cavalry being out of action, he applied to serve as an infantry officer, then as a Chasseur \u00e1 pied and finally when the sequel came which will be read later. But Bloch had no idea of Robert\u2019s patriotism simply because the latter did not express it. Though Bloch made professions of nefarious anti-militarism once he had been passed for service, he had declared the most chauvinistic opinions when he believed he would be exempted for shortsightedness. Saint-Loup would have been incapable of making such declarations, because of a certain moral delicacy which prevents one from expressing the depth of sentiments which are natural to us. My mother would not have hesitated a second to sacrifice her life for my grandmother\u2019s and would have suffered intensely from being unable to do so. Nevertheless I cannot imagine retrospectively a phrase on her lips such as \u201cI would give my life for my mother.\u201d Robert was equally silent about his love for France and in that he seemed to me much more Saint-Loup (as I imagined his father to have been) than Guermantes. He would also have been incapable of such expressions owing to his mind having a certain moral bias. Men who do their work intelligently and earnestly have an aversion to those who want to make literature out of what they do, to make it important. Saint-Loup and I had not been either at the Lyc\u00e9e or at the Sorbonne together, but each of us had separately attended certain lectures by the same masters and I remember his smile when he alluded to those who, because, undeniably, their lectures were exceptional tried to make themselves out men of genius by giving ambitious names to their theories. Little as we spoke of it, Robert laughed heartily. Our natural predilection was not for the Cottards or Brichots, though we had a certain respect for those who had a thorough knowledge of Greek or medicine and did not for that reason consider they need play the charlatan. Just as all my mother\u2019s actions were based upon the feeling that she would have given her life for her mother, as she had never formulated this sentiment which in any case she would have considered not only useless and ridiculous but indecent and shameful to express to others, so it was impossible to imagine Saint-Loup (speaking to me of his equipment, of the different things he had to attend to, of our chances of victory, of the little value of the Russian army, of what England would do) enunciating one of those eloquent periods to which even the most sympathetic minister is inclined to give vent when he addresses deputies and enthusiasts. I cannot, however, deny, on this negative side which prevented his expressing the beautiful sentiments he felt that there was a certain effect of the \u201cGuermantes spirit\u201d of which so many examples were afforded by Swann. For if I found him a Saint-Loup more than anything else, he remained a Guermantes as well and owing to that, among the many motives which excited his courage there were some dissimilar to those of his Donci\u00e8res friends, those young men with a passion for their profession with whom I had dined every evening and of whom so many were killed leading their men at the Battle of the Marne or elsewhere. Such young socialists as might have been at Donci\u00e8res when I was there, whom I did not know because they were not in Saint-Loup\u2019s set, were able to satisfy themselves that the officers in that set were in no way \u201caristos\u201d in the arrogantly proud and basely pleasure-loving sense which the \u201cpopulo\u201d officers from the ranks, and the Freemasons, gave to the word. And equally, the aristocratic officer discovered the same patriotism amongst those Socialists whom when I was at Donci\u00e8res in the midst of the Affair Dreyfus, I heard them accuse of being anti-patriotic. The deep and sincere patriotism of soldiers had taken a definite form which they believed intangible and which it enraged them to see aspersed, whereas the Radical-Socialists who were, in a sense, unconscious patriots, independents, without a defined religion of patriotism, did not realise what a profound reality underlay what they believed to be vain and hateful formulas. Without doubt, Saint-Loup, like them, had grown accustomed to developing as the truest part of himself, the exploration and the conception of better schemes in view of greater strategic and tactical success, so that for him as for them the life of the body was of relatively small importance and could be lightly sacrificed to that inner life, the vital kernel around which personal existence had only the value of a protective epidermis. I told Saint-Loup about his friend, the director of the Balbec Grand Hotel, who, it appeared had, at the outbreak of war, alleged that there had been disaffection in certain French regiments which he called \u201cdefec-tuosity\u201d and had accused what he termed \u201cPrussian militarists\u201d of provoking it, remarking with a laugh, \u201cMy brother\u2019s in the trenches. They\u2019re only thirty meters from the Boches\u201d until it was discovered that he was a Boche himself and they put him in a concentration camp. \u201cApropos of Balbec, do you remember the former lift-boy of the hotel?\u201d Saint-Loup asked me in the tone of one who seems not to know much about the person concerned and was counting upon me for enlightenment. \u201cHe\u2019s joining up and wrote me to get him entered in the aviation corps.\u201d Doubtless the lift-boy was tired of going up and down in the closed cage of the lift and the heights of the staircase of the Grand Hotel no longer sufficed for him. He was going to \u201cget his stripes\u201d otherwise than as a concierge, for our destiny is not always what we had believed. \u201cI shall certainly support his application,\u201d Saint-Loup said, \u201cI told Gilberte again this morning, we shall never have enough aeroplanes. It is through them we shall observe what the enemy is up to; they will deprive him of the chief advantage m an attack, surprise; the best army will perhaps be the one that has the best eyes. Has poor Fran\u00e7oise succeeded in getting her nephew exempted?\u201d Fran\u00e7oise who had for a long while done everything in her power to get her nephew exempted, on a recommendation through the Guermantes to General de St. Joseph being proposed to her, had replied despairingly: \u201cOh! That would be no use there\u2019s nothing to be done with that old fellow, he\u2019s the worst sort of all, he\u2019s patriotic!\u201d From the beginning of the war, Fran\u00e7oise whatever sorrow it had brought her, was of opinion that the \u201cpoor Russians\u201d must not be abandoned since we were \u201callianced\u201d. The butler, persuaded that the war would not last more than ten days and would end by the signal victory of France, would not have dared, for fear of being contradicted by events, to predict a long and indecisive one, nor would he have had enough imagination. But, out of this complete and immediate victory he tried to extract beforehand whatever might cause anxiety to Fran\u00e7oise. \u201cIt may turn out pretty rotten; it appears there are many who don\u2019t want to go to the front, boys of sixteen are crying about it.\u201d He also tried to provoke her by saying all sorts of disagreeable things, what he called \u201cpulling her leg\u201d by \u201cpitching an apostrophe at her\u201d or \u201cflinging her a pun.\u201d \u201cSixteen years old! Sainted Mary!\u201d exclaimed Fran\u00e7oise, and then, with momentary suspicion, \u201cBut they said they only took them after they were twenty, they\u2019re only children at sixteen.\u201d \u201cNaturally, the papers are ordered to say that. For that matter, the whole youth of the country will be at the front and not many will come back. In one way that will be a good thing, a good bleeding is useful from time to time, it makes business better. Yes, indeed, if some of these boys are a bit soft and chicken-hearted and hesitate, they shoot them immediately, a dozen bullets through the skin and that\u2019s that. In a way it\u2019s got to be done and what does it matter to the officers? They get their pesetas all the same and that\u2019s all they care about.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise got so pale during these conversations that one might well fear the butler would cause her death from heart disease. But she did not on that account lose her defects. When a girl came to see me, however much the old servant\u2019s legs hurt her, if ever I went out of my room for a moment I saw her on the top of the steps, in the hanging cupboard, in the act, she pretended, of looking for one of my coats to see if the moths had got into it, in reality to spy upon us. In spite of all my remonstrances, she kept up her insidious manner of asking indirect questions and for some time had been making use of the phrase \u201cbecause doubtless.\u201d Not daring to ask me, \u201cHas that lady a house of her own?\u201d she would say with her eyes lifted timidly like those of a gentle dog, \u201cBecause doubtless that lady has a house of her own,\u201d avoiding the flagrant interrogation in order to be polite and not to seem inquisitive. And further, since those servants we most care for \u2014 especially if they can no longer render us much service or even do their work \u2014 remain, alas, servants and mark more clearly the limits (which we should like to efface) of their caste in proportion to the extent to which they believe they are penetrating ours, Fran\u00e7oise often gave vent to strange comments about my person (in order to tease me, the butler would have said) which people in our own world would not make. For instance, with a delight as dissimulated but also as deep as if it had been a case of serious illness, if I happened to be hot and the perspiration (to which I paid no attention) was trickling down my forehead, she would say, \u201cMy word! You\u2019re drenched\u201d as though she were astonished by a strange phenomenon, smiling with that contempt for something indecorous with which she might have remarked, \u201cWhy, you\u2019re going out without your collar!\u201d while adopting a concerned tone intended to cause one discomfort. One would have thought I was the only person in the universe who had ever been \u201cdrenched\u201d. For, in her humility, in her tender admiration for beings infinitely inferior to her, she adopted their ugly forms of expression. Her daughter complained of her to me, \u201cShe\u2019s always got something to say, that I don\u2019t close the doors properly and patatipatali et patatapatala.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise doubtless thought it was only her insufficient education that had deprived her until now of this beautiful expression. And on her lips, on which formerly flowered the purest French, I heard several times a day, \u201cEt patati patall patata patala.\u201d As to that it is curious how little variation there is not only in the expressions but in the thoughts of the same individual. The butler, being accustomed to declare that M. Poincar\u00e9 had evil motives, not of a venal kind but because he had absolutely willed the war, repeated this seven or eight times a day before the same ever interested audience, without modifying a single word or gesture or intonation. Although it only lasted about two minutes, it was invariable like a performance. His mistakes in French corrupted the language of Fran\u00e7oise quite as much as the mistakes of her daughter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She hardly slept, she hardly ate, she had the communiqu\u00e9s read to her, though she did not understand them, by the butler who understood them little better and in whom the desire to torment Fran\u00e7oise was often dominated by a superficial sort of patriotism; he remarked with a sympathetic chuckle when speaking of the Germans, \u201cThat will stir them up a bit, our old Joffre is planning a comet to fall on them.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise did not understand what comet he was talking about but felt none the less that this phrase was one of those charming and original extravagances to which a well-bred person must reply, so with good humour and urbanity, shrugging her shoulders with the air of saying \u201cHe\u2019s always the same,\u201d she tempered her tears with a smile. At all events she was happy that her new butcher boy who in spite of his calling was somewhat timorous, (although he had begun in the slaughter-house) was too young to join up; otherwise, she would have been capable of going to the Minister of War about him. The butler could not believe the communiqu\u00e9s were other than excellent and that the troops were not approaching Berlin, as he had read, \u201cWe have repulsed the enemy with heavy losses on their side,\u201d actions that he celebrated as though they were new victories. For my part, I was horrified by the rapidity with which the theatre of these victories approached Paris and I was astonished that even the butler, who had seen in a communiqu\u00e9 that an action had taken place close to Lens, had not been alarmed by reading in the next day\u2019s paper that the result of this action had turned to our advantage at Jouy-le-Vicomte to which we firmly held the approaches. The butler very well knew the name of Jouy-le-Vicomte which was not far from Combray. But one reads the papers as one wants to with a bandage over one\u2019s eyes without trying to understand the facts, listening to the soothing words of the editor as to the words of one\u2019s mistress. We are beaten and happy because we believe ourselves unbeaten and victorious\nYou might also like\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I did not stay long in Paris and returned fairly soon to my sanatorium. Though in principle the doctor treated his patients by isolation, I had received on two different occasions letters from Gilberte and from Robert. Gilberte wrote me (about September, 1914) that much as she would have liked to remain in Paris in order to get news from Robert more easily, the perpetual \u201ctaube\u201d raids over Paris had given her such a fright, especially on her little girl\u2019s account, that she had fled from Paris by the last train which left for Combray, that the train did not even reach Com-bray and it was only thanks to a peasant\u2019s cart upon which she had made a ten hours journey in atrocious discomfort that she had at last been able to get to Tansonville. \u201cAnd what do you think awaited your old friend there?\u201d Gilberte closed her letter by saying. \u201cI had left Paris to get away from the German aeroplanes, imagining that at Tansonville I should be sheltered from everything. I had not been there two days when what do you think happened! The Germans were invading the region after beating our troops near La Fere and a German staff, followed by a regiment, presented themselves at the gate of Tansonville and I was obliged to take them in without a chance of escaping, not a train, nothing.\u201d Had the German staff behaved well or was one supposed to read into the letter of Gilberte the contagious effect of the spirit of the Guermantes who were of Bavarian stock and related to the highest aristocracy in Germany, for Gilberte was inexhaustible about the perfect behaviour of the staff and of the soldiers who had only asked \u201cpermission to pick one of the forget-me-nots which grew at the side of the lake,\u201d good behaviour she contrasted with the unbridled violence of the French fugitives who had traversed the estate and sacked everything before the arrival of the German generals. Anyhow, if Gilberte\u2019s letter was, in certain respects, impregnated with the \u201cGuermantes spirit,\u201d\u2014 others would say it was her Jewish internationalism, which would probably not be true, as we shall see \u2014 the letter I received some months later from Robert was much more Saint-Loup than Guermantes for it reflected all the liberal culture he had acquired and was altogether sympathetic. Unhappily he told me nothing about the strategy as he used to in our conversations at Donci\u00e8res and did not mention to what extent he considered the war had confirmed or disproved the principles which he then exposed to me. The most he told me was that since 1914, several wars had succeeded each other, the lessons of each influencing the conduct of the following one. For instance, the theory of the \u201cbreak through\u201d had been completed by the thesis that before the \u201cbreak through\u201d it was necessary to overwhelm the ground occupied by the enemy with artillery. Later it was discovered, on the contrary, that this destruction made the advance of infantry and artillery impossible over ground so pitted with thousands of shell-holes that they became so many obstacles. \u201cWar,\u201d he said, \u201cdoes not escape the laws of our old Hegel. It is a state of perpetual becoming.\u201d This was little enough of all I wanted to know. But what disappointed me more was that he had no right to give me the names of the generals. And indeed, from what little I could glean from the papers, it was not those of whom I was so much concerned to know the value in war, who were conducting this one. Geslin de Bourgogne, Galliffet, N\u00e9grier were dead, Pau had retired from active service almost at the beginning of the war. We had never talked about Joffre or Foch or Castlenau or P\u00e9tain. \u201cMy dear boy,\u201d Robert wrote, \u201cif you saw what these soldiers are like, especially those of the people, the working class, small shopkeepers who little knew the heroism of which they were capable and would have died in their beds without ever being suspected of it, facing the bullets to succour a comrade, to carry off a wounded officer and, themselves struck, smile at the moment they are going to die because the staff surgeon tells them that the trench had been re-captured from the Germans; I can assure you, my dear boy, that it gives one a wonderful idea of what a Frenchman is and makes us understand the historic epochs which seemed rather extraordinary to us when we were at school. The epic is so splendid that, like myself, you would find words useless to describe it. In contact with such grandeur the word \u201cpoilu\u201d has become for me something which I can no more regard as implying an allusion or a joke than when we read the word \u201cchouans\u201d. I feel that the word \u201cpoilu\u201d is awaiting great poets like such words as \u201cDeluge\u201d or \u201cChrist\u201d or \u201cBarbarians\u201d which were saturated with grandeur before Hugo, Vigny and the rest used them. To my mind, the sons of the people are the best of all but everyone is fine. Poor Vaugoubert, the son of the Ambassador, was wounded seven times before being killed and each time he came back from an expedition without being \u201cscooped,\u201d he seemed to be excusing himself and saying that it was not his fault. He was a charming creature. We had seen a great deal of each other and his poor parents obtained permission to come to his funeral on condition that they didn\u2019t wear mourning nor stop more than five minutes on account of the bombardment. The mother, a great horse of a woman, whom you perhaps know, may have been very unhappy but one would not have thought so. But the father was in such a state, I assure you, that I, who have become almost insensible through getting accustomed to seeing the head of a comrade I was talking to shattered by a bomb or severed from his trunk, could hardly bear it when I saw the collapse of poor Vaugoubert who was reduced to a rag. It was all very well for the general to tell him it was for France that his son died a hero\u2019s death, that only redoubled the sobs of the poor man who could not tear himself away from his son\u2019s body. Well, that is why we can say, \u2018they will not get through.\u2019 Such men as these, my poor valet or Vaugoubert, have prevented the Germans from getting through. Perhaps you have thought we do not advance much, but that is not the way to reason; an army feels itself victorious by intuition as a dying man knows he is done for. And we know that we are going to be the victors and we will it so that we may dictate a just peace, not only for ourselves, but a really just peace, just for the French and just for the Germans\u201d. As heroes of mediocre and banal mind, writing poems during their convalescence, placed themselves, in order to describe the war, not on the level of the events which in themselves are nothing, but on the level of the banal aesthetic of which they had until then followed the rules, speaking as they might have done ten years earlier of the \u201cbloody dawn,\u201d of the \u201cshuddering flight of victory,\u201d Saint-Loup, himself much more intelligent and artistic, remained intelligent and artistic and for my benefit noted with taste the landscapes while he was immobilised at the edge of a swampy forest, just as though he had been shooting duck. To make me grasp contrasts of shade and light which had been \u201cthe enchantment of the morning,\u201d he referred to certain pictures we both of us loved and alluded to a page of Romain Rolland or of Nietzsche with the independence of those at the front who unlike those at the rear, were not afraid to utter a German name, and with much the same coquetry that caused Colonel du Paty de Clam to declaim in the witnesses\u2019 room during the Zola affair as he passed by Pierre Quillard, a Dreyfusard poet of the extremest violence whom he did not know, verses from the latter\u2019s symbolic drama \u201cLa Fille aux Mains coup\u00e9es,\u201d Saint-Loup, when he spoke to me of a melody of Schumann gave it its German title and made no circumlocution to tell me, when he had heard the first warble at the edge of a forest, that he had been intoxicated as though the bird of that \u201csublime Siegfried\u201d which he hoped to hear again after the war, had sung to him. And now on my second return to Paris I had received on the day following my arrival another letter from Gilberte who without doubt had forgotten the one she had previously written me, to which I have alluded above, for her departure from Paris at the end of 1914 was represented retrospectively in quite different fashion. \u201cPerhaps you do not realise, my dear friend,\u201d she wrote me, \u201cthat I have now been at Tansonville two years. I arrived there at the same time as the Germans. Everybody wanted to prevent me going, I was treated as though I were mad. \u2018What,\u2019 they said to me, \u2018you are safe in Paris and you want to leave for those invaded regions just as everybody else is trying to get away from them?\u2019 I recognised the justice of this reasoning but what was to be done? I have only one quality, I am not a coward or, if you prefer, I am faithful, and when I knew that my dear Tansonville was menaced I did not want to leave our old steward there to defend it alone; it seemed to me that my place was by his side. And it is, in fact, thanks to that resolution that I was able to save the Ch\u00e2teau almost completely \u2014 when all the others in the neighbourhood, abandoned by their terrified proprietors, were destroyed from roof to cellar \u2014 and not only was I able to save the Ch\u00e2teau but also the precious collections which my dear father so much loved.\u201d In a word, Gilberte was now persuaded that she had not gone to Tansonville, as she wrote me in 1914, to fly from the Germans and to be in safety, but, on the contrary, in order to meet them and to defend her Ch\u00e2teau from them. As a matter of fact, they (the Germans) had not remained at Tansonville, but she did not cease to have at her house a constant coming and going of officers which much exceeded that which reduced Fran\u00e7oise to tears in the streets of Combray and to live, as she said this time with complete truth, the life of the front. Also she was referred to eulogistically in the papers because of her admirable conduct and there was a proposal to give her a decoration. The end of her letter was perfectly accurate: \u201cYou have no idea of what this war is, my dear friend, the importance of a road, a bridge or a height. How many times, during these days in this ravaged countryside, have I thought of you, of our walks you made so delightful, while tremendous fights were going on for the capture of a hillock you loved and where so often we had been together. Probably you, like myself, are unable to imagine that obscure Roussainville and tiresome M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, whence our letters were brought and where one went to fetch the doctor when you were ill, are now celebrated places. Well, my dear friend, they have for ever entered into glory in the same way as Austerlitz or Valmy. The Battle of M\u00e9s\u00e9glise lasted more than eight months, the Germans lost more than one hundred thousand men there, they destroyed M\u00e9s\u00e9glise but they have not taken it. The little road you so loved, the one we called the stiff hawthorn climb, where you professed to be in love with me when you were a child, when all the time I was in love with you, I cannot tell you how important that position is. The great wheatfield in which it ended is the famous \u2018slope 307\u2019 the name you have so often seen recorded in the communiqu\u00e9s. The French blew up the little bridge over the Vivonne which, you remember, did not bring back your childhood to you as much as you would have liked. The Germans threw others across; during a year and a half, they held one half of Combray and the French the other.\u201d The day following that on which I received this letter, that is to say the evening before the one when, walking in the darkness, I heard the sound of my foot-steps while reflecting on all these memories, Saint-Loup, back from the front and on the point of returning there, had paid me a visit of a few minutes only, the mere announcement of which had greatly stirred me. Fran\u00e7oise at first was going to throw herself upon him, hoping she would be able to get the butcher boy exempted; his class was going to the front in a year\u2019s time. But she restrained herself, realising the uselessness of the effort, since, for some time the timid animal-killer had changed his butcher-shop and, whether the owner of ours feared she would lose our custom, or whether it was simply in good faith, she declared to Fran\u00e7oise that she did not know where this boy \u201cwho for that matter would never make a good butcher\u201d was employed. Fran\u00e7oise had looked everywhere for him, but Paris is big, there are a large number of butchers\u2019 shops and however many she went into she never was able to find the timid and blood-stained young man\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Saint-Loup entered my room I had approached him with that diffidence, with that sense of the supernatural one felt about those on leave as we feel in approaching a person attacked by a mortal disease, who nevertheless gets up, dresses himself and walks about. It seemed that there was something almost cruel in these leaves granted to combatants, at the beginning especially, for, those who had not like myself lived far from Paris, had acquired the habit which removes from things frequently experienced the root-deep impression which gives them their real significance. The first time one said to oneself, \u201cThey will never go back, they will desert\u201d\u2014 and indeed they did not come from places which seemed to us unreal merely because it was only through the papers we had heard of them and where we could not realise they had been taking part in Titanic combats and had come back with only a bruise on the shoulder \u2014 they came back to us for a moment from the shores of death itself and would return there, incomprehensible to us, filling us with tenderness, horror and a sentiment of mystery like the dead who appear to us for a second and whom, if we dare to question them, at most reply, \u201cYou cannot imagine.\u201d For it is extraordinary, in those who have been resurrected from the front, for, among the living that is what men on leave are, or in the case of the dead whom a hypnotised medium evokes, that the only effect of this contact with the mystery is to increase, were that possible, the insignificance of our intercourse with them. Thus, approaching Robert who had a scar on his forehead more august and mysterious to me than a footprint left upon the earth by a giant, I did not dare ask him a question and he only said a few simple words. And those words were little different from what they would have been before the war, as though people, in spite of the war, continued to be what they were; the tone of intercourse remains the same, the matter differs and even then \u2014? I gathered that Robert had found resources at the front which had made him little by little forget that Morel had behaved as badly to him as to his uncle. Nevertheless he had preserved a great friendship for him and now and then had a sudden longing to see him again which he kept on postponing. I thought it more considerate towards Gilberte not to inform Robert, if he wanted to find Morel, he had only to go to Mme Verdurin\u2019s. On my remarking to Robert with a sense of humility how little one felt the war in Paris, he said that even there it was sometimes \u201crather extraordinary\u201d. He was alluding to a raid of zeppelins there had been the evening before and asked me if I had had a good view of it in the same way as he would formerly have referred to a piece of great aesthetic beauty at the theatre. One can imagine that at the front there is a sort of coquetry in saying, \u201cIt\u2019s marvellous! What a pink \u2014 and that pale green!\u201d when at that instant one can be killed, but it was not that which moved Saint-Loup about an insignificant raid on Paris. When I spoke to him about the beauty of the aeroplanes rising in the night, he replied, \u201cAnd perhaps the descending ones are still more beautiful. Of course they are marvellous when they soar upwards, when they\u2019re about to form constellation thus obeying laws as precise as those which govern astral constellations, for what is a spectacle to you is the assemblage of squadrons, orders being given to them, their despatch on scout duty, etc. But don\u2019t you prefer the moment when, mingling with the stars, they detach themselves from them to start on a chase or to return after the maroon sounds, when they \u2018loop the loop\u2019, even the stars seem to change their position. And aren\u2019t the sirens rather Wagnerian, as they should be, to salute the arrival of the Germans, very like the national hymn, very \u2018Wacht am Rhein\u2019 with the Crown Prince and the Princesses in the Imperial box; one wonders whether aviators or Walkyries are up there.\u201d He seemed to get pleasure out of comparing aviators with Walkyries, and explained them on entirely musical principles. \u201cDame! the music of sirens is like the prancing of horses; we shall have to await the arrival of the Germans to hear Wagner in Paris.\u201d From certain points of view the comparison was not false. The city seemed a formless and black mass which all of a sudden passed from the depth of night into a blaze of light, and in the sky, where one after another, the aviators rose amidst the shrieking wail of the sirens while, with a slower movement, more insidious and therefore more alarming, for it made one think they were seeking ah object still invisible but perhaps close to us, the searchlights swept unceasingly, scenting the enemy, encircling him with their beams until the instant when the pointed planes flashed like arrows in his wake. And in squadron after squadron the aviators darted from the city into the sky like Walkyries. Yet close to the ground, at the base of the houses, some spots were in high light and I told Saint-Loup, if he had been at home the evening before, he would have been able, while he contemplated the apocalypse in the sky, to see on the earth, as in the burial of the Comte d\u2019Orgaz by Greco, where those contrasting planes are parallel, a regular vaudeville played by personages in night-gowns, whose Well-known names ought to have been sent to some successor of that Ferrari whose fashionable notes it had so often amused him and myself to parody. And we should have done so again that day as though there had been no war, although about a very \u201cwar-subject\u201d, the dread of zeppelins realised, the Duchesse de Guermantes superb in her night-dress, the Duc de Guermantes indescribable in his pink pyjamas and bath-gown, etc., etc. \u201cI am sure,\u201d he said, \u201cthat in all the large hotels one might have seen American Jewesses in their chemises hugging to their bursting breasts pearl necklaces which would buy them a \u2018busted\u2019 duke. On such nights, the Hotel Ritz must resemble an exchange and mart emporium.\u201d\nI asked Saint-Loup if this war had confirmed our conclusions at Donci\u00e8res about war in the past. I reminded him of the proposition which he had forgotten, for instance about the parodies of former battles by generals of the future. \u201cThe feint,\u201d I said to him, \u201cis no longer possible in these operations where the advance is prepared with such accumulation of artillery and what you have since told me about reconnaissance by aeroplane which obviously you could not have foreseen, prevents the employment of Napoleonic ruses.\u201d \u201cHow mistaken you are,\u201d he answered, \u201cobviously this war is new in relation to former wars for it is itself composed of successive wars of which the last is an innovation on the preceding one. It is necessary to adapt oneself to the enemy\u2019s latest formula so as to defend oneself against him; then he starts a fresh innovation and yet, as in other human things, the old tricks always come off. No later than yesterday evening the most intelligent of our military critics wrote: \u2018When the Germans wanted to deliver East Prussia they began the operation by a powerful demonstration in the south against Warsaw, sacrificing ten thousand men to deceive the enemy. When at the beginning of 1915 they created the mass manoeuvre of the Arch-Duke Eug\u00e8ne in order to disengage threatened Hungary, they spread the report that this mass was destined for an operation against Serbia. Thus, in 1800 the army which was about to operate against Italy was definitely indicated as a reserve army which was not to cross the Alps but to support the armies engaged in the northern theatres of war. The ruse of Hindenburg attacking Warsaw to mask the real attack on the Mazurian Lakes, imitates the strategy of Napoleon in 1812.\u2019 You see that M. Bidou repeats almost the exact words of which you remind me and which I had forgotten. And as the war is not yet finished, these ruses will be repeated again and again and will succeed because they are never completely exposed and what has done the trick once will do it again because it was a good trick.\u201d And in fact, for a long time after that conversation with Saint-Loup, while the eyes of the Allies were fixed upon Petrograd against which capital it was believed the Germans were marching, they were preparing a most powerful offensive against Italy. Saint-Loup gave me many other examples of military parodies or, if one believes that there is not a military art but a military science, of the application of permanent laws. \u201cI will not say, there would be contradiction in the words,\u201d added Saint-Loup, \u201cthat the art of war is a science. And if there is a science of war there is diversity, dispute and contradiction between its professors, diversity partly projected into the category of Time. That is rather reassuring, for, as far as it goes, it indicates that truth rather than error is evolving.\u201d Later he said to me, \u201cSee in this war the ideas on the possibility of the break-through, for instance. First it is believed in, then we come back to the doctrine of invulnerability of the fronts, then again to the possible but risky break-through, to the necessity of not making a step forward until the objective has been first destroyed (the dogmatic journalist will write that to assert the contrary is the greatest foolishness), then, on the contrary, to that of advancing with a very light preparation by artillery, then to the invulnerability of the fronts as a principle in force since the war of 1870, from that the assertion that it is a false principle for this war and therefore only a relative truth. False in this war because of the accumulation of masses and of the perfecting of engines (see Bidou of the 2nd July, 1918), an accumulation which at first made one believe that the next war would be very short, then very long, and finally made one again believe in the possibility of decisive victories. Bidou cites the Allies on the Somme, the Germans marching on Paris in 1918. In the same way, at each victory of the Germans, it is said:\u2018the ground gained is nothing, the towns are nothing, what is necessary is to destroy the military force of the adversary.\u2019 Then the Germans in their turn adopt this theory in 1918 and Bidou curiously explains (and July, 1918) that the capture of certain vital points, certain essential areas, decides the victory. It is moreover a particular turn of his mind. He has shown how, if Russia were blockaded at sea, she would be defeated and that an army enclosed in a sort of vast prison camp is doomed to perish.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, if the war did not modify the character of Saint-Loup, his intelligence, developed through an evolution in which heredity played a great part, had reached a degree of brilliancy which I had never seen in him before. How far away was the young golden-haired man formerly courted or who aspired to be, by fashionable ladies and the dialectician, the doctrinaire who was always playing with words. To another generation of another branch of his family, much as an actor taking a part formerly played by Bressant or Delaunay, he, blonde, pink and golden was like a successor to M. de Charlus, once dark, now completely white. However much he failed to agree with his uncle about the war, identified as he was with that part of the aristocracy which was for France first and foremost whereas M. de Charlus was fundamentally a defeatist, to those who had not seen the original \u201ccreator of the part\u201d he displayed his powers as a controversialist. \u201cIt seems that Hindenburg is a revelation,\u201d I said to him. \u201cAn old revelation of tit-for-tat or a future one. They ought, instead of playing with the enemy, to let Mangin have his way, beat Austria and Germany to their knees and Europ\u00e9anise Turkey instead of Montenegrinising France.\u201d \u201cBut we shall have the help of the United States,\u201d I suggested. \u201cAt present all I see is the spectacle of Divided States. Why not make greater concessions to Italy and frighten them with dechristianising France?\u201d \u201cIf your Uncle Charlus could hear you!\u201d I said. \u201cReally you would not be sorry to offend the Pope a bit more and he must be in despair about what may happen to the throne of Francis Joseph. For that matter he\u2019s in the tradition of Talleyrand and the Congress of Vienna.\u201d \u201cThe era of the Congress of Vienna has gone full circle;\u201d he answered; \u201cone must substitute concrete for secret diplomacy. My uncle is at bottom an impenitent monarchist who would swallow carps like Mme Mol\u00e9 or scarps like Arthur Meyer as long as his carps and scarps were cooked \u00e0 la Chambord. Through hatred of the tricolour flag I believe he would rather range himself under the red rag, which he would accept in good faith instead of the white standard.\u201d Of course, these were only words and Saint-Loup was far from having the occasionally basic originality of his uncle. But his disposition was as affable and delightful as the other\u2019s was suspicious and jealous and he remained, as at Balbec, charming and pink under his thick golden hair. The only thing in which his uncle would not have surpassed him was in that mental attitude of the faubourg Saint-Germain with which those who believe themselves the most detached from it are saturated and which simultaneously gives them respect for men of intelligence who are not of noble birth (which only flourishes in the nobility and makes revolution so unjust) and silly self-complacency. It was through this mixture of humility and pride, of acquired curiosity of mind and inborn sense of authority, that M. de Charlus and Saint-Loup by different roads and holding contrary opinions had become to a generation of transition, intellectuals interested in every new idea and talkers whom no interrupter could silence. Thus a rather commonplace individual would, according to his disposition, consider both of them either dazzling or bores\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While recalling Saint-Loup\u2019s visit I had made a long-detour on my way to Mme Verdurin\u2019s and I had nearly reached the bridge of the Invalides. The lamps (few and far between, on account of Gothas) were lighted a little too early, for the change of hours had been prematurely determined for the summer season (like the furnaces which are lighted and extinguished at fixed dates) while night still came quickly and above the partly-illumined city, in one whole part of the sky \u2014 a sky which ignored summer and winter and did not deign to observe that half-past eight had become half-past nine \u2014 it still continued to be daylight. In all that part of the city, dominated by the towers of the Trocadero, the sky had the appearance of an immense turquoise-tinted sea, which, at low-tide, revealed a thin line of black rocks or perhaps only fishermen\u2019s nets aligned next each other and which were tiny clouds. A sea, now the colour of turquoise which was bearing unknowing man with it in the immense revolution of an earth upon which they are mad enough to continue their own revolutions, their vain wars such as this one now drenching France in blood. In fact one became giddy looking at the lazy, beautiful sky which deigned not to change its time-table and prolonged in its blue tones the lengthened day above the lighted city; it was no longer a spreading sea, but a vertical gradation of blue glaciers. And the towers of the Troca-dero seeming so close to those turquoise heights were in reality as far away from them as those twin towers in a town of Switzerland which, from far away, seem to neighbour the mountain-slopes. I retraced my steps but as I left the Bridge of the Invalides behind me there was no more day in the sky, nor scarcely a light in all the city and stumbling here and there against the dust-bins, mistaking my road, I found myself, unexpectedly and after following a labyrinth of obscure streets, upon the Boulevards. There the impression of the East renewed itself and to the evocation of the Paris of the Directoire succeeded that of the Paris of 1815. As then, the disparate procession of uniforms of Allied troops, Africans in baggy red trousers, white-turbaned Hindus, created for me, out of that Paris where I was walking, an exotic imaginary city in an East minutely exact in costume and colour of the skins but arbitrarily chimerical in scenery, just as Carpaccio made of his own city a Jerusalem or a Constantinople by assembling therein a crowd whose marvellous medley of colour was not more varied than this. Walking behind two Zouaves who did not seem to notice him, I perceived a great stout man in a soft, felt hat and a long cloak, to whose mauve coloured face I hesitated to put the name of an actor or of a painter equally well-known for innumerable sodomite scandals. In any case feeling certain I did not know the promenader, I was greatly surprised, when his glance met mine, to notice that he was embarrassed and made as though to stop and speak to me, like one who wants to show you that you are not surprising him in an occupation he would rather have kept secret. For a second I asked myself who was saying good-evening to me. It was M. de Charlus. One could say of him that the evolution of his disease or the revolution of his vice had reached that extreme point where the small primitive personality of the individual, his ancestral qualities, were entirely obscured by the interposition of the defect or generic evil which accompanied them. M. de Charlus had gone as far as it was possible for him to go, or rather, he was so completely marked by what he had become, by habits that were not his alone but also those of many other inverts, that, at first, I had taken him for one of these following the zouaves on the open boulevard; in fact, for another of their kind who was not M. de Charlus, not a grand seigneur, not a man of mind and imagination and who only resembled the baron through that appearance common to them all and to him as well which, until one looked closer, had covered everything. It was thus that, having wanted to go to Mme Verdurin\u2019s, I met M. de Charlus. And certainly I should not have found him as I used to at her house; their quarrel had only become accentuated and Mme Verdurin often made use of present conditions to discredit him further. Having said for a long time that he was used up, finished, more old-fashioned in his pretended audacities than the most pompous nonentities, she now comprised that condemnation in a general indictment by saying that he was \u201cpre-war\u201d. According to the little clan, the war had placed between him and the present, a gulf which relegated him to a past that was completely dead. Moreover \u2014 and that concerned rather the political world which was less well-informed \u2014 Mme Verdurin represented him as done for, as complete a social as an intellectual outsider. \u201cHe sees no one, no one receives him,\u201d she told M. Bontemps, whom she easily convinced. Moreover there was some truth in what she said. The situation of M. de Charlus had changed. Caring less and less about society, having quarrelled with everybody owing to his petulant disposition and, having through conviction of his own social importance, disdained to reconcile himself with most of those who constituted the flower of society, he lived in a relative isolation which, unlike that in which Mme de Villeparisis died, was not caused by the ostracism of the aristocracy but by something which appeared to the eyes of the public worse, for two reasons. M. de Charlus\u2019 bad reputation, now well-known, caused the ill-informed to believe that that accounted for people not frequenting his society, while actually it was he who, of his own accord, refused to frequent them, so that the effect of his own atrabilious humour appeared to be that of the hostility of those upon whom he exercised it. Besides that, Mme de Villeparisis had a great rampart; her family. But M. de Charlus had multiplied the quarrels between himself and his family, which, moreover appeared to him uninteresting, especially the old faubourg side, the Courvoisier set. He who had made so many bold sallies in the field of art, unlike the Courvoisiers, had no notion that what would have most interested a Bergotte was his relationship with that old faubourg, his having the means of describing the almost provincial life lived by his cousins in the rue de la Chaise or in the Place du Palais Bourbon and the rue Garanci\u00e8re. A point of view less transcendent and more practical was represented by Mme Verdurin who affected to believe that he was not French. \u201cWhat is his exact nationality? Is he not an Austrian?\u201d M. Verdurin innocently inquired. \u201cOh, no, not at all,\u201d answered the Comtesse Mol\u00e9, whose first gesture rather obeyed her good sense than her rancour. \u201cNothing of the sort, he\u2019s a Prussian,\u201d pronounced la Patronne: \u201cI know, I tell you. He told us often enough he was a hereditary peer of Prussia and a \u2018Serene Highness\u2019.\u201d \u201cAll the same, the Queen of Naples told me \u2014\u201d \u201cAs to her, you know she\u2019s an awful spy,\u201d exclaimed Mme Verdurin who had not forgotten the attitude which the fallen sovereign had displayed at her house one evening. \u201cI know it most positively. She only lives by spying. If we had a more energetic Government, all those people would be in a concentration camp. And in any case you would do well not to receive that charming kind of society, for I happen to know that the Minister of the Interior has got his eye on them and your house will be watched. Nothing will convince me that during two years Charlus was not continually spying at my house.\u201d And thinking probably, that there might be some doubt as to the interest the German Government might take, even in the most circumstantial reports on the organisation of the \u201clittle clan\u201d, Mme Verdurin, with the soft, confidential manner of a person who knows the value of what she is imparting and that it seems more significant if she does not raise her voice, \u201cI tell you, from the first day I said to my husband,\u2018the way in which this man has inveigled himself into our house is not to my liking. There\u2019s something suspicious about it.\u2019 Our estate was on a very high point at the back of a bay. I am certain he was entrusted by the Germans to prepare a base there for their submarines. Certain things surprised me and now I understand them. For instance, at first he would not come by train with the other guests. I had offered in the nicest way to give him a room in the ch\u00e2teau. Well, not a bit of it, he preferred living at Donci\u00e8res where there were an enormous number of troops. All that stank in one\u2019s nostrils of espionage.\u201d As to the first of these accusations directed against the Baron de Charlus, that of being out of fashion, society people were quite ready to accept Mme Verdurin\u2019s point of view. This was ungrateful of them for M. de Charlus who had been, up to a point their poet, had the art of extracting from social surroundings a sort of poetry into which he wove history, beauty, the picturesque, comedy and frivolous elegance. But fashionable people, incapable of understanding poetry, of which they saw none in their own lives, sought it elsewhere and placed a thousand feet above M. de Charlus men infinitely inferior to him, who affected to despise society and, on the other hand, professed social and political-economic theories. M. de Charlus delighted in an unpro-fessedly lyrical form of wit with which he described the knowing grace of the Duchesse of X\u2019s dresses and alluded to her as a sublime creature. This caused him to be looked upon as an idiot by those women in society who thought that the Duchesse of X was an uninteresting fool, that dresses are made to be worn without drawing attention to them and who, thinking themselves more intelligent, rushed to the Sorbonne or to the Chamber if Deschanel was going to speak. In short, people in society were disillusioned with M. de Charlus, not because they had got through him but because they had never grasped his rare intellectual value. He was considered pre-war, old-fashioned, just because those least capable of judging merit, most readily accept the edicts of passing fashion; so far from exhausting, they have hardly even skimmed the surface of men of quality in the preceding generation whom they now condemn en bloc because they are offered the label of a new generation they will understand just as little. As to the second accusation against M. de Charlus, that of Germanism, the happy-medium mentality of people in society made them reject it, but they encountered an indefatigable and particularly cruel interpreter in\nMorel, who, having managed to retain in the press and even in society the position which M. de Charlus had succeeded in getting him by expending twice as much trouble as he would have taken in depriving him of it, pursued the Baron with implacable hatred; this was not only cruel on the part of Morel, but doubly wrong, for whatever his relations with the Baron might have been, Morel had experienced the rare kindness his patron hid from so many people. M. de Charlus had treated the violinist with such generosity, with such delicacy, had shown such scruple about not breaking his word, that the idea of him which Charlie had retained was not at all that of a vicious man (at most he considered the Baron\u2019s vice a disease) but of one with the noblest ideas and the most exquisite sensibility he had ever known, a sort of saint. He denied it so little that though he had quarrelled with him he said sincerely enough to his relations, \u201cYou can confide your son to him, he would only have the best influence upon him.\u201d Indeed when he tried to injure him by his articles, in his mind he jeered, not at his vices but, at his virtues. Before the war, certain little broad-sheets, transparent to what are called the \u201cinitiates\u201d, had begun to do the greatest harm to M. de Charlus. Of one of these entitled The Misadventure of a pedantic Duchess, the Old Age of the Baroness Mme Verdurin had bought fifty copies, in order to lend them to her acquaintances, and M. Verdurin, declaring that Voltaire himself never wrote anything better, read them aloud to his friends. Since the war it was not the invertion of the Baron alone that was denounced, but also his alleged Germanic nationality. \u201cFrau Bosch\u201d, \u201cFrau voh der Bosch\u201d were the customary surnames of M. de Charlus. One effusion of poetic character had borrowed from certain dance melodies in Beethoven, the title \u201cUne Allemande\u201d. Finally, two little novels, Oncle d\u2019Am\u00e9rique et Tante de Francfort, and Gaillard d\u2019arri\u00e8re, read in proof by the little clan, had given delight to Brichot himself who remarked, \u201cTake care the most noble and puissant Anastasia doesn\u2019t do us in.\u201d The articles themselves were better done than their ridiculous titles would have led one to suppose. Their style derived from Bergotte but in a way which perhaps only I could recognise, for this reason. The writings of Bergotte had had no influence upon Morel. Fecundation had occurred in so peculiar and exceptional a fashion that I must register it here. I have indicated in its place the special way Bergotte had of selecting his words and pronouncing them when he talked. Morel, who had met him in early days, gave imitations of him at the time in which he mimicked his speech perfectly, using the same words as Bergotte would have used. So now Morel transcribed conversations \u00e0 la Bergotte but without transmuting them into what would have represented Bergotte\u2019s style of writing. As few people had talked with Bergotte, they did not recognise the tonality which was quite different from his style. That oral fertilisation is so rare that I wanted to mention it here; for that matter, it produces only sterile flowers\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Morel, who was at the Press Bureau and whose irregular situation was unknown, made the pretence, with his French blood boiling in his veins like the juice of the grapes of Combray, that to work in an office during the war was not good enough and that he wanted to join up (which he could have done at any moment he pleased) while Mme Verdurin did everything in her power to persuade him to remain in Paris. Certainly she was indignant that M. de Cambre-mer, in spite of his age, had a staff job, and she remarked about every man who did not come to her house, \u201cWhere has he found means of hiding?\u201d And if anyone affirmed that so and so had been in the front line from the first day she answered, lying unscrupulously or from the mere habit of falsehood, \u201cNot a bit of it, he has never stirred from Paris, he is doing something about as dangerous as promenading around the Ministries. I tell you I know what I am talking about because I have got it from someone who has seen him.\u201d But in the case of \u201cthe faithful\u201d it was different. She did not want them to go and alluded to the war as a \u201cboring business\u201d that took them away from her; and she took all possible steps to prevent them going which gave her the double pleasure of having them at dinner and, when they did not come or had gone, of abusing them behind their backs for their pusillanimity. The \u201cfaithful\u201d had to lend themselves to this embusquage and she was distressed when Morel pretended to be recalcitrant and told him, \u201cBy serving in the Press Bureau you are doing your bit, and more so than if you were at the front. What is required is to be useful, really to take part in the war, to be of it. There are those who are of it and embusqu\u00e9s; you are of it and don\u2019t you bother, everyone knows you are and no one can have a word to say against you.\u201d Under different circumstances, when men were not so few and when she was not obliged as now to have chiefly women, if one of them lost his mother she did not hesitate to persuade him that he could unhesitatingly continue to go to her receptions. \u201cSorrow is felt in the heart. If you were to go to a ball (she never gave any) I should be the first to advise you not to, but here at my little Wednesdays or in a box at the theatre, no one can be shocked. Everybody knows how grieved you are.\u201d Now, however, men were fewer, mourning more frequent, she did not have to prevent them from going into society, the war saw to that. But she wanted to persuade them that they were more useful to France by stopping in Paris, in the same way as she would formerly have persuaded them that the defunct would have been more happy to see them enjoying themselves. All the same she got very few men, and sometimes, perhaps, she regretted having brought about the rupture with M. de Charlus, which could never be repaired\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if M. de Charlus and Mme Verdurin no longer saw each other, each of them \u2014 with certain minor differences \u2014 continued as though nothing had changed, Mme Verdurin to receive and M. de Charlus to go about his own pleasures. For example, at Mme Verdurin\u2019s house, Cottard was present at the receptions in the uniform of a Colonel of l\u2019Ile du R\u00e8ve rather similar to that of a Haitian Admiral, and upon the lapel of which a broad sky-blue ribbon recalled that of the Enfants de Marie; as to M. de Charlus, finding himself in a city where mature men who had up to then been his taste had disappeared, he had, like certain Frenchmen who run after women when they are in France but who live in the Colonies, at first from necessity, then from habit, acquired a taste for little boys\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, one of the characteristic features of the Salon Verdurin disappeared soon after, for Cottard died \u201cwith his face to the enemy\u201d the papers said, though he had never left Paris; the fact was he had been overworked for his time of life and he was followed shortly afterwards by M. Verdurin, whose death caused sorrow to one person only \u2014 would one believe it? \u2014 Elstir. I had been able to study his work from a point of view which was in a measure final. But, as he grew older, he associated it superstitiously with the society which had supplied his models and, after the alchemy of his intuitions had transmuted them into works of art, gave him his public. More and more inclined to the belief that a large part of beauty resides in objects as, at first, he had adored in Mme Elstir that rather heavy type of beauty he had studied in tapestries and handled in his pictures, M. Verdurin\u2019s death signified to him the disappearance of one of the last traces of the perishable social framework, falling into limbo as swiftly as the fashions in dress which form part of it \u2014 that framework which supports an art and certifies its authenticity like the revolution which, in destroying the elegancies of the eighteenth century, would have distressed a painter of f\u00eates galantes or afflicted Renoir when Montmartre and the Moulin de la Galette disappeared. But, above all, with M. Verdurin disappeared the eyes, the brain, which had had the most authentic vision of his painting, wherein that painting lived, as it were, in the form of a cherished memory. Without doubt young men had emerged who also loved painting, but another kind of painting, and they had not, like Swann, like M. Verdurin, received lessons in taste from Whistler, lessons in truth from Monet, which enabled them to judge Elstir with justice! Also he felt himself more solitary when M. Verdurin, with whom he had, nevertheless, quarrelled years ago, died and it was as though part of the beauty of his work had disappeared with some of that consciousness of beauty which had until then, existed in the world\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The change which had been effected in M. de Charlus\u2019 pleasures remained intermittent. Keeping up a large correspondence with the front, he did not lack mature men home on leave. Therefore, in a general way, Mme Verdurin continued to receive and M. de Charlus to go about his pleasures as if nothing had happened. And still for two years the immense human entity called France, of which even from a purely material point of view one can only feel the tremendous beauty if one perceives the cohesion of millions of individuals who, like cellules of various forms fill it like so many little interior polygons up to the extreme limit of its perimeter, and if one saw it on the same scale as infusoria or cellules see a human body, that is to say, as big as Mont Blanc, was facing a tremendous collective battle with that other immense conglomerate of individuals which is Germany. At a time when I believed what people told me, I should have been tempted to believe Germany, then Bulgaria, then Greece when they proclaimed their pacific intentions. But since my life with Albertine and with Fran\u00e7oise had accustomed me to suspect those motives they did not express, I did not allow any word, however right in appearance of William II, Ferdinand of Bulgaria or Constantine of Greece to deceive my instinct which divined what each one of them was plotting. Doubtless my quarrels with Fran\u00e7oise and with Albertine had only been little personal quarrels, mattering only to the life of that little spiritual cellule which a human being is. But in the same way as there are bodies of animals, human bodies, that is to say, assemblages of cellules, which, in relation to one of them alone, are as great as a mountain, so there exist enormous organised groupings of individuals which we call nations; their life only repeats and amplifies the life of the composing cellules and he who is not capable of understanding the mystery, the reactions and the laws of those cellules, will only utter empty words when he talks about struggles between nations. But if he is master of the psychology of individuals, then these colossal masses of conglomerate individuals facing one another will assume in his eyes a more formidable beauty than a fight born only of a conflict between two characters, and he will see them on the scale on which the body of a tall man would be seen by infusoria of which it would require more than ten thousand to fill one cubic milimeter. Thus for some time past the great figure of France, filled to its perimeter with millions of little polygons of various shapes and the other figure of Germany filled with even more polygons were having one of those quarrels which, in a smaller measure, individuals have\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the blows that they were exchanging were regulated by those numberless boxing-matches of which Saint-Loup had explained the principles to me. And because, even in considering them from the point of view of individuals they were gigantic assemblages, the quarrel assumed enormous and magnificent forms like the uprising of an ocean which with its millions of waves seeks to demolish a secular line of cliffs or like giant glaciers which, with their slow and destructive oscillation, attempt to disrupt the frame of the mountain by which they are circumscribed. In spite of this, life continued almost the same for many people who have figured in this narrative, notably for M. de Charlus and for the Verdurins, as though the Germans had not been so near to them; a permanent menace in spite of its being concentrated in one immediate peril leaving us entirely unmoved if we do not realise it. People pursue their pleasures from habit without ever thinking, were etiolating and moderating influences to cease, that the proliferation of the infusoria would attain its maximum, that is to say, making a leap of many millions of leagues in a few days and passing from a cubic mili-meter to a mass a million times larger than the sun, at the same time destroying all the oxygen of the substances upon which we live, that there would no longer be any humanity or animals or earth, and, without any notion that an irremediable and quite possible catastrophe might be determined in the ether by the incessant and frantic energy hidden behind the apparent immutability of the sun, they go on with their business, without thinking of these two worlds, one too small, the other too large for them to perceive the cosmic menace which hovers around us. Thus the Verdurins gave their dinners (soon, after the death of M. Verdurin, Mme Verdurin alone) and M. de Charlus went about his pleasures, without realising that the Germans \u2014 immobilised, it is true, by a bleeding barrier which was always being renewed \u2014 were at an hour\u2019s automobile drive from Paris. One might say the Verdurins did, nevertheless, think about it, since they had a political salon where the situation of the armies and of the fleets was discussed every day. As a matter of fact, they thought about those hecatombs of annihilated regiments, of engulfed seafarers, but an inverse operation multiplies to such a degree what concerns our welfare and divides by such a formidable figure what does not concern it, that the death of millions of unknown people hardly affects us more unpleasantly than a draught. Mme Verdurin, who suffered from headaches on account of being unable to get croissants to dip into her coffee, had obtained an order from Cottard which enabled her to have them made in the restaurant mentioned earlier. It had been almost as difficult to procure this order from the authorities as the nomination of a general. She started her first croissant again on the morning the papers an-announced the wreck of the Lusitania. Dipping it into her coffee, she arranged her newspaper so that it would stay open without her having to deprive her other hand of its function of dipping, and exclaimed with horror, \u201cHow awful! It\u2019s more frightful than the most terrible tragedies.\u201d But those drowning people must have seemed to her reduced a thousand-fold, for, while she indulged in these saddening reflections, she was filling her mouth and the expression on her face, induced, one supposes, by the savour of the croissant, precious remedy for her headache, was rather that of placid satisfaction\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus went beyond not passionately desiring the victory of France; without avowing it, he wanted, if not the triumph of Germany, at least that she should not, as everybody desired, be destroyed. The reason of this was that in quarrels the great assemblages of individuals called nations behave, in a certain measure, like individuals. The logic which governs them is within them and is perpetually remoulded by passion like that of people engaged in a love-quarrel or in some domestic dispute, such as that of a son with his father, of a cook with her mistress, of a woman with her husband. He who is in the wrong believes himself in the right, as was the case with Germany, and he who is in the right supports it with arguments which only appear irrefutable to him because they respond to his anger. In these quarrels between individuals, in order to be convinced that one of the parties is in the right \u2014 the surest plan is to be that party; no onlooker will ever be so: completely convinced of it. And an individual, if he be an integral part of a nation, is himself merely a cellule of an individual which is the nation. Stuffing people\u2019s heads full of words means nothing. If, at a critical period in the war, a Frenchman had been told that his country was going to be beaten, he would have been desperate as though he were himself about to be killed by the \u201cBerthas\u201d. Really, one fills one\u2019s own head with hope which is a sort of instinct of self-preservation in a nation if one is really an integral member of it. To remain blind to what is false in the claims of the individual called Germany, to see justice in every claim of the individual called France, the surest way was not for a German to lack judgment and for a Frenchman to possess it but for both to be patriotic. M. de Charlus, who had rare moral qualities, who was accessible to pity, generous, capable of affection and of devotion, was in contrast, for various reasons, amongst them that a Bavarian duchess had been his mother, without patriotism. In consequence he belonged as much to the body of Germany as to the body of France. If I had been devoid of patriotism myself, instead of feeling myself one of the cellules in the body of France, I think my way of judging the quarrel would not have been the same as formerly. In my adolescence, when I believed exactly what I was told, doubtless, on hearing the German Government protest its good faith, I should have been inclined to believe it, but now for a long time I had realised that our thoughts do not always correspond with our words\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But actually I can only imagine what I should have done if I had not been a member of the agent, France, as in my quarrels with Albertine, when my sad appearance and my choking throat were, as parts of my being, too passionately interested on my own behalf for me to reach any sort of detachment. That of M. de Charlus was complete. Since he was only a spectator, everything had the inevitable effect of making him Germanophile because, though not really French, he lived in France. He was very keen-witted and in all countries fools outnumber the rest; no doubt, if he had lived in Germany the German fools defending an unjust cause with passionate folly would \u2014 have equally irritated him; but living in France, the French fools, defending a just cause with passionate folly, irritated him no less. The logic of passion, even in the service of justice, is never irrefutable by one who remains dispassionate. M. de Charlus acutely noted each false argument of the patriots. The satisfaction a brainless fool gets out of being in the right and out of the certainty of success, is particularly irritating. M. de Charlus was maddened by the triumphant optimism of people who did not know Germany and its power as he did, who every month were confident that she would be crushed the following month, and when a year had passed were just as ready to believe in a new prognostic as if they had not with equal confidence credited the false one they had forgotten, or if they were reminded of it, replied that, \u201cit was not the same thing.\u201d M. de Charlus, whose mind contained some depth, might perhaps not have understood in Art that the \u201cit isn\u2019t the same thing\u201d offered as an argument by the detractors of Monet in opposition to those who contended that \u201cthey said the same thing about Delacroix\u201d, corresponded to the same mentality. And then M. de Charlus was merciful, the idea of a vanquished man pained him, he was always for the weak, and could not read the accounts of trials in the papers without feeling in his own flesh the anguish of the prisoner and a longing to assassinate the judge, the executioner and the mob who delighted in \u201cseeing justice done\u201d. In any case, it was now certain that France could not be beaten and he knew that the Germans were famine-stricken and would be obliged sooner or later to surrender at discretion. This idea was also more unpleasant to him owing to his living in France. His memories of Germany were, after all, dimmed by time, whereas the French who unpleasantly gloated in the prospect of crushing Germany, were people whose defects and antipathetic countenances were familiar to him. In such a case we feel more compassionate towards those unknown to us, whom we can only imagine, than towards those whose vulgar daily life is lived close to us, unless we feel completely one of them, one flesh with them; patriotism works this miracle, we stand by our country as we do by ourselves in a love quarrel. The war, too, acted on M. de Charlus as an extraordinarily fruitful culture of those hatreds of his which were born from one instant to another, lasted a very short time, but during it were exceedingly violent. Reading the papers, the triumphant tone of the articles daily representing Germany laid low, \u201cthe beast at bay, reduced to impotence\u201d, at a time when the contrary was only too true, drove him mad with rage by their irresponsible and ferocious stupidity. The papers were in part edited at that time by well-known people who thus found a way of \u201cdoing their bit\u201d; by the Brichots, the Norpois, by the Legrandins. M. de Charlus longed to meet and pulverise them with his bitterest irony. Always particularly well informed about sexual taints, he recognised them in others who, imagining themselves unsuspected, delighted in denouncing the sovereigns of the \u201cEmpires of prey\u201d, Wagner et cetera as culprits in this respect. He yearned to encounter them face to face so that he could rub their noses in their own vices before the world and leave these insulters of a fallen foe demolished and dishonoured. Finally M. de Charlus had a still further reason for being the Germanophile he was. One was that as a man of the world he had lived much amongst people in society, amongst men of honour who will not shake hands with a scamp; he knew their niceties and also their hardness, he knew they were insensible to the tears of a man they expel from a club, with whom they refuse to fight a duel, even if their act of \u201cmoral purity\u201d caused the death of the black sheep\u2019s mother. Great as his admiration had been for England, that impeccable England incapable of lies preventing corn and milk from entering Germany was in a way a nation of chartered gentlemen, of licensed witnesses and arbiters of honour, whilst to his mind some of Dostoevsky\u2019s disreputable rascals were better. But I never could understand why he identified such characters with the Germans since the latter do not appear to us to have displayed the goodness of heart which, in the case of the former, lying and deceit failed to prejudice. Finally, a last trait will complete the Germanophilism of M. de Charlus, which he owed through a peculiar reaction to his \u201cCharlisme\u201d. He considered Germans very ugly, perhaps because they were a little too close to his own blood, he was mad about Moroccans but above all about Anglo-Saxons whom he saw as living statues of Phidias. In him sexual gratification was inseparable from the idea of cruelty and (how strong this was I did not then realise) the man who attracted him seemed like a kind of delightful executioner. He would have thought, if he had sided against the Germans, that he was acting as he only did in his hours of self-indulgence, that is, in a sense contrary to his naturally merciful nature, in other words, impassioned; by seductive evil and desiring to crush virtuous ugliness. He was like that at the time of the murder of Rasputine at a supper party a la Dostoevsky, which impressed people by its strong Russian flavour (an impression which would have been much stronger if the public had been aware of all that M. de Charlus knew), because life deceives us so much that we come to believing that literature has no relation with it and we are astonished to observe that the wonderful ideas books have presented to us are gratuitously exhibited in everyday life, without risk of being spoilt by the writer, that for instance, a murder at a supper-party, a Russian incident, should have something Russian about it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The war continued indefinitely and those who had announced years ago from a reliable source that negotiations for peace had begun, specifying even the clauses of the armistice, did not take the trouble, when they talked with you, to excuse themselves for their false information. They had forgotten it and were ready sincerely to circulate other information which they would forget equally quickly. It was the period when there were continuous raids of Gothas. The air perpetually quivered with the vigilant and sonorous vibration of the French aeroplanes. But sometimes the siren rang forth like a harrowing appeal of the Walkyries, the only German music one had heard since the war \u2014 until the hour when the firemen announced that the alarm was finished, while the maroon, like an invisible newsboy, communicated the good news at regular intervals and cast its joyous clamour into the air\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus was astonished to discover that even men like Brichot who, before the war, had been militarist and reproached France for not being sufficiently so, were not satisfied with blaming Germany for the excesses of her militarism, but even condemned her for admiring her army. Doubtless, they changed their view when there was a question of slowing down the war against Germany and rightly denounced the pacifists. Yet Brichot, as an example of inconsistency, having agreed in spite of his failing sight, to give lectures on certain books which had appeared in neutral countries, exalted the novel of a Swiss in which two children, who fell on their knees in admiration of the symbolic vision of a dragoon, are denounced as the seed of militarism. There were other reasons why this denunciation should displease M. de Charlus, who considered that a dragoon can be exceedingly beautiful. But still more he could not understand the admiration of Brichot, if not for the book which the baron had not read, at all events for its spirit which was so different from that which distinguished Brichot before the war. Then everything that was soldierlike was good, whether it was the irregularities of a General de Boisdeffre, the travesties and machinations of a Colonel du Paty de Clam or the falsifications of Colonel Henry. But by that extraordinary volte-face (which was in reality only another face of that most noble passion, patriotism, necessarily militarised when it was fighting against Dreyfusism which then had an anti-militarist tendency and now was almost anti-militarist since it was fighting against Germany, the super-militarist country), Brichot now cried: \u201cOh! What an admirable exhibition, how seemly, to appeal to youth to continue brutality for a century, to recognise no other culture than that of violence: a dragoon! One can imagine the sort of vile soldiery we can expect of a generation brought up to worship these manifestations of brute force.\u201d \u201cNow, look here,\u201d M. de Charlus said to me, \u201cyou know Brichot and Cambremer. Every time I see them, they talk to me about the extraordinary lack of psychology in Germany. Between ourselves, do you believe that until now they have cared much about psychology or that even now they are capable of proving they possess any? But, believe me, I am not exaggerating. Even when the greatest Germans are in question, Nietzsche or Goethe, you will hear Brichot say \u2018with that habitual lack of psychology which characterises the Teutonic race\u2019. Obviously there are worse things than that to bear but you must admit that it gets on one\u2019s nerves. Norpois is more intelligent, I admit, though he has never been other than wrong from the beginning. But what is one to say about those articles which excite universal enthusiasm? My dear Sir, you know as well as I do what Brichot\u2019s value is, and I have a liking for him even since the feud which has separated me from his little tabernacle, on account of which I see him much less. Still, I have a certain respect for this college dean, a fine speaker and an erudite, and I avow that it is extremely touching, at his age and in bad health as he is, for he has become sensibly so in these last years, that he should have given himself up to what he calls service. But whatever one may say, good intention is one thing, talent another and Brichot never had talent. I admit that I share his admiration for certain grandeurs of the war. At most, however, it is extraordinary that a blind partisan of antiquity like Brichot, who never could be ironical enough about Zola seeing more beauty in a workman\u2019s home, in a mine than in historic palaces or about Goncourt putting Diderot above Homer and Watteau above Raphael, should repeat incessantly that Thermopylae or Austerlitz were nothing in comparison with Vauquois. This time the public, which resisted the modernists of Art and Literature, follows those of the war, because it\u2019s the fashion to think like that and small minds are not overwhelmed by the beauty but by the enormous scale of the war. They never write Kolossal without a K but at bottom what they bow down to is indeed colossal.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt is a curious thing,\u201d added M. de Charlus, with that little high voice he adopted at times, \u201cI hear people who look quite happy all day long and drink plenty of excellent cocktails, say they will never be able to see the war through, that their hearts aren\u2019t strong enough, that they cannot think of anything else and that they will die suddenly, and the extraordinary thing is that it actually happens; how curious! Is it a matter of nourishment, because they only eat things which are badly cooked or because, to prove their zeal, they harness themselves to some futile task which interferes with the diet that preserved them? Anyhow, I have registered a surprising number of these strange premature deaths, premature at all events, so far as the desire of the dead person was concerned. I do not remember exactly what I was saying to you about Brichot and Norpois admiring this war but what a singular way to talk about it. To begin with, have you remarked that pullulation of new idioms used by Norpois which, exhausted by daily use \u2014 for really he is indefatigable and I believe the death of my Aunt Ville-parisis gave him a second youth \u2014 are immediately replaced by others that are in general use. Formerly, I remember you used to be amused by noting these modes of language which appear, are kept going for a time, and then disappear: \u2018He who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind\u2019, \u2018The dog barks, the caravan passes\u2019, \u2018Find me a good politic and I shall produce good finance for you, said Baron Louis\u2019. These are symptoms which it would be exaggerated to take too tragically but which must be taken seriously, \u2018To work for the King of Prussia\u2019, (for that matter this last has been revived as was inevitable). Well, since, alas, I have seen so many of them die we have had the \u2018Scrap of paper\u2019, \u2018the Robber Empires\u2019, \u2018the famous Kultur which consists in assassinating defenceless women and children\u2019, \u2018Victory, as the Japanese say, will be to him who can endure a quarter of an hour longer than the other\u2019, \u2018The Germano-Turanians\u2019, \u2018Scientific barbarity\u2019, \u2018if we want to win the war in accordance with the strong expression of Mr. Lloyd George\u2019, in fact, there are no end of them; the mordant of the troops, and the cran of the troops. Even the sentiments of the excellent Norpois undergo, owing to the war, as complete a modification as the composition of bread or the rapidity of transport. Have you observed that the excellent man, anxious to proclaim his desires as though they were a truth on the point of being realised, does not, all the same, dare to use the future tense which might be contradicted by events, but has adopted instead the verb \u2018know\u2019.\u201d I told M. de Charlus that I did not understand what he meant. I must observe here that the Duc de Guermantes did not in the least share the pessimism of his brother. He was, moreover, as Anglophile as M. de Charlus was Anglophobe. For instance, he considered M. Caillaux a traitor who deserved to be shot a thousand times over. When his brother asked him for proofs of this treason, M. de Guermantes answered that if one only condemned people who signed a paper on which they declared \u201cI have betrayed\u201d, one would never punish the crime of treason. But in case I should not have occasion to return to it, I will also remark that two years later the Duc de Guermantes, animated by pure anti-Caillauxism, made the acquaintance of an English military attach\u00e9 and his wife, a remarkably well-read couple, with whom he made friends as he did with the three charming ladies at the time of the Dreyfus Affair and that from the first day he was astounded, in talking of Caillaux, whose conviction he held to be certain and his crime patent, to hear one of the charming and well-read couple remark, \u201cHe will probably be acquitted, there is absolutely nothing against him.\u201d M. de Guermantes tried to allege that M. de Norpois, in his evidence had exclaimed, looking the fallen Caillaux in the face, \u201cYou are the Giolitti of France, yes, M. Caillaux, you are the Giolitti of France.\u201d But the charming couple smiled and ridiculed M. de Norpois, giving examples of his senility and concluded that he had thus addressed a M. Caillaux overthrown according to the Figaro, but probably in reality a very sly M. Caillaux. The opinions of the Duc de Guermantes soon changed. To attribute this change to the influence of an English woman is not as extreme as it might have seemed if one had prophesied even in 1919, when the English called the Germans Huns and demanded a ferocious sentence on the guilty, that their opinion was to change and that every decision which could sadden France and help Germany would be supported by them. To return to M. de Charlus. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, in reply to my not understanding him, \u201c\u2018to know\u2019 in the articles of Norpois takes the place of the future tense, that is, expresses the wishes of Norpois, all our wishes, for that matter,\u201d he added, perhaps not with complete sincerity. \u201cYou understand that if \u2018know\u2019 had not replaced the simple future tense one might, if pressed, admit that the subject of this verb could be a country. For instance, every time Brichot said \u2018America \u201cwould not know\u201d how to remain indifferent to these repeated violations of right,\u2019 \u2018the two-headed Monarchy \u201cwould not know\u201d how to fail to mend its ways\u2019, it is clear that such phrases express the wishes of Norpois (his and ours) but, anyhow, the word can still keep its original sense in spite of its absurdity, because a country can \u2018know\u2019, America can \u2018know\u2019, even the two-headed Monarchy itself can \u2018know\u2019 (in spite of its eternal lack of psychology) but that sense can no longer be admitted when Brichot writes \u2018the systematic devastations \u201cwould not know\u201d how to persuade the neutrals\u2019, or \u2018the region of the Lakes \u201cwould not know\u201d how to avoid shortly falling into the hands of the Allies\u2019, or \u2018the results of the elections in the neutral countries \u201cwould not know\u201d how to reflect the opinion of the great majority in those countries\u2019. Now it is clear that these devastations, these Lakes and these results of elections are inanimate things which cannot \u2018know\u2019. By that formula Norpois is simply addressing his injunctions to the neutrals (who, I regret to observe, do not seem to obey him) to emerge from their neutrality or exhorts the Lakes no longer to belong to the \u2018Boches\u2019.\u201d (M. de Charlus put the same sort of arrogance into his tone in pronouncing the word boches as he did formerly in the train to Balbec when he alluded to men whose taste is not for women,) \u201cMoreover, did you observe the tricks Norpois made use of in opening his articles on neutrals ever since 1914? He begins by declaring emphatically that France has no right to mix herself up in the politics of Italy, Roumania, Bulgaria, et cetera. It is \u2018for those powers alone to decide with complete independence, consulting only their national interests, whether or not they are to abandon their neutrality.\u2019 But if the preliminary declarations of the article (which would formerly have been called the exordium) are so markedly disinterested, what follows is generally much less so. Anyhow, as he goes on M. de Norpois says substantially, \u2018it follows that those powers only who have allied themselves with the side of Right and Justice will secure material advantages from the conflict. It cannot be expected that the Allies will compensate those nations which, following the line of least resistance, have not placed their sword at the service of the Allies, by granting them territories from which, for centuries the cry of their oppressed brethren has been raised in supplication\u2019. Norpois, having taken this first step towards advising intervention, nothing stops him and he now offers advice more and more thinly disguised, not only as to the principle but also as to the appropriate moment for intervention. \u2018Naturally,\u2019 he says, playing as he would himself call it, the good apostle, \u2018it is for Italy, for Roumania alone to decide the proper hour and the form under which it will suit them to intervene. They cannot, however, be unaware that if they delay too long, they run the risk of missing the crucial moment. Even now Germany trembles at the thud of the Russian cavalry. It is obvious that the nations which have only flown to help in the hour of victory of which the resplendent dawn is already visible, can in no wise have a claim to the rewards they can still secure by hastening, et cetera, et cetera\u2019. It is like at the theatre when they say,\u2018the last remaining seats will very soon be gone. This is a warning to the dilatory\u2019, an argument which is the more stupid that Norpois serves it up every six months and periodically admonishes Roumania: \u2018The Hour has come for Roumania to make up her mind whether she desires or not to realise her national aspirations. If she waits much longer, she will risk being too late\u2019. And though he has repeated the admonition for two years, the \u2018too late\u2019 has not yet come to pass and they keep on increasing their offers to Roumania. In the same way he invites France et cetera to intervene in Greece as a protective power because the treaty which bound Greece to Serbia has not been maintained. And, really and truly, if France were not at war and did not desire the assistance of the benevolent neutrality of Greece, would she think of intervening as a protective power and would not the moral sentiment which inspires her reprobation of Greece for not keeping her engagements with Serbia, be silenced the moment the question arose of an equally flagrant violation in the case of Roumania and Italy who, like Greece, I believe with good reason, have not fulfilled their obligations, which were less imperative and extensive than is supposed, as Allies of Germany. The truth is that people see everything through their newspaper and how can they do otherwise, seeing that they themselves know nothing about the peoples or the events in question. At the time of the \u2018Affaire\u2019 which stirred all passions during that period from which it is now the right thing to say we are separated by centuries, for the war-philosophers have agreed that all links with the past are broken, I was shocked at seeing members of my own family give their esteem to anti-clericals and former Communists whom their paper represented as anti-Dreyfusards and insult a general of high birth and a Catholic who was a revisionist. I am no less shocked to see the whole French people execrate the Emperor Francis Joseph, whom they used rightly to venerate; I am able to assure you of this, for I used to know him well and he honoured me by treating me as his cousin. Ah! I have not written to him since the war,\u201d he added as though avowing a fault for which he knew he could not be blamed. \u201cYes, let me see, I did write once, only the first year. But it doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t in the least change my respect for him, but I have many young relatives fighting in our lines and they would, I know, consider that I was acting very badly if I kept up a correspondence with the head of a nation at war with us. Let him who wishes criticise me,\u201d he added, as if he were boldly exposing himself to my reproof; \u201cI did not want a letter signed Charlus to arrive at Vienna in such times as these. The chief criticism that I should direct against the old sovereign is that a Seigneur of his rank, head of one of the most ancient and illustrious houses in Europe, should have allowed himself to be led by the nose by that little upstart of a country squire very intelligent for that matter but a pure parvenu like William of Hohenzollern. That is not the least shocking of the anomalies of this war.\u201d And as, once he adopted the nobiliary point of view which for him overshadowed everything else, M. de Charlus was capable of the most childish extravagances, he told me, in the same serious tone as if he were speaking of the Marne or of Verdun, that there were most interesting and curious things which should not be excluded by any historian of this war. \u201cFor instance,\u201d he said, \u201cpeople are so ignorant that no one has observed this remarkable point: the Grand-Master of the Order of Malta, who is a pure-bred Boche, does not on that account cease living at Rome where, as Grand-Master of our Order he enjoys exterritorial privileges. Isn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d he added with the air of saying, \u201cYou see you have not wasted your evening by meeting me.\u201d I thanked him and he assumed the modest air of one who is not asking for payment. \u201cAh! What was I telling you? Oh, yes, that people now hated Francis Joseph according to their paper. In the cases of the King Constantine of Greece and the Czar of Bulgaria the public has wavered between aversion and sympathy according to reports that they were going to join the Entente or what Norpois calls \u2018the Central Empires\u2019. It is like when he keeps on telling us every moment that the hour of Venizelos is going to strike. I do not doubt that Venizelos is a man of much capacity but how do we know that his country wants him so much? He desired, we are informed, that Greece should keep her engagements with Serbia. So we ought to know what those engagements were and if they were more binding than those which Italy and Roumania thought themselves justified in violating. We display an anxiety about the way in which Greece executes her treaties and respects her constitution that we certainly should not have were it not to our interest. If there had been no war, do you believe that the guaranteeing powers would even have paid the slightest attention to the dissolution of the Chamber? I observe that one by one they are withholding their support from the King of Greece so as to be able to throw him out or imprison him the day that he has no army to defend him. I was telling you that the public only judges the King of Greece and the Czar of Bulgaria by the papers, and how could they do otherwise since they do not know them? I used to see a great deal of them and knew them well. When Constantine of Greece was Crown Prince he was a marvel of beauty. I have always believed that the Emperor Nicholas had a great deal of sentiment for him. Honi soit qui mal y pense, of course. Princess Christian spoke of it openly, but she\u2019s a fiend. As to the Czar of the Bulgarians, he\u2019s a sly hussy, a regular show-figure, but very intelligent, a remarkable man. He\u2019s very fond of me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. de Charlus, who could be so pleasant, became odious when he touched on these subjects. His self-complacency irritated one like an invalid who keeps on assuring you how well he is. I have often thought that the \u201cfaithful\u201d who so much wanted the avowals withheld by the tortuous personage of Balbec, could not have put up with his ostentatious but uneasy display of his mania and would have felt as uncomfortable as if a morphino-maniac took out his syringe in front of them; probably they would soon have had enough of the confidences they thought they would relish. Besides, one got sick of hearing everybody relegated without proof to a category to which he belonged himself though he denied it. In spite of his intelligence, he had constructed for himself in that connection a narrow little philosophy (at the base of which there was perhaps a touch of that peculiar way of looking at life which characterised Swann) which attributed everything to special causes and, as always happens when a man is conscious of bordering on his own particular defect, he was unworthy of himself and yet unusually self-satisfied. So it came about that so earnest, so noble-minded a man could wear that idiotic smile when he enunciated: \u201cas there are strong presumptions of the same character in regard to Ferdinand of Coburg\u2019s relations with the Emperor William, that might be the reason why Czar Ferdinand placed himself by the side of the Robber-Empires. Dame, after all, that is quite comprehensible. One is generous to one\u2019s sister, one doesn\u2019t refuse her anything. To my mind it would be a very charming explanation of the alliance of Germany and Bulgaria.\u201d And M. de Charlus laughed as long over this stupid explanation as though it had been an ingenious one which, even if there had been any justification for it, was as puerile as the observations he made about the war when he judged it from the feudal point of view of from that of a Knight of the Order of Jerusalem. He finished with a sensible observation: \u201cIt is astonishing that the public, though it only judges men and things in the war by the papers, is convinced that it is exercising its own initiative.\u201d M. de Charlus was right about that. I was told that Mme de Forcheville\u2019s silences and hesitations were worth witnessing for the sake of her facial expression when she announced with deep personal conviction: \u201cNo, I do not believe that they will take Warsaw\u201d, \u201cI am under the impression that it will not last a second winter.\u201d \u201cWhat I do not want is a lame peace.\u201d \u201cWhat alarms me, if you care for my opinion, is the Chamber.\u201d \u201cYes, I believe, all the same, they can break through.\u201d In enunciating these phrases, Odette\u2019s features assumed a knowing look which was emphasised when she remarked: \u201cI don\u2019t say that the German armies don\u2019t fight well, but they lack that cran as we call it.\u201d In using that expression (or the word mordant in connection with the troops) she made a gesture of kneading with her hand, putting her head on one side and half-closing her eyes like an art-student. Her language bore more traces than ever of her admiration for the English whom she was no longer content to call as she used to \u201cour neighbours across the Channel\u201d, or \u201cour friends the English\u201d, but nothing less than \u201cour loyal allies\u201d. Unnecessary to say that she never neglected to use in all contexts the expression \u201cfair play\u201d in order to show that the English considered the Germans unfair players. \u201cFair play is what is needed to win the war, as our brave allies say.\u201d And she rather awkwardly associated the name of her son-in-law with everything that concerned the English soldiers and alluded to the pleasure he found in living on intimate terms with the Australians, as also with the Scottish, the New Zealanders and the Canadians. \u201cMy son-in-law, Saint-Loup, knows the slang of all those brave \u2018tommies\u2019. He knows ho\u2019w to make himself understood by those who came from the far \u2018Dominions\u2019 and he would just as soon fraternise with the most humble private as with the general commanding the base.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let this digression about Mme de Forcheville, while I am walking along the boulevard side by side with M. de Charlus, justify a longer one, to elucidate the relations of Mme Verdurin with Brichot at this period. If poor Brichot, like Norpois, was judged with little indulgence by M. de Charlus (because the latter was at once extremely acute and, unconsciously, more or less Germanophile) he was actually treated much worse by the Verdurins. The latter were, of course, chauvinist, and they ought to have liked Brichot\u2019s articles which, for that matter, were not inferior to many publications considered delectable by Mme Verdurin. The reader will, perhaps, recall that, even in the days of La Raspeli\u00e8re, Brichot had become, instead of the great man they used to think him, if not a Turk\u2019s head like Saniette, at all events the object of their thinly disguised raillery. Nevertheless, he was still one of the \u201cfaithfuls\u201d which assured him some of the advantages tacitly allotted by the statutes to all the foundation and associated members of the little group. But as, gradually, perhaps owing to the war or through the rapid crystallisation of the long-delayed fashionableness with which all the necessary but till then invisible elements had long since saturated the Verdurin Salon, that salon had been opened to a new society and as the \u201cfaithfuls\u201d, at first the bait for this new society, had ended by being less and less frequently invited, so a parallel phenomenon was taking place in Brichot\u2019s case. In spite of the Sorbonne, in spite of the Institute, his fame had, until the war, not outgrown the limits of the Verdurin salon. But when almost daily he began writing articles embellished with that false brilliance we have so often seen him lavishly dispensing for the benefit of the \u201cfaithful\u201d and as he possessed a real erudition which, as a true Sorbonian, he did not seek to hide under some of the graces he gave to it, society was literally dazzled. For once, moreover, it accorded its favour to a man who was far from being a nonentity and who could claim attention owing to the fertility of his intelligence and the resources of his memory. And while three duchesses went to spend the evening at Mme Verdurin\u2019s, three others contested the honour of having the great man at their table; and when the invitation of one of them was accepted, she felt herself the freer because Mme Verdurin, exasperated by the success of his articles in the faubourg Saint-Germain, had taken care not to have him at her house when there was any likelihood of his encountering there some brilliant personage whom he did not yet know and who would hasten to capture him. Brichot in his old age was satisfied to bestow on journalism in exchange for liberal emoluments, all the distinction he had wasted gratis and unrecognised in the Verdurins\u2019 salon (for his articles gave him no more trouble than his conversation, so good a talker and so learned was he) and this might have brought him unrivalled fame and at one moment seemed on the eve of doing so, had it not been for Mme Verdurin. Certainly Brichot\u2019s articles were far from being as remarkable as society people believed them to be. The vulgarity of the man was manifest at every instant under the pedantry of the scholar. And over and above imagery which meant nothing at all (\u201cthe Germans can no longer look the statue of Beethoven in the face\u201d, \u201cSchiller must have turned in his grave\u201d, \u201cthe ink which initialled the neutrality of Belgium was hardly dry\u201d, \u201cLenin\u2019s words mean no more than the wind over the steppes\u201d) there were trivialities such as \u201cTwenty thousand prisoners, that\u2019s something like a figure\u201d. \u201cOur Command will know how to keep its eyes open once for all\u201d. \u201cWe mean to win; one point, that\u2019s all\u201d. But mixed up with that nonsense, there were so much knowledge, intelligence and good reasoning. Now Mme Verdurin never began one of Brichot\u2019s articles without the anticipatory satisfaction of expecting to find absurdities in it and read it with concentrated attention so as to be certain not to let any of them escape her. Unfortunately there always were some, one hardly had to wait. The most felicitous quotation from an almost unknown author, unknown at all events, by the writer of the work Brichot referred to, was made use of to prove his unjustifiable pedantry and Mme Verdurin awaited the dinner-hour with impatience so that she could let loose her guests\u2019 shrieks of laughter, \u201cWell! What about our Brichot this evening? I thought of you when I was reading the quotation from Cuvier. Upon my word, I believe he\u2019s going crazy.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t read it yet,\u201d said a \u201cfaithful\u201d. \u201cWhat, you haven\u2019t read it yet? You don\u2019t know the delights in store for you. It\u2019s so perfectly idiotic that I nearly died of laughing.\u201d And delighted that someone or other had not yet read the particular article so that she could expose Brichot\u2019s absurdities herself, Mme Verdurin told the butler to bring the Temps and began to read it aloud, emphasising the most simple phrases. After dinner, throughout the evening, the anti-Brichot campaign continued, but with a pretence of reserve. \u201cI\u2019m not reading this too loud because I\u2019m afraid that down there,\u201d she pointed at the Comtesse Mol\u00e9, \u201cthere\u2019s a lingering admiration for this rubbish. Society people are simpler than one would think.\u201d While they wanted Mme Mol\u00e9 to hear what they were saying about her, they pretended the contrary by lowering their voices, and she, in cowardly fashion, disowned Brichot whom in reality she considered the equal of Michelet. She agreed with Mme Verdurin and yet, so as to end on a note which seemed to her incontrovertible, added, \u201cOne cannot deny that it is well written.\u201d \u201cYou call that well written,\u201d rejoined Mme Verdurin, \u201cI consider that it\u2019s written like a pig,\u201d a sally which raised a society laugh, chiefly because Mme Verdurin, rather abashed by the word \u201cpig\u201d, had uttered it in a whisper, with her hand over her lips. Her vindictiveness towards Brichot increased the more because he naively displayed satisfaction at his success in spite of ill-humour provoked by the censorship each time, as he said, with his habitual use of slang to show he was not too don-like, it had caviard\u00e9 a part of his article. To his face Mme Verdurin did not let him perceive how poor an opinion she had of his articles except by a sullen demeanour which would have enlightened a more perceptive man. Once only she reproached him with using \u201cI\u201d so often. As a matter of fact he did so, partly from professional habit; expressions like: \u201cI admit that\u201d, \u201cI am aware that the enormous development of the fronts necessitates\u201d, et cetera, et cetera imposed themselves on him but still more because as a former militant anti-Dreyfusard who had surmised the German preparations long before the war, he had grown accustomed to continually writing: \u201cI have denounced them since 1897\u201d, \u201cI pointed it out in 1901\u201d, \u201cI. warned them in my little brochure, very scarce to-day \u2018habent sua fata libelli\u2018\u201d and thus the habit had taken root. He blushed deeply at Mme Verdurin\u2019s bitter observation. \u201cYou are right, madame. One who loved the Jesuits as little as M. Combes, before he had been privileged with a preface by our charming master in delightful scepticism, Anatole France, who, unless I err, was my adversary \u2014 before the deluge, said that the \u2018I\u2019 was always detestable.\u201d From that moment Brichot replaced \u201cI\u201d by \u201cwe\u201d, but \u201cwe\u201d did not prevent the reader from seeing that the writer was speaking about himself, on the contrary it enabled him never to cease talking about himself, making a running commentary out of his least significant sentences and composing an article simply on a negation, invariably protected by \u201cwe\u201d. For instance, Brichot had stated, maybe, in another article that the German armies had lost some of their value, he would then begin as follows: \u201c\u2018We\u2019 are not going to disguise the truth. \u2018We\u2019 have said that these German armies had lost some of their value. \u2018We\u2019 have not said that they were not still of great value. Still less shall \u2018we\u2019 say that they have no value at all, any more than \u2018we\u2019 should say that ground is gained which is not gained, et cetera, et cetera.\u201d In short, Brichot would have been able, merely by enunciating everything he would not say and by recalling everything that he had been saying for years and what Clausewitz, Ovid, Apollonius of Tyana had said so and so many centuries ago, easily to constitute the material of a large volume. It is a pity he did not publish it because those articles crammed with erudition are now difficult to obtain. The faubourg Saint-Germain, instructed by Mme Verdurin, began laughing at Brichot at her house, but, once they got away from the little clan, they continued to admire him. Then laughing at him became the fashion as it had been the fashion to admire him, and even those ladies who continued to be secretly interested in him, had no sooner read one of his articles, than they stopped and laughed at them in company, so as not to appear less intelligent than others. Brichot had never been so much talked about in the little clan as at this period, but with derision. The criterion of the intelligence of every newcomer was his opinion of Brichot\u2019s articles; if he responded unsatisfactorily the first time, they soon taught him how to judge people\u2019s intelligence. \u201cWell, my dear friend,\u201d continued M. de Charlus, \u201call this is appalling and there\u2019s a good deal more to deplore than tiresome articles. They talk about vandalism, about the destruction of statues, but is not the destruction of so many wonderful young men who were polychrome statues of incomparable beauty also vandalism? Is not a city in which there are no more beautiful men like a city in which all the statuary has been destroyed? What pleasure can I have in going to dinner at a restaurant where I am served by old moss-grown pot-bellies who look like P\u00e8re Didon, if not by women in mob caps who make me think I am at a Bouillon Duval. Exactly, my dear fellow, and I think I have the right to say so, for the Beautiful is as much the Beautiful in living matter. A fine pleasure to be served by rickety creatures with spectacles the reason of whose exemption can be read in their faces. Nowadays, if one wants to gratify one\u2019s eyes with the sight of a good-looking person in a restaurant, one must no longer seek him among the waiters but among the customers. And one may see a servant again, often as they are changed, but what about that English lieutenant who has been to the restaurant for the first time and will perhaps be killed to-morrow? When Augustus of Poland, as Morand, the delightful author of Clarisse narrates, exchanged one of his regiments against a collection of Chinese pots, in my opinion he did a bad business. To think that all those splendid footmen six feet high, who adorned the monumental staircases of our beautiful lady friends, have all been killed, most of them having joined up because people kept on telling them that the war would only last two months. Ah! little did they know, as I did, the power of Germany, the valour of the Prussian race,\u201d he added, forgetting himself. And then, noticing that he had allowed his point of view to be too clearly seen, he continued: \u201cIt is not so much Germany as the war itself that I fear for France. People imagine that the war is only a gigantic boxing-match at which they are gazing from afar, thanks to the papers. But that is completely untrue. It is a disease which, when it seems cured at one spot crops up in another. To-day, Noyon will be relieved, to-morrow we shall have neither bread nor chocolate, the day after, he who believed himself safe and would, if needs must, be ready to die an unimagined death, will be horrified to read in the papers that his class has been called up. As to monuments, the destruction of a unique masterpiece like Rheims is not so terrible to me as to witness the destruction of such numbers of ensembles which made the smallest village of France instructive and charming.\u201d Immediately I began thinking of Combray and how in former days I had thought myself diminished in the eyes of Mme de Guermantes by avowing the modest situation which my family occupied there. I wondered if it had not been revealed to the Guermantes and to M. de Charlus whether by Legrandin or Swann or Saint-Loup or Morel. But that this might have been divulged was less painful to me than retrospective explanations. I only hoped that M. de Charlus would not allude to Combray. \u201cI do not want to speak ill of the Americans, monsieur,\u201d he continued, \u201cit seems they are inexhaustibly generous and, since there has been no orchestral conductor in this war and each entered the dance considerably after the other and the Americans began when we were almost finished, they may have an ardour which four years of war has quenched among us. Even before the war they loved our country and our art and paid high prices for our masterpieces of which they have many now. But it is precisely this deracinated art, as M. Barr\u00e9s would say, which is the reverse of everything which made the supreme charm of France. The Chateau explained the church which in its turn, because it had been a place of pilgrimage, explained the chanson de geste. As an illustration, I need not elaborate my own origin and my alliances; for that matter we are not concerned with that, but recently I had to settle some family interests and in spite of a certain coolness which exists between myself and the Saint-Loup family, I had to pay a visit to my niece who lives at Combray. Combray was only a little town like so many others, but our ancestors were represented as patrons in many of the painted windows of the church, in others our arms were inscribed. We had our chapel there and our tombs. This church was destroyed by the French and by the English because it served as an observation post for the Germans. All that medley of surviving history and of art which was France is being destroyed and it is not over yet. Of course I am not so ridiculous as to compare for family reasons the destruction of the Church of Combray with that of the Cathedral of Rheims which was a miracle of a Gothic cathedral in its spontaneous purity of unique statuary, or that of Amiens. I do not know if the raised arm of St. Firmin is smashed to atoms to-day. If it is, the the most noble affirmation of faith and of energy has disappeared from this world.\u201d \u201cThe symbol of it, monsieur,\u201d I answered, \u201cI love symbols as you do, but it would be absurd to sacrifice to the symbol the reality which it symbolises. The cathedrals must be adored until the day when in order to preserve them, it would be necessary to deny the truths which they teach. The raised arm of St. Firmin, with an almost military gesture, said: \u2018Let us be broken if honour demands it. Do not sacrifice men to stones whose beauty arises from having for a moment established human verities.\u2019\u201d. \u201cI understand what you mean,\u201d answered M. de Charlus, \u201cand M. Barr\u00e9s who alas! has been the cause of our making too many pilgrimages to the statue of Strasbourg and to the tomb of M. Deroul\u00e8de, was moving and graceful when he wrote that the Cathedral of Rheims itself was less dear to us than the life of one of our infantrymen. This assertion makes the rage of our newspapers against the German general who said that the Cathedral of Rheims was less precious to him than the life of a German soldier, rather ridiculous. And what is so exasperating and harrowing is that every country says the same thing. The reasons given by the industrialist associations of Germany for retaining possession of Belfort as indispensable for the preservation of their country against our ideas of revenge are the same as those of Barr\u00e9s exacting Mayence to protect us against the velleities of invasion by the Boches. How is it that the restitution of Alsace-Lorraine appeared to France an insufficient motive for a war and yet a sufficient motive for continuing it and for declaring it anew each year? You seem to believe the victory of France certain; I hope so with all my heart, you don\u2019t doubt that, but ever since, rightly or wrongly, the Allies believe that their own victory is assured (for my own part, of course, I should be delighted with such a solution, but I observe a great many paper victories, pyrrhic victories at a cost not revealed to us) and that the Boches are no longer confident of victory, we see Germany seeking peace and France wanting to prolong the war; that just France rightly desiring to make the voice of justice heard should be also France the compassionate, and make words of pity heard, were it only for the sake of her children, so that when spring-days come round and flowers bloom again, they will brighten other things than tombs. Be frank, my dear friend, you yourself exposed the theory to me that things only exist thanks to a perpetually renewed creation. You used to say that the creation of the world did not take place once and for all, but necessarily continues day by day. Well, if you said that in good faith you cannot except the war from that theory. It is all very well for our excellent Norpois to write (trotting out one of those rhetorical accessories he loves, like \u2018the dawn of victory\u2019 and \u2018General Winter\u2019) \u2018now that Germany has wanted war, the die is cast\u2019 the truth is that every day war is declared anew. Therefore he who wants to continue it is as culpable as he who began it, perhaps more, for the latter could not perhaps foresee all its horrors. And there is nothing to show that so prolonged a war, even if it has a victorious issue, will not have perils. It is difficult to talk about things which have no precedent and of repercussions on the organism of an operation which is attempted for the first time. Generally, it is true, we get over these novelties we\u2019re alarmed about quite well. The shrewdest Republican thought it mad to bring about the Disestablishment of the Church and it passed like a letter through the post. Dreyfus was rehabilitated, Picquart was made Minister of War without anybody saying a word. Nevertheless, what may not happen after such an exhaustion as that induced by an uninterrupted war lasting for several years? What will the men do when they come back? Will they be tired out? Will fatigue have broken them or driven them mad? All this may turn out badly, if not for France, at least for the Government and perhaps for the form of Government. Formerly you made me read the admirable Aim\u00e9e de Coigny by Maurras. I should be much surprised if some Aim\u00e9e de Coigny did not anticipate from the war which our Republic is making, developments expected by Aim\u00e9e de Coigny in 1812 from the war the Empire was then making. If that Aim\u00e9e de Coigny actually does exist, will her hopes be realised? I hope not. To return to the war itself: did the Emperor William begin it? I strongly doubt it and if so, what act has he committed that Napoleon, for instance, did not commit? Acts I, personally, consider abominable but I am astonished they should inspire so much horror in the Napoleonic incense-burners, in those who, on the day of the declaration of war, shrieked like General X: \u2018I have been awaiting this day for forty years. It is the greatest day of my life;\u2019 Heaven knows if anyone protested more loudly than I when society gave a disproportionate position to the Nationalists, to soldiers, when every friend of the Arts was accused of doing things which were injurious to the Fatherland, when every unwarlike civilisation was considered deleterious. Hardly an authentic social figure counted in comparison with a general, Some crazy woman or other nearly introduced me to M. Syveton! You will tell me that all I was concerned to uphold were laws of society; but, in spite of their apparent frivolity, they might perhaps have prevented many excesses. I have always honoured those who defend grammar and logic and it is only realised fifty years later that they have averted great dangers. And our Nationalists are the most Germanophobe, the most Die-hard of men, but during the last fifteen years their philosophy has entirely changed. As a fact, they are now urging the continuation of the war but it is only to exterminate a belligerent race and from love of peace. For the warlike civilisation they thought so beautiful fifteen years ago now horrifies them; not only they reproach Prussia with having allowed the military element in her country to predominate, but they consider that at all periods military civilisations were destructive of everything they have now discovered to be precious, including in the Arts that of gallantry. It suffices for one of their critics to be converted to nationalism for him to become at once a friend of peace; he is persuaded that in all warlike civilisations women play a humiliating and lowly part. One does not venture to reply that the ladies of the Knights in the Middle Ages and Dante\u2019s Beatrice were perhaps placed on a throne as elevated as M. Becque\u2019s heroines. I am expecting one of these days to find myself placed at table below a Russian revolutionary or perhaps only below one of our generals who make war because of their horror of war and in order to punish a people for cultivating an ideal which they themselves considered the only invigorating one fifteen years ago. The unhappy Czar was still honoured some months ago because he called the Conference of the Hague, but now that we are saluting free Russia we forget her only title to glory, thus the wheel of the world turns. And yet Germany uses so many of the same expressions as France that one might think that she\u2019s copying her. She never stops saying that she is fighting for her existence. When I read: \u2018We are fighting against an implacable and cruel enemy until we have obtained a peace which will guarantee our future against all aggression and in order that the blood of our brave soldiers should not have been shed in vain,\u2019 or \u2018who is not with us is against us\u2019, I do not know if this phrase is Emperor William\u2019s or M. Poincar\u00e9\u2018s, for each one has used the same words with variations twenty times, though to tell you the truth I must confess that the Emperor in this case was the imitator of the President of the Republic. France would not perhaps have held to prolonging the war if she had remained weak, but neither would Germany perhaps have been in such a hurry to finish it if she had not ceased to be strong, I mean, to be as strong as she was, for you will see she is still strong enough.\u201d He had got into the habit of talking very loud from nervousness, from seeking relief from impressions which, having never cultivated any art, he felt impelled to cast forth, as an aviator his bombs, into an open field where his words struck no one, and especially in society where they fell haphazard and where he was listened to with attention owing to snobbishness and where he so tyrannised his audience that one could say it was intimidated. On the boulevards this harangue was, moreover, a mark of his scorn for passers-by on whose account he no more lowered his voice than he would have moved aside for them. But there his voice exploded and astounded, and, especially when his remarks were sufficiently intelligible for passers-by to turn round, the latter might have had us arrested as defeatists. I drew M. de Charlus\u2019 attention to this but succeeded only in exciting his hilarity: \u201cAdmit that it really would be funny,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, one never knows, anyone of us risks every evening being in the news-column the following day; and, if it comes to that, why shouldn\u2019t I be shot in the ditch of Vincennes? The same thing happened to my great-uncle the Duc d\u2019Enghien, Thirst for noble blood delights the populace which in this respect displays more refinement than lions. As to those animals, you know, if Mme. Verdurin only had a scratch on her nose, she\u2019d say they had sprung upon, what in my youth one would have called her pif.\u201d And he began to laugh with his mouth wide open as though he had been alone in a room. At moments, seeing certain rather suspicious individuals emerging from a gloomy passage near where M. de Charlus was passing and congregating at some distance from him, I wondered whether he would prefer me to leave him alone or stay with him. Thus, one who met an old man subject to epileptic fits whose incoherent behaviour foreshadowed the probable imminence of an attack, would ask himself whether his company is desired as a support or feared as that of a witness from whom he might wish to hide the attack and whose mere presence perhaps might induce it whereas complete quiet might prevent it, while the possible event from which he cannot decide whether to fly or not, is revealed by the zigzag walk of the patient, similar to that of a drunken man. In the present case of M. de Charlus, the various divergent positions, signs of a possible incident of which I was not sure whether he wished it to happen or feared that my presence would prevent it, were, by an ingenious setting, not assumed by the baron himself who was walking straight on, but by a whole company of actors. All the same I think he preferred avoiding the encounter for he drew me into a side street more obscure than the boulevard and where there was a constant stream of soldiers of every army and of every nation, a juvenile influx compensating and consoling M. de Charlus for the reflux of all those men to the frontier which had caused that frightful void in Paris in the first days of the mobilisation. M. de Charlus unceasingly admired the brilliant uniforms passing before us which made Paris as cosmopolitan as a port, as unreal as a painted scene composed of architectural forms making a background for the most varied and seductive costumes. He retained all his respect and affection for certain grandes dames who were accused of defeatism, just as he did for those who had formerly been accused of Dreyfusism. He only regretted that in condescending to be political, they should have given a hold to \u201cthe polemics of journalists.\u201d His view was unchanged so far as they were concerned. For his frivolity was so systematic that birth combined with beauty and other glamours was the lasting thing, and the war, like the Dreyfus Affair, a vulgar and fugitive fashion. Had the Duchesse de Guermantes been shot as an overture to a separate peace with Austria, he would have considered it heroic and no more degrading than it seems to-day that Marie Antoinette was sentenced to decapitation. At that moment, M. de Charlus, looking as noble as a St. Vallier or a St. M\u00e9grin, was erect, rigid, solemn, spoke gravely, making none of those gestures and movements which reveal those of his kind. Yet why is it there are none whose voice is just right? At the very moment when he was talking of the most serious things, there was still that false note which needed tuning. And M. de Charlus literally did not know which way to look next, raising his head as though he felt the need of an opera-glass, which, however, would not have been much use to him, for, on account of the zeppelin raid of the previous day having aroused the vigilance of the public authorities, there were soldiers right up to the sky. The aeroplanes I had seen some hours earlier, like insects or brown spots upon the evening blue, continued to pass into the night deepened still more by the partial extinction of the street lamps like luminous faggots. The greatest impression of beauty given us by these flying human stars was perhaps that of making us look at the sky whither one rarely turned one\u2019s eyes in that Paris of which in 1914 I had seen the almost defenceless beauty awaiting the menace of the approaching enemy. Certainly there was now, as then, the ancient unchanged splendour of a moon cruelly, mysteriously serene, which poured upon the still intact monuments the useless loveliness of her light, but, as in 1914, and more than in 1914, there was something else, other lights and intermittent beams which, one realised, whether they came from aeroplanes or from the searchlights of the Eiffel Tower, were directed by an intelligent will, by a protective vigilance which caused that same emotion, inspired that same gratitude and calm I had experienced in Saint-Loup\u2019s room, in the cell of that military cloister where so many fervent and disciplined hearts were being prepared for the day when without a single hesitation they were to consummate their sacrifice in the fullness of youth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the raid of the evening before the sky was more agitated than the earth, but when it was over, the sky became comparatively calm but, like the sea after a tempest, not completely so. Aeroplanes rose like rockets into the sky to rejoin the stars and searchlights moved slowly across the sky divided into sections by their pale star dust like wandering Milky Ways. The aeroplanes so mingled with the stars that one could almost imagine oneself in another hemisphere looking at new constellations. M. de Charlus expressed his admiration for these aviators and, as he could no more help giving free play to his Germano-philism than to his other inclinations, although he denied both, said to me: \u201cMoreover, I must add that I admire the Germans in their Gothas just as much. And think of the courage that is needed to go in those zeppelins. They are simply heroes. And if they do throw their bombs upon civilians, don\u2019t our batteries fire upon theirs? Are you afraid of Gothas and cannon?\u201d I avowed that I was not, but perhaps I was wrong. Having got into the habit, through idleness, of postponing my work from day to day, I doubtless supposed death might deal in the same way with me. How could one be afraid of a shell which you are convinced will not strike you that day? Moreover, these isolated ideas of bombs thrown, of possible death, added nothing tragic to the image I had formed of the passing German airships, until, one evening, I might see a bomb thrown towards us from one of them as it was tossed and segmented in the storm-clouds or from an aeroplane which, though I knew its murderous errand, I had till then regarded as celestial. For the ultimate reality of danger is only perceived through something new and irreducible to what one has previously known which we call an impression and which is often, as was the case now, summed up in a line, a line which would disclose a purpose, a line in which there was a latent power of action which modified it; thus upon the Pont de la Concorde around the menacing and pursued aeroplane, as though the fountains of the Champs Elys\u00e9es, of the Place de la Concorde, of the Tuileries, were reflected in the clouds, searchlights like jets of luminous water pierced the sky like arrows, lines full of purpose, the foreseeing and protective purpose of powerful and wise men towards whom I felt that same gratitude as on the night in quarters at Donci\u00e8res when their power deigned to watch over us with such splendid precision\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The night was as beautiful as in 1914 when Paris was equally menaced. The moonbeams seemed like soft, continuous magnesium-light offering for the last time nocturnal visions of beautiful sites such as the Place Vend\u00f4me and the Place de la Concorde, to which my fear of shells which might destroy them lent a contrasting richness of as yet untouched beauty as though they were offering up their defenceless architecture to the coming blows. \u201cYou are not afraid?\u201d repeated M. de Charlus. \u201cParisians do not seem to realise their danger. I am told that Mme Verdurin gives parties every day. I only know it by hearsay for I know absolutely nothing about them; I have entirely broken with them,\u201d he added, lowering not only his eyes as if a telegraph boy had passed by, but also his head and his shoulders and lifting his arms with a gesture that signified: \u201cI wash my hands of them!\u201d \u201cAt least I can tell you nothing about them,\u201d (although I had not asked him). \u201cI know that Morel goes there a great deal\u201d (it was the first, time he had spoken to me about him). \u201cIt is suggested that he much regrets the past, that he wants to make it up with me again,\u201d he continued, showing simultaneously the credulity of a suburban who remarks: \u201cIt is commonly said that France is negotiating more than ever with Germany, even that pourparlers are taking place\u201d and of the lover whom the worst rebuffs cannot discourage. \u201cIn any case, if he wants to, he has only to say so. I am older than he is and it is not for me to take the first step.\u201d And indeed the useless-ness of his saying so was abundantly evident. But, besides, he was not even sincere and for that reason one was embarrassed about M. de Charlus because, when he said it was not for him to take the first step, he was, on the contrary, making one and was hoping that I should offer to bring about a reconciliation. Certainly I knew the na\u00efve or assumed credulity of those who care for someone or even who are simply not invited by him, and impute to that person a wish he has never expressed in spite of fulsome importunities\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must here be noted, that, unhappily, the very next day, M. de Charlus suddenly found himself face to face with Morel in the street. The latter in order to excite his jealousy took him by the arm and told him some tales that were more or less true and when M. de Charlus, bewildered and urgently wanting Morel to stay with him that evening, entreated him not to go away, the other, catching sight of a friend, said good-bye. M. de Charlus, in a fury, hoping that the threat which, as may be imagined, he was never likely to execute, would make Morel remain with him, said to him: \u201cTake care, I shall be revenged,\u201d and Morel turned away with a laugh, smacking his astonished friend on the back and putting his arm round him. From the sudden tremulous intonation with which M. de Charlus, in talking of Morel, had emphasised his words, from the pained expression in the depth of his eyes, I had the impression that there was something more behind his words than ordinary insistence. I was not mistaken and I will relate at once the two incidents which later proved it. (I am anticipating by many years in regard to the second of these incidents, which was after the death of M. de Charlus and that only occurred at a much later period. We shall have occasion to see him again several times, very different from the man we have hitherto known and in particular, when we see him the last time, it will be at a period when he had completely forgotten Morel). The first of these events happened only two years after the evening when I was walking down the boulevards, as I say, with M. de Charlus. I met Morel. Immediately I thought of M. de Charlus, of the pleasure it would give him to see the violinist, and I begged the latter to go and see him, were it only once. \u201cHe has been good to you,\u201d I told Morel. \u201cHe is now old, he might die, one must liquidate old quarrels and efface their memory.\u201d Morel appeared entirely to share my view as to the desirability of a reconciliation. Nevertheless, he refused categorically to pay a single visit to M. de Charlus. \u201cYou are wrong,\u201d I said to him. \u201cIs it obstinacy or indolence or perversity or ill-placed pride or virtue (be sure that won\u2019t be attacked), or is it coquetry?\u201d Then the violinist, distorting his face into an avowal which no doubt cost him dear, answered with a shiver: \u201cNo, it is none of those reasons. As to virtue, I don\u2019t care a damn, as to perversity, on the contrary, I\u2019m beginning to pity him, nor is it from coquetry, that would be futile. It is not from idleness, there are days together when I do nothing but twiddle my thumbs. No, it has nothing to do with all that, it is \u2014 I beg you tell no one, and it is folly for me to tell you \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s because I\u2019m afraid.\u201d He began trembling in all his limbs. I told him I did not understand what he meant. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me; don\u2019t let us say any more about it. You don\u2019t know him as I do. I could tell you things you\u2019ve no idea of.\u201d \u201cBut what harm could he do you? Less still if there were no resentment between you. And, besides, you know at bottom he is very kind.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed, I know it. I know that he is kind and full of delicacy and right feeling. But leave me alone, don\u2019t talk about it, I beg you, I\u2019m ashamed that I\u2019m afraid of him.\u201d The second incident dates from after the death of M. de Charlus. There were brought to me several souvenirs which he had left me and a letter enclosed in three envelopes written at least ten years before his death. But he had at that time been so seriously ill that he had made his will, then he had partially recovered before falling into the condition in which we shall see him later on the day of an afternoon party at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019. The letter had remained in a casket with objects he had left to certain friends, for seven years; seven years during which he had completely forgotten Morel. The letter written in a very fine yet firm hand was as follows: \u201cMy dear friend, the ways of Providence are sometimes inscrutable. It makes use of the sin of an inferior individual to prevent a just man\u2019s fall from virtue. You know Morel, you know where he came from, from what fate I wanted to raise him, so to speak, to my own level. You know that he preferred to return, not merely to the dust and ashes from which every man, for man is veritably a phoenix, can be reborn, but into the slime and mud where the viper has its being. He let himself sink and thus preserved me from falling into the pit. You know that my arms contain the device of Our Lord Himself: \u2018Inculcabis super leonem et aspidem\u2018, with a man represented with a lion and a serpent at his feet as a heraldic support. Now if the lion in me has permitted itself to be trampled on, it is because of the serpent and its prudence which is sometimes too lightly called a defect, because the profound wisdom of the Gospel has made of it a virtue, at least a virtue for others. Our serpent whose hisses were formerly harmoniously modulated when he had a charmer \u2014 himself greatly charmed for that matter \u2014 was not only a musical reptile but possessed to the point of cowardice that virtue which I now hold for divine, prudence.. It was this divine prudence which made him resist the appeals which I sent him to come and see me. And I shall have neither peace in this world nor hope of forgiveness in the next if I do not make this avowal to you. It is he who in this matter was the instrument of divine wisdom, for I had resolved that he should not leave me alive. It was necessary that one or the other of us should disappear. I had decided to kill him. God himself inspired his prudence to preserve me from a crime. I do not doubt but that the intercession of the Archangel Michael, my patron saint, played a great part in this matter, and I implore him to forgive me for having so much neglected him during many years and for having requited him so ill for the innumerable bounties he has shown me, especially in my fight against evil. I owe to his service, I say it from the fulness of my faith and my intelligence, that the Celestial Father inspired Morel not to come and see me. And now it is I who am dying. Your faithful and devoted Semper idem, P. G. Charlus.\u201d Then I understood Morel\u2019s fear. Certainly there were both pride and literature in that letter, but the avowal was true. And Morel knew better than I did that \u201calmost mad side\u201d which Mme de Guer-mantes recognised in her brother-in-law and which was not limited, as I had supposed until then, to momentary outbursts of superficial and futile passion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But we must retrace our steps. I am still walking down the boulevards beside M. de Charlus, who is using me as a vague intermediary for overtures of peace between him and Morel. Observing that I did not reply, he thus continued: \u201cAs to that, I do not know why he doesn\u2019t play any more. Apparently there is no more music, under the pretext of the war, but they dance and dine out. These f\u00eates represent what will be perhaps, if the Germans advance further, the last days of our Pompeii. It only needs the lava of some German Vesuvius (their naval guns are not less terrible than a volcano) to surprise them at their toilet and eternalise their gesture by interrupting it; children will later on be educated by illustrations of Mme Mol\u00e9 about to put the last layer of paint on her face before going to dine with her sister-in-law, or Sosth\u00e8ne de Guermantes finishing painting her false eyebrows. It will be lecturing material for the Brichots of the future; the frivolity of a period after ten centuries is worthy of the most serious erudition, especially if it has been preserved intact by a volcanic irruption in which matter akin to lava was thrown by bombardment. What documents for future history! When asphyxiating gases analogous to those emitted by Vesuvius and earthquakes like those which buried Pompeii will preserve intact all the remaining imprudent women who have not fled to Bayonne with their pictures and their statues. Moreover, has it not been Pompeii, a bit at a time every evening, for more than a year? These people flying to their cellars, not to bring out an old bottle of Mouton-Rothschild or of St. Emilion, but to hide themselves and their most precious possessions like the priests of Herculaneum surprised by death at the moment when they were carrying off the sacred vessels. Attachment to an object always brings death to the possessor. Paris was not, like Herculaneum, founded by Hercules. But what similarities force themselves upon one and that lucidity which has come to us is not only of our period, every period possessed it. If we think that to-morrow we may share the fate of the cities of Vesuvius, the women of those days believed they were menaced with the fate of the Cities of the Plain. They have discovered on the walls of one of the houses of Pompeii the inscription: \u2018Sodom and Gomorra.\u2019\u201d I do not know if it was this name of Sodom and the ideas which it aroused in him, or whether it was that of the bombardment which made M. de Charlus lift for an instant his eyes to Heaven, but he soon brought them down to earth again. \u201cI admire all the heroes of this war,\u201d he said. \u201cMy dear fellow, take all those English soldiers whom I thought of somewhat lightly at the beginning of the war as mere football-players presumptuous enough to measure themselves against professionals \u2014 and what professionals! Well, merely aesthetically they are athletes of Greece, yes, of Greece, my dear fellow, these are the youths of Plato or rather of the Spartans. A friend of mine went to their camp at Rouen and saw marvels of which one has no idea. It is no longer Rouen, it is another town. Of course there is still the old Rouen with the emaciated saints of the Cathedral. That is beautiful also, but it is another thing. And our poilus! I cannot tell you what a savour I find in our poilus, in our little \u2018parigots.\u2019 There, like that one who is passing so free and easy in that droll, wide-awake manner. I often stop and have a word with them. What quick intelligence, what good sense! And the boys from the Provinces, how nice they are with their rolling r\u2019s and their country jargon. I have always lived a great deal in the country, I have slept in the farms, I know how to talk to these people. But our admiration for the French must not allow us to underestimate our enemies, that diminishes ourselves. And you don\u2019t know what a German soldier is, you\u2019ve never seen them as I have, on parade doing the goose-step in \u2018Unter den Linden.\u2019\u201d In returning to the ideal of virility he had touched on at Balbec which in the course of time had taken a philosophic form, he made use of absurd arguments and at moments, even when he showed superiority, these forced one to perceive the limitations of a mere man of fashion, even though he was an intelligent man of fashion; \u201cYou see,\u201d he said, \u201cthat superb fellow, the German soldier, is a strong, healthy being, who only thinks of the greatness of his country, \u2018Deutschland uber Alles\u2019 which isn\u2019t as stupid as it sounds, and while they prepare themselves in virile fashion we are steeped in dilettantism.\u201d That word probably signified to M. de Charlus something analogous to literature, for immediately, recalling without doubt that I loved literature and, for a time, had the intention of devoting myself to it, he tapped me on the shoulder (taking the opportunity of leaning on it until I felt as bad as I used to during my military service from the recoil of a \u201c76\u201d) and remarked, as though to soften the reproach: \u201cYes, we have ruined ourselves by dilettantism, all of us, you too, remember, you can repeat your mea culpa like me. We have all been too dilettante.\u201d Through surprise at the reproach, lack of the spirit of repartee, deference towards my interlocutor and touched by his friendly kindness, I replied, as though, at his invitation, I ought also to strike my breast. And this was perfectly senseless, for I had not a shadow of dilettantism to reproach myself with. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll leave you,\u201d the knot of men which had escorted us some distance having at last disappeared, \u201cI\u2019m going home to bed like an old gentleman, the war seems to have changed all our habits \u2014 one of Norpois\u2019 aphorisms.\u201d As to that, I knew that M. de Charlus would not be less surrounded by soldiers because he was at home for he had transformed his mansion into a military hospital, yielding in that less to his obsession than to his good heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was a clear, still night and, in my imagination, the Seine, flowing between its circular bridges, circular through a combination of structure and reflection, resembled the Bosphorus, the moon symbolising, may-be, that invasion which the defeatism of M. de Charlus predicted or the cooperation of our Mussulman brothers with the armies of France, thin and curved like a sequin, seemed to be placing the Parisian sky under the oriental sign of the crescent. For an instant longer M. de Charlus stopped, facing a Senegalese and, in farewell took my hand and crushed it, a German habit, peculiar to people of the baron\u2019s sort, continuing for some minutes to knead it, as Cottard would have said, as though the baron wanted to impart to my joints a suppleness they had not lost. In the case of blind people touch supplements the vision to a certain extent; I hardly know which sense this kneading took the place of. Perhaps he believed he was only pressing my hand, as, no doubt, he also believed he was only glancing at the Senegalese who passed into the shadows and did not deign to notice he was being admired. But in both cases M. de Charlus made a mistake; there was an excess of contact and of staring. \u201cIs not the whole Orient of Decamps, of Fromentin, of Ingres, of Delacroix in all this?\u201d he remarked, still immobilised by the departure of the Senegalese. \u201cYou know that I am never interested in things and people except as a painter or as a philosopher. Besides, I\u2019m too old. But what a pity, to complete the picture, that one of us two is not an odalisque.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not the Orient of Decamps or even of Delacroix which began haunting my imagination when the baron left me, but the old Orient of the Thousand and One Nights which I had so much loved. Losing myself more and more in the network of black streets, I was thinking of the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid in quest of adventures in the lost quarters of Bagdad. Moreover, heat, due to the weather and to my walking, had made me thirsty, but all the bars had been closed long since and on account of the shortage of petrol the few taxis I met, driven by Levantines or negroes, did not even trouble to respond to my signs. The only place where I could have obtained something to drink and have regained the strength to return home, would have been a hotel. But in the street, rather far from the centre, I had now reached, all the hotels had been closed since the Gothas began hurling their bombs on Paris. The same applied to nearly all the shops whose proprietors, owing to the dearth of employees or because they themselves had taken fright and had fled to the country, had left upon their doors the usual notice, written by hand, announcing their reopening at a distant and problematical date. Those establishments which survived, announced in the same fashion they they would only open twice a week, and one felt that misery, desolation and fear inhabited the whole quarter. I was the more surprised to observe, amongst these abandoned houses, one where, in contrast, life seemed to have conquered fear and failure and which seemed to be full of activity and opulence. Behind the closed shutters of every window, lights, shaded to conform to police regulations, revealed complete indifference to economy and every few moments the door opened to admit some new visitor. This hotel must have excited the jealousy of the neighbouring shopkeepers (on account of the money which its owners must be making) and my curiosity was aroused on noticing an officer emerge from it at a distance of some fifteen paces which was too far for me to be able to recognise him in the darkness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet something about him struck me. It was not his face for I could not see it nor was it his uniform which was disguised in an ample cloak, it was the extraordinary disproportion between the number of different points past which his body flitted and the minute number of seconds employed in an exit, which resembled an attempted sortie by someone besieged. This made me believe, though I could not formally recognise him \u2014 whether by his outline, his slimness or his gait, or \u2014 even by his velocity but by a sort of ubiquity peculiar to him \u2014 that it was Saint-Loup. Who-ever he was, the officer with this gift of occupying so many different points in space in so short a time, had disappeared, without noticing me, in a cross street, and I stood asking myself whether or not I should enter this hotel the modest appearance of which made me doubt if it was really Saint-Loup who had emerged from it. I now remembered that Saint-Loup had got himself unhappily mixed up in an espionage affair owing to the appearance of his name in some letters seized upon a German officer. Full justice had been rendered him by the military authority but in spite of myself I related that fact to what I now saw. Was that hotel used as a meeting-place by spies? The officer had been gone some moments when I saw several privates of various arms enter and this added to my suspicions; and I was extremely thirsty. \u201cIt is probable I can get something to drink here,\u201d I said to myself and I took advantage of that to try and satisfy my curiosity in spite of my apprehensions. I do not think, however, that it was curiosity which decided me to climb up the several steps of the little staircase at the end of which the door of a sort of vestibule was open, no doubt on account of the heat. I believed at first that I should not be able to satisfy it for I saw several people come and ask for rooms, to whom the reply was given that there was not a single one vacant. Soon I grasped that all the people of the place had against them was that they did not belong to that nest of spies, for an ordinary sailor presented himself and they immediately gave him No. 28. I was able, thanks to the darkness, without being seen myself, to observe several soldiers and two men of the working class who were talking quietly in a small, stuffy room showily decorated with coloured portraits of women out of magazines and illustrated reviews. The men were expressing patriotic opinions: \u201cThere\u2019s no help for it, one must do like the rest,\u201d said one. \u201cCertainly, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be killed,\u201d another said in answer to a wish I had not heard, and who, I gathered, was leaving the following day for a dangerous post. \u201cJust think of it, at twenty-two! It would be pretty stiff after only doing six months!\u201d he cried in a tone revealing, more even than a desire to live, the justice of his reasoning as though being only twenty-two ought to give him a better chance of not being killed, in fact, that it was impossible he should be. \u201cIn Paris it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d said another, \u201cone wouldn\u2019t think there was a war on. Are you joining up, Julot?\u201d \u201cOf course I\u2019m joining up. I want to go and have a smack at those dirty Boches.\u201d \u201cThat Joffre! He\u2019s a chap who slept with Minister\u2019s wives, he\u2019s not done anything.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s rotten to hear that sort of stuff,\u201d interrupted an aviator who was somewhat older, turning towards the last speaker, a workman. \u201cI advise you not to talk like that when you get to the front or the poilus will very soon have you out of it.\u201d The banality of this conversation gave me no great desire to hear more and I was about to go up or down when my attention was roused by hearing the following words which made me tremble. \u201cIt is extraordinary that the patron has not come back yet, at this time of night. I don\u2019t know where he\u2019ll find those chains.\u201d \u201cBut the other is already chained up.\u201d \u201cYes, of course he\u2019s chained \u2014 in a way. If I were chained like that I\u2019d pretty soon free myself.\u201d \u201cBut the padlock is locked.\u201d \u201cOh! It\u2019s locked all right but if one tried, one could force it open. The trouble is the chains aren\u2019t long enough. You aren\u2019t going to explain that sort of thing to me, considering I was beating him the whole night till my hands bled.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019ll have to take a turn at it to-night.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s not my turn, it\u2019s Maurice\u2019s. It will be my turn on Sunday. The patron promised me.\u201d Now I knew why the sailor\u2019s strong arms were needed. If peaceful citizens had been refused admittance, it was not because the hotel was a nest of spies. An atrocious crime was going to be consummated if someone did not arrive in time to discover it and have the guilty arrested. On this threatened yet peaceful night all this seemed like a dream story and I deliberately entered the hotel with the determination of one who wants to see justice done with the enthusiasm of a poet. I lightly touched my hat and those present, without disturbing themselves, answered my salute more or less politely. \u201cWill you please tell me whom I can ask for a room and for something to drink?\u201d \u201cWait a minute, the patron has gone out.\u201d \u201cBut the chief is upstairs,\u201d suggested one of them. \u201cYou know perfectly well you can\u2019t disturb him.\u201d \u201cDo you think they\u2019ll give me a room?\u201d \u201cYes, I believe so, 43 must be free,\u201d said the young man who was sure of not being killed because he was only twenty-two, making room for me on the sofa beside him. \u201cIt would be a good thing to open the window, there\u2019s an awful lot of smoke here,\u201d said the aviator, and indeed each of them had a pipe or a cigarette. \u201cYes, that\u2019s all right, but shut the shutters first; you know lights are forbidden on account of zeppelins.\u201d \u201cThere won\u2019t be any more zeppelins, the papers said that they\u2019d all been shot down.\u201d \u201cThey won\u2019t come! They won\u2019t come! What do you know about it? When you\u2019ve been fifteen months at the front as I have, when you\u2019ve shot down your five German aeroplanes, then you\u2019ll be able to talk. It\u2019s absurd to believe the papers. They were over Compi\u00e8gne yesterday and killed a mother with her two children.\u201d The young man who hoped not to be killed and who had an energetic, open and sympathetic face spoke with ardent eyes and with profound pity. \u201cThere\u2019s no news of big Julot. His godmother hasn\u2019t had a letter from him for eight days and it\u2019s the first time he has been so long without giving her any news.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s his godmother?\u201d \u201cThe lady who keeps the place of convenience below Olympia.\u201d \u201cDo they sleep together?\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about, she\u2019s a perfectly respectable married woman. She sends him money every week because she\u2019s got a good heart. She\u2019s a jolly good sort.\u201d \u201cSo you know big Julot?\u201d \u201cDo I know him?\u201d The young man of twenty-two answered hotly. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my most intimate friends. There aren\u2019t many I think as much of as I do of him, he\u2019s a good pal, always ready to do one a turn. It would be a bad look out if anything happened to him.\u201d Someone proposed a game of dice and from the fevered fashion in which the young man cast them and called out the results with his eyes starting out of his head, it was easy to see that he had the temperament of a gambler. I could not quite grasp what someone else said to him just then but he suddenly cried in a tone of deep resentment. \u201cJulot a pimp! He may say he is but he bloody well isn\u2019t. I\u2019ve seen him pay his women. Yes I have. I don\u2019t say that Algerian Jeanne hasn\u2019t ever given him a bit. But never more than five francs, a woman in a house, earning more than fifty francs a day. To think of a man letting a woman give him only five francs. And now she\u2019s at the front, she\u2019s having a pretty hard life, I admit, but she earns what she likes and she never sends him anything. Julot a pimp, indeed there\u2019d be plenty of pimps at that rate. Not only he isn\u2019t a pimp, but I think he\u2019s a fool into the bargain.\u201d The oldest of the party, whom no doubt the patron had entrusted with keeping a certain amount of order, having gone out for a moment, only heard the end of the conversation but he stared at me and seemed visibly annoyed at the effect which it might have produced upon me. Without specially addressing the young man of twenty-two who had been exposing and developing his theory of venal love, he remarked in a general way: \u201cYou\u2019re talking too much and too loud The window is open. People are asleep at this hour. You know, if the patron heard you, there would be trouble.\u201d Just at that moment there was a sound of a door, opening, and everybody kept quiet, thinking it was the patron. But it was only a foreign chauffeur, whom everybody welcomed. When the young man of twenty-two, seeing the superb watch-chain extending across the new-comer\u2019s waistcoat, bestowed on him a questioning and laughing glance followed by a frown of his eyebrows at the same time giving me a severe wink, I understood that the first glance meant \u201cHullo! Where did you steal that? All my congratulations!\u201d and the second \u201cDon\u2019t say anything. We don\u2019t know this chap, so look out.\u201d Suddenly the patron came in sweating, carrying several yards of heavy chains, strong enough to chain up several prisoners and said: \u201cI\u2019ve got a nice load here. If all of you were not so lazy, I shouldn\u2019t be obliged to go myself.\u201d I told him I wanted a room for some hours only, \u201cI could not find a carriage and I am not very well, but I should like to have something taken up to my room to drink.\u201d \u201cPierrot, go to the cellar and fetch some cassis and tell them to prepare No. 43. There\u2019s No. 7 ringing. They say they\u2019re ill! Nice sort of illness! They\u2019re after cocaine, they look half-doped. They ought to be chucked out. Have a pair of sheets been put in No. 22? There you are, there\u2019s No. 7 ringing again. Run and see. What are you doing there, Maurice? You know very well you\u2019re expected, go up to 14 his, and look sharp!\u201d Maurice went out rapidly, following the patron who was evidently annoyed that I had seen his chains. \u201cHow is it you\u2019re so late?\u201d inquired the young man of twenty-two of the chauffeur. \u201cWhat do you mean, so late, I\u2019m an hour too early. But it\u2019s too hot to walk about, my appointment\u2019s only at midnight.\u201d \u201cBut who are you here for?\u201d \u201cFor Pamela la Charmeuse,\u201d answered the oriental chauffeur, whose laugh disclosed beautiful white teeth. \u201cAh!\u201d exclaimed the young man of twenty-two. Soon I was shown up to No. 43 but the atmosphere was so unpleasant and my curiosity so great that, having drunk my cassis, I descended the stairs, then, seized with another idea, I went up again and, without stopping at the floor where my room was, I went right up to the top. All of a sudden, from a room which was isolated at the end of the corridor, I seemed to hear stifled groans. I went rapidly towards them and applied my ear to the door. \u201cI implore you, pity, pity, unloose me, unchain me, do not strike me so hard,\u201d said a voice. \u201cI kiss your feet, I humiliate myself, I won\u2019t do it again, have pity.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t, you blackguard,\u201d replied another voice, \u201cand as you\u2019re screaming and dragging yourself about on your knees like that, I\u2019ll tie you to the bed. No mercy!\u201d And I heard the crack of a cat-o\u2019nine-tails, probably loaded with nails for it was followed by cries of pain. Then I perceived that there was a lateral peep-hole in the room, the curtain of which they had forgotten to draw. Creeping softly in that direction, I glided up to the peep-hole and there on the bed, like Prometheus bound to his rock, squirming under the strokes of a cat-o-nine-tails, which was, as a fact, loaded with nails, wielded by Maurice, already bleeding and covered with bruises which proved he was not submitting to the torture for the first time, I saw before me M. de Charlus. All of a sudden the door opened and someone entered who, happily, did not see me. It was Jupien. He approached the Baron with an air of respect and an intelligent smile. \u201cWell! Do you need me?\u201d The Baron requested Jupien to send Maurice out for a moment. Jupien put him out with the greatest heartiness. \u201cWe can\u2019t be heard, I suppose?\u201d asked the Baron. Jupien assured him that they could not. The Baron knew that Jupien, though he was as intelligent as a man of letters, had no sort of practical sense, and talked in front of designing people with hidden meanings that deceived no one, mentioning surnames everyone knew. \u201cOne second,\u201d interrupted Jupien who had heard a bell ring in room No. 3. It was a Liberal Deputy who was going away. Jupien did not need to look at the number of the bell, he knew the sound of it, as the deputy came after luncheon every day. That particular day he had been obliged to change his hour because he had to attend his daughter\u2019s marriage at mid-day at St. Pierre de Chaillot So he had come in the evening, but wanted to get away in good time because of his wife who got anxious if he came home late, especially in these times of bombardment. Jupien made a point of accompanying him to the door so as to show deference towards the honourable gentleman without any eye to his own advantage. For while the deputy repudiating the exaggerations of the Action Fran\u00e7aise (he would for that matter have been incapable of understanding a line of Charles Maurras or of L\u00e9on Daudet), was on good terms with Ministers who were flattered at being invited to his shooting parties, Jupien would never have dared to solicit the slightest help from him in his occasional difficulties with the police. He fully understood, if he had risked talking about such matters to the wealthy and timid legislator, he would not have been spared the most harmless raid but would instantly have lost the most generous of his customers. Having accompanied the deputy to the door, the latter pulled his hat over his eyes, raised his collar and gliding rapidly away as he did in his electoral campaigns, believed he was hiding his face. Jupien \u2014 going up again to M. de Charlus, said: \u201cIt was M. Eug\u00e8ne.\u201d At Jupien\u2019s, as in lunatic asylums, people were only called by their first names, but, to satisfy the curiosity of the habitu\u00e9s and increase the prestige of his house, he took care to add the surnames in a whisper. Sometimes, however, Jupien did not know the identity of his clients, so he invented them and said that this one was a stockbroker, another a man of title or an artist; trifling and amusing mistakes so far as those whom he wrongly named were concerned. He finally quite resigned himself to ignorance as to the identity of M. Victor. Jupien further had the habit of pleasing the Baron by doing the contrary of what is considered the right thing at certain parties: \u201cI am going to introduce M. Lebrun to you\u201d (in his ear: \u201che calls himself M. Lebrun but in reality he\u2019s a Russian Grand-Duke.)\u201d In another sense, Jupien did not think it interesting enough to introduce a milkman to M. de Charlus, but, with a wink: \u201cHe\u2019s a sort of milkman, but over and above that he\u2019s one of the most dangerous apaches in Belleville.\u201d (The rollicking way in which Jupien said \u201capache\u201c was worth seeing). And as though this observation were not enough, he added others such as: \u201cHe has been sentenced several times for stealing and burgling houses. He was sent to Fresnes for fighting (the same jolly air) with people in the street whom he half crippled and he has been in an African battalion where he killed his sergeant.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Baron was slightly annoyed with Jupien because he knew that everybody more or less in that house he had charged his factotum to buy and have run by an underling, owing to the indiscretions of the uncle of Mlle d\u2019Oloran late Mme de Cambremer, was aware of his personality and his name, (fortunately many believed it was a pseudonym and so deformed it that the Baron was protected by their stupidity, not by Jupien\u2019s discretion). Eased by the knowledge that they could not be overheard, the Baron said to him: \u201cI did not want to speak before that little fellow. He\u2019s very nice and does his best but he\u2019s not brutal enough. His face pleases me but he calls me a low debauchee as though he had learnt it by heart.\u201d \u201cOh dear no! No one has said a word to him,\u201d Jupien answered without realising the unlikelihood of the assertion. \u201cAs a matter of fact he was mixed up in the murder of a concierge in La Villette.\u201d \u201cIndeed? That is rather interesting,\u201d said the Baron with a smile. \u201cBut I\u2019ve just secured a butcher, a slaughterer, who looks rather like him; by a bit of luck he happened to look in. Would you like to try him?\u201d \u201cYes, with plea-ure.\u201d I watched the man of the slaughter-house enter. He did look a little like \u201cMaurice\u201d but, what was more curious, both of them were of a type that I had never been able to define but which I then realised was also exemplified in Morel; if not in his face as I knew it, at least in a cast of features that the eyes of love, seeing Morel differently from me, might have fitted into his countenance. From the moment that I had made within myself a model with features borrowed from my recollections of what Morel might represent to someone else, I realised that those two young men, of whom one was a jeweller\u2019s boy and the other a hotel-employee, were vaguely his successors. Must one conclude that M. de Charlus, at all events on one side of his love-affairs, was always faithful to the same type and that the lust which caused him to select these two young men was the same which had caused him to stop Morel on the platform of the station of Donci\u00e8res, that all three resembled a little that youth whose form, engraved in the sapphire eyes of M. de Charlus, gave to his gaze the peculiar something which had frightened me on that first day at Balbec. Or, was it that his love for Morel had modified the type he favoured and he was now seeking men who resembled Morel to console himself for the latter\u2019s desertion? Another supposition was that perhaps in spite of appearances there had never been between Morel and himself any relations but those of friendship and that M. de Charlus had made Jupien procure these young men because they sufficiently resembled Morel for him to have the illusion that Morel was taking pleasure with him. It is true, bearing in mind all that M. de Charlus had done for Morel, that this supposition seems improbable, if one did not know that love forces great sacrifices from us for the being we love and sometimes the sacrifice of our very desire which, moreover, is the less easily exorcised because the being we love feels that we love him the more. What takes away the likelihood of such a supposition was the highly strung and profoundly passionate temperament of M. de Charlus, similar in that respect to Saint-Loup, which might at first have played the same part in his relations with Morel, though a more decent and negative part, as his nephew\u2019s early relations with Rachel. The relations one has with a woman one loves (and that can apply also to love for a youth) can remain platonic for other reasons than the chastity of the woman or the unsensual nature of the love she inspires. The reason may be that the lover is too impatient and by the very excess of his love is unable to await the moment when he will obtain his desires by sufficient pretence of indifference. Continually, he returns to the charge, he never ceases writing to her whom he loves, he is always trying to see her, she refuses herself, he becomes desperate. From that time she knows, if she grants him her company, her friendship, that these benefits will seem so considerable to one who believed he was going to be deprived of them, that she need grant nothing more and that she can take advantage of the moment when he can no longer bear being unable to see her and when, at all costs, he must put an end to the struggle by accepting a truce which will impose upon him a platonic relationship as its preliminary condition. Moreover, during all the time that preceded this truce, the lover, in a constant state of anxiety, ceaselessly hoping for a letter, a glance, has long ceased thinking of the physical desire which at first tormented him but which has been exhausted by waiting and has been replaced by another order of longings more painful still if left unsatisfied. The pleasure formerly anticipated from caresses will later be accorded but transmuted into friendly words and promises of intercourse which brings delicious moments after the strain of uncertainty or after a look impregnated with such coldness that it seemed to remove the loved one beyond hope of his ever seeing her again. Women divine all this and know they can afford the luxury of never yielding to those who, from the first, have betrayed their inextinguishable desire. A woman is enchanted if, without giving anything, she can receive more than she generally gets when she does give herself. On that account highly-strung men believe in the chastity of their idol. And the halo with which they surround her is also a product, but, as we see, an indirect one, of their excessive love. There is in woman something of the unconscious function of drugs which are cunning without knowing it, like morphine. They are not indispensable in the case of those to whom they give the blessings of sleep and real well-being. By such they will not be bought at their weight in gold, taken in exchange for everything the sick man possesses, it is by those other unfortunates (they may, indeed, be the same but altered in the course of years) to whom the drug brings no sleep, gives them no pleasure but who, without it, are a prey to an agitation to which they must at all costs put an end, even though to do so means death. And M. de Charlus, whose case, with the slight difference due to the similarity of sex, can be included in the general laws of love, though he belonged to a family more ancient than the Capets themselves, rich and sought after by the most exclusive society, while Morel was nobody, might say to him as he had said to me: \u201cI am a prince and I desire your welfare,\u201d nevertheless Morel was his master if he did not yield to him. And perhaps, to know he was loved was sufficient to make him determine not to. The disgust of distinguished people for snobs who want to force themselves upon them, the virile man has for the invert, the woman for every man who is too much in love with her. M. de Charlus not only had every advantage, he might perhaps have offered immense bribes to Morel, yet it is likely that they would have been unavailing in opposition to the latter\u2019s will. M. de Charlus had something in common with the Germans to whom he belonged by his origin and who, in the war now proceeding, were, as the Baron too often repeated, conquerors on every front. But what use were their victories since each one left the Allies more resolved than ever to refuse them the peace and reconciliation they wanted. Thus Napoleon invaded Russia and magnanimously invited the authorities to present themselves to him. But no one came\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I went downstairs and entered the little ante-room where Maurice, uncertain whether they would call him back or not and whom Jupien had told to wait, was about to join in a game of cards with one of his friends. They were much excited about a croix-de-guerre which had been found on the floor and did not know who had lost it or to whom to send it back so that the rightful owner should not be worried about it. They then started talking about the bravery of an officer who had been killed trying to save his orderly. \u201cAll the same there are good people amongst the rich. I would have got killed with pleasure for such a man as that!\u201d exclaimed Maurice who evidently only managed to inflict his ghastly flagellations on the Baron from mechanical habit, ignorance, need of money and preference for making it without working although, perhaps, it gave him more trouble. And as M. de Charlus had feared, he was possibly a good-hearted fellow, and certainly he seemed plucky. Tears almost came into his eyes when he spoke of the death of the officer and the young man of twenty-two was equally moved. \u201cAh! They\u2019re fine fellows! Poor devils like us have nothing to lose. But a gentleman who\u2019s got lots of stuff, who can go and take his aperitif every day at six o\u2019clock, it\u2019s really a bit thick. One can jaw as much as one likes, but when one sees chaps like that die, really it\u2019s pretty stiff. God oughtn\u2019t to let rich people like that die, besides, they\u2019re useful to working people. The damned Boches ought to be killed to the last man of them for doing in a man like that. And look what they\u2019ve done at Louvain, cutting off the heads of little children! I don\u2019t know, I am not any better than anyone else but I\u2019d rather have my throat cut than obey savages like that; they aren\u2019t men, they are out and out savages, you can\u2019t deny it.\u201d In fact all these boys were patriots. One, only slightly wounded in the arm, was not on such a high level as the others as he said, having shortly to return to the front: \u201cDamn it, I wish it had been a proper wound\u201d (one which procures exemption) just as Mme Swann formerly used to say, \u201cI\u2019ve succeeded in catching a tiresome influenza.\u201d The door opened again for the chauffeur who had gone to take the air for a moment. \u201cHullo!\u201d he said, \u201cis it over already? It wasn\u2019t long!\u201d noticing Maurice who, he supposed, was engaged in whipping the man they nick-named after a newspaper of that period, \u201cThe man in chains.\u201d \u201cIt may not seem long to you who\u2019ve been out for a walk,\u201d answered Maurice, annoyed for it to be known that he had not pleased the customer upstairs, \u201cbut if you\u2019d been obliged to keep on whipping like me in this heat! If it weren\u2019t for the fifty francs he gives \u2014!\u201d \u201cBesides, he\u2019s a man who talks well, one feels he\u2019s had an education. Did he say it would soon be over?\u201d \u201cHe said we shan\u2019t get them, that it will end without either side winning.\u201d \u201cBon sang de bon sang! He must be a Boche.\u201d \u201cI told you you were talking too loud,\u201d said a man older than the others, noticing me. \u201cHave you done with your room?\u201d \u201cShut up, you\u2019re not master here.\u201d \u201cYes, I\u2019ve finished and I\u2019ve come to pay.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d better pay the patron. Maurice, go and fetch him.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to disturb you.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t disturb me.\u201d Maurice went upstairs and came back. \u201cThe patron is coming down,\u201d he said. I gave him two francs for his trouble. He blushed with pleasure: \u201cThank you very much. I shall send them to my brother who\u2019s a prisoner. No, he\u2019s all right, it depends on the camp.\u201d Meanwhile, two extremely elegant customers in dress coats and white ties under their overcoats, they seemed Russians from their slight accent, were standing in the doorway deliberating if they should enter. It was visibly the first time they had come there. They must have been told where the place was and seemed divided between desire, temptation and extreme fright. One of the two, a handsome young man, kept repeating every minute to the other, with a half-questioning, half-persuasive smile, \u201cAfter all, we don\u2019t care a damn.\u201d He might say he did not mind the consequences, but he was not so indifferent as his words suggested for his remark did not result in his entering but on the contrary, in another glance at his friend, followed by the same smile and the same, \u201cAfter all we don\u2019t care a damn.\u201d It was this \u201cwe don\u2019t care a damn,\u201d an example among thousands of that expressive language so different from what we generally speak, in which emotion makes us vary what we meant to say and in its place make use of phrases emerging from an unknown lake where live expressions without relation to one\u2019s thought and for that very reason reveal it. I remember that Albertine once, when Fran\u00e7oise noiselessly entered the room just at the moment when my friend was lying beside me nude, exclaimed in spite of herself, to warn me: \u201cAh! here\u2019s that beauty Fran\u00e7oise.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise, whose sight was not good, and who was crossing the room some distance from us, apparently saw nothing. But the abnormal words \u201cthat beauty Fran\u00e7oise\u201d which Albertine had never used in her life, spontaneously revealed their origin; Fran\u00e7oise knew they had escaped Albertine through emotion and understanding without seeing, went off muttering in her patois, the word \u201cpoutana\u201c. Much later on, when Bloch having become the father of a family, married one of his daughters to a Catholic, an ill-bred person informed her that he had heard she was the daughter of a Jew and asked her what her name had been. The young woman who had been Miss Bloch since her birth, answered, pronouncing Bloch in the German fashion as the Duc de Guermantes might have done, that is, pronouncing the Ch not like \u201cK\u201d but with the Germanic \u201cch\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To go back to the scene of the hotel, (into which the two Russians had finally decided to penetrate \u2014\u201cafter all we don\u2019t care a damn\u201d) the patron had not yet come back when Jupien entered and rated them for talking too loud, saying that the neighbours would complain. But he stood dumbfounded on seeing me. \u201cGet out all of you this instant!\u201d he cried. Immediately all of them jumped up, whereupon I said: \u201cIt would be better if these young men stayed here and I went outside with you a moment.\u201d He followed me, much troubled, and I explained to him why I had come. One could hear customers asking the patron if he could not introduce them to a footman, a choir boy, a negro chauffeur. All professions interested these old madmen; soldiers of all arms and the allies of all nations. Some especially favoured Canadians, feeling the charm of their accent which was so slight that they did not know whether it was of old France or of England. On account of their kilts and because of the lacustrine dreams associated with such lusts, Scotchmen were at a premium, and as every mania owes its peculiar character, if not its aggravation, to circumstances, an old man, whose prurient cravings had all been sated, demanded with insistence to be made acquainted with a mutilated soldier. Steps were heard on the stairs. With the indiscretion which was natural to him, Jupien could not resist telling me it was the Baron who was coming down, that he must not on any account see me but if I would enter the little room contiguous to the passage where the young men were, he would open the shutter, a trick he had invented for the Baron to see and hear without being seen and which would now operate in my favour against him. \u201cOnly don\u2019t make a noise,\u201d he said. And half pushing me into the darkness, he left me. Moreover, he had no other room to offer me, his hotel, in spite of the war, being full. The room I had just left had been taken by the Vicomte de Courvoisier who, having been able to leave the Red Cross at X\u2014\u2014 for two days, had come to amuse himself for an hour in Paris before returning to the Chateau de Courvoisier where he would tell the Vicomtesse he had been unable to catch the last train. He had no notion that M. de Charlus was only a few yards away from him and the former had as little, never having encountered his cousin at Jupien\u2019s house, the latter being ignorant of the carefully disguised identity of the Vicomte. The Baron soon came in, walking with some difficulty on account of his bruises which he must, nevertheless, have got used to. Although his debauch was finished and he was only going in to give Maurice the money he owed him, he directed a circular glance upon the young men gathered there which was at once tender and inquisitive and evidently expected to have the pleasure of a quite platonic but amorously prolonged chat with each of them. I noticed in all the lively frivolity he displayed towards the harem by which he seemed almost intimidated, those twistings of the body and tossings of the head, those sensitive glances I had noticed on the evening of his first arrival at La Raspeli\u00e8re, graces inherited from one of his grandmothers whom I had not known and which, masked in ordinary life by more virile expressions, were coquettishly displayed when he wanted to please an inferior audience by appearing a grande dame. Jupien had recommended them to the goodwill of the Baron by telling him they were hooligans of Belleville and that they would go to bed with their own sisters for a louis. In actual fact, Jupien was both lying and telling the truth. Better and more sensitive than he told the Baron they were, they did not belong to a class of miscreants. But those who believed them so talked to them with entire good faith as if these terrible fellows were doing the same. However, much a sadist may believe he is with an assassin, his own pure sadist soul is not on that account changed and he is hypnotised by the lies of these fellows who aren\u2019t in the least assassins but who, wanting to turn an easy penny, wordily bring their father, their mother or their sister to life and kill them again, turn and turn about, because they get interrupted in their conversation with the customer they are trying to please. The customer is bewildered in his simplicity and, in his absurd conception of the guilty gigolo revelling in mass-murders, is astounded at the culprit\u2019s lies and contradictions. All of them seemed to know M. de Charlus who stayed some time talking to each of them in what he thought was his vernacular, from pretentious affectation of local colour and also from the sadistic pleasure of mixing himself up in a crapulous life. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said, \u201cI saw you in front of Olympia with two street-women, just to get some coppers out of them. That\u2019s a nice way of deceiving me.\u201d Happily for the young man who was thus addressed, he had no time to declare that he had never accepted coppers from a woman which would have diminished the excitement of M. de Charlus and he reserved his protest for the end of the latter\u2019s sentence, replying, \u201cOh, no! I do not deceive you.\u201d These words caused M. de Charlus a lively pleasure and as, in his own despite, his natural intelligence prevailed over his affectation, he turned to Jupien: \u201cIt\u2019s nice of him to say that and he says it so charmingly, one would think it was true. And, after all, what does it matter whether it\u2019s true or not if he makes one believe it. What sweet little eyes he\u2019s got. Come here, boy, I\u2019m going to give you two big kisses for your trouble. You\u2019ll think of me in the trenches, won\u2019t you? Is it very hard?\u201d \u201cOh, my God. There are days when a shell passes close to you!\u201d and the young man began imitating the noise of a shell, of aeroplanes and so on. \u201cBut one must do like the rest and. you can be sure we shall go on to the end.\u201d \u201cTill the end,\u201d replied the pessimistic Baron in a melancholy tone. \u201cHaven\u2019t you read in the papers that Sarah Bernhardt said France would go on till the end. The French will let themselves be killed to the last man.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t doubt for a single instant that the French will bravely be killed to the last man,\u201d M. de Charlus answered as though it were the most natural thing in the world, in spite of his having no intention of doing anything whatever, but with the intention of correcting any impression of pacifism he might give in moments of forgetfulness, \u201cI don\u2019t doubt it, but I am asking myself to what extent Mme Sarah Bernhardt is qualified to speak in the name of France \u2014 Ah, I seem to know this charming young man,\u201d pointing at another whom he had probably never seen. He saluted him as he would have saluted a prince at Versailles and, so as to profit by the opportunity and have a supplementary pleasure gratis, like when I was small and went with my mother to give an order to Boissier or Gouache and one of the ladies offered me a bonbon from one of the glass vases in the midst of which she presided, he took the hand of the charming young man and pressed it for a long time in his Prussian fashion, fixing his eyes upon him and smiling for the interminable time photographers used to take in posing us when the light was bad. \u201cMonsieur, I am charmed, I am enchanted to make your acquaintance. He has such lovely hair,\u201d he said, turning to Jupien. Then he moved over to Maurice to give him his fifty francs and put his arm round his waist. \u201cYou never told me you had lined an old Belleville bitch,\u201d M. de Charlus guffawed with ecstasy, sticking his face close to that of Maurice. \u201cOh, monsieur le Baron,\u201d protested the gigolo whom they had forgotten to warn, \u201chow can you believe such a thing?\u201d Whether it was false or whether the alleged culprit really thought it was an abominable thing he had to deny, the boy went on: \u201cTo touch my own kind, even a German as it is war is one thing, but a woman and an old woman at that!\u201d This declaration of virtuous principles had the effect of a cold water douche upon the Baron, who moved coldly away from Maurice, none the less giving him his money, but with the air of one who is \u201cput off\u201d, someone who has been \u201cdone\u201d but who doesn\u2019t want to make a fuss, one who pays but is dissatisfied\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The bad impression produced upon the Baron was, moreover, increased by the way in which the beneficiary thanked him: \u201cI am going to send this to my old people and I shall keep a little for my pal at the front.\u201d These touching sentiments disappointed M. de Charlus almost as much as did his rather conventional peasant-like expression. Jupien sometimes warned them that they had to be \u201cmore vicious\u201d. Then one of them with the air of confessing something satanic would adventure: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something, Baron, but you won\u2019t believe me. When I was a boy I looked through the key-hole and saw my parents embracing each other. Isn\u2019t that vicious? You seem to believe that I\u2019m drawing the long bow but I swear I\u2019m not. It\u2019s the exact truth.\u201d This fictitious attempt at perversity which only revealed stupidity and innocence, exasperated M. de Charlus. The most determined burglar, robber or assassin would not have satisfied him for they do not talk about their crimes, and, moreoever, there is in the sadist \u2014 good as he may be, indeed the better he is \u2014 a thirst for evil that malefactors cannot satisfy. The handsome young man, realising his mistake, might say, \u201che\u2019d let him have it hot and heavy,\u201d and push audacity to the point of telling the Baron to \u201cbloody well make a date\u201d with him, the charm was dissipated. The humbug was as transparent as in books whose authors insist on writing slang. In vain the young man gave him details of all his obscenities with his women, M. de Charlus was only struck by how little they amounted to. For that matter that was not only the result of insincerity, for nothing is more limited than vice. In that sense one can really use a common expression and say that one is always turning in the same vicious circle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow simple he is, one would never say he was a Prince,\u201d the habitu\u00e9s commented when M. de Charlus had gone escorted downstairs by Jupien to whom the Baron did not cease complaining about the decency of the young man. From the dissatisfied manner of Jupien, he had been trying to train the young man in advance and one felt that the false assassin would presently get a good dressing down. \u201cHe\u2019s quite contrary to what you told me,\u201d added the Baron so that Jupien should profit by the lesson for another time. \u201cHe seems to have a nice nature, he expresses sentiments of respect for his family.\u201d \u201cAll the same, he doesn\u2019t get on with his father at all,\u201d objected Jupien, \u201cthey live together but each goes to a different bar.\u201d Obviously that was rather a feeble crime in comparison with assassination but Jupien found himself taken aback. The Baron said nothing more because, though he wanted his pleasures prepared for him, he also needed the illusion that they were not prepared. \u201cHe\u2019s an out-and-out ruffian, he told you all that to take you in, you\u2019re too simple,\u201d Jupien added, to exculpate himself but in so doing only wounded the pride of M. de Charlus the more. While talking of M. de Charlus being a prince the young men in the establishment were deploring the death of someone about whom the gigolos said, \u201cI don\u2019t know his name but it appears he is a baron,\u201d and who was no other than the Prince de Foux (the father of Saint-Loup\u2019s friend). While the Prince\u2019s wife believed he was spending most of his time at the Club, in reality he was spending hours with Jupien chattering and telling stories about society in the presence of blackguards. He was a fine, handsome man like his son. It is extraordinary that M. de Charlus did not know that he shared his tastes; doubtless this was because the, Baron had only seen him in society. People went so far as to say that he had actually gone to the length of practising these tastes upon his son when he was still at College, which was probably false. On the other hand, very well-informed about habits many are ignorant of, he kept a careful watch upon the people his son frequented. One day a man of low extraction followed the young Prince de Foux as far as his father\u2019s mansion and threw a missive through a window which the father had picked up. But though this follower was not, aristocratically speaking, of the same society as M. de Foux, he was from another point of view, and he had no difficulty in finding among their common associates an intermediary who made M. de Foux hold his tongue by proving that it was the young man who had provoked the advance from a man much older than himself. And that was quite credible, the Prince de Foux having succeeded in protecting his son from bad company outside, but not from his heredity. It may be added that young Prince de Foux, like his father, unsuspected in this respect by people in society, went to extreme lengths with another class\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe\u2019s said to have a million a year to spend,\u201d said the young man of twenty-two to whom this statement did not seem incredible. Soon the sound of M. de Charlus\u2019 carriage was heard. At that moment I perceived someone accompanied by a soldier leaving a neighbouring room with a slow step, a person who looked to me like an old lady in a black dress. I soon saw my mistake, it was a priest; that rare and in France extremely exceptional thing, a bad priest. Apparently the soldier was chaffing his companion about the incompatability of his conduct with his cloth for the priest, holding his finger in front of his hideous face with the grave gesture of a doctor of theology, answered sententiously: \u201cWell, what do you expect of me, I am not\u201d (I was expecting him to say a saint) \u201can angel.\u201d There was nothing for him to do but go and he took leave of Jupien, who, having returned from escorting the Baron, was going upstairs, but, owing to his bewilderment, the bad priest had forgotten to pay for his room. Jupien, whose presence of mind never abandoned him, rattling the box in which the customers\u2019 contributions were put remarked: \u201cFor the expenses of the service, Monsieur l\u2019Abb\u00e9.\u201d The repulsive personage apologised, handed over his money and departed. Jupien came and fetched me from the obscure cavern whence I had not dared move. \u201cGo into the vestibule for a moment where the young men are sitting \u2014 it\u2019s quite all right as you\u2019re a lodger \u2014 while I go and shut up your room.\u201d The patron was there and I paid him. At that moment, a young man in a dinner-jacket entered and with an air of authority demanded of the patron: \u201cCan I have L\u00e9on to-morrow morning at a quarter to eleven instead of eleven because I\u2019m lunching out?\u201d \u201cThat depends on how long the Abb\u00e9 keeps him,\u201d the patron answered. This appeared to dissatisfy the young man in the dinner-jacket who seemed about to curse the Abb\u00e9 but his anger took another form when he perceived me. Going straight up to the patron, he asked in an angry voice: \u201cWho\u2019s that? What does this mean?\u201d The patron, much embarrassed, explained that my presence was of no importance, I was merely a lodger. The young man in the dinner-jacket was by no means appeased by this explanation and kept on repeating: \u201cThis is extremely unpleasant; it\u2019s the sort of thing that ought not to happen. You know I hate it and I shan\u2019t put my foot inside this place again.\u201d The execution of the threat did not seem, however, to be imminent for though he went away in a rage, he again expressed the wish that L\u00e9on should be free at a quarter to eleven if not at half-past ten. Jupien returned and took me downstairs. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to have a bad opinion of me,\u201d he said, \u201cthis house doesn\u2019t bring in as much money as you might think. I\u2019m obliged to have respectable lodgers, though, if I depended only on them, I should lose money. Here to the contrary of the Mount Carmels, it is thanks to vice that virtue can exist. If I\u2019ve taken this house, or rather, if I have had it taken by the patron whom you\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s only to render service to the Baron and to distract his old age.\u201d Jupien did not want to talk only about sadistic performances like those I had seen or about the Baron\u2019s vices. The latter even for conversation, for company or to play cards with, now only liked common people who exploited him. Doubtless, snobbishness about low company is just as comprehensible as the opposite. In the case of M. de Charlus, the two kinds had long been interchangeable; no one in society was smart enough to associate with and in the underworld, no one was base enough. \u201cI hate anything middling,\u201d he said, \u201cthe bourgeois comedy is irksome. Give me either princesses of classical tragedy or broad farce, no half-and-half, Ph\u00e8dre or Les Saltimbanques. But, talk as he might, the equilibrium between these two forms of snobbery had been upset. Whether owing to an old man\u2019s fatigue or the extension of sensuality to the most banal intercourse, the Baron only lived now with inferiors. Thus unconsciously he was accepting succession from such of his great ancestors as the Duc de La Rochefoucauld, the Prince d\u2019Harcourt, the Duc de Berry whom Saint-Simon exhibits as spending their lives with their lackeys who got enormous sums out of them, to such a point that when people went to see these great gentlemen they were shocked to find them familiarly playing cards and drinking with their servants. \u201cIt\u2019s chiefly,\u201d added Jupien, \u201cto save him being bored, because, you see, the Baron is a great baby. Even now, when he has got everything here he wants, he must run after adventures and play the villain. And, generous though he is, some time or other this behaviour may lead to trouble. Only the other day the chasseur of a hotel nearly died of fright because of the money the Baron offered him. Fancy! To come to his house, what imprudence! This lad, who only liked women, was very relieved when he understood what the Baron wanted. The Baron\u2019s promises of money made the lad believe he was a spy and he was consoled when he knew that he was not being asked to betray his country but only to surrender his body which is perhaps not any more moral but less dangerous and certainly easier.\u201d Listening to Jupien I said to myself: \u201cWhat a pity M. de Charlus is not a novelist or a poet, not in order to describe what he sees, but the stage reached by M. de Charlus in relation to desire causes scandals to arise round him, forces him to take life seriously, to emotionalise pleasure, prevents him from becoming static through taking a purely ironical and exterior view of things, reopens in him a constant source of pain. Almost every time he makes overtures, he risks outrage if not prison. Not the education of children but that of poets is accomplished by blows. Had M. de Charlus been a novelist, the protection the house controlled by Jupien afforded him (though a police raid was always on the cards) by reducing the risks he ran from casual street encounters, would have been a misfortune for him. But M. de Charlus was only a dilettante in Art who did not dream of writing and had no gift for it. \u201cMoreover, I\u2019ll admit to you,\u201d continued Jupien, \u201cthat I haven\u2019t much scruple about making money out of this sort of job. I can\u2019t disguise from you that I like it, that it\u2019s to my taste. And is it a crime to get a salary for things one doesn\u2019t consider wrong? You are better educated than I am and doubtless you will tell me that Socrates did not consider he was justified in receiving money for his lessons. But in our day professors of philosophy are not like that nor are doctors nor painters nor playwrights nor theatrical managers. Don\u2019t imagine that this business forces one to associate only with low people. It is true that the manager of an establishment of this kind, like a great courtesan, only receives men but he receives men who are important in all sorts of ways and who are generally on equal terms with the most refined, the most sensitive and the most amiable of their kind. This house might easily be transformed, I assure you, into an intellectual bureau and a news agency.\u201d But I was still occupied with thinking of the blows I had seen M. de Charlus receive. And, to tell the truth when one knew M. de Charlus, his pride, his satiation with social amusements, his caprices which changed so readily into passion for men of the worst class and of the lowest kind, one could easily understand that he was glad to possess the large fortune which, when enjoyed by a parvenu, enables him to marry his daughter to a duke and to invite Highnesses to his shooting parties, and permitted him to exercise authority in one, perhaps in several, establishments where there were permanently young men with whom he took his pleasure. Perhaps, indeed, he did not need to be vicious for that. He was the successor of so many great gentlemen and princes of the blood or dukes who, Saint-Simon tells us, never associated with anyone fit to speak to. \u201cMeanwhile,\u201d I said to Jupien: \u201cthis house is something very different, it is rather a pandemonium than a mad house, since the madness of the lunatics who are there is placed upon the stage and visually reconstituted. I believed, like the Caliph in the Thousand and One Nights, that I had, at the critical moment, come to the rescue of a man who was being ill-treated and another story of the Thousand and One Nights was realised before my eyes, in which a woman is changed into a dog and allows herself to be beaten in order to regain her former shape.\u201d Jupien, realising that I had seen the Baron being whipped, was much concerned. He remained silent a moment, then, suddenly, with that pretty wit of his own that had so often struck me when he greeted Fran\u00e7oise or myself in the court-yard of our house with such graceful phrases: \u201cYou talk of stories in the Thousand and One Nights\u201c he said. \u201cI know one which is not without relevance to the title of a book which I caught sight of at the Baron\u2019s house\u201d (he was alluding to a translation of Ruskin\u2019s Sesame and Lilies which I had sent to M. de Charlus). \u201cIf you ever wanted one evening to see, I won\u2019t say forty but ten thieves, you have only to come here; to be sure I\u2019m there, you have only to look up and if my little window is left open and the light is on, it will mean that I am there and that you can come in; that is my Sesame. I only refer to Sesame; as to the Lilies, if you\u2019re seeking for them I advise you to look elsewhere,\u201d and saluting me somewhat cavalierly, for an aristocratic connection and a band of young men whom he controlled like a pirate-chief had given him a certain familiarity, he took leave of me. He had hardly left me when blasts of a siren were immediately followed by violent barrage firing. It was evident that a German aviator was hovering close over our heads and suddenly a violent explosion proved that he had hurled one of his bombs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many who had not wanted to run away had collected in the same room at Jupien\u2019s. Though they did not know each other they belonged more or less to the same wealthy and aristocratic society. The aspect of each inspired a repugnance due, doubtless, to their indulging in degrading vices. The face of one of them, an enormous fellow, was covered with red blotches like a drunkard\u2019s. I afterward learnt that, at first, he was not one but enjoyed making youths drink and that, later on, in fear of being mobilised, (though he seemed to be over fifty) as he was very fat, he started to drink without stopping until he exceeded the weight of a hundred kilos, beyond which men were exempted. And now the trick had turned into a passion, and however much people tried to prevent him, he always went back to the liquor-merchant. But the moment he spoke one could see, in spite of his mediocre intelligence, that he was a man of considerable education and culture. Another young society man of remarkably distinguished appearance, came in. In his case, there were as yet no exterior stigmata of vice but, what was worse, there were internal ones. Tall, with an attractive face, his manner of speech indicated a different order of intelligence to that of his alcoholic neighbour, indeed, without exaggeration, a very remarkable one. But whatever he said was accompanied by a facial expression suited to a different remark. Though he owned a complete storehouse of human expressions, he might have lived in another world, for he used them in the wrong order and seemed to scatter smiles and glances haphazard without relation to the remarks he was making or hearing. I hope for his sake if, as seems likely, he is still alive, that he was not the victim of an organic disease but of a passing disorder. Probably, if those men had been ordered to produce their visiting cards one would have been surprised to observe that they all belonged to the upper class of society. But every sort of vice and the greatest vice of all, lack of will which prevents a man from resisting it, brought them together there, in separate rooms, it is true, but every evening, I was told, so that if ladies in society still knew their names, they were gradually forgetting their faces. They still received invitations but habit always brought them back to that composite resort of evil repute. They concealed it but little from themselves, being in this respect different from the little chasseurs, workmen, et cetera, who ministered to their pleasure. And besides many obvious reasons this can be explained by the following one. For a commercial employee or a servant to go there was like a respectable woman going to a place of assignation. Some of them who had been there refused ever again to do so and Jupien himself telling lies to save their reputation or to prevent competition, declared: \u201cOh, no, he doesn\u2019t come to my place and he wouldn\u2019t want to.\u201d For men in society it is of less importance, in that other people in society do not go to such places and neither know anything about them nor concern themselves with other people\u2019s business\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the beginning of the alarm I had left Jupien\u2019s house. The streets had become entirely dark. Only now and then an enemy aeroplane which was flying low enough cast a light on the spot where he was going to throw a bomb. I could no longer find my way and thought of that day when going to La Raspeli\u00e8re I had met an aviator like a god reining back his horse. I was thinking that this time the encounter would have a different end, that the God of Evil would kill me. I hurried my steps to escape like a traveller pursued by a water-spout, yet I turned in a circle round dark places from which I could not escape. At last the flames of a fire lighted me and I was able to rediscover my road whilst the cannon boomed unceasingly. But my thought turned elsewhere. I thought of Jupien\u2019s house now reduced perhaps to cinders for a bomb had fallen quite close to me just as I was coming out of that house upon which M. de Charlus might prophetically have written \u201cSodom\u201d as an unknown inhabitant of Pompeii had done with no less prescience when, possibly, as a prelude to the catastrophe, the volcanic eruption began. But what did sirens or Gothas matter to those who had come there bent on gratifying their lusts? We never think of the framework of nature which surrounds our passion. The tempest rages on the sea, the ship heaves and pitches on every side, avalanches fall from the windswept sky and, at most, we allow ourselves to pause a moment, to ward off an inconvenience caused us by that immense scene, in which both we and the human body we desire, are the tiniest atoms. The premonitory siren of the bombs troubled the inhabitants of Jupien\u2019s house as little as would an iceberg. More than that, the menace of a physical danger freed them from the fear by which they had been so long unhealthily obsessed. It is false to believe that the scale of fears corresponds to that of the dangers which inspire them. One might be frightened of sleeplessness and yet not of a duel, of a rat and not of a lion. For some hours the police would be concerned only for the lives of the population, a matter of small consequence, for it did not threaten to dishonour them\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some of the habitu\u00e9s, recovering their moral liberty were the more tempted by the sudden darkness in the streets. Some of these Pompeians upon whom the fire of Heaven was already pouring, descended into the M\u00e9tro passages which were as dark as catacombs. They knew, of course, that they would not be alone there. And the darkness which bathes everything as in a new element had the effect, an irresistibly tempting one for certain people, of eliminating the first phase of lust and enabling them to enter, without further ado the domain of caresses which as a rule, demands preliminaries. Whether the libidinous aim is directed towards a woman or a man, assuming that approach is easy and that the sentimentalities that go on eternally in a drawing-room in the day time can be dispensed with, even in the evening however ill-lit the street, there must, at least, be a preamble when only the eyes can devour the corn within the ear, when the fear of passers-by or even of the one pursued prevents the follower getting further than vision and speech. But in darkness the whole bag of tricks goes by the board, hands, lips, bodies, come into immediate play. Then there is the excuse of the darkness itself and of the mistakes it engenders if a bad reception is met with, but if on the contrary, there is the immediate response of a body which, instead of withdrawing, comes closer, the inference that the woman or the man approached is equally licentious and vicious, adds the additional thrill of being able to bite into the fruit without lusting after it with the eyes and without asking permission. And still the darkness continued. Plunged in this new element Jupien\u2019s habitu\u00e9s imagined themselves travellers witnessing a phenomenon of nature such as a tidal-wave or an eclipse and instead of indulgence in a pre-arranged debauch, were seeking fortuitous adventures in the unknown, and celebrating, to the accompaniment of the volcanic thunder of bombs \u2014 as though in a Pompeian brothel \u2014 secret rites in the tenebrous shadows of the catacombs. To such events the Pompeian paintings at Jupien\u2019s were appropriate for they recalled the end of the French Revolution at the somewhat similar period of the Directoire which was now beginning. Already in the anticipation of peace, new dances organised in darkness so as not too openly to infringe police regulations, were rioting in the night. And as an accompaniment certain artistic opinions, less anti-German than during the first years of the war, enabled stifled minds to expand though a brevet of civic virtue was needed by him who ventured to express them. A professor wrote a remarkable book on Schiller of which the papers took notice. But before mentioning the author, the publishers inscribed the volume with a statement like a printing licence, to the effect that he had been at the Marne and at Verdun, that he had had five mentions, and two sons killed. Upon that, there was loud praise of the lucidity and depth of the author\u2019s work upon Schiller, who could be qualified as great as long as he was alluded to as a great Boche and not as a great German, and thus the articles were passed by the Censor. As I approached my home I was meditating on how quickly the consciousness ceases to collaborate with our habits, leaving them to develop on their own account without further concerning itself with them and how astonished we are, when we base our judgment of an individual merely on externals as though they comprehended the whole of him, at the actions of a man whose moral or intellectual value may develop independently in a completely different direction. Obviously it was a fault of upbringing or the entire lack of upbringing combined with a preference for earning money in the easiest way (many different kinds of work might be easier as it happens, but does not a sick man fabricate a far more painful existence out of manifold privations and remedies than the often comparatively mild illness against which he thinks he is thus defending himself?) or at all events, in the least laborious way, which had caused these youths, so to speak, in complete innocence and for small pay to do things which gave them no pleasure and must at first have inspired them with the strongest repugnance. Accordingly one might consider them fundamentally rotten but they were not only wonderful soldiers in the war, brave to a degree, but often good-hearted fellows if not decent people in civil life. They no longer realised what was moral or immoral in the life they led because it was that of their surroundings. Thus, in studying certain periods of ancient history we are sometimes amazed to observe that people who were individually good, participated without scruple in mass assassinations and human sacrifices, which probably seemed to them perfectly natural things. For him who reads the history of our period two thousand years hence, it will in the same way seem to have allowed gentle and pure consciences to be plunged in a vital environment to which they adapted themselves though it will then appear just as monstrously pernicious. And what is more, I knew no man more gifted with intelligence and sensibility than Jupien for those charming acquisitions which constituted the intellectual fabric of his discourse, did not come to him from school instruction or from university culture which might have made him remarkable, while so many young men in society got no profit from them whatever. It was his spontaneous, innate sense, his natural taste which enabled him from occasional haphazard and unguided readings in his spare moments to compose his way of speaking so rightly that all the symmetries of language were set off and showed their beauty in it. Yet the business in which he was engaged could with good reason be considered, if one of the most lucrative, one of the lowest imaginable. As to M. de Charlus, disdain as he might \u201cwhat people say\u201d, how was it that a feeling of personal dignity and self-respect had not forced him to resist sensual indulgences for which the only excuse was complete insanity? It could only be that in his case, as in that of Jupien, the habit of isolating morality from a whole order of actions (which, for that matter, must occur in a function such as that of a judge, sometimes in that of a statesman and others) had been acquired so long ago that, no longer demanding his judgment or moral sentiment, it had become aggravated from day to day until it had reached a point where this consenting Prometheus had allowed himself to be nailed by force to the rock of pure matter. Certainly I realised that therein a new phase declared itself in the disease of M. de Charlus which, ever since I first perceived and judged it as stage by stage it revealed itself to my eyes, had continued to evolve with ever-increasing speed. The poor Baron could not now be far distant from the final term, from death, if indeed that was not preceded, according to the predictions and hopes of Mme Verdurin, by a poisoning which at his age could only hasten his death. Nevertheless, perhaps I used an inaccurate expression in saying rock of pure matter. It is possible that a little mind still survived in that pure matter. This madman knew, in spite of everything, that he was mad, that he was the prey at such moments of insanity .since he knew perfectly well that the man who was beating him was no wickeder than the little boys in battle-games who draw lots to decide which of them is to play the Prussian and upon whom all the others fall in true patriotic ardour and pretended hatred. A prey to insanity into which, nevertheless, some of M. de Charlus\u2019 personality entered; for even in its aberrations, human nature (as in our loves and in our journeys) still betrays the need of faith through the exactions of truth. When I told Fran\u00e7oise about a church in Milan \u2014 a city she would probably never see \u2014 or about the Cathedral of Rheims \u2014 even about that of Arras! \u2014 which she would never be able to see since they had been more or less destroyed, she envied the rich people who were able to afford the sight of such treasures and cried with nostalgic regret: \u201cAh, how wonderful it must be!\u201d Yet she, who had lived in Paris so many years, had never had the curiosity to go and see Notre Dame! It was just because Notre Dame belonged to Paris, to the city where her daily life was spent and where in consequence it was difficult for our old servant (as it would have been for me if the study of architecture had not modified in certain respects Combray instincts) to situate the objects of her dreams. There is imminent in those we love a certain dream which we cannot always discern but which we pursue. It was my belief in Bergotte and in Swann which made me love Gilberte, my belief in Gilbert the Bad which had made me fall in love with Mme de Guermantes. And what a great sweep of ocean had been included in my love, the saddest, the most jealous the most personal ever, for Albertine. In that love of one creature towards whom one\u2019s whole being is urged, there is already something of aberration. Arid are not the very diseases of the body, at least those closely associated with the nervous system, in some measure peculiar tastes or peculiar fears contracted by our organs, by our articulation, which thus discover for themselves a horror of certain climates as inexplicable and as obstinate as the fancy certain men display for a woman who wears an eyeglass, or for circus-riders? Who shall ever say with what lasting and curious dream that desire aroused time after time at the sight of a circus rider, is associated; as unconscious and as mysterious as is, for example, the influence of a certain town, in appearance similar to others but in which a lifelong sufferer from asthma is able, for the first time, to breathe freely\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aberrations are like passions which a morbid strain has overlaid, yet, in the craziest of them love can still be recognised. M. de Charlus\u2019 insistence that the chains which bound his feet and hands should be of attested strength, his demand to be tried at the bar of justice and, from what Jupien told me, for ferocious accessories there was great difficulty in obtaining even from sailors (the punishment they used to inflict having been abolished even where the discipline is strictest, on ship-board), at the base of all this there was M. de Charlus\u2019 constant dream of virility proved, if need be, by brutal acts and all the illumination the reflections of which within himself though to us invisible, he projected on judicial and feudal tortures which embellished an imagination coloured by the Middle Ages. This sentiment was in his mind each time he said to Jupien: \u201cThere won\u2019t be any alarm this evening anyhow, for I can already see myself reduced to ashes by the fire of Heaven like an inhabitant of Sodom,\u201d and he affected to be frightened of the Gothas not because he really had the smallest fear of them but to have a pretext the moment the sirens sounded of dashing into the shelter of the M\u00e9tropolitain, where he hoped to get a thrill from midnight frictions associated in his mind with vague dreams of prostrations and subterranean dungeons in the Middle Ages. Finally his desire to be chained and beaten revealed, with all its ugliness, a dream as poetic as the desire of others to go to Venice or to keep dancing girls. And M. de Charlus held so much to the illusion of reality which this dream gave him that Jupien was compelled to sell the wooden bed which was in room No. 43, and replace it by one of iron which went better with the chains\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At last the maroon sounded as I arrived home. The noise of approaching firemen was announced by a small boy and I met Fran\u00e7oise coming up from the cellar with the butler. She had thought me dead. She told me that Saint-Loup had excused himself for coming in to see if he had not let his croix de guerre fall when calling that morning. He had only just noticed he had lost it and having to rejoin his regiment the next day had wanted at all costs to see if it was not at my house. He and Fran\u00e7oise had searched everywhere without success. Fran\u00e7oise believed he must have lost it before coming to see me, for, she said, she could almost have sworn he did not have it on when she saw him; in this she was mistaken, which shows the value of witnesses and of recollections. I felt immediately by the unenthusiastic way they spoke of him that Saint-Loup had not produced a good impression on Fran\u00e7oise and the butler. Saint-Loup\u2019s efforts to court danger were the exact opposite of those made by the butler\u2019s son and Fran\u00e7oise\u2019s nephew to get themselves exempted, but judging from their own standpoint, Fran\u00e7oise and the butler could not believe that. They were convinced that rich people are always protected. For that matter had they even known the truth about Robert\u2019s heroic bravery, they would not have been moved by it. He never talked of \u201cBoches\u201d, he praised the bravery of the Germans, he had not attributed our failure to secure victory from the first day, to treason. That was what they wanted to hear and that was what they would have considered a mark of courage. So, while they continued searching for the croix de guerre, I, who had not much doubt as to where that cross had been lost, found them cold on the subject of Robert. Though Saint-Loup had been amusing himself in equivocal fashion that evening, it was only while awaiting news of Morel; he had been seized with longing to see him again, and had made use of all his connections to discover the corps Morel was in, supposing him to have joined up, but, so far, he had received only contradictory answers. I advised Fran\u00e7oise and the butler to go to bed but the latter was never in any hurry to leave Fran\u00e7oise since, thanks to the war, he had found a still more efficacious way of tormenting her than telling her about the expulsion of the nuns and the Dreyfus affair. That evening and whenever I was near them during the time I spent in Paris, I heard the butler say to poor, frightened Fran\u00e7oise: \u201cThey\u2019re not in a hurry, of course; they\u2019re waiting for the ripe pear, the day that they take Paris they\u2019ll have no mercy.\u201d \u201cMy God! Blessed Virgin Mary!\u201d cried Fran\u00e7oise, \u201cisn\u2019t it enough for them to have conquered poor Belgium. She suffered enough at the time of her \u2018invahition\u2019.\u201d \u201cBelgium, Fran\u00e7oise. Why! What they did to Belgium is nothing to what they\u2019ll do here.\u201d The war having thrown upon the people\u2019s conversation-market a number of new expressions which they only knew visually through reading the papers without being able to pronounce them, the butler added, \u201cYou\u2019ll see, Fran\u00e7oise they are preparing a new attack of a greater enverjure than ever before.\u201d In protest, if not out of pity for Fran\u00e7oise or from strategic common-sense, at least for grammar\u2019s sake, I told them that the right way to pronounce the word was envergure, but I only succeeded in making Fran\u00e7oise repeat the terrible word every time I entered the kitchen. The butler, much as he enjoyed frightening his fellow-servant, was equally pleased to show his master, though he was only a former gardener of Combray and now a butler, that he was a good Frenchman of the order of St. Andr\u00e9 d\u00e8s-Champs and possessed the privilege, since the declaration of the rights of man, to pronounce enverjure, with complete independence and not to accept orders on a matter which had nothing to do with his service and, in regard to which, in consequence of the Revolution, no one had any right to correct him, since he was my equal. I had, therefore, the irritation of hearing Fran\u00e7oise talk about an operation of great enverjure with an insistence which was intended to prove to me that that pronunciation was, in fact, not that of ignorance but of maturely-considered determination. The butler indiscriminately applied a suspicious \u201cthey\u201d to the Government and the papers: \u201cThey talk of the losses of the Boches, they don\u2019t talk of ours which, it appears, are ten times greater. They tell us that they\u2019re at the last gasp, that they\u2019ve got nothing to eat. I believe they\u2019ve got a hundred times more to eat than we have. It\u2019s all very well but they\u2019ve no right to humbug us like that. If they had nothing to eat they wouldn\u2019t be able to fight like the other day when they killed a hundred thousand youngsters less than twenty years old.\u201d He thus continually exaggerated the triumphs of the Germans as he did formerly those of the Radicals, and told tales of their atrocities so as to make the victories of the enemy still more painful to Fran\u00e7oise who kept on exclaiming: \u201cSainted Mother of Angels! Sainted Mother of God!\u201d Sometimes he tried being unpleasant to her in another way by saying: \u201cFor that matter, we\u2019re no better than they are. What we\u2019re doing in Greece is no nicer than what they did in Belgium. You\u2019ll see, we shall have the whole world against us and we shall have to fight the lot,\u201d while, actually, the exact contrary was the truth. On days when news was good he revenged himself on Fran\u00e7oise by assuring her the war would last thirty-five years and that if, by chance, a possible peace came, it would not last more than a few months and would be succeeded by battles in comparison with which those of to-day were child\u2019s play and that after them nothing would be left of France. The victory of the Allies if not close at hand, seemed at any rate assured, and unfortunately it must be admitted that this displeased the butler. For, having identified the world-war and the rest of it with his campaign against Fran\u00e7oise (whom he liked, all the same, just as one likes a person whom one daily enrages by defeating him at dominoes) victory was represented to him in terms of the first conversation he would have with her thereafter when he would be irritated by hearing her say: \u201cWell, it\u2019s finished at last, and they\u2019ll have to give us a great deal more than we gave them in \u201871.\u201d Really, he always believed this must happen in the end for an unconscious patriotism made him think, like all Frenchmen, who were victims of an illusion similar to my own ever since I had been ill, that victory like my recovery was coming to-morrow. He took the upper hand of Fran\u00e7oise by announcing that though victory might come about, her heart would bleed from it, because a revolution would swiftly follow and then invasion. \u201cAh! That bloody old war, the Boches will be the ones to recover quick from it! Why, Fran\u00e7oise! They\u2019ve already made hundreds of millions out of it. But don\u2019t you imagine they\u2019re going to give us a penny of it. They may put that in the papers,\u201d he added for prudence sake and to be on the safe side, \u201cto keep people quiet just as they\u2019ve been saying for three years that the war would be finished the next day. I can\u2019t understand how people can be such fools as to believe it.\u201d Fran\u00e7oise was the more worried by his comments because, as a matter of fact, she had believed the optimists in preference to the butler and had seen that the war, which was to end in a fortnight in spite of the \u201cinvahition of poor Belgium,\u201d lasted for ever, that there was no advance, a phenomenon of fixation of the fronts the sense of which she could not understand, and that one of her innumerable godsons to whom she gave everything she received from us, had told her that this, that and the other things were concealed from the public. \u201cAll that will fall upon the working-class,\u201d the butler remarked in conclusion, \u201cand they\u2019ll take your field from you, Fran\u00e7oise.\u201d \u201cOh, my God!\u201d But he preferred miseries that were close at hand and devoured the papers, hoping to announce a defeat to Fran\u00e7oise, and awaited news like Easter eggs, which should be bad enough to terrify Fran\u00e7oise without his suffering material disadvantages therefrom. Thus a Zeppelin-raid enchanted him because he could watch Fran\u00e7oise hiding in the cellar while he felt convinced that in so large a city as Paris, bombs would not just fall upon our house. Then Fran\u00e7oise began to get back her Combray pacifism. She even began doubting the \u201cGerman atrocities\u201d. \u201cAt the beginning of the war they told us the Germans were assassins, brigands, regular bandits \u2014 bbboches.\u201d (If she put several b\u2019s to Boches it was because it seemed plausible enough to accuse the Germans of being assassins but to call them Boches seemed almost impossible in its enormity). Still, it was rather difficult to grasp what mysteriously horrible sense Fran\u00e7oise gave to the word Boche since she was talking about the beginning of the war and uttered the word so doubtfully. For the doubt that the Germans were criminals might be ill-founded in fact but did not in itself contain a contradiction from a logical point of view but how could anyone doubt that they were Boches since that word in the popular tongue means German and nothing else. Perhaps she was merely repeating violent comments she had heard at the time when a particular emphasis was given to the word Boche. \u201cI used to believe all that,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I\u2019m now wondering if we aren\u2019t really just as big rogues as they are.\u201d This blasphemous thought had been cunningly fostered in Fran\u00e7oise by the butler who, observing that his fellow-servant had a certain weakness for King Constantine of Greece, continually represented that we did not allow him to have any food until he surrendered. The abdication of the sovereign had further moved Fran\u00e7oise to declare: \u201cWe\u2019re no better than they are. If we were in Germany we should do the same.\u201d I did not see much of her at that time as she often went to stay with cousins of hers about whom my mother one day said to me: \u201cYou know, they\u2019re richer than you are.\u201d In that connection a very beautiful thing happened, frequent enough at that period throughout the country, which, had there been historians to perpetuate its memory, would have borne witness to the grandeur of France, to the grandeur of her soul, that grandeur of St. Andr\u00e9-des-Champs which was displayed no less by civilians at the rear than by the soldiers who fell at the Marne. A nephew of Fran\u00e7oise had been killed at Berry-au-Bac who was also a nephew of those millionaire cousins of Fran\u00e7oise, former caf\u00e9 proprietors long since retired with a fortune. This young man of twenty-five, himself the proprietor of a little caf\u00e9, without other means, was called up and left his young wife to keep the little bar alone, hoping to return in a few months. He was killed and the following happened. These millionaire cousins of Fran\u00e7oise upon whom this young woman, widow of their nephew, had no claim whatever, left their home in the country to which they had retired ten years previously and again took over the caf\u00e9 but without taking a penny. Every morning at six o\u2019clock the millionaire wife, a true gentlewoman, dressed herself as did her young lady daughter to assist their niece and cousin by marriage, and for three years they washed glasses and served meals from early morning till half-past-nine at night without a day of rest. In this book in which there is not a single event which is not fictitious, in which there is not a single personage \u201ca clef\u201c, where I have invented everything to suit the requirements of my presentation, I must, in homage to my country, mention as personages who did exist in real life, these millionaire relations of Fran\u00e7oise who left their retirement to help their bereaved niece. And, persuaded that their modesty will not be offended for the excellent reason that they will never read this book, it is with childlike pleasure and deeply moved, that, unable to give the names of so many others who acted similarly and, thanks to whom France has survived, I here transcribe their name, a very French one, Larivi\u00e8re. If there were certain contemptible embusqu\u00e9s like the imperious young man in the dinner-jacket whom I saw at Jupien\u2019s and whose sole preoccupation was to know whether he could have L\u00e9on at half-past-ten because he was lunching out, they are more than made up for by the innumerable mass of Frenchmen of St. Andr\u00e9-des-Champs, by all those superb soldiers beside whom I place the Larivi\u00e8res. The butler, to quicken the anxieties of Fran\u00e7oise showed her some old Readings for All he had discovered somewhere, on the cover of which (the copies dated from before the war) figured \u201cThe Imperial Family of Germany\u201d. \u201cHere is our master of to-morrow,\u201d said the butler to Fran\u00e7oise, showing her \u201cGuillaume\u201d. She opened her eyes wide, then pointing at the feminine personage beside him in the picture, she added, \u201cAnd there is the Guillaumesse.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My departure from Paris was retarded by news which, owing to the pain it caused me, rendered me incapable of moving for some time. I had learnt, in fact, of the death of Robert Saint-Loup, killed, protecting the retreat of his men, on the day following his return to the front. No man less than he, felt hatred towards a people (and as to the Emperor, for special reasons which may have been mistaken, he believed that William II had rather sought to prevent war than to unleash it). Nor did he hate Germanism; the last words I heard him utter six days beforej were those at the beginning of a Schumann song which he hummed to me in German on my staircase; indeed on account of neighbours I had to ask him to keep quiet. Accustomed by supreme good breeding to refrain from apologies, invective and phrase, in the face of the enemy he had avoided, as he did at the moment of mobilisation, whatever might have preserved his life by a self-effacement in action which his manners symbolised, even to his way of closing my cab-door when he saw me out, standing bare-headed every time I left his house. For several days I remained shut up in my room thinking about him. I recalled his arrival at Balbec that first time when in his white flannels and his greenish eyes moving like water he strolled through the hall adjoining the large dining-room with its windows open to the sea. I recalled the uniqueness of a being whose friendship I had then so greatly desired. That desire had been realised beyond my expectation, yet it had given me hardly a moment\u2019s pleasure, and afterwards I had realised all the qualities as well as other things which were hidden under that elegant appearance. He had bestowed all, good and bad, without stint, day by day, and on the last he stormed a trench with utter generosity, putting all he possessed at the service of others, just as one evening he had run along the sofas of the restaurant so as not to inconvenience me. That I had, after all, seen him so little in so many different places, under so many different circumstances separated by such long intervals, in the hall of Balbec, at the caf\u00e9 of Rivebelle, in the Donci\u00e8res Cavalry barracks and military dinners, at the theatre where he had boxed a journalist\u2019s ears, at the Princesse de Guermantes\u2019, resulted in my retaining more striking and sharper pictures of his life, feeling a keener sorrow at his death than one often does in the case of those one has loved more but of whom one has seen so much that the image we retain of them is but a sort of vague average of an infinite number of pictures hardly different from each other and also that our sated affection has not preserved, as in the case of those we have seen for limited moments in the course of meetings unfulfilled in spite of them and of ourselves, the illusion of greater potential affection of which circumstances alone had deprived us. A few days after the one on which I had seen Saint-Loup tripping along behind his eye-glass and had imagined him so haughty in the hall of Balbec there was another figure I had seen for the first time upon the Balbec beach and who now also existed only as a memory \u2014 Albertine \u2014 walking along the sand that first evening indifferent to everybody and as akin to the sea as a seagull. I had so soon fallen in love with her that, not to miss being with her every day I never left Balbec to go and see Saint-Loup. And yet the history of my friendship with him bore witness also to my having ceased at one time to love Albertine, since, if I had gone away to stay with Robert at Donci\u00e8res, it was out of grief that Mme de Guermantes did not return the sentiment I felt for her. His life and that of Albertine so late known to me, both at Bal-bee and both so soon ended, had hardly crossed each other; it was he, I repeated to myself, visualising that the flying shuttle of the years weaves threads between memories which seemed at first to be completely independent of each other, it was he whom I sent to Mme Bontemps when Albertine left me. And then it happened that each of their two lives contained a parallel secret I had not suspected. Saint-Loup\u2019s now caused me more sadness than Albertine\u2019s for her life had become to me that of a stranger. But I could not console myself that hers like that of Saint-Loup had been so short. She and he both often said when they were seeing to my comfort: \u201cYou are so ill,\u201d and yet it was they who were dead, they whose last presentment I can visualise, the one facing the trench, the other after her accident, separated by so short an interval from the first, that even Albertine\u2019s was worth no more to me than its association with a sunset on the sea. Fran\u00e7oise received the news of Saint-Loup\u2019s death with more pity than Albertine\u2019s. She immediately adopted her r\u00f4le of mourner and bewailed the memory of the dead with lamentations and despairing comments. She manifested her sorrow and turned her face away to dry her eyes only when I let her see my own tears which she pretended not to notice. Like many highly-strung people the agitation of others horrified her, doubtless because it was too like her own. She wanted to draw attention to the slightest stiff-neck or giddiness she had managed to get afflicted with. But if I spoke of one of my own pains she became stoical and grave and made a pretence of not hearing me. \u201cPoor marquis!\u201d she would say, although she could not help thinking he had done everything in his power not to go to the front and once there to escape danger. \u201cPoor lady!\u201d she would say, alluding to Mme de Marsantes, \u201chow she must have wept when she heard of the death of her son! If only she had been able to see him again! But perhaps it was better she was not able to because his nose was cut in two. He was completely disfigured.\u201d And the eyes of Fran\u00e7oise filled with tears through which nevertheless the cruel curiosity of the peasant peered. Without doubt Fran\u00e7oise condoled with Mme de Marsantes with all her heart but she was sorry not to witness the form her grief had taken and that she could not luxuriate in the spectacle of her affliction. And as she liked crying and liked me to see her cry, she worked herself up by saying: \u201cI feel it dreadfully.\u201d And she observed the traces of sorrow in my face with an eagerness which made me pretend to a kind of hardness when I spoke of Robert. In a spirit of imitation and because she had heard others say so, for there are clich\u00e9s in the servants\u2019 quarters just as in coteries, she repeated, not without the complaisance of the poor: \u201cAll his wealth did not prevent his dying like anyone else and it\u2019s no good to him now.\u201d The butler profited by the opportunity to remark to Fran\u00e7oise that it was certainly sad but that it scarcely counted compared with the millions of men who fell every day in spite of all the efforts of the Government to hide it. But this time the butler did not succeed in causing Fran\u00e7oise more pain as he had hoped, for she answered: \u201cIt\u2019s true they died for France too, but all of them are unknown and it\u2019s always more interesting when one has known people.\u201d And Fran\u00e7oise who revelled in her tears, added: \u201cBe sure and let me know if the death of the marquis is mentioned in the paper.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Robert had often said to me with sadness long before the war: \u201cOh, don\u2019t let us talk about my life, I am doomed in advance.\u201d Was he then alluding to the vice which he had until then succeeded in hiding from the world, the gravity of which he perhaps exaggerated as young people do who make love for the first time or who even earlier seek solitary gratification and imagine themselves like plants which cannot disseminate their pollen without dying? Perhaps in Saint-Loup\u2019s case this exaggeration arose as in that of children from the idea of an unfamiliar sin, a new sensation possessing an almost terrifying power which later on is attenuated. Or had he, owing to his father\u2019s early death, the presentiment of his premature end. Such a presentiment seems irrational and yet death seems subject to certain laws. One would think, for instance, that people born of parents who died very old or very young are almost forced to die at the same age, the former sustaining sorrows and incurable diseases till they are a hundred, the latter carried off, in spite of a happy, healthy existence at the inevitable and premature date by a disease so timely and accidental (however deep its roots in the organism) that it seems to be a formality necessary to the actuality of death. And is it not possible that accidental death itself \u2014 like that of Saint-Loup, linked as it was with his character in more ways than I have been able to say \u2014 is also determined beforehand, known only to gods invisible to man, but revealed by a special and semi-conscious sadness (and even expressed to others as sincerely as we announce misfortunes which, in our inmost hearts, we believe we shall escape and which nevertheless happen) in him who bears the fatal date and perceives it continuously within himself, like a device\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He must have been very beautiful in those last hours, he who in this life had seemed always, even when he sat or walked about in a drawing-room, to contain within himself the dash of a charge and to disguise smilingly the indomitable will-power centred in his triangle-shaped head when he charged for the last time. Disencumbered of its books, the feudal turret had become warlike again and that Guer-mantes was more himself in death \u2014 he was more of his breed, a Guermantes and nothing more and this was symbolised at his funeral in the church of Saint-Hilaire-de-Combray hung with black draperies where the \u201cG\u201d under the closed coronet divested of initials and titles betokened the race of Guermantes which he personified in death. Before going to the funeral which did not take place at once I wrote to Gilberte. Perhaps I ought to have written to the Duchesse de Guermantes but I imagined that she would have accepted the death of Robert with the indifference I had seen her display about so many others who had seemed so closely associated with her life, and perhaps even that, with her Guermantes spirit, she would want to show that j superstition about blood ties meant nothing to her. I was too ill to write to everybody. I had formerly believed that she and Robert liked each other in the society sense, which is the same as saying that they exchanged affectionate expressions when they felt so disposed. But when he was away from her, he did not hesitate to say that she was a fool and if she sometimes found a selfish pleasure in his society, I had noticed that she was incapable of giving herself the smallest trouble, of using her power in the slightest degree to render him a service or even to prevent some misfortune happening to him. The spitefulness she had shown in refusing to recommend him to General Saint-Joseph when Robert was going back to Morocco proved that her goodwill towards him when he married was only a sort of compromise that cost her nothing. So that I was much surprised when I heard that, owing to her being ill when Robert was killed, her people considered it necessary to hide the papers from her for several days (under fallacious pretexts) for fear of the shock that would have been caused her by their announcement of his death. But my surprise was greater when I learnt that after she had been told the truth, the Duchesse de Guermantes wept the whole day, fell ill and took a long time \u2014 more than a week, which was long for her \u2014 to console herself. When I heard about her grief, I was touched and it enabled everyone to say, as I do, that there was a great friendship between them. But when I remember how many petty slanders, how much ill-will entered into that friendship, I realise how small a value society attaches to it. Moreover somewhat later, under circumstances which were historically more important though they touched my heart less, Mme de Guermantes appeared, in my opinion, in a still more favourable light. It will be remembered that as a girl she had displayed audacious impertinence towards the Imperial family of Russia and after her marriage, spoke about them with a freedom amounting to social tactlessness, yet she was perhaps the only person, after the Russian Revolution, who gave proof of extreme devotion to the Grand-Dukes and Duchesses. The very year which preceded the war she had annoyed the Grande-Duchesse Vladimir by calling the Comtesse of Hohenfelsen, the morganatic wife of the Grand-Duc Paul, the \u201cGrande-Duchesse Paul\u201d. But, no sooner had the Russian Revolution broken out, than our Ambassador at St. Petersburg, M. Pal\u00e9ologue (\u201cPal\u00e9o\u201d for diplomatic society which, like the other, has its pseudo-witty abbreviations), was harassed by telegrams from the Duchesse de Guermantes who wanted news of the Grande-Duchesse Maria Pavlovna and for a long time the only marks of sympathy and respect which that Princess received came to her exclusively from Mme de Guermantes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saint-Loup caused, if not by his death, at least by what he had done in the weeks that preceded it, troubles greater than those of the Duchesse. What happened was that the day following the evening when I had seen M. de Charlus, the day on which he had said to Morel: \u201cI shall be revenged,\u201d Saint-Loup\u2019s hunt for Morel had ended, by the general, under whose orders Morel ought to have been, discovering that he was a deserter and having him sought out and arrested. To excuse himself to Saint-Loup for the punishment which was going to be inflicted on a person he had been interested in, the general had written to inform Saint-Loup of it. Morel was convinced that his arrest was due to the rancour of M. de Charlus. He remembered the words \u201cI shall be revenged\u201d and, thinking this was the revenge, he demanded to be heard. \u201cIt is true,\u201d he declared, \u201cthat I deserted but, if I have been influenced to evil courses, is it altogether my fault?\u201d Without compromising himself, he gave accounts of M. de Charlus and of M. d\u2019Argencourt with whom he had also quarrelled, concerning matters which these two, with the twofold exuberance of lovers and of inverts, had told him, which caused the simultaneous arrest of M. de Charlus and M. d\u2019Argencourt. This arrest caused, perhaps, less distress to these two than the knowledge that each had been the unwilling rival of the other and the proceedings disclosed an enormous number of other and more obscure rivals picked up daily in the street. They were, moreover, quickly released as was Morel because the letter written to Saint-Loup by the general was returned to him with the mention: \u201cDead on the field of honour.\u201d The general, in honour of the dead, decided that Morel should simply be sent to the front; he there behaved bravely, escaped all dangers and, when the war was over, returned with the cross which, earlier, M. de Charlus had vainly solicited for him and which he thus got indirectly through the death of Saint-Loup. I have since often thought, when recalling the croix-de-guerre lost at Jupien\u2019s, that if Saint-Loup had survived he would have been easily able to get elected deputy in the election which followed the war, thanks to the frothy idiocy and to the halo of glory which it left behind it, thanks also to centuries of prejudice being, on that account, abolished and if the loss of a finger procured a brilliant marriage and entrance into an aristocratic family, the croix-de-guerre, though it were won in an office, took the place of a profession of faith and ensured a triumphant election to the Chamber of Deputies, almost to the French Academy. The election of Saint-Loup would, on account of his \u201csainted\u201d family, have made M. Arthur Meyer pour out floods of tears and ink. But perhaps Saint-Loup loved the people too sincerely to gain their suffrages although they would, doubtless, have forgiven him his democratic ideas for the sake of his noble birth. Saint-Loup would perhaps have exposed the former with success before a chamber composed of aviators and those heroes would have understood him as would have done a few other elevated minds. But owing to the pacifying effect of the Bloc National, a lot of old political rascals had been fished up and were always elected. Those who were unable to enter a Chamber of aviators went about soliciting the votes of Marshals, of a President of the Republic, of a President of the Chamber, etc. in the hope of at least becoming members of the French Academy. They would not have favoured Saint-Loup but they did another of Jupien\u2019s customers, that deputy of Liberal Action, and he was re-elected unopposed. He did not stop wearing his territorial officer\u2019s uniform although the war had been over a long time. His election was joyfully welcomed by all the newspapers who had formed the Coalition on the strength of his name, with the help of rich and noble ladies who wore rags out of conventional sentimentality and fear of taxes, while men on the Stock Exchange ceaselessly bought diamonds, not for their wives but because, having no confidence in the credit of any country, they sought safety in tangible wealth, and incidentally made de Beers go up a thousand francs. Such imbecility was somewhat irritating but one was less indignant with the Bloc National when, suddenly, the Victims of Bolshevism appeared on the scene; Grand-Duchesses in tatters whose husbands and sons had been in turn assassinated. Husbands in wheelbarrows, sons stoned and deprived of food, forced to labour amidst jeers and finally thrown into pits and buried alive because they were said to be sickening of the plague and might infect the community. The few who succeeded in escaping suddenly reappeared and added new and terrifying details to this picture of horrorEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1496341", "artist_names": "Tony Bennett", "full_title": "Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words) by\u00a0Tony\u00a0Bennett", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5d391c67e58890166cda19d8d680cf3c.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5d391c67e58890166cda19d8d680cf3c.982x982x1.jpg", "id": 1496341, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 3141771, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1498871595, "path": "/Tony-bennett-fly-me-to-the-moon-in-other-words-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Tony-bennett-fly-me-to-the-moon-in-other-words-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5d391c67e58890166cda19d8d680cf3c.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5d391c67e58890166cda19d8d680cf3c.982x982x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false}, "title": "Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words)", "title_with_featured": "Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words)", "updated_by_human_at": 1498871595, "url": "https://genius.com/Tony-bennett-fly-me-to-the-moon-in-other-words-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/40927", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5hsntijmqgecf9011zoxm7awi.445x383x1.jpg", "id": 40927, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5hsntijmqgecf9011zoxm7awi.445x383x1.jpg", "index_character": "t", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Tony Bennett", "slug": "Tony-bennett", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Tony-bennett"}, "artist": "Tony Bennett", "lyrics": "Fly Me To The Moon (In Other Words) LyricsPoets often use many words\nTo say a simple thing\nIt takes thought and time and rhyme\nTo make a poem sing\nWith music and words I've been playing\nFor you I have written a song\nTo make sure you know what I'm saying\nI'll translate as I go along\n\nFly me to the moon\nAnd let me play among the stars\nLet me see what spring is like\nOn Jupiter and Mars\nIn other words\nHold my hand\nIn other words\nDarlin kiss me\nFill my heart with song\nAnd let me sing forevermore\nYou are all I long for\nAll I worship and adore\nIn other words\nPlease be true\nIn other words\nI love you...You might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1269275", "artist_names": "Ray Charles", "full_title": "I'm a Fool to Care by\u00a0Ray\u00a0Charles", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/cd964c30193643311ea9ff5c7866821a.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cd964c30193643311ea9ff5c7866821a.999x999x1.png", "id": 1269275, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 2976672, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1631244969, "path": "/Ray-charles-im-a-fool-to-care-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Ray-charles-im-a-fool-to-care-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1987, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1987", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1987", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/cd964c30193643311ea9ff5c7866821a.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/cd964c30193643311ea9ff5c7866821a.999x999x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "I\u2019m a Fool to Care", "title_with_featured": "I'm a Fool to Care", "updated_by_human_at": 1632995329, "url": "https://genius.com/Ray-charles-im-a-fool-to-care-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22416", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9df5a6ccd0811bf06a2548035b51aef3.1000x453x1.jpg", "id": 22416, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/763b169fe54e11c482ba5d6de6b84979.415x415x1.jpg", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Ray Charles", "slug": "Ray-charles", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Ray-charles"}, "artist": "Ray Charles", "lyrics": "I\u2019m a Fool to Care Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI'm a fool to care\nWhen you treat me this way\nOh, I love you so, but darling, I know\nI'm a fool to care\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm a fool to cry\nSince you told me goodbye\nOh, you can't be true, so what can I do?\nI'm a fool to care (I'm a fool to care)\n[Verse 3]\nI know I should laugh, hahahaha\nAnd call it a day\nBut I know I would cry\nIf you went away\n\n[Verse 4]\nI'm a fool to care\nWhen you don't care for me\nWhy should I pretend?

concerned\nBut now you've upped and left me and I think it's time you learned\nIf you're not back here in my arms by the time I count to ten\nWell, I'll wait just a little while, then I'll count again\n\nWhen you were mine I had you like a puppet on a string\nSo now you'd better listen 'cause I'll tell you one more thing\nIf your lips aren't next to mine by the time I count to ten\nWell, I'll wait just a little while, then I'll count again\n\nI'll count the lonely hours I spent 'cause I was blind\nI'll count the things I'll do to make you change your mind\nI'll give you love and kindness and I'll buy you presents too\nI'll try so hard to always make you happy when you're blue\nSo if you're not back here in my arms by the time I count to ten\nWell, I'll wait just a little while, then I'll count again\nYes, I'll wait just a little while, then I'll count againYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/7545816", "artist_names":

Carolann Clare\nWho, bored with the lesson, the rivers of England \u2013\nBrathay, Coquet, Crake, Dee, Don, Goyt\nRothay, Tyne, Swale, Tees, Wear, Wharfe\nHad passed, a note, which has never been found\nTo the classmate in front, Emily Jane, a girl\nWho adored the teacher, Miss V. Dunn MA\nSteadily squeaking her chalk on the board \u2013\nAllen, Clough, Duddon, Feugh, Greta, Hindburn\nIrwell, Kent, Leven, Lowther, Lune, Sprint\nBut who furtively opened the folded note\nTorn from the back of the King James Bible, read\nWhat was scribbled there and laughed out loud\nIt was a miserable, lowering winter\u2019s day. The girls\nHad been kept indoors at break \u2013 Wet Play\nIn the Hall \u2013 the windows tall and thin\nSad with rain like a song list of watery names \u2013\nRawthey, Roeburn, Skirfare, Troutbeck, Wash\nLikewise, the sound of the laugh of Emily Jane\nWas a liquid one, a gurgle, a ripple, a dribble\nA babble, a gargle, a plash, a splash of a laugh\nLike the sudden jackpot leap of a silver fish\nIn the purse of a pool. No fool, Emily Jane\nClamped her turquoise hand \u2013 her fountain pen leaked \u2013\nTo her mouth; but the laugh was out, was at large\nWas heard by the pupil twinned to her double desk \u2013\n\nRosemary Beth \u2013 the brace on whose jiggly teeth\nCouldn\u2019t restrain the gulping giggle she gave\nWhich caused Miss Dunn to spin round. Perhaps\nShe said, We can all share the joke? But Emily Jane\nHad scrunched and dropped the note with the joke\nTo the floor and kicked it across to Jennifer Kay\nWho snorted and toed it across to Marjorie May\nWho spluttered and heeled it backwards\nTo Jessica Kate. Girls! By now, every girl in the form\nHad started to snigger or snicker or titter or chuckle\nOr chortle till the classroom came to the boil\nWith a brothy mirth. Girls! Miss Dunn\u2019s shrill voice\nScraped Top G and only made matters worse\nYou might also likeFive minutes passed in a cauldron of noise\nNo one could seem to stop. Each tried holding\nHer breath or thinking of death or pinching\nHer thigh, only to catch the eye of a pal\nA crimson, shaking, silent girl, and explode\nThrough the noise in a cackling sneeze. Thank you!\nPlease! Screeched Miss Dunn, clapping her hands\nAs though she applauded the choir they\u2019d become\nA percussion of trills and whoops filling the room\nLike birds in a cage. But then came a triple rap\nAt the door and in stalked Miss Fife, Head of Maths\nWhose cold equations of eyes scanned the desks\nFor a suitable scapegoat. Stand up, Geraldine Ruth\n\nGeraldine Ruth got to her feet, a pale girl, a girl\nWho looked, in the stale classroom light, like a sketch\nFor a girl, a first draft to be crumpled and crunched\nAnd tossed away like a note. She cleared her throat\nRaising her eyes, water and sky, to look at Miss Fife\nThe girls who were there that day never forgot\nHow invisible crayons seemed to colour in\nGeraldine Ruth, white face to puce, mousey hair\nSuddenly gifted with health and youth, and how \u2013\nAs Miss Fife demanded what was the meaning of this \u2013\nHer lips split from the closed bud of a kiss\nTo the daisy chain of a grin and how then she yodelled\nA laugh with the full, open, blooming rose of her throat\nA flower of merriment. What\u2019s the big joke?\nThundered Miss Fife as Miss Dunn began again\nTo clap, as gargling Geraldine Ruth collapsed\nIn a heap on her desk, as the rest of the class\nHollered and hooted and howled. Miss Fife strode\nOn sharp heels to the blackboard, snatched up\nA finger of chalk and jabbed and slashed out\nA word. SILENCE. But the class next door\nFourth Years learning the Beaufort scale with Miss Batt\nCould hear the commotion. Miss Batt droned on \u2013\nNought, calm; one, light air; two, light breeze; three\nGentle . . . four, moderate . . . five, fresh . . . six, strong breeze;\nSeven, moderate gale . . . Stephanie Fay started to laugh\n\nWhat\u2019s so amusing, Stephanie Fay? barked Miss Batt\nWhat\u2019s so amusing? echoed unwitting Miss Dunn\nOn the other side of the wall. Precisely what\u2019s\nSo amusing? chorused Miss Fife. The Fourth Years\nShrieked with amazed delight and one wag\nAngela Joy, popped her head in the jaws of her desk\nAnd bellowed What\u2019s so amusing? What\u2019s so\nAmusing? into its musty yawn. The Third Form\nGuffawed afresh at the sound of the Fourth\nAnd the noise of the two combined was heard\nBy the First Form, trying to get Shakespeare by heart\nTo the beat of the ruler of Mrs Mackay. Don\u2019t look\nAt your books, look at me. After three. Friends\n\nRomans, Countrymen . . . What\u2019s so amusing? rapped out\nMrs Mackay as the First Years chirruped\nAnd trilled like baby birds in a nest at a worm;\nBut she heard for herself, appalled, the chaos\nComing in waves through the wall and clipped\nTo the door. Uproar. And her Head of Lower School!\nIt was then that Mrs Mackay made mistake number one\nLeaving her form on its own while she went to see\nTo the forms of Miss Batt and Miss Dunn. The moment\nShe\u2019d gone, the room blossomed with paper planes\nInk bombs, whistles, snatches of song, and the class clown \u2013\nCaroline Joan \u2013 stood on her desk and took up\nThe speech where Mrs Mackay had left off \u2013 Lend\n\nMe your ears . . . just what the Second Form did\nIn the opposite room, reciting the Poets Laureate\nFor Miss Nadimbaba \u2013 John Dryden, Thomas Shadwell\nNahum Tate, Nicholas Rowe, Laurence Eusden, Colley Cibber\nWilliam Whitehead . . . but scattering titters and giggles\nLike noisy confetti on reaching Henry Pye as Carline Joan\nBelted out Antony\u2019s speech in an Elvis style \u2013\nFor Brutus, uh huh huh, is an honourable man\nMiss Nadimbaba, no fan of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll, could scarcely\nBelieve her ears, deducing at once that Mrs Mackay\nWas not with her class. She popped an anxious head\nOutside her door. Anarchy roared in her face\nLike a tropical wind. The corridor clock was at four\n\nThe last bell rang. Although they would later regret it\nThe teachers, taking their cue from wits-end Mrs Mackay\nAllowed the chuckling, bright-eyed, mirthful girls\nTo go home, reprimand-free, each woman privately glad\nThat the dark afternoon was over and done\nThe chalky words rubbed away to dance as dust\nOn the air, the dates, the battles, the kings and queens\nThe rivers and tributaries, poets, painters, playwrights\nPoliticos, popes . . . but they all agreed to make it quite clear\nIn tomorrow\u2019s Assembly that foolish behaviour \u2013\nEven if only the once \u2013 wasn\u2019t admired or desired\nAt Stafford Girls\u2019 High. Above the school, the moon\nWas pinned like a monitor\u2019s badge to the sky\nMiss Dunn was the first to depart, wheeling\nHer bicycle through the gates, noticing how\nThe sky had cleared, a tidy diagram of the Plough\nDirectly above. She liked it this cold, her breath\nChiffoning out behind as she freewheeled home\nDown the hill, her mind emptying itself of geography\nOf mountains and seas and deserts and forests\nAnd capital cities. Her small terraced house looked\nShe thought, like a sleeping face. She roused it\nEach evening, kisses of light on its cheeks\nFrom her lamps, the small talk of cutlery, pots\nAnd pans as she cooked, sweet silver steam caressing\nThe shy rooms of her home. Miss Dunn live alone\n\nSo did Miss Batt, in a flat on the edge of the park\nNear the school; though this evening Miss Fife\nWas coming for supper. The two were good friends\nAnd Miss Fife liked to play on Miss Batt\u2019s small piano\nAfter the meal and the slowly shared carafe of wine\nMusic and Maths! Johann Sebastian Bach! Miss Batt\nAn all-rounder, took out her marking \u2013 essays on Henry VIII\nAnd his wives from the Fifth \u2013 while Miss Fife gave herself up\nTo Minuet in G. In between Catherine Howard\nAnd Catherine Parr, Miss Batt glanced across at Fifi\u2019s\nStraight back as she played, each teacher conscious\nOf each woman\u2019s silently virtuous love. Nights like this\nTwice a week, after school, for them both, seemed enough\n\nMrs Mackay often gave Miss Nadimbaba a lift\nAs they both, by coincidence, lived on Mulberry Drive \u2013\nMrs Mackay with her husband of twenty-five grinding\nChildless years; Miss Nadimbaba sharing a house\nWith her elderly aunt. Neither had ever invited\nThe other one in, although each would politely enquire\nAfter her colleague\u2019s invisible half. Mrs Mackay\nWatched Miss Nadimbaba open her purple door and saw\nA cat rubbing itself on her calf. She pulled away\nFrom the kerb, worrying whether Mr Mackay would insist\nOn fish for his meal. Then he would do his crossword:\nMr Mackay calling out clues \u2013 Kind of court for a bounder (8) \u2013\nWhile she passed him Roget, Brewer, Pears, the OED\n\nThe women teachers of England slept in their beds\nTheir shrewd or wise or sensible heads safe vessels\nFor Othello\u2019s jealousy, the Wife of Bath\u2019s warm laugh\nThe phases of the moon, the country code;\nFor Roman numerals, Greek alphabets, French verbs;\nFor foreign currencies and Latin roots, for logarithms, tables\nQuotes; the meanings of current calamo and fiat lux and stet\nMiss Dunn dreamed of a freezing white terrain\nWhere slowly moving elephants were made of ice\nMiss Nadimbaba dreamed she knelt to kiss Miss Barrett\nOn her couch and she, Miss Nadimbaba, was Browning\nSaying Beloved, be my wife . . . and then a dog began to bark\nAnd she woke up. Miss Batt dreamed of Miss Fife\n\n* * *\n\nMorning assembly \u2013 the world like Quink outside\nThe teachers perched in a solemn row on the stage\nThe Fifth and Sixth Forms clever and tall, Miss Fife\nAt the school piano, the Head herself, Doctor Bream\nAt the stand \u2013 was a serious affair. Jerusalem hung\nIn the air till the last of Miss Fife\u2019s big chords\nWobbled away. Yesterday, intoned Doctor Bream\nThe Lower school behaved in a foolish way, sniggering\nFor the most of the late afternoon. She glared at the girls\nThrough her pince-nez and paused for dramatic effect\nBut the First and Second and Third and Fourth Forms\nStarted to laugh, each girl trying to swallow it down\nTill the sound was like distant thunder, the opening chord\n\nOf a storm. Miss Dunn and Miss Batt, Miss Nadimbaba\nAnd Mrs Mackay leapt to their feet as one, grim-faced\nThe Fifth Form hooted and howled. Miss Fife, oddly disturbed\nCrashed down fistfuls of furious notes on the yellowing keys\nThe Sixth Forms, upper and lower, shrieked. Se\u00f1ora Devizes\nSartorial, strict, slim, server teacher of Spanish\nStalked from the stage and stilettoed sharply down\nTo the back of the Hall to chastise the Fifth and Sixth\n\u00a1Callaos! \u00a1Callaos! \u00a1Callaos! \u00a1Qu\u00e9dense! The whole school\nGuffawed; their pink young lungs flowering more\nThan they had for the hymn. \u00a1El clamor! The Hall was a zoo\nSnow began falling outside as though the clouds\nWere being slowly torn up like a rule book. A good laugh\n\nAs the poet Ursula Fleur, who attended the school\nWas to famously write, is feasting on air. The air that day\nWas chomped, chewed, bitten in two, pulled apart\nLike a wishbone, licked like a lollipop, sluiced and sucked\nSome of the girls were almost sick. Girls gulped or sipped\nOr slurped as they savoured the joke. What joke?\nNobody knew. A silly joy sparkled and fizzed. Tabitha Rose\nFlower monitor for the day, wet herself, wailed, wept, ran\nFrom the Hall, a small human shower of rain. The bell\nFor the start of lessons rang. Somehow the school\nFiled out in a raggedly line. The Head Girl, Josephine June\nScarlet-faced from killing herself, was in for a terrible time\nWith the Head. Snow iced the school like a giant cake\n\nNo one on record recalls the words that were said\nBut Josephine June was stripped of the Head Girl\u2019s badge\nAnd sash and sent to the Sixth Form Common Room\nTo demand of the prefects how they could hope to grow to be\nThe finest of England\u2019s daughters and mothers and wives\nAfter this morning\u2019s Assembly\u2019s abysmal affair?\nBut the crowd of girls gave a massive cheer, stamping\nThe floor with their feet in a rebel beat and Diana Kim\nCaptain of Sports, jumped on a chair and declared\nThat if J.J. was no longer Head Girl then no one\nWould take her place. All for one! Someone yelled. And one\nFor all! Diana Kim opened the window and jumped down\nInto the snow. With a shriek, Emmeline Bell jumped after her\n\nFollowed by cackling Anthea Meg, Melanie Hope, Andrea Lyn\nJ.J. herself . . . It was Gillian Tess in the Fifth, being lectured\nBy tight-lipped Se\u00f1ora Devizes on how to behave, who glanced\nFrom the first-floor window and noticed the Sixth Form\nBouncing around in the snow like girls on the moon\nA snowball, the size of a netball, was creaking, rolling\nGrowing under their hands. Look! Girls at their windows gaped\nIt grew from a ball to the size of a classroom globe. It grew\nFrom a globe to the size of a huge balloon. Miss Dunn\nDrumming the world\u2019s highest mountains into the heads\nOf the First Years \u2013 Everest, K2, Kangchenjunga, Lhoste, Makalu 1\nFlung open her window and breathed in the passionate cold\nOf the snow. A wild thought seeded itself in her head\nIn later years, the size of the snowball rolled by the Sixth\nGrew like a legend. Some claimed that the Head, as it groaned\nPast her study, thought that there might have been an eclipse\nUrsula Fleur, in her prose poem Snow, wrote that it took\nThe rest of the Michaelmas Term to melt. Miss Batt\nVacantly staring down as her class wrote out a list\nOf the monarchs of England \u2013 Egbert, Ethelwulf, Ethelbald\nEthelbert, Ethelred, Alfred, Edward, Athelstan, Edmund\nEadred, Eadwing, Edgar . . . noticed the snowball, huge and alone\nOn the hockey pitch, startlingly white in the pencil grey\nOf the light, and thought of desire, of piano scales slowing\nSlowing, breasts. She moaned aloud, forgetful of where\nShe was. Francesca Eve echoed the moan. The class roared\n\nBut that night Miss Batt, while she cooked for Miss Fife\nWho was opening the wine with a corkscrew\nFrom the last year\u2019s school trip to Sienna and Florence\nFelt herself naked, electric under her tartan skirt, twin set\nAnd pearls; and later, Miss Fife at the piano, stroking\nThe first notes of Beethoven\u2019s \u2018Moonlight\u2019 Sonata, Miss Batt\nCame behind her, placing her inked and trembling hands\nOn her shoulders. A broken A minor chord stumbled\nAnd died. Miss Fife said that Ludwig could only\nHave written this piece when he was in love. Miss Batt\nPulled Miss Fife by the hair, turning her face around, hearing\nHer gasp, bending down, kissing her, kissing her, kissing her\nEssays on Cardinal Wolsey lay unmarked on the floor\n\nAcross the hushed white park, down the slush of the hill\nMiss Dunn crouched on the floor of her sitting room\nOver a map of Tibet. The whisky glass in her nervous hand\nClunked on her teeth, Talisker sheathing her tongue\nIn a heroine\u2019s warmth. She moved her finger slowly\nOver the map, the roof of the world. Her fingers walked to Nepal\nChanging the mountain Chomulungma to Sagarmatha\nShe sipped at her malt and thought about Mallory, lost\nOn Everest\u2019s slopes with his English Air, of how he\u2019d wanted\nTo reach the summit because it was there. She wondered\nWhether he had. Nobody knew. She was herself walking\nThe upper slopes with the Captain of Sports towards\nThe foetal shape of a sleeping man . . . She turned to the girl\n\n* * *\n\nThat Monday morning Doctor Bream, at her desk\nDidn\u2019t yet know that the laughter of Stafford Girls\u2019 High\nWould not go away. But when she stood on the stage\nGarbed in her Cambridge cap and gown, and told the school\nTo quietly stand and contemplate a fresh and serious start\nTo the week, and closed her eyes \u2013 the hush like an air balloon\nTethered with ropes \u2013 a low and vulgar giggle yanked\nAt the silence. Doctor Bream kept her eyes clenched, hoping\nThat if she ignored it all would be well. Clumps of laughter\nSprouted among the row upon row of girls. Doctor Bream\nDetermined and blind, started the morning\u2019s hymn. I vow\nTo thee my country . . . A flushed Miss Fife started to play\nAll earthly things above . . . The rest of the staff joined in \u2013\n\nEntire and whole and perfect, the service of my love\nThe love that asks no questions, the love that stands the test\nBut the girls were hysterical, watching the Head\nQueen Canute, singing against the tide of their mirth\nTheir shoals, their glittering laughter. She opened her eyes \u2013\nClarice Maud Bream, MBE, DLitt \u2013 and saw, in the giggling sea\nOne face which seemed to her to be worse, cheekier\nRedder and louder, than all of the rest. Nigella Dawn\nWas fished by the Head from her seat and made to stand\nOn a chair on the stage. Laughter drained from the Hall. This girl\nBoomed the Head, will stand on this chair for as long as it takes\nFor the school to come to its senses. SILENCE! The whole school\nStood like a crowd waiting for news. The bell rang. Nobody\n\nMoved. Nobody made a sound. Minutes slinked away\nAs Nigella Dawn swayed on her creaky chair. The First Years\nStared in shame at their shoes. The Head\u2019s tight smile\nWas a tick. That, she thought, in a phrase of her mother\u2019s\nHas put the tin lid on that. A thin high whine, a kitten\nWind on a wire, came from behind. The school\nSeemed to hold its breath. Nigella Dawn shook on her chair\nThe sound came again, louder. Doctor Bream looked to the staff\nMiss Batt had her head in her lap and was keening and rocking\nBackwards and forwards. The noise put the Head in mind\nOf a radio dial \u2013 Luxembourg, Light, Hilversum, Welsh \u2013\nAs though the woman were trying to tune in to herself. Miss Batt\nFlung her head back and laughed, laughed like a bride\n\n* * *\n\nMr and Mrs Mackay silently ate. She eyed him\nBoning his fish, slicking it down to the backbone\nSliding the skeleton out, fastidious, deft. She spied him\nEat from the right of his plate to the left, ordered, precise\nShe clenched herself for his voice. A very nice dish\nFrom the bottomless deep. Bad words ran in her head like mice\nShe wanted to write them down like crossword lights\n14 Across: F . . . 17 Down: F . . . . . . 2 Down: F\nMr Mackay reached for the OED. She bit her lip. A word\nFor one who is given to walking by night, not necessarily\nIn sleep. She felt her heart flare in its dark cave, hungry, blind\nOpen in its small beak. Beginning with N. Mrs Mackay\nMoved to the window and stared at the ravenous night. Later\n\nAwake in the beached boat of the marital bed, Mrs Mackay\nSlid from between the sheets. Her spouse whistled and whined\nShe dressed in sweater and slacks, in boots, in her old tweed coat\nAnd slipped from the house with a tut of the front door snib\nHer breath swaggered away like a genie popped from a flask\nShe looked for the moon, found it, arched high over the house\nA raised eyebrow of light, and started to walk. The streets\nWere empty, darkly sparkling under her feet, ribbons that tied\nThe sleeping town like a gift. A black cat glared from a wall\nMrs Mackay walked and walked, letting the night\nSigh underneath her clothes, perfume her skin; letting it in\nThe scented night \u2013 stone, starlight, tree-sleep, rat, owl\nA calm rhythm measured itself in her head. Noctambulist\nShe walked for hours, till dawn\u2019s soft tip rubbed, smudged\nErased the dark. Back home, she stripped and washed\nAnd dressed for school, moving about in the kitchen\nTill Mr Mackay appeared, requesting a four-minute egg\nFrom a satisfied hen. She watched him slice off the top\nWith the side of his spoon, dip in his toast, savour the soft gold\nOf the yolk with his neat tongue. She thought of the girls\nHow they\u2019d laughed now for weeks. Panic nipped and salted\nHer eyes. And later that day, walking among the giggling desks\nOf the Third, she read Cleopatra\u2019s lament in a shaking voice\nAs tears shone on her cheeks: Hast thou no care for me?\nShall I abide in this dull word, which in thy absence is\nNo better than sty? O! see my women, the crown\n\nO\u2019 the earth doth melt. My lord! O! withered is the garland\nOf the war, the soldier\u2019s pole is fall\u2019n; young boys and girls\nAre level now with men; the odds is gone, and there is nothing\nLeft remarkable beneath the visiting moon. Carolann Clare, trapped\nIn a breathless crippling laugh, seriously thought she would die\nMrs Mackay lay down her book and asked the girls to start\nFrom the top and carry on reading the play round the class\nShe closed her eyes and seemed to drift off at her desk\nThe voices of girls shared Shakespeare, line by line, the clock\nOver the blackboard crumbling its minutes into the dusty air\nFrom the other side of the wall, light breezes of laughter came\nAnd went. Further away, from the music, room, the sound\nOf the orchestra hooted and sneered its way through Grieg\n\nMiss Batt, in the staffroom, marking The War of Jenkins\u2019 Ear\nOver and over again, put down her pen. Music reminded her\nOf Miss Fife. She lay her head on the table, dizzy with lust, longed\nFor the four o\u2019clock bell, for home, for pasta and vino rosso\nFor Fifi\u2019s body on hers in the single bed, for kisses that tasted\nOf jotters, of wine. She picked up an essay and read:\nEngland went to war with Spain because a seaman, Robert\nJenkins, claimed that the Spanish thought him a smuggler\nAnd cut off his ear. He showed the ear in the Commons\nAnd public opinion forced the Government to declare war\nOn October 23, 1739 . . . Miss Batt cursed under her breath\nSlashing a red tick with her pen. The music had stopped. Hilarity\nSquealed and screeched in its place down the corridor\n\nMiss Nadimbaba was teaching the poems of Yeats\nTo the Fifth when the girls in the orchestra laughed. She held\nIn her hands the poem which made her a scribbler of verse\nAt twelve or thirteen. \u2018The Song\u2019 \u2013 she was sick of the laughter\nAt Stafford Girls\u2019 High \u2013 \u2018of Wandering Aengus.\u2019 She stared\nAt the girls in her class who were starting to shake. An epidemic\nThat\u2019s what it was. It had gone on all term. It was now the air\nThat they breathed, teachers and girls: a giggling, sniggering\nGurgling, snickering atmosphere, a laughing gas that seeped\nUnder doors, up corridors, into the gym, the chemistry lab\nThe swimming pool, into Latin and Spanish and French and Greek\nInto Needlework, History, Art, R.K., P.E., into cross-country runs\nInto the silver apples of the moon, the golden apples of the sun\n\nMiss Dunn stood with her bike outside school after four\nScanning the silly, cackling girls for a face \u2013 Diana Kim\u2019s\nThe Captain of Sports was tall, red-haired. Her green eyes\nStared at Miss Dunn and Miss Dunn knew. This was a girl\nWho would scale a vertical wall of ice with her fingertips\nWho would pitch a tent on the lip of a precipice, who would know\nWhen the light was good, when the wind was bad, when snow\nWas powdery or hard. The girl had the stuff of heroines. Diana Kim\nWalked with the teacher, pushing her bicycle for her, hearing her\nOutline the journey, the great adventure, the climb to the Mother\nOf Earth. Something inside her opened and bloomed\nMiss Dunn was her destiny, fame, a strong hand pulling her\nHigher and higher into the far Tibetan clouds, into the sun\n\n* * *\n\nDoctor Bream was well aware that something had to be done\nLaughter, it seemed, was on the curriculum. The girls\nFound everything funny, strange; howled or screamed\nAt the slightest thing. The Headmistress prowled the school\nListening at classroom doors. The new teacher, Mrs Munro\nWas reading The Flaying of Marsyas to the Third: Help!\nWhy are you stripping me from myself? The girls were in fits\nMrs Munro\u2019s tight voice struggled on: It was possible to count\nHis throbbing organs and the chambers of his lungs. Shrieks\nAnd squeals stabbed the air. Why? At what? Doctor Bream\nSnooped on. Miss Batt was teaching the First Form the names\nOf the nine major planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars\nJupiter, Saturn, Uranus . . . Pandemonium hooted and whooped\n\nThe grim Head passed down the corridor, hearing the Fifth Form\nGargling its way through the Diet of Worms. She came\nTo the Honours Board, the names of the old girls written in gold \u2013\nHead Girls who had passed into legend, Captains of Sport\nWho had played the game, prize-winning girls, girls who\u2019d gone on\nTo achieve great things. Members of Parliament! Blasts of laughter\nBelched from the playing fields. Doctor Bream walked to her room\nAnd stood by her desk. Her certificates preened behind glass\nIn the wintery light. Silver medals and trophies and cups gleamed\nIn the cabinet. She went to the wall \u2013 the school photograph\nGlinted and glowed, each face like a fingertip; the pupils\nStraight-backed, straight-faced; the staff upright, straight-laced\nA warm giggle burbled outside. She flung open the door\n\nThe empty corridor winked. She could hear\nA distant piano practising F\u00fcr Elise . . . Se\u00f1ora Devizes\nCounting in Spanish in one of the rooms \u2013 uno, dos, tres\nCuatro, cinco, seis, siete, ocho, nueve, diez, once, doce\nTrece, catorce, quince, diez y seis, diez y siete, diez y ocho\nA shrill whistle blowing outside . . . But then a burst of hysteria\nCame from the classroom above, rolled down the stairs\nExploded again the classroom below. Mrs Mackay\nFrantic, hoarse, could be heard pitching Portia\u2019s speech\nOver the hoots of the Fourth: The quality of MERCY\nIs not STRAINED. It droppeth as the gentle rain from HEAVEN\nUpon the place BENEATH . . . Cackles, like gunfire, crackled\nAnd spat through the school. A cheer boomed from the Gym\n\nIt went on thus \u2013 through every hymn or poem, catechism\nLogarithm, sum, exam; in every classroom, drama room\nTo music room; on school trips to a factory or farm; from\nFirst to Sixth Form, dunce to academic cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\nDay in, day out; till, towards the end of the Hilary Term\nDoctor Bream called yet another meeting in the Staffroom\nDetermined now to solve the problem of the laughter\nOf the girls once and for all. The staff filed in at 4.15 \u2013\nMiss Batt, Miss Fife, Miss Dunn, Mrs Munro, the sporty\nMrs Lee, Mrs Mackay, Miss Nadimbaba, the Heads of French\nAnd Science \u2013 Miss Feaver, Mirs Kaye \u2013 Se\u00f1ora Devizes\nThe tuneful Miss Aherne, the part-time drama teacher\nMrs Prendergast. The Head stood up and clapped her hands\n\nMiss Fife poured Earl Grey tea. Miss Dunn stood by the window\nStaring out. Miss Batt burned at Miss Fife. Mrs Mackay\nSat down and closed her eyes. Miss Nadimbaba churned\nThe closing couplet of a poem in her head. Miss Feaver\nCrossed her legs and smiled at Mrs Lee, who twirled\nA squash racquet between her rosy knees. I think we all agree\nSaid Doctor Bream, that things are past the pale. The girls\nAre learning nothing. Discipline\u2019s completely gone\nTo pot. I\u2019d like to hear from each of you in turn. Mrs Mackay?\nMrs Mackay opened her eyes and sighed. And shook her head\nAnd then she started singing: It was a lover and his lass\nWith a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonimo, that o\u2019er\nThe green cornfield did pass, in the spring time\n\nThe only pretty ring time, when birds do sing, hey ding\nA ding, ding; sweet lovers love the spring. A silence fell\nMiss Batt looked at Miss Fife and cleared her throat. Miss Fife\nAnd I are leaving at the end of term. Miss Dunn at the window\nTurned. I\u2019m leaving then myself. To have a crack at Everest\nThe Head sank to a chair. Miss Nadimbaba stood. Then one by one\nThe staff resigned \u2013 to publish poetry, to live in Spain, to form\nA tennis club, to run a restaurant in Nice, to tread the boards\nTo sing in smoky clubs, to translate Ovid into current speech\nTo study homeopathy. Doctor Bream was white with shock\nAnd what, she forced herself at last to say, about the girls?\nMiss Batt, slowly undressing Fifi in the stockroom in her head\nWinked at Miss Fife. She giggled girlishly. Miss Feaver laughed\n\n* * *\n\nSmall hours. The moon tracked Mrs Mackay as she reached the edge\nOf the sleeping town, houses dwindling to fields, the road\nTwisting up and away into the distant hills. She caught her mid\nMaking anagrams \u2013 grow heed, stab, rats \u2013 and forced herself\nTo chant aloud as she walked. Hedgerow. Bats. Star. Her head\nCleared. The town was below her now, dark and hunched\nA giant husband bunched in his sleep. Mrs Mackay climbed on\nHigher and higher, keeping close to the ditch, till the road snaked\nInto a long S then levelled out into open countryside. Shore\nLove, steer, low, master, night loom, riven use, no. Horse. Vole\nTrees. Owl. Stream. Moonlight. Universe. On. Wed, loop, wand\nDrib, tiles, pay thaw, god. Dew. Pool. Dawn. Bird. Stile. Pathway\nDog. She arrived at the fringe of a village as morning broke\n\nMiss Batt held Miss Fife in her arms at dawn, the small room\nChaste with new light. Miss Fife began to talk in her sleep \u2013\nThe square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum\nOf the squares of the other two sides. Miss Batt slid down\nNuzzled her breastbone, her stomach, kissed down, kissed down\nDown to the triangle. The tutting bedside clock\nCounted to five. They woke again at seven, stupid with love\nEverything they knew \u2013 the brightest stars, Sirius, Canopus\nAlpha Centauri, Vega; the Roman Emperors, Claudius\nNero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius; musical terms, allegro, calando\nCrescendo, glissando; mathematics, the value of pi\nPrime numbers, Cantor\u2019s infinities \u2013 only a jumble of words\nA jumble of words. A long deep zero groaned from Miss Fife\n\nMiss Dunn took out her list and checked it again\nHer class was sniggering its way through a test on Britain\u2019s largest lakes\nShe mouthed her list like a prayer: socks, mittens, shirt, leggings\nHat, face mask, goggles, harness, karabiners, ice screws, pitons\nHelmet, descender, ascender, loops, slings, ice axe, gaiters\nCrampons, boots, jacket, hood, trousers, water bottle, urine\nBottle, waste bags, sleeping bag, kit bag, head torch, batteries\nTent, medical kit, maps, stove, butane, radio, fixing line, rope\nCord, stoppers, wands, stakes and chocks and all of it twice\nA sprinkle of giggles made her look up. Pass your test to the girl\nOn your left to be marked. The answers are: Lough Neagh\nLower Lough Erne, Loch Lomond, Loch Ness, Loch Awe, Upper\nLough Erne . . . Diana Kim climbed and climbed in her head\n\nDoctor Bream read through the letter to parents then signed\nHer name at the end. The school was to close at the end of term\nUntil further notice. A dozen resignation notes from the staff lay\nOn her desk. The Head put her head in her hands and wept\nA local journalist lurked at the gates. Se\u00f1ora Devizes\nAnd Miss Nadimbaba entered the room to say that the girls\nWere filing into the Hall for the Special Assembly. There was still\nNo sign of Mrs Mackay. She looked at the shattered Head\nAnd Kipling sprang to Miss Nadimbaba\u2019s lips: If you can force\nYour heart and nerve and sinew to server your turn long after they\nAre gone . . . Se\u00f1ora Devizes joined in: Persiste aun no tengas\nFuerza, y s\u00f3lo te quede la voluntad que les dice:\n\u00a1Persiste! The Head got to her feet and straightened her back\n\nAnd so, Doctor Bream summed up, you girls have laughed this once\nGreat school into the ground. Se\u00f1ora Devizes plans to return\nTo Spain. Cries of \u00a1Ol\u00e9! Miss Batt and Miss Fife have resigned\nWolf whistles. Mrs Prendergast is joining the Theatre Royale\nA round of applause crashed on the boards like surf. The Head stared\nAt the laughing girls then turned and marched from the stage\nClipped up the polished corridor, banged through the double doors\nCrunched down the gravel drive to the Staff Car Park and into her car\nElvis, shrieked Caroline Joan from the Hall, has left the building\nA cheer like an avalanche bounced off the roof. The Captain of Sports\nSlipped from her seat and followed Miss Dunn. The girls burst\nInto song as their mute teachers walked from the stage. Till we\nHave built Jerusalem in England\u2019s green and pleasant land\n\n* * *\n\nThe empty school creaked and sighed, its desks the small coffins\nOf lessons, its blackboards the tombstones of learning. The books\nIn the Library stiffened and yellowed and curled. The portraits\nOf gone Headmistresses stared into space. The school groaned\nThe tiles on its roof falling off in its sleep, its windows as white\nAs chalk. The grass on the playing fields grew like grass\nOn a grave. Doctor Bream stared from her hospital window\nOver the fields. She could see the school bell in its tower glint\nIn the evening sun like a tear in an eye. She turned away. Postcards\nAnd get-well messages from the staff were pinned to the wall\nShe took down a picture of Everest from Miss Dunn: We leave\nCamp II tomorrow if the weather holds to climb the Corridor\nTo 21,000 feet. Both coping well with altitude. The Sherpas\n\nMrs Mackay walked through Glen Strathfarrar, mad, muttering\nFree; a filthy old pack on her back filled with scavenged loot \u2013\nBanana, bottle, blanket, balaclava, bread, blade, bible. She sat\nBy a stream, filled her bottle and drank. She ate the crusts\nThe fruit. Kingfisher. Eagle. Heron. Red deer. Midge. The Glen\nDarkened and cooled like History. Mrs Mackay lay in the heather\nUnder her blanket, mumbling lines from Lear: As mad as the vex\u2019d\nSea; singing aloud; crowned with rank fumitory and furrow weeds\nWith burdocks, hemlocks, nettles, cuckoo-flowers, darnel\nSyllables. Syllables. Sleep came suddenly, under the huge black\nThe chuckling clever stars. The Head at her window looked north\nTo the clear night sky, to Pollux and Castor, Capella, Polaris\nAnd wondered again what could have become of Mrs Mackay\n\nRough lads from the town came up to the school to throw stones\nThrough the glass. Miss Batt and Miss Fife had moved\nTo a city. They drank in a dark bar where women danced, cheek\nTo cheek. Miss Batt loved Miss Fife till she sobbed and shook\nIn her arms. Stray cats prowled through the classrooms, lunging\nAt mice. Miss Fife dreamed that the school was a huge ship\nFloating away from land, all hands lost, steered by a ghost\nA woman whose face was the Head\u2019s, was Miss Nadimbaba\u2019s\nThen Mrs Mackay\u2019s, Mrs Lee\u2019s, Miss Feaver\u2019s, Miss Dunn\u2019s\nMrs Munro\u2019s, Mrs Kaye\u2019s, Miss Aherne\u2019s, Se\u00f1ora Devizes\u2019\nShe woke in the darkness, a face over hers, a warm mouth\nKissing the gibberish from her lips. The school sank in her mind\nA black wave taking it down as she gazed at the woman\u2019s face\n\nMiss Nadimbaba put down her pen and read through her poem\nThe palms of her hands felt light, that talented ache\nShe altered a verb and the line jumped on the page like a hooked fish. She needed\nTo type it up, but the poem was done. She was dying\nTo read it aloud to her aunt. She would open some wine\nIn the hospital, a nurse brought warm milk and a pill to the Head\nWho stared through the bars at the blackened hulk of the school\nBy dawn, at John O\u2019Groats, Mrs Mackay had finally run out of land\nShe wrote her maiden name with a stick in the sand then walked\nInto the sea, steady at first, step by step, till the firm waves lifted her\nUnder the arms and danced her away like a groom with a bride\nHigh above in the cold sky the seagulls, like schoolgirls, laughed\nHigher again, a teacher fell through the clouds with a girl in her armsEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/439815", "artist_names": "Chuck Berry", "full_title": "Dear Dad by\u00a0Chuck\u00a0Berry", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3eedb66df77d18a33df18d67152a23de.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3eedb66df77d18a33df18d67152a23de.1000x1000x1.jpg", "id": 439815, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 3492882, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1579758464, "path": "/Chuck-berry-dear-dad-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Chuck-berry-dear-dad-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1965, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1965", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1965", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/3eedb66df77d18a33df18d67152a23de.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/3eedb66df77d18a33df18d67152a23de.1000x1000x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Dear Dad", "title_with_featured": "Dear Dad", "updated_by_human_at": 1579758464, "url": "https://genius.com/Chuck-berry-dear-dad-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/19340", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/f21824f0b94d37c44b387118d337bf43.640x421x1.jpg", "id": 19340, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/af5bfacf7d280d1d9805c1bfbcf86d21.560x560x1.jpg", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Chuck Berry", "slug": "Chuck-berry", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Chuck-berry"}, "artist": "Chuck Berry", "lyrics": "Dear Dad Lyrics[Verse 1]\nDear Dad, don't get mad, what I'm asking for\nIs by the next semester can I get another car?\nThis one here is sickning on a wide dual road\nI might as well be walking as to drive this old Ford\nAlmost every time I try to go and pass a truck\nIf I ain't going downhill, Dad, I'm, out of luck\nAnd even if I get by it's still a rugged risk\nThe way this old Ford keep a hitting and a miss\n\n[Verse 2]\nLast week when I was driving on my way to school\nI almost got a ticket about a freeway traffic rule\nIt's now a violation driving under forty-five\nAnd if I push to fifty this here Ford will nosedive\nDad, I'm in great danger out here trying to drive\nThe way this Ford wiggles when I'm approaching forty-five\nI have to nurse it along like a little stubborn pup\nAnd cars whizzing by me, Dad, look like I'm backing up\n[Verse 3]\nShe just don't have the appetite for gas somehow\nAnd Dad, I got four carburetors hooked up on it now\nI tried to hook another to see if it'd do a little good\nBut isn't no place to put it unless I perforate the hood\nSo Dad, send the money, see what I can see\nTry to find a Cadillac, a sixty-two or three\nJust something that won't worry us to keep it on the road\nSincerely, your beloved son, Henry Junior FordYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/188205", "artist_names": "Richard F.

Burton", "lyrics": "Arabian Nights, Vol. 3 (Chap. 13) LyricsTale Of Kamar Al Zaman\n\nThat there was in times of yore and in ages long gone before a King called Shahrim\u00e1n,[FN#220] who was lord of many troops and guards, and officers, and who reigned over certain islands, known as the Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1n Islands,[FN#221] on the borders of the land of the Persians. But he was stricken in years and his bones were wasted, without having been blessed with a son, albeit he had four wives, daughters of Kings, and threescore concubines, with each of whom he was wont to lie one night in turn.[FN#222] This preyed upon his mind and disquieted him, so that he complained thereof to one of his Wazirs, saying, \"Verily I fear lest my kingdom be lost when I die, for that I have no son to succeed me.\" The Minister answered, \"O King, peradventure Allah shall yet bring something to pass; so rely upon the Almighty and be instant in prayer. It is also my counsel that thou spread a banquet and invite to it the poor and needy, and let them eat of thy food; and supplicate the Lord to vouchsafe thee a son; for perchance there may be among thy guests a righteous soul whose prayers find acceptance; and thereby thou shalt win thy wish.\" So the King rose, made the lesser ablution, and prayed a two-bow prayer,[FN#223] then he cried upon Allah with pure intention; after which he called his chief wife to bed and lay with her forthright. By grace of God she conceived and, when her months were accomplished, she bore a male child, like the moon on the night of fulness. The King named him Kamar al-Zam\u00e1n,[FN#224] and rejoiced in him with extreme joy and bade the city be dressed out in his honour; so they decorated the streets seven days, whilst the drums beat and the messengers bore the glad tidings abroad. Then wet and dry nurses were provided for the boy and he was reared in splendour and delight, until he reached the age of fifteen. He grew up of surpassing beauty and seemlihead and symmetry, and his father loved him so dear that he could not brook to be parted from him day or night. One day he complained to a certain of his Ministers anent the excess of his love for his only child, saying, \"O thou the Wazir, of a truth I fear for my son, Kamar al-Zaman, the shifts and accidents which befal man and fain would I marry him in my life-time.\" Answered the Wazir, \"O King, know thou that marriage is one of the most honourable of moral actions, and thou wouldst indeed do well and right to marry thy son in thy lifetime, ere thou make him Sultan.\" On this quoth the King, \"Hither with my son Kamar al-Zaman;\" so he came and bowed his head to the ground in modesty before his sire. \"O Kamar al Zaman,\" said King Shahriman, \"of a truth I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee during my lifetime.\" Replied he, \"O my father, know that I have no lust to marry nor cloth my soul incline to women; for that concerning their craft and perfidy I have read many books and heard much talk, even as saith the poet,\n\n'Now, an of women ask ye, I reply:\u2014*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In their affairs I'm versed a doctor rare!\nWhen man's head grizzles and his money dwindles, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In their affections he hath naught for share.'\n\nAnd another said:\u2014\n'Rebel against women and so shalt thou serve Allah the more; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The youth who gives women the rein must forfeit all hope to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     soar.\nThey'll baulk him when seeking the strange device, Excelsior, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tho' waste he a thousand of years in the study of science\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     and lore.' \"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verses he continued, \"O my father, wedlock is a thing whereto I will never consent; no, not though I drink the cup of death.\" When Sultan Shahriman heard these words from his son, light became darkness in his sight and he grieved thereat with great grief.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman heard these words from his son, the light became darkness in his sight and he grieved over his son's lack of obedience to his directions in the matter of marriage; yet, for the great love he bore him, he was unwilling to repeat his wishes and was not wroth with him, but caressed him and spake him fair and showed him all manner of kindness such as tendeth to induce affection. All this, and Kamar al-Zaman increased daily in beauty and loveliness and amorous grace; and the King bore with him for a whole year till he became perfect in eloquence and elegant wit. All men were ravished with his charms; and every breeze that blew bore the tidings of his gracious favour; his fair sight was a seduction to the loving and a garden of delight to the longing, for he was honey-sweet of speech and the sheen of his face shamed the full moon; he was a model of symmetry and blandishment and engaging ways; his shape was as the willow-wand or the rattan- cane and his cheeks might take the place of rose or red anemone. He was, in fine the pink of perfection, even as the poet hath said of him,\n\n\"He came and cried they, 'Now be Allah blest! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Praise Him that clad that soul in so fair vest!'\nHe's King of Beauty where the beauteous be; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     All are his Ryots,[FN#225] all obey his hest:\nHis lip-dew's sweeter than the virgin honey; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His teeth are pearls in double row close press:\nAll charms are congregate in him alone, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And deals his loveliness to man unrest.\nBeauty wrote on those cheeks for worlds to see *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'I testify there is none good but He.'\"[FN#226]\n\nWhen the year came to an end, the King called his son to him and said, \"O my son, wilt thou not hearken to me?\" Whereupon Kamar al-Zaman fell down for respect and shame before his sire and replied, \"O my father, how should I not hearken to thee, seeing that Allah commandeth me to obey thee and not gain-say thee?\" Rejoined King Shahriman, \"O my son, know that I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee whilst yet I live, and make thee King over my realm, before my death.\" When the Prince heard his sire pronounce these words he bowed his head awhile, then raised it and said, \"O my father, this is a thing which I will never do; no, not though I drink the cup of death! I know of a surety that the Almighty hath made obedience to thee a duty in religion; but, Allah upon thee! press me not in this matter of marriage, nor fancy that I will ever marry my life long; for that I have read the books both of the ancients and the moderns, and have come to know all the mischiefs and miseries which have befallen them through women and their endless artifices. And how excellent is the saying of the poet,\n'He whom the randy motts entrap *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall never see deliverance!\nThough build he forts a thousand-fold, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose mighty strength lead-plates enhance,[FN#227]\nTheir force shall be of no avail; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     These fortresses have not a chance!\nWomen aye deal in treachery *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To far and near o'er earth's expanse\nWith fingers dipt in Henna-blood *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And locks in braids that mad the glance;\nAnd eyelids painted o'er with Kohl *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  They gar us drink of dire mischance.'\n\nAnd how excellently saith another,\n\n'Women, for all the chastity they claim, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Are offal cast by kites where'er they list:\nThis night their talk and secret charms are shine, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That night another joyeth calf and wrist:\nLike inn, whence after night thou far'st at dawn, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lodges other wight thou hast not wist.'\"[FN#228]\n\nNow when King Shahriman heard these his son's words and learnt the import of his verses and poetical quotations, he made no answer, of his excessive love for him, but redoubled in graciousness and kindness to him. He at once broke up the audience and, as soon as the seance was over, he summoned his Minister and taking him apart, said to him, \"O thou the Wazir! tell me how I shall deal with my son in the matter of marriage.\"- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted stay.\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King summoned his Minister; and, taking him apart, said to him, \"O thou the Wazir, tell me what I shall do with my son in the matter of marriage. Of a truth I took counsel with thee thereon and thou didst counsel me to marry him, before making him King. I have spoken with him of wedlock time after time and he still gainsaid me; so do thou, O Wazir, forthright advise me what to do.\" Answered the Minister, \"O King, wait another year and, if after that thou be minded to speak to him on the matter of marriage, speak not to him privily, but address him on a day of state, when all the Emirs and Wazirs are present with the whole of the army standing before thee. And when all are in crowd then send for thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and summon him; and, when he cometh, broach to him the matter of marriage before the Wazirs and Grandees and Officers of state and Captains; for he will surely be bashful and daunted by their presence and will not dare to oppose thy will.\" Now when King Shahriman heard his Wazir's words, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, seeing success in the project, and bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour. Then he took patience with his son another year, whilst, with every day that passed over him, Kamar al-Zaman increased in beauty and loveliness, and elegance and perfect grace, till he was nigh twenty years old. Indeed Allah had clad him in the cloak of comeliness and had crowned him with the crown of completion: his eye-glance was more bewitching than H\u00e1r\u00fat and Mar\u00fat[FN#229] and the play of his luring looks more misleading than T\u00e1gh\u00fat;[FN#230] and his cheeks shone like the dawn rosy-red and his eyelashes stormed the keen-edged blade: the whiteness of his brow resembled the moon shining bright, and the blackness of his locks was as the murky night; and his waist was more slender than the gossamer[FN#231] and his back parts than two sand heaps bulkier, making a Babel of the heart with their softness; but his waist complained of the weight of his hips and loins; and his charms ravished all mankind, even as one of the poets saith in these couplets,\n\"By his eyelash tendril curled, by his slender waist I swear,\nBy the dart his witchery feathers, fatal hurtling through the\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   air;\nBy the just roundness of his shape, by his glances bright and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   keen\nBy the swart limping of his locks, and his fair forehead shining\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sheen;\nBy his eyebrows which deny that she who looks on them should\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    sleep,\nWhich now commanding, now forbidding, o'er me high dominion keep;\nBy the roses of his cheek, his face as fresh as myrtle wreath\nHis tulip lips, and those pure pearls that hold the places of his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     teeth;\nBy his noble form, which rises featly turned in even swell\nTo where upon his jutting chest two young pomegranates seem to\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   dwell\nBy his supple moving hips, his taper waist, the silky skin,\nBy all he robbed Perfection of, and holds enchained his form\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     within;\nBy his tongue of steadfastness, his nature true, and excellent,\nBy the greatness of his rank, his noble birth, and high descent,\nMusk from my love her savour steals, who musk exhales from every\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     limb\nAnd all the airs ambergris breathes are but the Zephyr's blow\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     o'er him.\nThe sun, methinks, the broad bright sun, as low before my love\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     should quail\nAs would my love himself transcend the paltry paring of his\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     nail!\"[FN#232]\nSo King Shahriman, having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shahriman having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year and a great festival, a day of state when the audience hall was filled with his Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of his reign and Officers of State and Captains of might and main. Thereupon he sent for his son Kamar al-Zaman who came, and kissing the ground before him three times, stood in presence of his sire with his hands behind his back the right grasping the left.[FN#233] Then said the King to him, \"Know O my son, that I have not sent for thee on this occasion and summoned thee to appear before this assembly and all these officers of estate here awaiting our orders save and except that I may lay a commandment on thee, wherein do thou not disobey me; and my commandment is that thou marry, for I am minded to wed thee to a King's daughter and rejoice in thee ere I die.\" When the Prince heard this much from his royal sire, he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then raising it towards his father and being moved thereto at that time by youthful folly and boyish ignorance, replied, \"But for myself I will never marry; no, not though I drink the cup of death! As for thee, thou art great in age and small of wit: hast thou not, twice ere this day and before this occasion, questioned me of the matter of marriage and I refused my consent? Indeed thou dotest and are not fit to govern a flock of sheep!\" So saying Kamar al-Zaman unclasped his hands from behind his back and tucked up his sleeves above his elbows before his father, being in a fit of fury; moreover, he added many words to his sire, knowing not what he said in the trouble of his spirits. The King was confounded and ashamed, for that this befel in the presence of his grandees and soldier-officers assembled on a high festival and a state occasion; but presently the majesty of Kingship took him, and he cried out at his son and made him tremble. Then he called to the guards standing before him and said, \"Seize him!' So they came forward and laid hands on him and, binding him, brought him before his sire, who bade them pinion his elbows behind his back and in this guise make him stand before the presence. And the Prince bowed down his head for fear and apprehension, and his brow and face were beaded and spangled with sweat; and shame and confusion troubled him sorely. Thereupon his father abused him and reviled him and cried, \"Woe to thee, thou son of adultery and nursling of abomination![FN#234] How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman cried out to his son Kamar al-Zaman, \"How durst thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised thee. Knowest thou not that this deed thou hast done were a disgrace to him had it been done by the meanest of my subjects?\" And the King commanded his Mamelukes to loose his elbow bonds and imprison him in one of the bastions of the citadel. So they took the Prince and thrust him into an old tower, wherein there was a dilapidated saloon and in its middle a ruined well, after having first swept it and cleansed its floor-flags and set therein a couch on which they laid a mattress, a leathern rug and a cushion; and then they brought a great lanthorn and a wax candle, for that place was dark, even by day. And lastly the Mamelukes led Kamar al-Zaman thither, and stationed an eunuch at the door. And when all this was done, the Prince threw himself on the couch, sad-spirited, and heavy- hearted; blaming himself and repenting of his injurious conduct to his father, whenas repentance availed him naught, and saying, \"Allah curse marriage and marriageable and married women, the traitresses all! Would I had hearkened to my father and accepted a wife! Had I so done it had been better for me than this jail.\" This is how it fared with him; but as regards King Shahri man, he remained seated on his throne all through the day until sundown; then he took the Minister apart and said to him \"Know thou, O Wazir, that thou and thou only west the cause of all this that hath come to pass between me and my son by the advice thou west pleased to devise; and so what dost thou counsel me to do now?\" Answered he, \"O King, leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days: then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, said to King Shahriman, \"Leave thy son in limbo for the space of fifteen days; then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again.\" The King accepted the Wazir's opinion and lay down to sleep that night troubled at heart concerning his son; for he loved him with dearest love because he had no other child but this; and it was his wont every night not to sleep, save after placing his arm under his son's neck. So he passed that night in trouble and unease on the Prince 's account, tossing from side to side, as he were laid on coals of Artemisia-wood[FN#235]: for he was overcome with doubts and fears and sleep visited him not all that livelong night; but his eyes ran over with tears and he began repeating, ;\n\n\"While slanderers slumber, longsome is my night; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Suffice thee a heart so sad in parting-plight;\nI say, while night in care slow moments by, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'What! no return for thee, fair morning light?'\"\n\nAnd the saying of another,\n\n\"When saw I Pleiad-stars his glance escape *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And Pole star draught of sleep upon him pour;\nAnd the Bier-daughters[FN#236] wend in mourning dight, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I knew that morning was for him no more!\"\n\nSuch was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, when the night came upon him the eunuch set the lanthorn before him and lighting the wax-candle, placed it in the candlestick; then brought him somewhat of food. The Prince ate a little and continually reproached himself for his unseemly treatment of his father, saying to himself, \"O my soul, knowest thou not that a son of Adam is the hostage of his tongue, and that a man's tongue is what casteth him into deadly perils?\" Then his eyes ran over with tears and he bewailed that which he had done, from anguished vitals and aching heart, repenting him with exceeding repentance of the wrong wherewith he had wronged his father and repeating,\n\n\"Fair youth shall die by stumbling of the tongue: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Stumble of foot works not man's life such wrong:\nThe slip of lip shall oft smite off the head, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     While slip of foot shall never harm one long.\"\n\nNow when he had made an end of eating, he asked for the wherewithal to wash his hands and when the Mameluke had washed them clean of the remnants of food, he arose and made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the prayers of sundown and nightfall, conjoining them in one; after which he sat down.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Prince Kamar al-Zaman had prayed (conjoining them in one) the prayers of sundown and nightfall, he sat down on the well and began reciting the Koran, and he repeated \"The Cow,\" the \"House of Imr\u00e1n,\" and \"Y. S.;\" \"The Compassionate,\" \"Blessed be the King,\" \"Unity\" and \"The two Talismans''[FN#237]; and he ended with blessing and supplication and with saying, \"I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned.\"[FN#238] Then he lay down upon his couch which was covered with a mattress of satin from al- Ma'adin town, the same on both sides and stuffed with the raw silk of Irak; and under his head was a pillow filled with ostrich-down And when ready for sleep, he doffed his outer clothes and drew off his bag-trousers and lay down in a shirt of delicate stuff smooth as wax; and he donned a head-kerchief of azure Mar\u00e1zi[FN#239] cloth; and at such time and on this guise Kamar al-Zaman was like the full-orbed moon, when it riseth on its fourteenth night. Then, drawing over his head a coverlet of silk, he fell asleep with the lanthorn burning at his feet and the wax-candle over his head, and he ceased not sleeping through the first third of the night, not knowing what lurked for him in the womb of the Future, and what the Omniscient had decreed for him. Now, as Fate and Fortune would have it, both tower and saloon were old and had been many years deserted; and there was therein a Roman well inhabited by a Jinniyah of the seed of Iblis[FN#240] the Accursed, by name Maym\u00fanah, daughter of Al- Dimiry\u00e1t, a renowned King of the J\u00e1nn.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the name of the Jinniyah in question was Maymunah, daughter of Al-Dimiryat; a renowned King of the Jann. And as Kamar al-Zaman continued sleeping till the first third of the night, Maymunah came up out of the Roman well and made for the firmament, thinking to listen by stealth to the converse of the angels; but when she reached the mouth of the well, she saw a light shining in the tower, contrary to custom; and having dwelt there many years without seeing the like, she said to herself, \"Never have I witnessed aught like this\"; and, marvelling much at the matter, determined that there must be some cause therefor. So she made for the light and found the eunuch sleeping within the door; and inside she saw a couch spread, whereon was a human form with the wax-candle burning at his head and the lanthorn at his feet, and she wondered to see the light and stole towards it little by little. Then she folded her wings and stood by the bed and, drawing back the coverlid, discovered Kamar al-Zaman's face. She was motionless for a full hour in admiration and wonderment; for the lustre of his visage outshone that of the candle; his face beamed like a pearl with light; his eyelids were languorous like those of the gazelle; the pupils of his eyes were intensely black and brilliant[FN#241]; his cheeks were rosy red; his eye-brows were arched like bows and his breath exhaled a scent of musk, even as saith of him the poet,\n\n\"I kissed him: darker grew those pupils,[FN#242] which *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Seduce my soul, and cheeks flushed rosier hue;\nO heart, if slanderers dare to deem there be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His like in chasms, Say 'Bring him hither, you!' \"\n\nNow when Maymunah saw him, she pronounced the formula of praise,[FN#243] and said, \"Blessed be Allah, the best of Creators!\"; for she was of the true-believing Jinn; and she stood awhile gazing on his face, exclaiming and envying the youth his beauty and loveliness. And she said in herself, \"By Allah! I will do no hurt to him nor let any harm him; nay, from all of evil will I ransom him, for this fair face deserveth not but that folk should gaze upon it and for it praise the Lord. Yet how could his family find it in their hearts to leave him in such desert place where, if one of our M\u00e1rids came upon him at this hour, he would assuredly slay him.\" Then the Ifritah Maymunah bent over him and kissed him between the eyes, and presently drew back the sheet over his face which she covered up; and after this she spread her wings and soaring into the air, flew upwards. And after rising high from the circle of the saloon she ceased not winging her way through air and ascending skywards till she drew near the heaven of this world, the lowest of the heavens. And behold, she heard the noisy flapping of wings cleaving the welkin and, directing herself by the sound, she found when she drew near it that the noise came from an Ifrit called Dahnash. So she swooped down on him like a sparrow-hawk and, when he was aware of her and knew her to be Maymunah, the daughter of the King of the Jinn, he feared her and his side-muscles quivered; and he implored her forbearance, saying, I conjure thee by the Most Great and August Name and by the most noble talisman graven upon the seal-ring of Solomon, entreat me kindly and harm me not!\" When she heard these words her heart inclined to him and she said, \"Verily, thou conjurest me, O accursed, with a mighty conjuration. Nevertheless, I will not let thee go, till thou tell me whence thou comest at this hour.\" He replied, \"O Princess, Know that I come from the uttermost end of China-land and from among the Islands, and I will tell thee of a wonderful thing I have seen this night. If thou kind my words true, let me wend my way and write me a patent under thy hand and with thy sign manual that I am thy freedman, so none of the Jinn-hosts, whether of the upper who fly or of the lower who walk the earth or of those who dive beneath the waters, do me let or hindrance.\" Rejoined Maymunah, \"And what is it thou hast seen this night, O liar, O accursed! Tell me without leasing and think not to escape from my hand with falses, for I swear to thee by the letters graven upon the bezel of the seal-ring of Solomon David son (on both of whom be peace!), except thy speech be true, I will pluck out thy feathers with mine own hand and strip off thy skin and break thy bones!\" Quoth the Ifrit Dahnash son of Shamh\u00farish[FN#244] the Flyer, \"I accept, O my lady, these conditions.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-eight Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash spoke thus to Maymunah, \"I accept, O my lady, these conditions.\" Then he resumed, \"Know, O my mistress, that I come to-night from the Islands of the Inland Sea in the parts of China, which are the realms of King Ghay\u00far, lord of the Islands and the Seas and the Seven Palaces. There I saw a daughter of his, than whom Allah hath made none fairer in her time: I cannot picture her to thee, for my tongue would fail to describe her with her due of praise; but I will name to thee a somewhat of her charms by way of approach. Now her hair is like the nights of disunion and separation and her face like the days of union and delectation; and right well hath the poet said when picturing her,\n\n'She dispread the locks from her head one night, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Showing four fold nights into one night run\nAnd she turned her visage towards the moon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And two moons showed at moment one.'\n\nShe hath a nose like the edge of the burnished blade and cheeks like purple wine or anemones blood-red: her lips as coral and carnelian shine and the water of her mouth is sweeter than old wine; its taste would quench Hell's fiery pain. Her tongue is moved by wit of high degree and ready repartee: her breast is a seduction to all that see it (glory be to Him who fashioned it and finished it!); and joined thereto are two upper arms smooth and rounded; even as saith of her the poet Al-Walah\u00e1n,[FN#245]\n\n'She hath wrists which, did her bangles not contain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would run from out her sleeves in silvern rain.'\n\nShe hath breasts like two globes of ivory, from whose brightness the moons borrow light, and a stomach with little waves as it were a figured cloth of the finest Egyptian linen made by the Copts, with creases like folded scrolls, ending in a waist slender past all power of imagination; based upon back parts like a hillock of blown sand, that force her to sit when she would fief stand, and awaken her, when she fain would sleep, even as saith of her and describeth her the poet,\n\n\n'She hath those hips conjoined by thread of waist, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Hips that o'er me and her too tyrannise\nMy thoughts they daze whene'er I think of them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And weigh her down whene'er she would uprise.'[FN#246]\n\nAnd those back parts are upborne by thighs smooth and round and by a calf like a column of pearl, and all this reposeth upon two feet, narrow, slender and pointed like spear-blades,[FN#247] the handiwork of the Protector and Requiter, I wonder how, of their littleness, they can sustain what is above them. But I cut short my praises of her charms fearing lest I be tedious.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash bin Shamhurish said to the Ifritah Maymunah, \"Of a truth I cut short my praises fearing lest I be tedious.\" Now when Maymunah heard the description of that Princess and her beauty and loveliness, she stood silent in astonishment; whereupon Dahnash resumed, \"The father of this fair maiden is a mighty King, a fierce knight, immersed night and day in fray and fight; for whom death hath no fright and the escape of his foe no dread, for that he is a tyrant masterful and a conqueror irresistible, lord of troops and armies and continents and islands, and cities and villages, and his name is King Ghayur, Lord of the Islands and of the Seas and of the Seven Palaces. Now he loveth his daughter, the young maiden whom I have described to thee, with dearest love and, for affection of her, he hath heaped together the treasures of all the kings and built her therewith seven palaces, each of a different fashion; the first of crystal, the second of marble, the third of China steel, the fourth of precious stones and gems of price, the fifth of porcelain and many-hued onyxes and ring bezels, the sixth of silver and the seventh of gold. And he hath filled the seven palaces with all sorts of sumptuous furniture, rich silken carpets and hangings and vessels of gold and silver and all manner of gear that kings require; and hath bidden his daughter to abide in each by turns for a certain season of the year; and her name is the Princess Budur.[FN#248] Now when her beauty became known and her name and fame were bruited abroad in the neighbouring countries, all the kings sent to her father to demand her of him in marriage, and he consulted her on the matter, but she disliked the very word wedlock with a manner of abhorrence and said, O my father, I have no mind to marry; no, not at all; for I am a sovereign Lady and a Queen suzerain ruling over men, and I have no desire for a man who shall rule over me. And the more suits she refused, the more her suitors' eagerness increased and all the Royalties of the Inner Islands of China sent presents and rarities to her father with letters asking her in marriage. So he pressed her again and again with advice on the matter of espousals; but she ever opposed to him refusals, till at last she turned upon him angrily and cried, 'O my father, if thou name matrimony to me once more, I will go into my chamber and take a sword and, fixing its hilt in the ground, will set its point to my waist; then will I press upon it, till it come forth from my back, and so slay myself.' Now when the King heard these her words, the light became darkness in his sight and his heart burned for her as with a flame of fire, because he feared lest she should kill herself; and he was filled with perplexity concerning her affair and the kings her suitors. So he said to her 'If thou be determined not to marry and there be no help for it abstain from going and coming in and out.' Then he placed her in a house and shut her up in a chamber, appointing ten old women as duennas to guard her, and forbade her to go forth to the Seven Palaces; moreover, he made it appear that he was incensed against her, and sent letters to all the kings, giving them to know that she had been stricken with madness by the Jinns; and it is now a year since she hath thus been secluded.\" Then continued the Ifrit Dahnash, addressing the Ifritah Maymunah, \"And I, O my lady go to her every night and take my fill of feeding my sight on her face and I kiss her between the eyes: yet, of my love to her, I do her no hurt neither mount her, for that her youth is fair and her grace surpassing: every one who seeth her jealouseth himself for her. I conjure thee, therefore, O my lady, to go back with me and look on her beauty and loveliness and stature and perfection of proportion; and after, if thou wilt, chastise me or enslave me; and win to thy will, for it is shine to bid and to forbid.\" So saying, the Ifrit Dahnash bowed his head towards the earth and drooped his wings downward; but Maymunah laughed at his words and spat in his face and answered, \"What is this girl of whom thou pratest but a potsherd wherewith to wipe after making water?[FN#249] Faugh! Faugh! By Allah, O accursed, I thought thou hadst some wondrous tale to tell me or some marvellous news to give me. How would it be if thou were to sight my beloved? Verily, this night I have seen a young man, whom if thou saw though but in a dream, thou wouldst be palsied with admiration and spittle would flow from thy mouth.\" Asked the Ifrit, \"And who and what is this youth?\"; and she answered, \"Know, O Dahnash, that there hath befallen the young man the like of what thou tellest me befel thy mistress; for his father pressed him again and again to marry, but he refused, till at length his sire waxed wroth at being opposed and imprisoned him in the tower where I dwell: and I came up to-night and saw him.\" Said Dahnash, \"O my lady, shew me this youth, that I may see if he be indeed handsomer than my mistress, the Princess Budur, or not; for I cannot believe that the like of her liveth in this our age.\" Rejoined Maymunah, \"Thou liest, O accursed, O most ill-omened of Marids and vilest of Satans![FN#250] Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen It was the One Hundred and Eightieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifritah Maymunah spake thus to the Ifrit Dahnash, \"Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this world! Art thou mad to fellow thy beloved with my beloved?\" He said, \"Allah upon thee, O my lady, go back with me and look upon my mistress, and after I will with thee and look upon thy beloved.\" She answered, \"It must needs be so, O accursed, for thou art a knavish devil; but I will not go with thee nor shalt thou come with me, save upon condition of a wager which is this. If the lover thou lovest and of whom thou boastest so bravely, prove handsomer than mine whom I mentioned and whom I love and of whom I boast, the bet shall be shine against me; but if my beloved prove the handsomer the bet shall be mine against thee.\" Quoth Dahnash the Ifrit, \"O my lady, I accept this thy wager and am satisfied thereat; so come with me to the Islands.\" Quoth Maymunah; \"No! for the abode of my beloved is nearer than the abode of shine: here it is under us; so come down with me to see my beloved and after we will go look upon thy mistress.\" \"I hear and I obey,\" said Dahnash. So they descended to earth and alighted in the saloon which the tower contained; then Maymunah stationed Dahnash beside the bed and, putting out her hand, drew back the silken coverlet from Kamar al-Zaman's face, when it glittered and glistened and shimmered and shone like the rising sun. She gazed at him for a moment, then turning sharply round upon Dahnash said, \"Look, O accursed, and be not the basest of madmen; I am a maid, yet my heart he hath waylaid.\" So Dahnash looked at the Prince and long continued gazing steadfastly on him then, shaking his head, said to Maymunah, \"By Allah, O my lady, thou art excusable; but there is yet another thing to be considered, and this is, that the estate female differeth from the male. By Allah's might, this thy beloved is the likest of all created things to my mistress in beauty and loveliness and grace and perfection; and it is as though they were both cast alike in the mould of seemlihead.\" Now when Maymunah heard these words, the light became darkness in her sight and she dealt him with her wing so fierce a buffet on the head as well-nigh made an end of him. Then quoth she to him, \"I conjure thee, by the light of his glorious countenance, go at once, O accursed, and bring hither thy mistress whom thou lovest so fondly and foolishly, and return in haste that we may lay the twain together and look on them both as they lie asleep side by side; so shall it appear to us which be the goodlier and more beautiful of the two. Except thou obey me this very moment, O accursed, I will dart my sparks at thee with my fire and consume thee; yea, in pieces I will rend thee and into the deserts cast thee, that to stay at home and wayfarer an example thou be!\" Quoth Dahnash, \"O my lady, I will do thy behests, for I know forsure that my mistress is the fairer and the sweeter.\" So saying the If rit flew away and Maymunah flew with him to guard him. They were absent awhile and presently returned, bearing the young lady, who was clad in a shift of fine Venetian silk, with a double edging of gold and purfled with the most exquisite of embroidery having these couplets worked upon the ends of the sleeves,\n\n\"Three matters hinder her from visiting us, in fear *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Of hate-full, slandering envier and his hired spies:\nThe shining light of brow, the trinkets' tinkling voice, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And scent of essences that tell whene'er she tries:\nGi'en that she hide her brow with edge of sleeve, and leave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     At home her trinketry, how shall her scent\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     disguise?''[FN#251]\n\nAnd Dahnash and Maymunah stinted not bearing that young lady till they had carried her into the saloon and had laid her beside the youth Kamar al-Zaman.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit Dahnash and the Ifritah Maymunah stinted not bearing Princess Budur till they descended and laid her on the couch beside Kamar al- Zaman. Then they uncovered both their faces, and they were the likest of all folk, each to other, as they were twins or an only brother and sister; and indeed they were a seduction to the pious, even as saith of them the poet Al-Mub\u00edn,\n\n\"O heart! be not thy love confined to one, *\nLest thou by doting or disdain be undone:\nLove all the fair, and thou shalt find with them *\nIf this be lost, to thee that shall be won.\"\n\nAnd quoth another,\n\n\"Mine eyes beheld two lying on the ground; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Both had I loved if on these eyne they lay!\"\n\nSo Dahnash and Maymunah gazed on them awhile, and he said, \"By Allah, O my lady, it is good! My mistress is assuredly the fairer.\" She replied, \"Not so, my beloved is the fairer; woe to thee, O Dahnash! Art blind of eye and heart that lean from fat thou canst not depart? Wilt thou hide the truth? Dost thou not see his beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetry? Out on thee, hear what I purpose to say in praise of my beloved and, if thou be a lover true to her thou dost love, do thou the like for her thou Lovest.\" Then she kissed Kamar al-Zaman again and again between the eyes and improvised this ode,\n\n\"How is this? Why should the blamer abuse thee in his pride?\nWhat shall console my heart for thee, that art but slender bough?\n\nA Nature Kohl'd[FN#252] eye thou hast that witcheth far and wide;\nFrom pure platonic love[FN#253] of it deliverance none I trow!\n\nThose glances, fell as plundering Turk, to heart such havoc deal\nAs never havocked scymitar made keenest at the curve.\n\nOn me thou layest load of love the heaviest while I feel\nSo feeble grown that under weight of chemisette I swerve.\n\nMy love for thee as wottest well is habit, and my lowe\nIs nature; to all others false is all the love I tender:\n\nNow were my heart but like to shine I never would say No;\nOnly my wasted form is like thy waist so gracious slender:\n\nOut on him who in Beauty's robe for moon like charms hath fame,\nAnd who is claimed by mouth of men as marvel of his tribe!\n\n'Of man what manner may he be' (ask they who flyte and blame)\n'For whom thy heart is so distressed?' I only cry 'Describe!'\n\nOh stone-entempered heart of him! learn of his yielding grace\nAnd bending form to show me grace and yielding to consent.\nOh my Prince Beautiful, thou hast an Overseer in place[FN#254]\nWho irketh me, and eke a Groom whose wrong cloth ne'er relent.\n\nIndeed he lieth who hath said that all of loveliness\nWas pent in Joseph: in thy charms there's many and many a Joe!\n\nThe Genii dread me when I stand and face to face address;\nBut meeting thee my fluttering heart its shame and terror show.\n\nI take aversion semblance and I turn from thee in fright,\nBut more aversion I assume, more love from me dost claim;\n\nThat hair of jetty black! That brow e'er raying radiant light! Those eyne wherein white jostles black![FN#255] That dearling dainty frame!\"\n\nWhen Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he joyed with exceeding joy and marvelled with excessive wonderment.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Ifrit Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise of her beloved, he shook for exceeding joy and said, \"Thou hast celebrated thy beloved in song and thou hast indeed done well in praise of him whom thou lovest! And there is no help for it but that I also in my turn do my best to enfame my mistress, and recite somewhat in her honour.\" Then the Ifrit went up to the Lady Budur; and' kissing her between the eyes, looked at Maymunah and at his beloved Princess and recited the following verses, albeit he had no skill in poesy,\n\n\"Love for my fair they chide in angry way; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unjust for ignorance, yea unjustest they!\nAh lavish favours on the love mad, whom *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Taste of thy wrath and parting woe shall slay:\nIn sooth for love I'm wet with railing tears, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That rail mine eyelids blood thou mightest say:\nNo marvel what I bear for love, 'tis marvel *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That any know my \"me\" while thou'rt away:\nUnlawful were our union did I doubt *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thy love, or heart incline to other May.\"\n\nAnd eke these words:\u2014\n\n\"I feed eyes on their stead by the valley's side, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And I'm slain and my slaver[FN#256] aside hath tried:\nGrief-wine have I drunken, and down my cheeks *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Dance tears to the song of the camel-guide:\nFor union-blessing I strive though sure, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In Budur and Su'ad all my bliss shall bide:[FN#257]\nWot I not which of three gave me most to 'plain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So hear them numbered ere thou decide:\nThose Sworders her eyne, that Lancer her fig- *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     -ure, or ring-mail'd Locks which her forehead hide.\nQuoth she (and I ask of her what so wights *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Or abide in towns or in desert ride[FN#258] )\nTo me, 'In thy heart I dwell, look there!' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Quoth I, 'Where's my heart ah where? ah where?'\"\n\nWhen Maymunah heard these lines from the Ifrit, she said, \"Thou hast done well, O Dahnash! But say thou which of the two is the handsomer?\" And he answered, \"My mistress Budur is handsomer than thy beloved!\" Cried Maymunah, \"Thou liest, O accursed. Nay, my beloved is more beautiful than shine!\" But Dahnash persisted, \"Mine is the fairer.\" And they ceased not to wrangle and challenge each other's words till Maymunah cried out at Dahnash and would have laid violent hands on him, but he humbled himself to her and, softening his speech, said, \"Let not the truth be a grief to thee, and cease we this talk, for all we say is to testify in favour of our lovers; rather let each of us withdraw the claim and seek we one who shall judge fairly between us which of the two be fairer; and by his sentence we will abide.\" \"I agree to this,\" answered she and smote the earth with her foot, whereupon there came out of it an Ifrit blind of an eye, humpbacked and scurvy-skinned, with eye-orbits slit up and down his face.[FN#259] On his head were seven horns and four locks of hair fell to his heels; his hands were pitchfork-like and his legs mast-like and he had nails as the claws of a lion, and feet as the hoofs of the wild ass.[FN#260] When that If rit rose out of the earth and sighted Maymunah, he kissed the ground before her and, standing with his hands clasped behind him, said, \"What is thy will, O my mistress, O daughter of my King?\"[FN#261] She replied, \"O Kashkash, I would have thee judge between me and this accursed Dahnash.\" And she made known to him the matter, from first to last, whereupon the Ifrit Kashkash looked at the face of the youth and then at the face of the girl; and saw them lying asleep, embraced, each with an arm under the other's neck, alike in beauty and loveliness and equal in grace and goodliness. The Marid gazed long upon them, marvelling at their seemlihead; and, after carefully observing the twain, he turned to Maymunah and Dahnash, and reseated these couplets.\n\n\"Go, visit her thou lovest, and regard not\nThe words detractors utter, envious churls\nCan never favour love. Oh! sure the Merciful\nNe'er made a thing more fair to look upon,\nThan two fond lovers in each others' arms,\nSpeaking their passion in a mute embrace.\nWhen heart has turned to heart, the fools would part them\nStrike idly on cold steel. So when thou'st found\nOne purely, wholly shine, accept her true heart,\nAnd live for her alone. Oh! thou that blamest\nThe love-struck for their love, give o'er thy talk,\nHow canst thou minister to a mind diseased?\"[FN#262]\n\nThen he turned again to Maymunah and Dahnash and said to them, \"By Allah, if you will have the truth, I tell you fairly the twain be equal in beauty, and loveliness and perfect grace and goodliness, nor can I make any difference between them on account of their being man and woman. But I have another thought which is that we wake each of them in turn, without the knowledge of the other, and whichever is the more enamoured shall be held inferior in seemlihead and comeliness.\" Quoth Maymunah, \"Right is this recking,\" and quoth Dahnash, \"I consent to this.\" Then Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman, whereupon he started from sleep in a fright.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-third Night,\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman who started from sleep in a fright and rubbed the bitten part, his neck, and scratched it hard because of the smart. Then turning sideways, he found lying by him something whose breath was sweeter than musk and whose skin was softer than cream. Hereat marvelled he with great marvel and he sat up and looked at what lay beside him; when he saw it to be a young lady like an union pearl, or a shining sun, or a dome seen from afar on a well built wall; for she was five feet tall, with a shape like the letter Alif[FN#263], bosomed high and rosy checked; even as saith of her the poet,\n\n\"Four things which ne'er conjoin, unless it be *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To storm my vitals and to shed my blood:\nBrow white as day and tresses black as night *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cheeks rosy red and lips which smiles o'erflood.\"\n\nAnd also quoth another,\n\n\"A Moon she rises, Willow wand she waves, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Breathes Ambergris, and gazes, a Gazelle:\nMeseems that sorrow woes my heart and wins *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And, when she wendeth hastes therein to dwell!\"\n\nAnd when Kamar al-Zaman saw the Lady Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, and her beauty and comeliness, she was sleeping clad in a shift of Venetian silk, without her petticoat-trousers, and wore on her head a kerchief embroidered with gold and set with stones of price: her ears were hung with twin earrings which shone like constellations and round her neck was a collar of union pearls, of size unique, past the competence of any King. When he saw this, his reason was confounded and natural heat began to stir in him; Allah awoke in him the desire of coition and he said to himself, \"Whatso Allah willeth, that shall be, and what He willeth not shall never be!\" So saying, he put out his hand and, turning her over, loosed the collar of her chemise; then arose before his sight her bosom, with its breasts like double globes of ivory; whereat his inclination for her redoubled and he desired her with exceeding hot desire, He would have awakened her but she would not awake, for Dahnash had made her sleep heavy; so he shook her and moved her, saying, \"O my beloved, awake and look on me; I am Kamar al-Zaman.\" But she awoke not, neither moved her head; where-upon he considered her case for a long hour and said to himself, \"If I guess aright, this is the damsel to whom my father would have married me and these three years past I have refused her; but Inshallah!\u2014God willing\u2014as soon as it is dawn, I will say to him, 'Marry me to her, that I may enjoy her.'\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to himself, \"By Allah, when I see dawn I will say to my sire, 'Marry me to her that I may enjoy her'; nor will I let half the day pass ere I possess her and take my fill of her beauty and loveliness.\" Then he bent over Budur to buss her, whereat the Jinniyah Maymunah trembled and was abashed and Dahnash, the Ifrit, was like to fly for joy. But, as Kamar al- Zaman was about to kiss her upon the mouth, he was ashamed before Allah and turned away his head and averted his face, saying to his heart, \"Have patience.\" Then he took thought awhile and said, \"I will be patient; haply my father when he was wroth with me and sent me to this jail, may have brought my young lady and made her lie by my side to try me with her, and may have charged her not to be readily awakened when I would arouse her, and may have said to her, 'Whatever thing Kamar al-Zaman do to thee, make me ware thereof'; or belike my sire standeth hidden in some stead whence (being himself unseen) he can see all I do with this young lady; and to morrow he will scold me and cry, 'How cometh it that thou sayest, I have no mind to marry; and yet thou didst kiss and embrace yonder damsel?' So I will withhold myself lest I be ashamed before my sire; and the right and proper thing to do is not to touch her at this present, nor even to look upon her, except to take from her somewhat which shall serve as a token to me and a memorial of her; that some sign endure between me and her.\" Then Kamar al-Zaman raised the young lady's hand and took from her little finger a seal-ring worth an immense amount of money, for that its bezel was a precious jewel and around it were graven these couplets,\n\n\"Count not that I your promises forgot, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Despite the length of your delinquencies\nBe generous, O my lord, to me inclining; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply your mouth and cheeks these lips may kiss:\nBy Allah, ne'er will I relinquish you *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Albe you will transgress love's boundaries.\"\n\nThen Kamar al-Zaman took the seal-ring from the little finger of Queen Budur and set it on his own; then, turning his back to her, went to sleep.[FN#264] When Maymunah the Jinniyah saw this, she was glad and said to Dahnash and Kashkash, \"Saw ye how my beloved Kamar al-Zaman bore himself chastely towards this young lady? Verily, this was of the perfection of his good gifts; for observe you twain how he looked on her and noted her beauty and loveliness, and yet embraced her not neither kissed her nor put his hand to her, but turned his back and slept.\" Answered they, \"Even so!\" Thereupon Maymunah changed herself into a flea and entering into the raiment of Budur, the loved of Dahnash, crept up her calf and came upon her thigh and, reaching a place some four carats[FN#265] below her navel, there bit her. Thereupon she opened her eyes and sitting up in bed, saw a youth lying beside her and breathing heavily in his sleep, the loveliest of Almighty Allah's creatures, with eyes that put to shame the fairest Houris of Heaven; and a mouth like Solomon's seal, whose water was sweeter to the taste and more efficacious than a theriack, and lips the colour of coral-stone, and cheeks like the blood red anemone, even as saith one, describing him in these couplets,\n\n\"My mind's withdrawn from Zaynab and Naw\u00e1r[FN#266] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     By rosy cheeks that growth of myrtle bear;\nI love a fawn, a tunic-vested boy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And leave the love of bracelet-wearing Fair:\nMy mate in hall and closet is unlike *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Her that I play with, as at home we pair.\nOh thou, who blam'st my flight from Hind and Zaynab, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The cause is clear as dawn uplighting air!\nWould'st have me fare[FN#267] a slave, the thrall of thrall, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cribbed, pent, confined behind the bar and wall?\"\n\nNow when Princess Budur saw him, she was seized by a transport of passion and yearning and love-longing,\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur saw Kamar al-Zaman she was forthwith seized with a transport of passion and yearning and love longing, and she said to herself, \"Alas, my shame! This is a strange youth and I know him not. How cometh he to be lying by my side on one bed?\" Then she looked at him a second time and, noting his beauty and loveliness, said, \"By Allah, he is indeed a comely youth and my heart[FN#268] is well-nigh torn in sunder with longing for him! But alas, how am I shamed by him! By the Almighty, had I known it was this youth who sought me in marriage of my father, I had not rejected him, but had wived with him and enjoyed his loveliness!\" Then she gazed in his face and said, \"O my lord and light of mine eyes, awake from sleep and take thy pleasure in my beauty and grace.\" And she moved him with her hand; but Maymunah the Jinniyah let down sleep upon him as it were a curtain, and pressed heavily on his head with her wings so that Kamar al-Zaman awoke not. Then Princess Budur shook him with her hands and said, \"My life on thee, hearken to me; awake and up from thy sleep and look on the narcissus and the tender down thereon, and enjoy the sight of naked waist and navel; and touzle me and tumble me from this moment till break of day! Allah upon thee, O my lord, sit up and prop thee against the pillow and slumber not!\" Still Kamar al-Zaman made her no reply but breathed hard in his sleep. Continued she, \"Alas! Alas! thou art insolent in thy beauty and comeliness and grace and loving looks! But if thou art handsome, so am I handsome; what then is this thou dost? Have they taught thee to flout me or hath my father, the wretched old fellow,[FN#269] made thee swear not to speak to me to-night?\" But Kamar al-Zaman opened not his mouth neither awoke, whereat her passion for him redoubled and Allah inflamed her heart with love of him. She stole one glance of eyes that cost her a thousand sighs: her heart fluttered, and her vitals throbbed and her hands and feet quivered; and she said to Kamar al-Zaman \"Talk to me, O my lord! Speak to me, O my friend! Answer me, O my beloved, and tell me thy name, for indeed thou hast ravished my wit!\" And during all this time he abode drowned in sleep and answered her not a word, and Princess Budur sighed and said, \"Alas! Alas! why art thou so proud and self satisfied?\" Then she shook him and turning his hand over, saw her seal-ring on his little finger, whereat she cried a loud cry, and followed it with a sigh of passion and said, \"Alack! Alack! By Allah, thou art my beloved and thou lovest me! Yet thou seemest to turn thee away from me out of coquetry, for all, O my darling, thou camest to me, whilst I was asleep and knew not what thou didst with me, and tookest my seal-ring; and yet I will not pull it off thy finger.\" So saying, she opened the bosom of his shirt and bent over him and kissed him and put forth her hand to him, seeking somewhat that she might take as a token, but found nothing. Then she thrust her hand into his breast and, because of the smoothness of his body, it slipped down to his waist and thence to his navel and thence to his yard, whereupon her heart ached and her vitals quivered and lust was sore upon her, for that the desire of women is fiercer than the desire of men,[FN#270] and she was ashamed of her own shamelessness. Then she plucked his seal-ring from his finger, and put it on her own instead of the ring he had taken, and bussed his inner lips and hands, nor did she leave any part of him unkissed; after which she took him to her breast and embraced him and, laying one of her hands under his neck and the other under his arm-pit, nestled close to him and fell asleep by his side.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Budur fell asleep by the side of Kamar al-Zaman, after doing that which she did, quoth Maymunah to Dahnash, Night thou, O accursed, how proudly and coquettishly my beloved bore himself, and how hotly and passionately thy mistress showed herself to my dearling? There can be no doubt that my beloved is handsomer than shine; nevertheless I pardon thee.\" Then she wrote him a document of manumission and turned to Kashkash and said, \"Go, help Dahnash to take up his mistress and aid him to carry her back to her own place, for the night waneth apace and there is but little left of it.\" \"I hear and I obey;\" answered Kashkash. So the two Ifrits went forward to Princess Budur and upraising her flew away with her; then, bearing her back to her own place, they laid her on her bed, whilst Maymunah abode alone with Kamar al-Zaman, gazing upon him as he slept, till the night was all but spent, when she went her way. As soon as morning morrowed, the Prince awoke from sleep and turned right and left, but found not the maiden by him and said in his mind, \"What is this business? It is as if my father would incline me to marriage with the damsel who was with me and have now taken her away by stealth, to the intent that my desire for wedlock may redouble.\" Then he called out to the eunuch who slept at the door, saying, \"Woe to thee, O damned one, arise at once!\" So the eunuch rose, bemused with sleep, and brought him basin and ewer, whereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered the water closet and did his need;[FN#271] then, coming out made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the dawn-prayer, after which he sat telling on his beads the ninety-and-nine names of Almighty Allah. Then he looked up and, seeing the eunuch standing in service upon him, said, \"Out on thee, O Saw\u00e1b! Who was it came hither and took away the young lady from my side and I still sleeping?\" Asked the eunuch, 'O my lord, what manner of young lady?\" \"The young lady who lay with me last night,\" replied Kamar al-Zaman. The eunuch was startled at his words and said to him, \"By Allah, there hath been with thee neither young lady nor other! How should young lady have come in to thee, when I was sleeping in the doorway and the door was locked? By Allah, O my lord, neither male nor female hath come in to thee!\" Exclaimed the Prince, \"Thou liest, O pestilent slave!: is it of thy competence also to hoodwink me and refuse to tell me what is become of the young lady who lay with me last night and decline to inform me who took her away?\" Replied the eunuch (and he was affrighted at him), \"By Allah, O my lord, I have seen neither young lady nor young lord!\" His words only angered Kamar al-Zaman the more and he said to him, \"O accursed one, my father hath indeed taught thee deceit! Come hither.\" So the eunuch came up to him, and the Prince took him by the collar and dashed him to the ground; whereupon he let fly a loud fart[FN#272] and Kamar al-Zaman, kneeling upon him, kicked him and throttled him till he fainted away. Then he dragged him forth and tied him to the well-rope, and let him down like a bucket into the well and plunged him into the water, then drew him up and lowered him down again. Now it was hard winter weather, and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not to plunge the eunuch into the water and pull him up again and douse him and haul him whilst he screamed and called for help; and the Prince kept on saying \"By Allah, O damned one, I will not draw thee up out of this well till thou tell me and fully acquaint me with the story of the young lady and who it was took her away, whilst I slept.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One and Eighty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to the eunuch, \"By Allah! I will not draw thee up out of this well until thou tell me the story of the young lady and who it was took her away whilst I slept.\" Answered the eunuch, after he had seen death staring him in the face; \"O my lord, let me go and I will relate to thee the truth and the whole tale.\" So Kamar al-Zaman pulled him up out of the well, all but dead for suffering, what with cold and the pain of dipping and dousing, drubbing and dread of drowning. He shook like cane in hurricane, his teeth were clenched as by cramp and his clothes were drenched and his body befouled and torn by the rough sides of the well: briefly he was in a sad pickle. Now when Kamar al-Zaman saw him in this sorry plight, he was concerned for him; but, as soon as the eunuch found himself on the floor, he said to him, \"O my lord, let me go and doff my clothes and wring them out and spread them in the sun to dry, and don others; after which I will return to thee forthwith and tell thee the truth of the matter.\" Answered the Prince, \"O rascal slave! hadst thou not seen death face to face, never hadst thou confessed to fact nor told me a word; but go now and do thy will, and then come back to me at once and tell me the truth.\" Thereupon the eunuch went out, hardly crediting his escape, and ceased not running, stumbling and rising in his haste, till he came in to King Shahriman, whom he found sitting at talk with his Wazir of Kamar al-Zaman's case. The King was saying to the Minister, \"I slept not last night, for anxiety concerning my son, Kamar al-Zaman and indeed I fear lest some harm befal him in that old tower. What good was there in imprisoning him?\" Answered the Wazir, \"Have no care for him. By Allah, no harm will befal him! None at all! Leave him in prison for a month till his temper yield and his spirit be broken and he return to his senses.\" As the two spoke behold, up rushed the eunuch, in the aforesaid plight, making to the King who was troubled at sight of him; and he cried \"O our lord the Sultan! Verily, thy son's wits are fled and he hath gone mad, he hath dealt with me thus and thus, so that I am become as thou seest me, and he kept saying, 'A young lady lay with me this night and stole away secretly whilst I slept. Where is she?' And he insisteth on my letting him know where she is and on my telling him who took her away. But I have seen neither girl nor boy: the door was locked all through the night, for I slept before it with the key under my head, and I opened to him in the morning with my own hand. When King Shahriman heard this, he cried out, saying, \"Alas, my son!;\" and he was enraged with sore rage against the Wazir, who had been the cause of all this case and said to him, \"Go up, bring me news of my son and see what hath befallen his mind.\" So the Wazir rose and, stumbling over his long skirts, in his fear of the King's wrath, hastened with the slave to the tower. Now the sun had risen and when the Minister came in to Kamar al-Zaman, he found him sitting on the couch reciting the Koran; so he saluted him and seated himself by his side, and said to him, \"O my lord, this wretched eunuch brought us tidings which troubled and alarmed us and which incensed the King.\" Asked Kamar al-Zaman, \"And what hath he told you of me to trouble my father? In good sooth he hath troubled none but me.\" Answered the Wazir, \"He came to us in fulsome state and told us of thee a thing which Heaven forfend; and the slave added a lie which it befitteth not to repeat, Allah preserve thy youth and sound sense and tongue of eloquence, and forbid to come from thee aught of offense!\" Quoth the Prince, \"O Wazir, and what thing did this pestilent slave say of me?\" The Minister replied, \"He told us that thy wits had taken leave of thee and thou wouldst have it that a young lady lay with thee last night, and thou west instant with him to tell thee whither she went and thou diddest torture him to that end.\" But when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was enraged with sore rage and he said to the Wazir, \"'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her per misted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman heard the words of the Wazir he was enraged with sore rage and said to him, \"'Tis manifest to me in very deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did and forbade him to tell me what became of the young lady who lay with me last night. But thou, O Wazir, art cleverer than the eunuch, so do thou tell me without stay or delay, whither went the young lady who slept on my bosom last night; for it was you who sent her and bade her steep in my embrace and we lay together till dawn; but, when I awoke, I found her not. So where is she now?\" Said the Wazir, \"O my lord Kamar al-Zaman, Allah's name encompass thee about! By the Almighty, we sent none to thee last night, but thou layest alone, with the door locked on thee and the eunuch sleeping behind it, nor did there come to thee young lady or any other. Regain thy reason, O my lord, and stablish thy senses and occupy not thy mind with vanities.\" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman who was incensed at his words, \"O Wazir, the young lady in question is my beloved, the fair one with the black eyes and rosy cheeks, whom I held in my arms all last night.\" So the Minister wondered at his words and asked him, \"Didst thou see this damsel last night with shine own eyes on wake or in sleep?\" Answered Kamar al-Zaman, \"O ill- omened old man, dost thou fancy I saw her with my ears? Indeed, I saw her with my very eyes and awake, and I touched her with my hand, and I watched by her full half the night, feeding my vision on her beauty and loveliness and grace and tempting looks. But you had schooled her and charged her to speak no word to me; so she feigned sleep and I lay by her side till dawn, when I awoke and found her gone.\" Rejoined the Wazir, \"O my lord Kamar al- Zaman, haply thou sawest this in thy sleep; it must have been a delusion of dreams or a deception caused by eating various kinds of food, or a suggestion of the accursed devils.\" Cried the Prince, \"O pestilent old man! wilt thou too make a mock of me and tell me this was haply a delusion of dreams, when that eunuch confessed to the young lady, saying, 'At once I will return to thee and tell thee all about her?'\" With these words, he sprang up and rushed at the Wazir and gripped hold of his beard (which was long[FN#273]) and, after gripping it, he twisted his hand in it and haling him off the couch, threw him on the floor. It seemed to the Minister as though his soul departed his body for the violent plucking at his beard; and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not kicking the Wazir and basting his breast and ribs and cuffing him with open hand on the nape of his neck till he had well-nigh beaten him to death. Then said the old man in his mind, \"Just as the eunuch-slave saved his life from this lunatic youth by telling him a lie, thus it is even fitter that I do likewise; else he will destroy me. So now for my lie to save myself, he being mad beyond a doubt.\" Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, \"O my lord, pardon me; for indeed thy father charged me to conceal from thee this affair of the young lady; but now I am weak and weary and wounded with funding; for I am an old man and lack strength and bottom to endure blows. Have, therefore, a little patience with me and I will tell thee all and acquaint thee with the story of the young woman.\" When the Prince heard this, he left off drubbing him and said, \"Wherefore couldst thou not tell me the tale until after shame and blows? Rise now, unlucky old man that thou art, and tell me her story.\" Quoth the Wazir, \"Say, dost thou ask of the young lady with the fair face and perfect form?\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"Even so! Tell me, O Wazir, who it was that led her to me and laid her by my side, and who was it that took her away from me by night; and let me know forthright whither she is gone, that I myself may go to her at once. If my father did this deed to me that he might try me by means of that beautiful girl, with a view to our marriage, I consent to wed her and free myself of this trouble; for he did all these dealings with me only because I refused wedlock. But now I consent and I say again, I consent to matrimony: so tell this to my father, O Wazir, and advise him to marry me to that young lady; for I will have none other and my heart loveth none save her alone. Now rise up at once and haste thee to my father and counsel him to hurry on our wedding and bring me his answer within this very hour.\" Rejoined the Wazir, \"'Tis well!\" and went forth from him, hardly believing himself out of his hands. Then he set off from the tower, walking and tripping up as he went, for excess of fright and agitation, and he ceased not hurrying till he came in to King Shahriman.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Eighty-nineth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir, fared forth from the tower, and ceased not running till he came in to King Shahriman, who said to him as he sighted him, \"O thou Wazir, what man hath brought thee to grief and whose mischief hath treated thee in way unlief; how happeneth it that I see thee dumb foundered and coming to me thus astounded?\" Replied the Wazir, \"O King! I bring thee good news.\" \"And what is it?\" quoth Shahriman, and quoth the Wazir, \"Know that thy son Kamar al- Zaman's wits are clean gone and that he hath become stark mad.\" Now when the King heard these words of the Minister, light became darkness in his sight and he said, \"O Wazir, make clear to me the nature of his madness.\" Answered the Wazir, \"O my lord, I hear and I obey.\" Then he told him that such and such had passed and acquainted him with all that his son had done; whereupon the King said to him, \"Hear, O Wazir, the good tidings which I give thee in return for this thy fair news of my son's insanity; and it shall be the cutting off of thy head and the forfeiture of my favour, O most ill-omened of Wazirs and foulest of Emirs! for I feel that thou hast caused my son's disorder by the wicked advice and the sinister counsel thou hast given me first and last. By Allah, if aught of mischief or madness have befallen my son I will most assuredly nail thee upon the palace dome and make thee drain the bitterest draught of death!'' Then he sprang up and, taking the Wazir, with him, fared straight for the tower and entered it. And when Kamar al-Zaman saw the two, he rose to his father in haste from the couch whereon he sat and kissing his hands drew back and hung down his head and stood before him with his arms behind him, and thus remained for a full hour. Then he raised his head towards his sire; the tears gushed from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks and he began repeating,\n\n\"Forgive the sin 'neath which my limbs are trembling,\nFor the slave seeks for mercy from his master;\nI've done a fault, which calls for free confession,\nWhere shall it call for mercy, and forgiveness?''[FN#274]\n\nWhen the King heard this, he arose and embraced his son, and kissing him between the eyes, made him sit by his side on the couch; then he turned to the Wazir, and, looking on him with eyes of wrath, said, \"O dog of Wazirs, how didst thou say of my son such and such things and make my heart quake for him?\" Then he turned to the Prince and said, \"O my son, what is to-day called?\" He answered, \"O my father, this day is the Sabbath, and to morrow is First day: then come Second day, Third, Fourth, Fifth day and lastly Friday.\"[FN#275] Exclaimed the King, \"O my son, O Kamar al-Zaman, praised be Allah for the preservation of thy reason! What is the present month called in our Arabic?\" \"Z\u00fa'l Ka'adah,\" answered Kamar al-Zaman, \"and it is followed by Z\u00fa'l hijjah; then cometh Muharram, then Safar, then Rab\u00ed'a the First and Rab\u00ed'a the Second, the two Jam\u00e1d\u00e1s, Rajab, Sha'aban, Ramaz\u00e1n and Shaww\u00e1l.\" At this the King rejoiced exceedingly and spat in the Wazir's face, saying, \"O wicked old man, how canst thou say that my son is mad? And now none is mad but thou.\" Hereupon the Minister shook his head and would have spoken, but bethought himself to wait awhile and see what might next befal. Then the King said to his child, \"O my son, what words be these thou saddest to the eunuch and the Wazir, declaring, 'I was sleeping with a fair damsel this night?'[FN#276] What damsel is this of whom thou speakest?\" Then Kamar al-Zaman laughed at his father's words and replied, \"O my father, know that I can bear no more jesting; so add me not another mock or even a single word on the matter, for my temper hath waxed short by that you have done with me. And know, O my father, with assured knowledge, that I consent to marry, but on condition that thou give me to wife her who lay by my side this night; for I am certain it was thou sentest her to me and madest me in love with her and then despatchedst a message to her before the dawn and tookest her away from beside me.\" Rejoined the King, \"The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness!\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninetieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth King Shahriman to his son Kamar al-Zaman, \"The name of Allah encompass thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness! What thing be this young lady whom thou fanciest I sent to thee last night and then again that I sent to withdraw her from thee before dawn? By the Lord, O my son, I know nothing of this affair, and Allah upon thee, tell me if it be a delusion of dreaming or a deception caused by indisposition. For verily thou layest down to sleep last night with thy mind occupied anent marriage and troubled with the talk of it (Allah damn marriage and the hour when I spake of it and curse him who counselled it!); and without doubt or diffidence I can say that being moved in mind by the mention of wedlock thou dreamedst that a handsome young lady embraced thee and didst fancy thou sawest her when awake. But all this, O my son, is but an imbroglio of dreams.\" Replied Kamar al-Zaman, \"Leave this talk and swear to me by Allah, the All creator, the Omniscient; the Humbler of the tyrant Caesars and the Destroyer of the Chosroes, that thou knowest naught of the young lady nor of her woning-place.\" Quoth the King, \"By the Might of Allah Almighty, the God of Moses and Abraham, I know naught of all this and never even heard of it; it is assuredly a delusion of dreams thou hast seen in sleep.' Then the Prince replied to his sire, \"I will give thee a self evident proof that it happened to me when on wake.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al Zamar said to his sire, \"I will give thee a self-evident proof that this happened to me when on wake. Now let me ask thee, did it ever befal any man to dream that he was battling a sore battle and after to awake from sleep and find in his hand a sword-blade besmeared with blood? Answered the King, \"No, by Allah, O my son, this hath never been.\" Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, \"I will tell thee what happened to me and it was this. Meseemed I awoke from sleep in the middle of the past night and found a girl lying by my side, whose form was like mine and whose favour was as mine. I embraced her and turned her about with my hand and took her seal- ring, which I put on my finger, and she pulled off my ring and put it on hers. Then I went to sleep by her side, but refrained from her for shame of thee, deeming that thou hadst sent her to me, intending to tempt me with her and incline me to marriage, and suspecting thee to be hidden somewhere whence thou couldst see what I did with her. And I was ashamed even to kiss her on the mouth for thy account, thinking over this temptation to wedlock; and, when I awoke at point of day, I found no trace of her, nor could I come at any news of her, and there befel me what thou knowest of with the eunuch and with the Wazir. How then can this case have been a dream and a delusion, when the ring is a reality? Save for her ring on my finger I should indeed have deemed it a dream; but here is the ring on my little finger: look at it, O King, and see what is its worth.\" So saying he handed the ring to his father, who examined it and turned it over, then looked to his son and said, \"Verily, there is in this ring some mighty mystery and some strange secret. What befel thee last night with the girl is indeed a hard nut to crack, and I know not how intruded upon us this intruder. None is the cause of all this posher save the Wazir; but, Allah upon thee, O my son, take patience, so haply the Lord may turn to gladness this thy grief and to thy sadness bring complete relief: as quoth one of the poets,\n\n'Haply shall Fortune draw her rein, and bring *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Fair chance, for she is changeful, jealous, vain:\nStill I may woo my want and wishes win, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And see on heels of care unfair, the fain.'\n\nAnd now, O my son, I am certified at this hour that thou art not mad; but thy case is a strange one which none can clear up for thee save the Almighty.\" Cried the Prince, \"By Allah, O my father, deal kindly with me and seek out this young lady and hasten her coming to me; else I shall die of woe and of my death shall no one know.\" Then he betrayed the ardour of his passion; and turned towards his father and repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"If your promise of personal call prove untrue, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Deign in vision to grant me an interview:\nQuoth they, 'How can phantom[FN#277] appear to the sight *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of a youth, whose sight is fordone, perdue?'\"\n\nThen, after ending his poetry, Kamar al-Zaman again turned to his father, with submission and despondency, and shedding tears in flood, began repeating these lines.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman had repeated to his father these verses, he wept and complained and groaned from a wounded heart; and added these lines,\n\n\"Beware that eye glance which hath magic might; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Wherever turn those orbs it bars our flight:\nNor be deceived by low sweet voice, that breeds *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    A fever festering in the heart and sprite:\nSo soft that silky skin, were rose to touch it *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     She'd cry and tear-drops rain for pain and fright:\nDid Zephyr e'en in sleep pass o'er her land, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Scented he'd choose to dwell in scented site:\nHer necklets vie with tinkling of her belt; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Her wrists strike either wristlet dumb with spite:\nWhen would her bangles buss those rings in ear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Upon the lover's eyne high mysteries 'light:\nI'm blamed for love of her, nor pardon claim; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Eyes are not profiting which lack foresight:\nHeaven strip thee, blamer mine! unjust art thou; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Before this fawn must every eye low bow.\"[FN#278]\n\nAfter which he said, \"By Allah, O my father, I cannot endure to be parted from her even for an hour.\" The King smote hand upon hand and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! No cunning contrivance can profit us in this affair.\" Then he took his son by the hand and carried him to the palace, where Kamar al-Zaman lay down on the bed of languor and the King sat at his head, weeping and mourning over him and leaving him not, night or day, till at last the Wazir came in to him and said, \"O King of the age and the time, how long wilt thou remain shut up with thy son and hide thyself from thy troops. Haply, the order of thy realm may be deranged, by reason of shine absence from thy Grandees and Officers of State. It behoveth the man of understanding, if he have various wounds in his body, to apply him first to medicine the most dangerous; so it is my counsel to thee that thou remove thy son from this place to the pavilion which is in the palace overlooking the sea; and shut thyself up with him there, setting apart in every week two days, Thursday and Monday, for state receptions and progresses and reviews. On these days let shine Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and high Officials and Grandees of the realm and the rest of the levies and the lieges have access to thee and submit their affairs to thee; and do thou their needs and judge among them and give and take with them and bid and forbid. And the rest of the week thou shalt pass with thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and cease not thus doing till Allah shall vouchsafe relief to you twain. Think not, O King, that thou art safe from the shifts of Time and the strokes of Change which come like a traveller in the night; for the wise man is ever on his guard and how well saith the poet,\n\n'Thou deemedst well of Time when days went well, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And fearedst not what ills might bring thee Fate:\nThe Nights so fair and restful cozened thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For peaceful Nights bring woes of heavy weight.\nOh children of mankind whom Time befriends, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Beware of Time's deceits or soon or late!'''[FN#279]\n\nWhen the Sultan heard his Wazir's words he saw that they were right and deemed his counsel wise, and it had effect upon him for he feared lest the order of the state be deranged; so he rose at once and bade transport his son from his sick room to the pavilion in the palace overlooking the sea. Now this palace was girt round by the waters and was approached by a causeway twenty cubits wide. It had windows on all sides commanding an ocean- view; its floor was paved with parti-coloured marbles and its ceiling was painted in the richest pigments and figured with gold and lapis-lazuli. They furnished it for Kamar al-Zaman with splendid upholstery, embroidered rugs and carpets of the richest silk; and they clothed the walls with choice brocades and hung curtains bespangled with gems of price. In the midst they set him a couch of juniper[FN#280]-wood inlaid with pearls and jewels, and Kamar al-Zaman sat down thereon, but the excess of his concern and passion for the young lady had wasted his charms and emaciated his body; he could neither eat nor drink nor sleep; and he was like a man who had been sick twenty years of sore sickness. His father seated himself at his head, grieving for him with the deepest grief, and every Monday and Thursday he gave his Wazirs and Emirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and Lords of the realm and levies and the rest of his lieges leave to come up to him in that pavilion. So they entered and did their several service and duties and abode with him till the end of the day, when they went their ways and the King returned to his son in the pavilion whom he left not night nor day; and he ceased not doing on this wise for many days and nights. Such was the case with Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman; but as regards Princess Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seven Palaces, when the two Jinns bore her up and laid her on her bed, she slept till daybreak, when she awoke and sitting upright looked right and left, but saw not the youth who had lain in her bosom. At this her vitals fluttered, her reason fled and she shrieked a loud shriek which awoke all her slave girls and nurses and duennas. They flocked in to her; and the chief of them came forward and asked, \"What aileth thee, O my lady?\" Answered the Princess, \"O wretched old woman, where is my beloved, the handsome youth who lay last night in my bosom? Tell me whither he is gone.\" Now when the duenna heard this, the light starkened in her sight and she feared from her mischief with sore affright, and said to her, \"O my Lady Budur, what unseemly words are these?\" Cried the Princess, \"Woe to thee pestilent crone that thou art! I ask thee again where is my beloved, the goodly youth with the shining face and the slender form, the jetty eyes and the joined eyebrows, who lay with me last night from supper-tide until near daybreak?\" She rejoined \"By Allah, O my lady, I have seen no young man nor any other. I conjure thee, carry not this unseemly jest too far lest we all lose our lives; for perhaps the joke may come to thy father's ears and who shall then deliver us from his hand?\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the duenna bespake the Lady Budur in these words, \"Allah upon thee, O my lady! carry not this unseemly jest too far; for perhaps it may come to thy father's ears, and who shall then deliver us from his hand?\" The Princess rejoined, \"In very sooth a youth lay with me last night, one of the fairest-faced of men.\" Exclaimed the duenna, \"Heaven preserve thy reason! indeed no one lay with thee last night.\" Thereupon the Princess looked at her hand and, finding Kamar al-Zaman's seal-ring on her finger in stead of her own, said to her, \"Woe to thee, thou accursed! thou traitress! wilt thou lie to me and tell me that none lay with me last night and swear to me a falsehood in the name of the Lord?\" Replied the duenna, \"By Allah, I do not lie to thee nor have I sworn falsely.\" Then the Princess was incensed by her words and, drawing a sword she had by her, she smote the old woman with it and slew her;[FN#281] whereupon the eunuch and the waiting-women and the concubines cried out at her, and ran to her father and, without stay or delay, acquainted him with her case. So the King went to her, and asked her, \"O my daughter, what aileth thee?\"; and she answered, \"O my father, where is the youth who lay with me last night?\" Then her reason fled from her head and she cast her eyes right and left and rent her raiment even to the skirt. When her sire saw this, he bade the women lay hands on her; so they seized her and manacled her, then putting a chain of iron about her neck, made her fast to one of the palace-windows and there left her.[FN#282] Thus far concerning Princess Budur; but as regards her father, King Ghayur, the world was straitened upon him when he saw what had befallen his daughter, for that he loved her and her case was not a little grievous to him. So he summoned on it the doctors and astrologers and men skilled in talisman- writing and said to them, \"Whoso healeth my daughter of what ill she hath, I will marry him to her and give him half of my kingdom; but whoso cometh to her and cureth her not, I will strike off his head and hang it over her palace-gate.\" Accordingly, all who went in to her, but failed to heal her, he beheaded and hung their heads over the palace-gates, till he had beheaded on her account forty doctors and crucified forty astrologers; wherefor the general held aloof from her, all the physicians having failed to medicine her malady; and her case was a puzzle to the men of science and the adepts in cabalistic characters. And as her longing and passion redoubled and love and distraction were sore upon her, she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"My fondness, O my moon, for thee my foeman is, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to thy comradeship the nights my thought compel:\nIn gloom I bide with fire that flames below my ribs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose lowe I make comparison with heat of Hell:\nI'm plagued with sorest stress of pine and ecstasy; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor clearest noon tide can that horrid pain dispel.\"\n\nThen she sighed and repeated these also,\n\n\"Salams fro' me to friends in every stead; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Indeed to all dear friends do I incline:\nSalams, but not salams that bid adieu; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Salams that growth of good for you design:\nI love you dear, indeed, nor less your land, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But bide I far from every need of mine!\"\n\nAnd when the Lady Budur ceased repeating her poetry, she wept till her eyes waxed sore and her cheeks changed form and hue, and in this condition she continued three years. Now she had a foster-brother, by name Marzaw\u00e1n,[FN#283] who was travelling in far lands and absent from her the whole of this time. He loved her with an exceeding love, passing the love of brothers; so when he came back he went in to his mother and asked for his sister, the Princess Budur. She answered him, \"O my son, thy sister hath been smitten with madness and hath passed these three years with a chain of iron about her neck; and all the physicians and men of science have failed of healing her.\" When Marzawan heard these words he said, \"I must needs go in to her; peradventure I may discover what she hath, and be able to medicine her;\" and his mother replied, \"Needs must thou visit her, but wait till to morrow, that I may contrive some thing to suit thy case.\" Then she went a-foot to the palace of the Lady Budur and, accosting the eunuch in charge of the gates, made him a present and said to him, \"I have a daughter, who was brought up with thy mistress and since then I married her; and, when that befel the Princess which befel her, she became troubled and sore concerned, and I desire of thy favour that my daughter may go in to her for an hour and look on her; and then return whence she came, so shall none know of it.\" Quoth the eunuch, \"This may not be except by night, after the King hath visited his child and gone away; then come thou and thy daughter.\" So she kissed the eunuch's hand and, returning home, waited till the morrow at nightfall; and when it was time she arose and sought her son Marzawan and attired him in woman's apparel; then, taking his hand in hers, led him towards the palace, and ceased not walking with him till she came upon the eunuch after the Sultan had ended his visit to the Princess. Now when the eunuch saw her, he rose to her, and said, \"Enter, but do not prolong thy stay!\" So they went in and when Marzawan beheld the Lady Budur in the aforesaid plight, he saluted her, after his mother had doffed his woman's garb: then he took out of their satchel books he had brought with him; and, lighting a wax- candle, he began to recite certain conjurations Thereupon the Princess looked at him and recognising him, said, \"O my brother, thou hast been absent on thy travels' and thy news have been cut off from us.\" He replied, \"True! but Allah hath brought me back safe and sound, I am now minded to set out again nor hath aught delayed me but the news I hear of thee; wherefore my heart burned for thee and I came to thee, so haply I may free thee of thy malady.\" She rejoined, O my brother, thinkest thou it is madness aileth me?\" \"Yes.\" answered he, and she said, \"Not so, by Allah! 'tis even as saith the poet,\n\n'Quoth they 'Thou rav'st on him thou lov'st': quoth I, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'The sweets of love are only for th' insane!'\nLove never maketh Time his friend befriend; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Only the Jinn-struck wight such boon can gain:\nWell! yes, I'm mad: bring him who madded me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And, if he cure m: madness, blame restrain!'\"\n\nThen she let Marzawan know that she was love-daft and he said \"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply there may be in my hand something which shall be a means of deliverance for thee.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of da, and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Marzawar thus addressed Princess Budur, \"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply Allah may inspire me with a means of deliverance for thee.\" Quoth she, \"O my brother, hear my story which is this. One night I awoke from sleep, in the last third of the night[FN#284] and, sitting up, saw by my side the handsomest of youths that be, and tongue faileth to describe him, for he was as a willow-wand or an Indian rattan-cane. So methought it was my father who had done on this wise in order thereby to try me, for that he had consulted me concerning wedlock, when the Kings sought me of him to wife, and I had refused. It was this though withheld me from arousing him, for I feared that, if I did aught of embraced him, he would peradventure inform my father of m, doings. But in the morning, I found on my finger his seal-ring, in place of my own which he had taken. And, O my brother, m, heart was seized with love of him at first sight; and, for the violence of my passion and longing, I have never savoured the taste of sleep and have no occupation save weeping alway and repeating verses night and day. And this, O my brother, is my story and the cause of my madness.\" Then she poured forth tears and repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Now Love hast banished all that bred delight; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With that heart-nibbling fawn my joys took flight:\nLightest of trifles lover's blood to him *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who wastes the vitals of the hapless wight!\nFor him I'm jealous of my sight and thought; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart acts spy upon my thought and sight:\nThose long-lashed eyelids rain on me their shafts *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Guileful, destroying hearts where'er they light:\nNow, while my portion in the world endures, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall I behold him ere I quit world-site?\nWhat bear I for his sake I'd hide, but tears *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Betray my feelings to the spy's despight.\nWhen near, our union seemeth ever far; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When far, my thoughts to him aye nearest are.\"\n\nAnd presently she continued, \"See then, O my brother, how thou mayest aid me in mine affliction.\" So Marzawan bowed his head ground-wards awhile, wondering and not knowing what to do, then he raised it and said to her, \"All thou hast spoken to me I hold to be true, though the case of the young man pass my understanding: but I will go round about all lands and will seek for what may heal thee; haply Allah shall appoint thy healing to be at my hand. Meanwhile, take patience and be not disquieted.\" Thereupon Marzawan farewelled her, praying that she might be constant and left her repeating these couplets,\n\n\"Thine image ever companies my sprite, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    For all thou'rt distant from the pilgrim's sight:\nBut my heart-wishes e'er attract thee near: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    What is the lightning's speed to Thought's swift flight?\nThen go not thou, my very light of eyes *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which, when thou'rt gone, lack all the Kohl of light.\"\n\nThen Marzawan returned to his mother's house, where he passed the night. And when the morrow dawned, having equipped himself for his journey, he fared forth and ceased not faring from city to city and from island to island for a whole month, till he came to a town named Al-Tayrab.[FN#285] Here he went about scenting news of the townsfolk, so haply he might light on a cure for the Princess's malady, for in every capital he entered or passed by, it was reported that Queen Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, had lost her wits. But arriving at Al-Tayrab city, he heard that Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, was fallen sick and afflicted with melancholy madness. So Marzawan asked the name of the Prince's capital and they said to him, \"It is on the Islands of Khalidan and it lieth distant from our city a whole month's journey by sea, but by land it is six months' march.\" So he went down to the sea in a ship which was bound for the Khalidan Isles, and she sailed with a favouring breeze for a whole month, till they came in sight of the capital; and there remained for them but to make the land when, behold, there came out on them a tempestuous wind which carried away the masts and rent the canvas, so that the sails fell into the sea and the ship capsized, with all on board,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship capsized with all on board, each sought his own safety; and as for Marzawan the set of the sea carried him under the King's palace, wherein was Kamar al-Zaman. And by the decree of destiny it so happened that this was the day on which King Shahriman gave audience to his Grandees and high officers, and he was sitting, with his son's head on his lap, whilst an eunuch fanned away the flies; and the Prince had not spoken neither had he eaten nor drunk for two days, and he was grown thinner than a spindle.[FN#286] Now the Wazir was standing respectfully a-foot near the latticed window giving on the sea and, raising his eyes, saw Marzawan being beaten by the billows and at his last gasp; whereupon his heart was moved to pity for him, so he drew near to the King and moving his head towards him said, \"I crave thy leave, O King, to go down to the court of the pavilion and open the water-gate that I may rescue a man who is at the point of drowning in the sea and bring him forth of danger into deliverance; peradventure, on this account Allah may free thy son from what he hath!\" The King replied, \"O thou Wazir, enough is that which hath befallen my son through thee and on shine account. Haply, if thou rescue this drowning man, he will come to know our affairs, and look on my son who is in this state and exult over me; but I swear by Allah, that if this half-drowned wretch come hither and learn our condition and look upon my son and then fare forth and speak of our secrets to any, I will assuredly strike off thy head before his; for thou, O my Minister art the cause of all that hath betided us, first and last. Now do as thou wilt.\" Thereupon the Wazir sprang up and, opening the private pastern which gave upon the sea, descended to the causeway; then walked on twenty steps and came to the water where he saw Marzawan nigh unto death. So he put out his hand to him and, catching him by his hair, drew him ashore in a state of insensibility, with belly full of water and eyes half out of his head. The Wazir waited till he came to himself, when he pulled off his wet clothes and clad him in a fresh suit, covering his head with one of his servants' turbands; after which he said to him, Know that I have been the means of saving thee from drowning: do not thou requite me by causing my death and shine own.\"\u00c4And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Wazir did to Marzawan what he did, he thus addressed him Know that I have been the cause of saving thee from drowning so requite me not by causing my death and shine own.\" Asked Marzawan, And how so?\"; and the Wazir answered, \"Thou art at this hour about to go up and pass among Emirs and Wazirs all of them silent and none speaking, because of Kamar al-Zaman the son of the Sultan.\" Now when Marzawan heard the name of Kamar al-Zaman, he knew that this was he whom he had heard spoken of in sundry cities and of whom he came in search, but he feigned ignorance and asked the Wazir, \"And who is Kamar al-Zaman? Answered the Minister, \"He is the son of Sultan Shahriman and he is sore sick and lieth strown on his couch restless alway, eating not nor drinking neither sleeping night or day; indeed he is nigh upon death and we have lost hope of his living and are certain that he is dying. Beware lest thou look too long on him, or thou look on any other than that where thou settest thy feet: else thou art a lost man, and I also.\" He replied, \"Allah upon thee, O Wazir, I implore thee, of thy favour, acquaint me touching this youth thou describest, what is the cause of the condition in which he is.\" The Wazir replied, \"I know none, save that, three years ago, his father required him to wed, but he refused; whereat the King was wroth and imprisoned him. And when he awoke on the morrow, he fancied that during the night he had been roused from sleep and had seen by his side a young lady of passing loveliness, whose charms tongue can never express; and he assured us that he had plucked off her seal-ring from her finger and had put it on his own and that she had done likewise; but we know not the secret of all this business. So by Allah, O my son, when thou comest up with me into the palace, look not on the Prince, but go thy way; for the Sultan's heart is full of wrath against me.\" So said Marzawan to himself, \"By Allah; this is the one I sought!\" Then he followed the Wazir up to the palace, where the Minister seated himself at the Prince's feet; but Marzawan found forsooth nothing to do but go up to Kamar al-Zaman and stand before him at gaze. Upon this the Wazir, died of affright in his skin, and kept looking at Marzawan and signalling him to wend his way; but he feigned not to see him and gave not over gazing upon Kamar al- Zaman, till he was well assured that it was indeed he whom he was seeking,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan looked upon Kamar al-Zaman and knew that it was indeed he whom he was seeking, he cried, \"Exalted be Allah, Who hath made his shape even as her shape and his complexion as her complexion and his cheek as her cheek!'' Upon this Kamar al-Zaman opened his eyes and gave earnest ear to his speech; and, when Marzawan saw him inclining to hear, he repeated these couplets[FN#287],\n\n\"I see thee full of song and plaint and love's own ecstasy;\nDelighting in describing all the charms of loveliness:\n\nArt smit by stroke of Love or hath shaft-shot wounded thee?\nNone save the wounded ever show such signals of distress!\nHo thou! crown the wine cup and sing me singular\nPraises to Sulaym\u00e1, Al-Rab\u00e1b, Tan'oum addrest;[FN#288]\n\nGo round the grape-vine sun[FN#289] which for mansion hath a jar;\nWhose East the cup boy is, and here my mouth that opes for West.\n\nI'm jealous of the very clothes that dare her sides enroll\nWhen she veils her dainty body of the delicatest grace:\n\nI envy every goblet of her lips that taketh toll\nWhen she sets the kissing cup on that sweetest kissing-place.\n\nBut deem not by the keen-edged scymitar I'm slain\u2014\nThe hurts and harms I dree are from arrows of her eyes.\n\nI found her finger tips, as I met her once again,\nDeep-reddened with the juice of the wood that ruddy dyes;[FN#290]\n\nAnd cried, 'Thy palms thou stainedst when far away was I\nAnd this is how thou payest one distracted by his pine!'\n\nQuoth she (enkindling in my heart a flame that burned high\nSpeaking as one who cannot hide of longing love the sign),\n\n'By thy life, this is no dye used for dyeing; so forbear\nThy blame, nor in charging me with falsing Love persist!\n\nBut when upon our parting-day I saw thee haste to fare,\n\nThe while were bared my hand and my elbow and my wrist;\n\n'I shed a flood of blood-red tears and with fingers brushed away; Hence blood-reddened were the tips and still blood-red they remain.'\n\nHad I wept before she wept, to my longing-love a prey,\nBefore repentance came, I had quit my soul of pain;\n\nBut she wept before I wept and I wept to see her care\nAnd I said, 'All the merit to precedent;'[FN#291]\n\nBlame me not for loving her, now on self of Love I swear\nFor her sake, for her only, these pains my soul torment.\n\nShe hath all the lere of Lukm\u00e1n[FN#292] and Y\u00fasuf's beauty lief;\nSweet singer David's voice and Maryam's chastity:\n\nWhile I've all Jacob's mourning and Jonah's prison-grief,\nAnd the sufferings of Job and old Adam's history:\n\nYet kill her not, albeit of my love for her I die;\nBut ask her why my blood to her was lawful. ask her why?\"\n\nWhen Marzawan recited this ode, the words fell upon Kamar al- Zaman's heart as freshness after fever and returning health; and he sighed and, turning his tongue in his mouth, said to his sire, \"O my father, let this youth come and sit by my side.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman said to his sire, \"O my father, allow this youth to come and sit by my side.\" Now when the King heard these words from his son, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, though at the first his heart had been set against Marzawan and he had determined that the stranger's head needs must be stricken off: but when he heard Kamar al-Zaman speak, his anger left him and he arose and drawing Marzawan to him, seated him by his son and turning to him said, \"Praised be Allah for thy safety!\" He replied, \"Allah preserve thee! and preserve thy son to thee!\" and called down blessings on the King. Then the King asked, \"From what country art thou?\"; and he answered, \"From the Islands of the Inland Sea, the kingdom of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas and the Seven Palaces.\" Quoth King Shahriman, \"Maybe thy coming shall be blessed to my son and Allah vouchsafe to heal what is in him.\" Quoth Marzawan, \"Inshallah, naught shall be save what shall be well!\" Then turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he said to him in his ear unheard of the King and his court, 'O my lord! be of good cheer, and hearten thy heart and let shine eyes be cool and clear and, with respect to her for whose sake thou art thus, ask not of her case on shine account. But thou keptest thy secret and fellest sick, while she told her secret and they said she had gone mad; so she is now in prison, with an iron chain about her neck, in most piteous plight; but, Allah willing, the healing of both of you shall come from my hand.\" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, his life returned to him and he took heart and felt a thrill of joy and signed to his father to help him sit up; and the King was like to fly for gladness and rose hastily and lifted him up. Presently, of his fear for his son, he shook the kerchief of dismissal[FN#293]; and all the Emirs and Wazirs withdrew; then he set two pillows for his son to lean upon, after which he bade them perfume the palace with saffron and decorate the city, saying to Marzawan, \"By Allah, O my son, of a truth shine aspect be a lucky and a blessed!\" And he made as much of him as he might and called for food, and when they brought it, Marzawan came up to the Prince and said, \"Rise, eat with me.\" So he obeyed him and ate with him, and all the while the King invoked blessings on Marzawan and said, \"How auspicious is thy coming, O my son!\" And when the father saw his boy eat, his joy and gladness redoubled, and he went out and told the Prince's mother and all the household. Then he spread throughout the palace the good news of the Prince's recovery and the King commanded the decoration of the city and it was a day of high festival. Marzawan passed that night with Kamar al-Zaman, and the King also slept with them in joy and delight for his son's recovery.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the One Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Shahriman also passed that night with them in the excess of his joy for his son's recovery. And when the next morning dawned, and the King had gone away and the two young men were left alone, Kamar al-Zaman told his story from beginning to end to Marzawan who said, \"In very sooth I know her with whom thou didst foregather; her name is the Princess Budur and she is daughter to King Ghayur.\" Then he related to him all that had passed with the Princess from first to last and acquainted him with the excessive love she bore him, saying, \"All that befel thee with thy father hath befallen her with hers, and thou art without doubt her beloved, even as she is shine; so brace up thy resolution and take heart, for I will bring thee to her and unite you both anon and deal with you even as saith the poet,\n\n\"Albe to lover adverse be his love, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And show aversion howso may he care;\nYet will I manage that their persons[FN#294] meet, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     E'en as the pivot of a scissor pair.\"\n\nAnd he ceased not to comfort and solace and encourage Kamar al- Zaman and urged him to eat and drink till he ate food and drank wine, and life returned to him and he was saved from his ill case; and Marzawan cheered him and diverted him with talk and songs and stories, and in good time he became free of his disorder and stood up and sought to go to the Hammam.[FN#295] So Marzawan took him by the hand and both went to the bath, where they washed their bodies and made them clean.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundredth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, went to the Hammam, his father in his joy at this event freed the prisoners, and presented splendid dresses to his grandees and bestowed large alm-gifts upon the poor and bade decorate the city seven days. Then quoth Marzawan to Kamar al-Zaman, \"Know, O my lord, that I came not from the Lady Budur save for this purpose, and the object of my journey was to deliver her from her present case; and it remaineth for us only to devise how we may get to her, since thy father cannot brook the thought of parting from thee. So it is my counsel that to-morrow thou ask his leave to go abroad hunting. Then do thou take with thee a pair of saddle-bags full of money and mount a swift steed, and lead a spare horse, and I will do the like, and say to thy sire, 'I have a mind to divert myself with hunting the desert and to see the open country and there to pass one night.' Suffer not any servant to follow us, for as soon as we reach the open country, we will go our ways.\" Kamar al- Zaman rejoiced in this plan with great joy and cried, \"It is good.\" Then he stiffened his back and, going in to his father, sought his leave and spoke as he had been taught, and the King consented to his going forth a-hunting and said, \"O my son, blessed be the day that restoreth thee to health! I will not gainsay thee in this; but pass not more than one night in the desert and return to me on the morrow; for thou knowest that life is not good to me without thee, and indeed I can hardly believe thee to be wholly recovered from what thou hadst,[FN#296] because thou art to me as he of whom quoth the poet,\n\n'Albe by me I had through day and night *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Solomon's carpet and the Chosroes' might,\nBoth were in value less than wing of gnat, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unless these eyne could hold thee aye in sight.'\"[FN#297]\n\nThen the King equipped his son Kamar al-Zaman and Marzawan for the excursion, bidding make ready for them four horses, together with a dromedary to carry the money and a camel to bear the water and belly timber; and Kamar al-Zaman forbade any of his attendants to follow him. His father farewelled him and pressed him to his breast and kissed him, saying, \"I ask thee in the name of Allah, be not absent from me more than one night, wherein sleep will be unlawful to me, for I am even as saith the poet,\n\n'Thou present, in the Heaven of heavens I dwell; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Bearing shine absence is of hells my Hell:\nPledged be for thee my soul! If love for thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Be crime, my crime is of the fellest fell.\nDoes love-lowe burn thy heart as burns it mine, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Doomed night and day Gehenna-fire to smell?'\"\n\nAnswered Kamar al-Zaman, \"O my father, Inshallah, I will lie abroad but one night!\" Then he took leave of him, and he and Marzawan mounted and leading the spare horses, the dromedary with the money and the camel with the water and victual, turned their faces towards the open country;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawning day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and First Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman and Marzawan fared forth and turned their faces towards the open country; and they travelled from the first of the day till nightfall, when they halted and ate and drank and fed their beasts and rested awhile; after which they again took horse and ceased not journeying for three days, and on the fourth they came to a spacious tract wherein was a thicket. They alighted in it and Marzawan, taking the camel and one of the horses, slaughtered them and cut off their flesh and stripped their bones. Then he doffed from Kamar al-Zaman his shirt and trousers which he smeared with the horse's blood and he took the Prince's coat which he tore to shreds and befouled with gore; and he cast them down in the fork of the road. Then they ate and drank and mounting set forward again; and, when Kamar al- Zaman asked why this was done, and said, \"What is this O my brother, and how shall it profit us?\"; Marzawan replied, \"Know that thy father, when we have outstayed the second night after the night for which we had his leave, and yet we return not, will mount and follow in our track till he come hither; and, when he happeneth upon this blood which I have spilt and he seeth thy shirt and trousers rent and gore-fouled, he will fancy that some accident befel thee from bandits or wild-beasts, so he will give up hope of thee and return to his city, and by this device we shall win our wishes.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"By Allah, this be indeed a rare device! Thou hast done right well.''[FN#298] Then the two fared on days and nights and all that while Kamar al-Zaman did naught but complain when he found himself alone, and he ceased not weeping till they drew near their journeys end, when he rejoiced and repeated these verses,\n\n\"Wilt tyrant play with truest friend who thinks of thee each\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     hour, * And after showing love-desire betray indifference?\nMay I forfeit every favour if in love I falsed thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     If thee I left, abandon me by way of recompense:\nBut I've been guilty of no crime such harshness to deserve, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And if I aught offended thee I bring my penitence;\nOf Fortune's wonders one it is thou hast abandoned me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Fortune never wearieth of showing wonderments.\"\n\nWhen he had made an end of his verses, Marzawan said to him, \"Look! these be King Ghayur's Islands;\" whereat Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done, and kissed him between the eyes and strained him\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Marzawan said \"Look! these be the Islands of King Ghayur;\" Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what he had done and kissed him between the eyes and strained him to his bosom. And after reaching the Islands and entering the city they took up their lodging in a khan, where they rested three days from the fatigues of their wayfare; after which Marzawan carried Kamar al-Zaman to the bath and, clothing him in merchant's gear, provided him with a geomantic tablet of gold,[FN#299] with a set of astrological instruments and with an astrolabe of silver, plated with gold. Then he said to him, \"Arise, O my lord, and take thy stand under the walls of the King's palace and cry out, 'I am the ready Reckoner; I am the Scrivener; I am he who weeteth the Sought and the Seeker; I am the finished man of Science; I am the Astrologer accomplished in experience! Where then is he that seeketh?' As soon as the King heareth this, he will send after thee and carry thee in to his daughter the Princess Budur, thy lover; but when about going in to her do thou say to him, 'Grant me three days' delay, and if she recover, give her to me to wife; and if not, deal with me as thou dealest with those who forewent me.' He will assuredly agree to this, so as soon as thou art alone with her, discover thyself to her; and when she seeth thee, she will recover strength and her madness will cease from her and she will be made whole in one night. Then do thou give her to eat and drink. and her father, rejoicing in her recovery, will marry thee to her and share his kingdom with thee; for he hath imposed on himself this condition and so peace be upon thee.\" Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words he exclaimed, \"May I never lack thy benefits!\", and, taking the set of instruments aforesaid, sallied forth from the caravanserai in the dress of his order. He walked on till he stood under the walls of King Ghayur's palace, where he began to cry out, saying, \"I am the Scribe, I am the ready Reckoner, I am he who knoweth the Sought and the Seeker; I am he who openeth the Volume and summeth up the Sums;[FN#300] who Dreams can expound whereby the sought is found! Where then is the seeker?\" Now when the city people heard this, they flocked to him, for it was long since they had seen Scribe or Astrologer, and they stood round him and, looking upon him, they saw one in the prime of beauty and grace and perfect elegance, and they marvelled at his loveliness, and his fine stature and symmetry. Presently one of them accosted him and said, \"Allah upon thee, O thou fair and young, with the eloquent tongue! incur not this affray; nor throw thy life away in thine ambition to marry the Princess Budur. Only cast shine eyes upon yonder heads hung up; all their owners have lost their lives in this same venture.\" Yet Kamar al-Zaman paid no heed to them, but cried out at the top of his voice, saying, \"I am the Doctor, the Scrivener! I am the Astrologer, the Calculator!\" And all the townsfolk forbade him from this, but he regarded them not at all, saying in his mind, \"None knoweth desire save whoso suffereth it.\" Then he began again to cry his loudest, shouting, \"I am the Scrivener, I am the Astrologer!\"\u2014And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman in no wise heeded the words of the citizens, but continued to cry out, \"I am the Calculator! I am the Astrologer!\" Thereupon all the townsfolk were wroth with him and said to him, \"Thou art nothing but an imbecile, silly, self-willed lad! Have pity on shine own youth and tender years and beauty and loveliness.\" But he cried all the more, \"I am the Astrologer, I am the Calculator! Is there any one that seeketh?\" As he was thus crying and the people forbidding him, behold, King Ghayur heard his voice and the clamour of the lieges and said to his Wazir, \"Go down and bring me yon Astrologer.\" So the Wazir, went down in haste, and taking Kamar al-Zaman from the midst of the crowd led him up to the King; and when in the presence he kissed the ground and began versifying,\n\n\"Eight glories meet, all, all conjoined in thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whereby may Fortune aye thy servant be:\nLere, lordliness, grace, generosity; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Plain words, deep meaning, honour, victory!\"\n\nWhen the King looked upon him, he seated him by his side and said to him, \"By Allah, O my son, an thou be not an astrologer, venture not thy life nor comply with my condition; for I have bound myself that whoso goeth in to my daughter and healeth her not of that which hath befallen her I will strike off his head; but whoso healeth her him I will marry to her. So let not thy beauty and loveliness delude thee: for, by Allah! and again, by Allah! If thou cure her not, I will assuredly cut off thy head.\" And Kamar al-Zaman replied, \"This is thy right; and I consent, for I wot of this ere came I hither.\" Then King Ghayur took the Kazis to witness against him and delivered him to the eunuch, saying, \"Carry this one to the Lady Budur.\" So the eunuch took him by the hand and led him along the passage; but Kamar al-Zaman outstripped him and pushed on before, whilst the eunuch ran after him, saying, \"Woe to thee! Hasten not to shine own ruin: never yet saw I astrologer so eager for his proper destruction; but thou weetest not what calamities are before thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman turned away his face from the eunuch,\u2014And Shah razed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the eunuch thus addressed Kamar al-Zaman, \"Patience, and no indecent hurry!\"; the Prince turned away his face and began repeating these couplets,\n\n\"A Sage, I feel a fool before thy charms; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Distraught, I wot not what the words I say:\nIf say I 'Sun,' away thou dost not pass *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From eyes of me, while suns go down with day:\nThou hast completed Beauty, in whose praise *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Speech-makers fail, and talkers lose their way.\"\n\nThen the eunuch stationed Kamar al-Zaman behind the curtain of the Princess's door and the Prince said to him, \"Which of the two ways will please thee more, treat and cure thy lady from here or go in and heal her within the curtain?\" The eunuch marvelled at his words and answered, \"An thou heal her from here it were better proof of thy skill.\" Upon this Kamar al-Zaman sat down behind the curtain and, taking out ink case, pen and paper, wrote the following: \"This is the writ of one whom passion swayeth,* and whom longing waylayeth * and wakeful misery slayeth * one who despaireth of living * and looketh for naught but dying * with whose mourning heart * nor comforter nor helper taketh part * One whose sleepless eyes * none succoureth from anxieties * whose day is passed in fire * and his night in torturing desire * whose body is wasted for much emaciation * and no messenger from his beloved bringeth him consolation.\" And after this he indited the following couplets,\n\n\"I write with heart devoted to thy thought, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And eyelids chafed by tears of blood they bled;\nAnd body clad, by loving pine and pain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In shirt of leanness, and worn down to thread,\nTo thee complain I of Love's tormentry, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which ousted hapless Patience from her stead:\nA toi!

* If we or you have wrought deceit * may the deceiver win defeat! * There is naught goodlier than a lover who keeps faith * with the beloved who works him scathe.\" Then, by way of subscription, he wrote, \"From the distracted and despairing man * whom love and longing trepan * from the lover under passion's ban * the prisoner of transport and distraction * from this Kamar al-Zaman * son of Shahriman * to the peerless one * of the fair Houris the pearl-union * to the Lady Budur * daughter of King Al Ghayur * Know thou that by night I am sleepless * and by day in distress * consumed with increasing wasting and pain * and longing and love unfain * abounding in sighs * with tear flooded eyes * by passion captive ta'en * of Desire the slain * with heart seared by the parting of us twain * the debtor of longing bane, of sickness cup-companion * I am the sleepless one, who never closeth eye * the slave of love, whose tears run never dry * for the fire of my heart is still burning * and never hidden is the flame of my yearning.\" Then on the margin Kamar al-Zaman wrote this admired verse,\n\n\"Salem from graces hoarded by my Lord *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To her, who holds my heart and soul in hoard!\"\n\nAnd also these,\n\n\"Pray'ee grant me some words from your lips, belike *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Such mercy may comfort and cool these eyne:\nFrom the stress of my love and my pine for you, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I make light of what makes me despised, indign:\nAllah guard a folk whose abode was far, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And whose secret I kept in the holiest shrine:\nNow Fortune in kindness hath favoured me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thrown on threshold dust of this love o' mine:\nBy me bedded I looked on Bud\u00far, whose sun *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The moon of my fortunes hath made to shine.\"\n\nThen, having affixed his seal-ring to the missive, he wrote these couplets in the place of address,\n\n\"Ask of my writ what wrote my pen in dole, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And hear my tale of misery from this scroll;\nMy hand is writing while my tears down flow, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to the paper 'plains my longing soul:\nMy tears cease not to roll upon this sheet, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And if they stopped I'd cause blood-gouts to roll.\"\n\nAnd at the end he added this other verse,\n\n\"I've sent the ring from off thy finger bore *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   I when we met, now deign my ring restore!\"\n\nThen Kamar al-Zaman set the Lady Budur's ring inside the letter and sealed it and gave it to the eunuch, who took it and went in with it to his mistress.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman, after setting the seal-ring inside the epistle, gave it to the eunuch who took it and went in with it to his mistress; and, when the Lady Budur opened it, she found therein her own very ring. Then she read the paper and when she understood its purport and knew that it was from her beloved, and that he in person stood behind the curtain, her reason began to fly and her breast swelled for joy and rose high; and she repeated these couplets,\n\n\"Long, long have I bewailed the sev'rance of our loves, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With tears that from my lids streamed down like burning\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     rain;\nAnd vowed that, if the days deign reunite us two, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My lips should never speak of severance again:\nJoy hath o'erwhelmed me so that, for the very stress *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of that which gladdens me to weeping I am fain.\nTears are become to you a habit, O my eyes, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So that ye weep as well for gladness as for pain.''[FN#301]\n\nAnd having finished her verse, the Lady Budur stood up forthwith and, firmly setting her feet to the wall, strained with all her might upon the collar of iron, till she brake it from her neck and snapped the chains. Then going forth from behind the curtain she threw herself on Kamar al-Zaman and kissed him on the mouth, like a pigeon feeding its young.[FN#302] And she embraced him with all the stress of her love and longing and said to him, \"O my lord do I wake or sleep and hath the Almighty indeed vouchsafe] us reunion after disunion? Laud be to Allah who hath our loves repaired, even after we despaired!\" Now when the eunuch saw her in this case, he went off running to King Ghayur and, kissing the ground before him, said, \"O my lord, know that this Astrologer is indeed the Shaykh of all astrologers, who are fools to him, all of them; for verily he hath cured thy daughter while standing behind the curtain and without going in to her.\" Quoth the King, \"Look well to it, is this news true?\" Answered the eunuch, \"O my lord, rise and come and see for thyself how she hath found strength to break the iron chains and is come forth to the Astrologer, kissing and embracing him.\" Thereupon the King arose and went in to his daughter who, when she saw him, stood up in haste and covered her head,[FN#303] and recited these two couplets,\n\n\"The toothstick love I not; for when I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Siw\u00e1k,'[FN#304] I miss thee, for it sounds 'Siw\u00e1-ka'.\nThe caper-tree I love; for when I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Ar\u00e1k'[FN#305] it sounds I look on thee, 'Ar\u00e1-ka.'\"\n\nThereupon the King was so transported for joy at her recovery that he felt like to fly and kissed her between the eyes, for he loved her with dearest love; then, turning to Kamar al-Zaman, he asked him who he was, and said, \"What countryman art thou?\" So the Prince told him his name and rank, and informed him that he was the son of King Shahriman, and presently related to him the whole story from beginning to end; and acquainted him with what happened between himself and the Lady Budur; and how he had taken her seal-ring from her finger and had placed it on his own; whereat Ghayur marvelled and said, \"Verily your story deserveth in books to be chronicled, and when you are dead and gone age after age be read.\" Then he summoned Kazis and witnesses forthright and married the Lady Budur to Prince Kamar al-Zaman; after which he bade decorate the city seven days long. So they spread the tables with all manner of meats, whilst the drums beat and the criers anounced the glad tidings, and all the troops donned their richest clothes; and they illuminated the city and held high festival. Then Kamar al-Zaman went in to the Lady Budur and the King rejoiced in her recovery and in her marriage; and praised Allah for that He had made her to fall in love with a goodly youth of the sons of Kings. So they unveiled her and displayed the bride before the bridegroom; and both were the living likeness of each other in beauty and comeliness and grace and love-allurement. Then Kamar al-Zaman lay with her that night and took his will of her, whilst she in like manner fulfilled her desire of him and enjoyed his charms and grace; and they slept in each other's arms till the morning. On the morrow, the King made a wedding-feast to which he gathered all comers from the Islands of the Inner and Outer Seas, and he spread the tables with choicest viands nor ceased the banquetting for a whole month. Now when Kamar al-Zaman had thus fulfilled his will and attained his inmost desire, and whenas he had tarried awhile with the Princess Budur, he bethought him of his father, King Shahriman, and saw him in a dream, saying, \"O my son, is it thus thou dealest with me?\" and recited in the vision these two couplets,\n\n\"Indeed to watch the darkness-moon he blighted me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to star-gaze through longsome night he plighted me:\nEasy, my heart! for haply he'll unite with thee; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And patience, Sprite! with whatso ills he dight to thee.\"\n\nNow after seeing his father in the dream and hearing his re preaches, Kamar al-Zaman awoke in the morning, afflicted and troubled, whereupon the Lady Budur questioned him and he told her what he had seen.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman acquainted the Lady Budur with what he had seen in his dream, she and he went in to her sire and, telling him what had passed, besought his leave to travel. He gave the Prince the permission he sought; but the Princess said, \"O my father, I cannot bear to be parted from him.\" Quoth Ghayur, her sire, \"Then go thou with him,\" and gave her leave to be absent a whole twelvemonth and afterwards to visit him in every year once; so she kissed his hand and Kamar al-Zaman did the like. Thereupon King Ghayur proceeded to equip his daughter and her bridegroom for the journey, and furnished them with outfit and appointments for the march; and brought out of his stables horses marked with his own brand, blood-dromedaries[FN#306] which can journey ten days without water, and prepared a litter for his daughter, besides loading mules and camels with victual; moreover, he gave them slaves and eunuchs to serve them and all manner of travellinggear; and on the day of departure, when King Ghayur took leave of Kamar al-Zaman, he bestowed on him ten splendid suits of cloth of gold embroidered with stones of price, together with ten riding horses and ten she-camels, and a treasury of money;[FN#307] and he charged him to love and cherish his daughter the Lady Budur. Then the King accompanied them to the farthest limits of his Islands where, going in to his daughter Budur in the litter, he kissed her and strained her to his bosom, weeping and repeating,\n\n\"O thou who wooest Severance, easy fare! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     For love-embrace belongs to lover-friend:\nFare softly! Fortune's nature falsehood is, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And parting shall love's every meeting end.\"\n\nThen leaving his daughter, he went to her husband and bade him farewell and kissed him; after which he parted from them and, giving the order for the march he returned to his capital with his troops. The Prince and Princess and their suite fared on without stopping through the first day and the second and the third and the fourth, nor did they cease faring for a whole month till they came to a spacious champaign, abounding in pasturage, where they pitched their tents; and they ate and drank and rested, and the Princess Budur lay down to sleep. Presently, Kamar al-Zaman went in to her and found her lying asleep clad in a shift of apricot-coloured silk that showed all and everything; and on her head was a coif of gold-cloth embroidered with pearls and jewels. The breeze raised her shift which laid bare her navel and showed her breasts and displayed a stomach whiter than snow, each one of whose dimples would contain an ounce of benzoin- ointment.[FN#308] At this sight, his love and longing redoubled, and he began reating,\n\n\"An were it asked me when by hell-fire burnt, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When flames of heart my vitals hold and hem,\n'Which wouldst thou chose, say wouldst thou rather them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Or drink sweet cooling draught?' I'd answer, 'Them!' \"\n\nThen he put his hand to the band of her petticoat-trousers and drew it and loosed it, for his soul lusted after her, when he saw a jewel, red as dye-wood, made fast to the band. He untied it and examined it and, seeing two lines of writing graven thereon, in a character not to be read, marvelled and said in his mind, \"Were not this bezel something to her very dear she had not bound it to her trousers-band nor hidden it in the most privy and precious place about her person, that she might not be parted from it. Would I knew what she cloth with this and what is the secret that is in it.\" So saying, he took it and went outside the tent to look at it in the light,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he took the bezel to look at it in the light, the while he was holding it behold, a bird swooped down on him and, snatching the same from his hand, flew off with it and then lighted on the ground. There-upon Kamar al-Zaman fearing to lose the jewel, ran after the bird; but it flew on before him, keeping just out of his reach, and ceased not to draw him on from dale to dale and from hill to hill, till the night starkened and the firmament darkened, when it roosted on a high tree. So Kamar al-Zaman stopped under the tree confounded in thought and faint for famine and fatigue, and giving himself up for lost, would have turned back, but knew not the way whereby he came, for that darkness had overtaken him. Then he exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious the Great!\"; and laying him down under the tree (whereon was the bird) slept till the morning, when he awoke and saw the bird also wake up and fly away. He arose and walked after it, and it flew on little by little before him, after the measure of his faring; at which he smiled and said, \"By Allah, a strange thing! Yesterday, this bird flew before me as fast as I could run, and to-day, knowing that I have awoke tired and cannot run, he flieth after the measure of my faring. By Allah, this is wonderful! But I must needs follow this bird whether it lead me to death or to life; and I will go wherever it goeth, for at all events it will not abide save in some inhabited land.[FN#309] So he continued to follow the bird which roosted every night upon a tree; and he ceased not pursuing it for a space of ten days, feeding on the fruits of the earth and drinking of its waters. At the end of this time, he came in sight of an inhabited city, whereupon the bird darted off like the glance of the eye and, entering the town, disappeared from Kamar al-Zaman, who knew not what it meant or whither it was gone; so he marvelled at this and exclaimed, \"Praise be to Allah who hath brought me in safety to this city!\" Then he sat down by a stream and washed his hands and feet and face and rested awhile; and, recalling his late easy and pleasant life of union with his beloved and contrasting it with his present plight of trouble and fatigue and distress and strangerhood and famine and severance, the tears streamed from his eyes and he began repeating these cinquains,\n\n\"Pain had I hid thy handwork, but it showed, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Changed sleep for wake, and wake with me abode:\nWhen thou didst spurn my heart I cried aloud *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Pate, hold thy hand and cease to gird and goad:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          In dole and danger aye my sprite I spy!\nAn but the Lord of Love were just to me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Sleep fro' my eyelids ne'er were forced to flee.\nPity, my lady, one for love o' thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Prom his tribes darling brought to low degree:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Love came and doomed Wealth beggar-death to die.\nThe railers chide at thee: I ne'er gainsay, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But stop my ears and dumbly sign them Nay:\n'Thou lov'st a slender may,' say they; I say, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'I've picked her out and cast the rest away:'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Enough; when Fate descends she blinds man's\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          eye!\"[FN#310]\n\nAnd as soon as he had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he rose and walked on little by little, till he entered the city.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as Kamar al-Zaman had finished his poetry and had taken his rest, he arose and entered the city-gate[FN#311] not knowing whither he should wend. He crossed the city from end to end, entering by the land-gate, and ceased not faring on till he came out at the sea- gate, for the city stood on the sea-shore. Yet he met not a single one of its citizens. And after issuing from the land-gate he fared forwards and ceased not faring till he found himself among the orchards and gardens of the place; and, passing among the trees presently came to a garden and stopped before its door; where-upon the keeper came out to him and saluted him. The Prince returned his greeting and the gardener bade him welcome, saying, \"Praised be Allah that thou hast come off safe from the dwellers of this city! Quick, come into the garth, ere any of the townfolk see thee.\" Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered that garden, wondering in mind, and asked the keeper, \"What may be the history of the people of this city and who may they be?\" The other answered, \"Know that the people of this city are all Magians: but Allah upon thee, tell me how thou camest to this city and what caused thy coming to our capital.\" Accordingly Kamar al-Zaman told the gardener all that had befallen him from beginning to end, whereat he marvelled with great marvel and said, \"Know, O my son, that the cities of Al-Islam lie far from us; and between us and them is a four months' voyage by sea and a whole twelve months' journey by land. We have a ship which saileth every year with merchandise to the nearest Moslem country and which entereth the seas of the Ebony Islands and thence maketh the Khalidan Islands, the dominions of King Shahriman.\" Thereupon Kamar al- Zaman considered awhile and concluded that he could not do better than abide in the garden with the gardener and become his assistant, receiving for pay one fourth of the produce. So he said to him, \"Wilt thou take me into thy service, to help thee in this garden?\" Answered the gardener, \"To hear is to consent;\" and began teaching him to lead the water to the roots of the trees. So Kamar al-Zaman abode with him, watering the trees and hoeing up the weeds and wearing a short blue frock which reached to his knees. And he wept floods of tears; for he had no rest day or night, by reason of his strangerhood and he ceased not to repeat verses upon his beloved, amongst others the following couplets,\n\n\n\"Ye promised us and will ye not keep plight? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ye said a say and shall not deed be dight?\nWe wake for passion while ye slumber and sleep; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Watchers and wakers claim not equal right:\nWe vowed to keep our loves in secrecy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But spake the meddler and you spoke forthright:\nO friend in pain and pleasure, joy and grief, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In all case you, you only, claim my sprite!\nMid folk is one who holds my prisoned heart; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would he but show some ruth for me to sight.\nNot every eye like mine is wounded sore, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Not every heart like mine love-pipings blight:\nYe wronged me saying, Love is wrongous aye *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yea! ye were right, events have proved that quite.\nForget they one love-thralled, whose faith the world *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Robs not, though burn the fires in heart alight:\nIf an my foeman shall become my judge, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whom shall I sue to remedy his despight?\nHad not I need of love nor love had sought, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My heart forsure were not thus love-distraught.\"\n\nSuch was the case with Kamar al-Zaman; but as regards his wife, the Lady Budur, when she awoke she sought her husband and found him not: then she saw her petticoat-trousers undone, for the band had been loosed and the bezel lost, whereupon she said to herself, \"By Allah, this is strange! Where is my husband? It would seem as if he had taken the talisman and gone away, knowing not the secret which is in it. Would to Heaven I knew whither can he have wended! But it must needs have been some extraordinary matter that drew him away, for he cannot brook to leave me a moment. Allah curse the stone and damn its hour!\" Then she considered awhile and said in her mind, \"If I go out and tell the varlets and let them learn that my husband is lost they will lust after me: there is no help for it but that I use stratagem. So she rose and donned some of her husband's clothes and riding- boots, and a turband like his, drawing one corner of it across her face for a mouth-veil.[FN#312] Then, setting a slave-girl in her litter, she went forth from the tent and called to the pages who brought her Kamar al-Zaman's steed; and she mounted and bade them load the beasts and resume the march. So they bound on the burdens and departed; and she concealed her trick, none doubting but she was Kamar al-Zaman, for she favoured him in face and form; nor did she cease journeying, she and her suite, days and nights, till they came in sight of a city overlooking the Salt Sea, where they pitched their tents without the walls and halted to rest. The Princess asked the name of the town and was told, \"It is called the City of Ebony; its King is named Arman\u00fas, and he hath a daughter Hay\u00e1t al-Nuf\u00fas[FN#313] hight,\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur halted within sight of the Ebony City to take her rest, King Armanus sent a messenger, to learn what King it was who had encamped without his capital; so the messenger, coming to the tents, made inquiry anent their King, and was told that she was a King's son who had lost the way being bound for the Khalidan Islands; whereupon he returned to King Armanus with the tidings; and, when the King heard them, he straightway rode out with the lords of his land to greet the stranger on arrival. As he drew near the tents the Lady Budur came to meet him on foot, whereupon the King alighted and they saluted each other. Then he took her to the city and, bringing her up to the palace, bade them spread the tables and trays of food and commanded them to transport her company and baggage to the guess house. So they abode there three days; at the end of which time the King came in to the Lady Budur. Now she had that day gone to the Hammam and her face shone as the moon at its full, a seduction to the world and a rending of the veil of shame to mankind; and Armanus found her clad in a -suit of silk, embroidered with gold and jewels; so he said to her, 'O my son, know that I am a very old man, decrepit withal, and Allah hath blessed me with no child save one daughter, who resembleth thee in beauty and grace; and I am now waxed unfit for the conduct of the state. She is shine, O my son; and, if this my land please thee and thou be willing to abide and make thy home here, I will marry thee to her and give thee my kingdom and so be at rest.\" When Princess Budur heard this, she bowed her head and her forehead sweated for shame, and she said to herself. \"How shall I do, and I a woman? If I refuse and depart from him, I cannot be safe but that haply send after me troops to slay me; and if I consent, belike I shall be put to shame. I have lost my beloved Kamar al-Zaman and know not what is become of him; nor can I escape from this scrape save by holding my peace and consenting and abiding here, till Allah bring about what is to be.\" So she raised her head and made submission to King Armanus, saying, \"Hearkening and obedience!\"; whereat he rejoiced and bade the herald make proclamation throughout the Ebony Islands to hold high festival and decorate the houses. Then he assembled his Chamberlains and Nabobs, and Emirs and Wazirs and his officers of state and the Kazis of the city; and, formally abdicating his Sultanate, endowed Budur therewith and invested her in all the vestments of royalty. The Emirs and Grandees went in to her and did her homage, nothing doubting but that she was a young man, and all who looked on her bepissed their bag-trousers, for the excess of her beauty and loveliness. Then, after the Lady Budur had been made Sultan and the drums had been beaten in announcement of the glad event, and she had been ceremoniously enthroned, King Armanus proceeded to equip his daughter Hayat al-Nufus for marriage, and in a few days, they brought the Lady Budur in to her, when they seemed as it were two moons risen at one time or two suns in conjunction. So they entered the bridal-chamber and the doors were shut and the curtains let down upon them, after the attendants had lighted the wax-candles and spread for them the carpet-bed. When Budur found herself alone with the Princess Hayat al-Nufus, she called to mind her beloved Kamar al-Zaman and grief was sore upon her. So she wept for his absence, and estrangement and she began repeating,\n\n\"O ye who fled and left my heart in pain low li'en, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     No breath of life if found within this frame of mine:\nI have an eye which e'er complains of wake, but lo! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tears occupy it would that wake content these eyne!\nAfter ye marched forth the lover 'bode behind; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Question of him what pains your absence could design!\nBut for the foods of tears mine eyelids rail and rain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My fires would flame on high and every land calcine.\nTo Allah make I moan of loved ones lost for aye, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who for my pine and pain no more shall pain and pine:\nI never wronged them save that over love I nurst: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Love departs us lovers into blest and curst.\"\n\nAnd when she had finished her repeating, the Lady Budur sat down beside the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and kissed her on the mouth; after which rising abruptly, she made the minor ablution and betook herself to her devotions; nor did she leave praying till Hayat al-Nufus fell asleep, when she slips into bed and lay with her back to her till morning. And when day had broke the King and Queen came in to their daughter and asked her how she did. whereupon she told them what she had seen, and repeated to them the verses she had heard. Thus far concerning Hayat al-Nufus and her father; but as regards Queen Budur she went forth and seated herself upon the royal throne and all the Emirs and Captains and Officers of state came up to her and wished her joy of the kingship, kissing the earth before her and calling down blessings upon her. And she accosted them with smiling face and clad them in robes of honour, augmenting the fiefs of the high officials and giving largesse to the levies; wherefore all the people loved her and offered up prayers for the long endurance of her reign, doubting not but that she was a man. And she ceased not sitting all day in the hall of audience, bidding and forbidding; dispensing justice, releasing prisoners and remitting the customs-dues, till nightfall, when she withdrew to the apartment prepared for her. Here she found Hayat al-Nufus seated, so she sat down by her side and, clapping her on the back, coaxed and caressed her and kissed her between the eyes, and fell to versifying in these couplets,\n\n\"What secret kept I these my tears have told, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And my waste body must my love unfold:\nThough hid my pine, my plight on parting day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To every envious eye my secret sold:\nO ye who broke up camp, you've left behind *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    My spirit wearied and my heart a-cold:\nIn my hearts core ye dwell, and now these eyne *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Roll blood-drops with the tears they whilome rolled:\nThe absent will I ransom with my soul; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     All can my yearning for their sight behold:\nI have an eye whose babe,[FN#314] for love of thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rejected sleep nor hath its tears controlled.\nThe foeman bids me patient bear his loss, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ne'er may mine ears accept the ruth he doled!\nI tricks their deme of me, and won my wish *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of Kamar al-Zaman's joys manifold:\nHe joins all perfect gifts like none before, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Boasted such might and main no King of old:\nSeeing his gifts, Bin Z\u00e1'idah's[FN#315] largesse *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Forget we, and Mu'\u00e1wiyah mildest-soul'd:[FN#316]\nWere verse not feeble and o'er short the time *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I had in laud of him used all of rhyme.\"\n\nThen Queen Budur stood up and wiped away her tears and, making the lesser ablution,[FN#317] applied her to pray: nor did she give over praying till drowsiness overcame the Lady Hayat al- Nufus and she slept, whereupon the Lady Budur came and lay by her till the morning. At daybreak, she arose and prayed the dawn- prayer; and presently seated herself on the royal throne and passed the day in ordering and counter ordering and giving laws and administering justice. This is how it fared with her; but as regards King Armanus he went in to his daughter and asked her how she did; so she told him all that had befallen her and repeated to him the verses which Queen Budur had recited, adding, \"O my father, never saw I one more abounding in sound sense and modesty than my husband, save that he cloth nothing but weep and sigh.\" He answered, \"O my daughter, have patience with him yet this third night, and if he go not in unto thee and do away thy maidenhead, we shall know how to proceed with him and oust him from the throne and banish him the country.\" And on this wise he agreed with his daughter what course he would take.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Tenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Armanus had agreed with his daughter on this wise and had determined what course he would take and night came on, Queen Budur arose from the throne of her kingdom and betaking herself to the palace, entered the apartment prepared for her. There she found the wax-candles lighted and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus seated and awaiting her; whereupon she bethought her of her husband and what had betided them both of sorrow and severance in so short a space; she wept and sighed and groaned groan upon groan, and began improvising these couplets,\n\n\"News of my love fill all the land, I swear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     As suns on Ghaz\u00e1[FN#318]-wold rain heat and glare:\nSpeaketh his geste but hard its sense to say; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thus never cease to grow my cark and care:\nI hate fair Patience since I loved thee; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     E'er sawest lover hate for love to bear?\nA glance that dealt love-sickness dealt me death, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Glances are deadliest things with torments rare:\nHe shook his love locks down and bared his chin, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whereby I spied his beauties dark and fair:\nMy care, my cure are in his hands; and he *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who caused their dolour can their dole repair:\nHis belt went daft for softness of his waist; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     His hips, for envy, to uprise forbear:\nHis brow curl-diademed is murky night; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unveil 't and lo! bright Morn shows brightest light.\"\n\nWhen she had finished her versifying, she would have risen to pray, but, lo and behold! Hayat al-Nufus caught her by the skirt and clung to her saying, \"O my lord, art thou not ashamed before my father, after all his favour, to neglect me at such a time as this?\" When Queen Budur heard her words, she sat down in the same place and said, \"O my beloved, what is this thou sayest?\" She replied, \"What I say is that I never saw any so proud of himself as thou. Is every fair one so disdainful? I say not this to incline thee to me; I say it only of my fear for thee from King Armanus; because he purposeth, unless thou go in unto me this very night, and do away my maidenhead, to strip thee of the kingship on the morrow and banish thee his kingdom; and peradventure his excessive anger may lead him to slay thee. But I, O my lord, have ruth on thee and give thee fair warning; and it is thy right to reck.\"[FN#319] Now when Queen Budur heard her speak these words, she bowed her head ground-wards awhile in sore perplexity and said in herself, \"If I refuse I'm lost; and if I obey I'm shamed. But I am now Queen of all the Ebony Islands and they are under my rule, nor shall I ever again meet my Kamar al- Zaman save in this place; for there is no way for him to his native land but through the Ebony Islands. Verily, I know not what to do in my present case, but I commit my care to Allah who directeth all for the best, for I am no man that I should arise and open this virgin girl.\" Then quoth Queen Budur to Hayat al- Nufus, \"O my beloved, that I have neglected thee and abstained from thee is in my own despite.\" And she told her her whole story from beginning to end and showed her person to her, saying, \"I conjure thee by Allah to keep my counsel, for I have concealed my case only that Allah may reunite me with my beloved Kamar al- Zaman and then come what may.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eleventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Lady Budur acquainted Hayat al-Nufus with her history and bade her keep it secret, the Princess heard her with extreme wonderment and was moved to pity and prayed Allah to reunite her with her beloved, saying, \"Fear nothing, O my sister; but have patience till Allah bring to pass that which must come to pass:\" and she began repeating,\n\n\"None but the men of worth a secret keep;\nWith worthy men a secret's hidden deep;\nAs in a room, so secrets lie with me,\nWhose door is sealed, lock shot and lost the key.\"[FN#320]\n\nAnd when Hayat al-Nufus had ended her verses, she said, \"O my sister, verily the breasts of the noble and brave are of secrets the grave; and I will not discover shine.\" Then they toyed and embraced and kissed and slept till near the Mu'ezzin's call to dawn prayer, when Hayat al-Nufus arose and took a pigeon-poult,[FN#321] and cut its throat over her smock and besmeared herself with its blood. Then she pulled off her petticoat-trousers and cried aloud, where-upon her people hastened to her and raised the usual lullilooing and outcries of joy and gladness. Presently her mother came in to her and asked her how she did and busied herself about her and abode with her till evening; whilst the Lady Budur arose with the dawn, and repaired to the bath and, after washing herself pure, proceeded to the hall of audience, where she sat down on her throne and dispensed justice among the folk. Now when King Armanus heard the loud cries of joy, he asked what was the matter and was informed of the consummation of his daughter's marriage; whereat he rejoiced and his breast swelled with gladness and he made a great marriage-feast whereof the merry-making lasted a long time. Such was their case: but as regards King Shahriman it was on this wise. After his son had fared forth to the chase accompanied by Marzawan, as before related, he tarried patiently awaiting their return at nightfall; but when his son did not appear he passed a sleepless night and the dark hours were longsome upon him; his restlessness was excessive, his excitement grew upon him and he thought the morning would never dawn. Anc when day broke he sat expecting his son and waited till noon, but he came not; whereat his heart forebode separation and was fired with fears for Kamar al-Zaman; and he cried, \"Alas! my son!\" and he wept till his clothes were drenched with tears, and repeated with a beating heart,\n\n\n\"Love's votaries I ceased not to oppose, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Till doomed to taste Love's bitter and Love's sweet:\nI drained his rigour-cup to very dregs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Self humbled at its slaves' and freemen's feet:\nFortune had sworn to part the loves of us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     She kept her word how truly, well I weet!\"\n\nAnd when he ended his verse, he wiped away his tears and bade his troops make ready for a march and prepare for a long expedition. So they all mounted and set forth, headed by the Sultan, whose heart burnt with grief and was fired with anxiety for his son Kamar al-Zaman; and they advanced by forced marches. Now the King divided his host into six divisions, a right wing and a left wing, a vanguard and a rear guard;[FN#322] and bade them rendezvous for the morrow at the cross-roads. Accordingly they separated and scoured the country all the rest of that day till night, and they marched through the night and at noon of the ensuing day they joined company at the place where four roads met. But they knew not which the Prince followed, till they saw the sign of torn clothes and sighted shreds of flesh and beheld blood still sprinkled by the way and they noted every piece of the clothes and fragment of mangled flesh scattered on all sides. Now when King Shahriman saw this, he cried from his heart-core a loud cry, saying, \"Alas, my son!\"; and buffeted his face and plucks his beard and rent his raiment, doubting not but his son was dead. Then he gave himself up to excessive weeping and wailing, and the troops also wept for his weeping, all being assured that Prince Kamar al-Zaman had perished. They threw dust on their heads, and the night surprised them shedding tears and lamenting till they were like to die. Then the King with a heart on fire and with burning sighs spake these couplets,\n\n\"Chide not the mourner for bemourning woe; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Enough is yearning every Ill to show:\nHe weeps for stress of sorrow and of pain, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And these to thee best evidence his lowe:\nHappy![FN#323] of whom Love sickness swore that ne'er *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Should cease his eye lids loving tears to flow:\nHe mourns the loss of fairest, fullest Moon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shining o'er all his peers in glorious glow:\nBut death made drink a brimming cup, what day *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     He fared from natal country fain to go:\nHis home left he and went from us to grief; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor to his brethren could he say adieu:\nYea, his loss wounded me with parting pangs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And separation cost me many a throe:\nHe fared farewelling, as he fared, our eyes; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Whenas his Lord vouch-safed him Paradise.\"\n\nAnd when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twelfth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to his capital, giving up his son for lost, and deeming that wild beasts or banditti had set upon him and torn him to pieces; and made proclamation that all in the Khalidan Islands should don black in mourning for him. Moreover, he built, in his memory, a pavilion, naming it House of Lamentations; and on Mondays and Thursdays he devoted himself to the business of the state and ordering the affairs of his levies and lieges; and the rest of the week he was wont to spend in the House of Lamentations, mourning for his son and bewailing him with elegiac verses,[FN#324] of which the following are some:\u2014\n\n\"My day of bliss is that when thou appearest; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My day of bale[FN#325] is that whereon thou farest:\nThough through the night I quake in dread of death; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Union wi' thee is of all bliss the dearest.\"\n\nAnd again he said,\n\n\"My soul be sacrifice for one, whose going *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Afflicted hearts with sufferings sore and dread:\nLet joy her widowed term[FN#326] fulfil, for I *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Divorced joy with the divorce thrice-said.\"[FN#327]\n\nSuch was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Queen Budur daughter of King Ghayur, she abode as ruler in the Ebony Islands, whilst the folk would point to her with their fingers, and say, \"Yonder is the son-in-law of King Armanus.\" And every night she lay with Hayat al-Nufus, to whom she lamented her desolate state and longing for her husband Kamar al-Zaman; weeping and describing to her his beauty and loveliness, and yearning to enjoy him though but in a dream: And at times she would repeat,\n\n\"Well Allah wots that since my severance from thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I wept till forced to borrow tears at usury:\n'Patience!' my blamer cried, 'Heartsease right soon shalt see!' *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Quoth I, 'Say, blamer, where may home of Patience be?'\"\n\nThis is how it fared with Queen Budur; but as regards Kamar al- Zaman, he abode with the gardener in the garden for no short time, weeping night and day and repeating verses bewailing the past time of enjoyment and delight; whilst the gardener kept comforting him and assuring him that the ship would set sail for the land of the Moslems at the end of the year. And in this condition he continued till one day he saw the folk crowding together and wondered at this; but the gardener came in to him and said, \"O my son, give over work for this day nor lead water to the trees; for it is a festival day, whereon folk visit one another. So take thy rest and only keep shine eye on the garden, whilst I go look after the ship for thee; for yet but a little while and I send thee to the land of the Moslems.\" Upon this, he went forth from the garden leaving to himself Kamar al-Zaman, who fell to musing upon his case till his heart was like to break and the tears streamed from his eyes. So he wept with excessive weeping till he swooned away and, when he recovered, he rose and walked about the garden, pondering what Time had done with him and bewailing the long endurance of his estrangement and separation from those he loved. As he was thus absorbed in melancholy thought, his foot stumbled and he fell on his face, his forehead striking against the projecting root of a tree; and the blow cut it open and his blood ran down and mingled with his tears Then he rose and, wiping away the blood, dried his tears and bound his brow with a piece of rag; then continued his walk about the garden engrossed by sad reverie. Presently, he looked up at a tree and saw two birds quarrelling thereon, and one of them rose up and smote the other with its beak on the neck and severed from its body its head, wherewith it flew away, whilst the slain bird fell to the ground before Kamar al-Zaman. As it lay, behold, two great birds swooped down upon it alighting, one at the head and the other at the tail, and both drooped their wings and bowed their bills over it and, extending their necks towards it, wept. Kamar al-Zaman also wept when seeing the birds thus bewail their mate, and called to mind his wife and father, And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman wept and lamented his separation from spouse and sire, when he beheld those two birds weeping over their mate. Then he looked at the twain and saw them dig a grave and therein bury the slain bird; after which they flew away far into the firmament and disappeared for a while; but presently they returned with the murtherer-bird and, alighting on the grave of the murthered, stamped on the slayer till they had done him to death. Then they rent his belly and tearing out his entrails, poured the blood on the grave of the slain[FN#328]: moreover, they stripped off his skin and tare his flesh in pieces and, pulling out the rest of the bowels, scattered them hither and thither. All this while Kamar al-Zaman was watching them wonderingly; but presently, chancing to look at the place where the two birds had slain the third, he saw therein something gleaming. So he drew near to it and noted that it was the crop of the dead bird. Whereupon he took it and opened it and found the talisman which had been the cause of his separation from his wife. But when he saw it and knew it, he fell to the ground a-fainting for joy; and, when he revived, he said, \"Praised be Allah! This is a foretaste of good and a presage of reunion with my beloved.\" Then he examined the jewel and passed it over his eyes[FN#329]; after which he bound it to his forearm, rejoicing in coming weal, and walked about till nightfall awaiting the gardener's return; and when he came not, he lay down and slept in his wonted place. At daybreak he rose to his work and, girding his middle with a cord of palm- fibre, took hatchet and basket and walked down the length of the garden, till he came to a carob-tree and struck the axe into its roots. The blow rang and resounded; so he cleared away the soil from the place and discovered a trap-door and raised it.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen It was the Two Hundred and Fourteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar al-Zaman raised the trap-door, he found a winding stair, which he descended and came to an ancient vault of the time of Ad and Tham\u00fad,[FN#330] hewn out of the rock. Round the vault stood many brazen vessels of the bigness of a great oil-jar which he found full of gleaming red gold: whereupon he said to himself, \"Verily sorrow is gone and solace is come!\" Then he mounted from the souterrain to the garden and, replacing the trap-door as it was before, busied himself in conducting water to the trees till the last of the day, when the gardener came back and said to him, \"O my son, rejoice at the good tidings of a speedy return to thy native land: the merchants are ready equipped for the voyage and the ship in three days' time will set sail for the City of Ebony, which is the first of the cities of the Moslems, and after making it, thou must travel by land a six months' march till thou come to the Islands of Khalidan, the dominions of King Shahriman.\" At this Kamar al-Zaman rejoiced and began repeating,\n\n\"Part not from one whose wont is not to part from you; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor with your cruel taunts an innocent mortify:\nAnother so long parted had ta'en heart from you, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And had his whole condition changed,\u2014but not so I.\"\n\nThen he kissed the gardener's hand and said, \"O my father, even as thou hast brought me glad tidings, so I also have great good news for thee,' and told him anent his discovery of the vault; whereat the gardener rejoiced and said, \"O my son, fourscore years have I dwelt in this garden and have never hit on aught whilst thou, who hast not sojourned with me a year, hast discovered this thing; wherefore it is Heaven's gift to thee, which shall end thy crosses and aid thee to rejoin thy folk and foregather with her thou lovest.\" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, \"There is no help but it must be shared between me and thee.\" Then he carried him to the underground-chamber and showed him the gold, which was in twenty jars: he took ten and the gardener ten, and the old man said to him, \"O my son, fill thyself leather bottles[FN#331] with the sparrow-olives[FN#332] which grow in this garden, for they are not found except in our land; and the merchants carry them to all parts. Lay the gold in the bottles and strew it over with olives: then stop them and cover them and take them with thee in the ship.\" So Kamar al-Zaman arose without stay or delay and took fifty leather bottles and stored in each somewhat of the gold, and closed each one after placing a layer of olives over the gold; and at the bottom of one of the bottles he laid the talisman. Then sat he down to talk with the gardener, confident of speedy reunion with his own people and saying to himself, \"When I come to the Ebony Islands I will journey thence to my father's country and enquire for my beloved Budur. Would to Heaven I knew whether she returned to her own land or journeyed on to my father's country or whether there befel her any accident by the way.\" And he began versifying,\n\n\"Love in my breast they lit and fared away, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And far the land wherein my love is pent:\nFar lies the camp and those who camp therein; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Par is her tent-shrine, where I ne'er shall tent.\nPatience far deaf me when from me they fled; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Sleep failed mine eyes, endurance was forspent:\nThey left and with them left my every joy, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Wending with them, nor find I peace that went:\nThey made these eyes roll down love tears in flood, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lacking them these eyne with tears are drent.\nWhen my taste spins once again would see them, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     When pine and expectation but augment,\nIn my heart's core their counterfeits I trace, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With love and yearning to behold their grace.\"\n\nThen, while he awaited the end of the term of days, he told the gardener the tale of the birds and what had passed between them; whereat the hearer wondered; and they both lay down and slept till the morning. The gardener awoke sick and abode thus two days; but on the third day, his sickness increased on him, till they despaired of his life and Kamar al-Zaman grieved with sore grief for him. Meanwhile behold, the Master and his crew came and enquired for the gardener; and, when Kamar al-Zaman told them that he was sick, they asked, \"Where be the youth who is minded to go with us to the Ebony Islands?\" \"He is your servent and he standeth before you!\" answered the Prince and bade them carry the bottles of olives to the ship; so they transported them, saying, \"Make haste, thou, for the wind is fair;\" and he replied, \"I hear and obey.\" Then he carried his provaunt on board and, returning to bid the gardener farewell, found him in the agonies of death; so he sat down at his head and closed his eyes, and his soul departed his body; whereupon he laid him out and committed him to the earth unto the mercy of Allah Almighty. Then he made for the ship but found that she had already weighed anchor and set sail; nor did she cease to cleave the seas till she disappeared from his sight. So he went back to whence he came heavy-hearted with whirling head; and neither would he address a soul nor return a reply; and reaching the garden and sitting down in cark and care he threw dust on his head and buffeted his cheeks.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Fifteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the ship sped on her course, Kamar al-Zaman returned to the garden in cark and care; but- anon he rented the place of its owner and hired a man to help him in irrigating the trees. Moreover, he repaired the trap-door and he went to the underground chamber and bringing the rest of the gold to grass, stowed it in other fifty bottles which he filled up with a layer of olives. Then he enquired of the ship and they told him that it sailed but once a year, at which his trouble of mind redoubled and he cried sore for that which had betided him, above all for the loss of the Princess Budur's talisman, and spent his nights and days weeping and repealing verses. Such was his case; but as regards the ship she sailed with a favouring wind till she reached the Ebony Islands. Now by decree of destiny, Queen Budur was sitting at a lattice-window overlooking the sea and saw the galley cast anchor upon the strand. At this sight, her heart throbbed and she took horse with the Chamberlains and Nabobs and, riding down to the shore, halted by the ship, whilst the sailors broke bulk and bore the bales to the storehouses; after which she called the captain to her presence and asked what he had with him. He answered \"O King, I have with me in this ship aromatic drugs and cosmetics and healing powders and ointments and plasters and precious metals and rich stuffs and rugs of Yemen leather, not to be borne of mule or camel, and all manner of otters and spices and perfumes, civet and ambergris and camphor and Sumatra aloes-wood, and tamerinds[FN#333] and sparrow-olives to boot, such as are rare to find in this country.\" When she heard talk of sparrow- olives her heart longed for them and she said to the ship-master, \"How much of olives hast thou?\" He replied, \"Fifty bottles full, but their owner is not with us, so the King shall take what he will of them.\" Quoth she, \"Bring them ashore, that I may see them.'' Thereupon he called to the sailors, who brought her the fifty bottles; and she opened one and, looking at the olives, said to the captain, \"I will take the whole fifty and pay you their value, whatso it be.\" He answered, \"By Allah, O my lord, they have no value in our country; moreover their shipper tarried behind us, and he is a poor man.\" Asked she, \"And what are they worth here?\" and he answered \"A thousand dirhams.\" \"I will take them at a thousand,\" she said and bade them carry the fifty bottles to the palace. When it was night, she called for a bottle of olives and opened it, there being none in the room but herself and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then, placing a dish before her she turned into it the contents of the jar, when there fell out into the dish with the olives a heap of red gold; and she said to the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, \"This is naught but gold!\" So she sent for the rest of the bottles and found them all full of precious metal and scarce enough olives to fill a single jar. Moreover, she sought among the gold and found therein the talisman, which she took and examined and behold, it was that which Kamar al- Zaman had taken from off the band of her petticoat trousers. Thereupon she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Sixteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Budur saw the talisman she cried out for joy and slipped down in a swoon; and when she recovered she said to herself, \"Verily, this talisman was the cause of my separation from my beloved Kamar al-Zaman; but now it is an omen of good.\" Then she showed it to Hayat al-Nufus and said to her, \"This was the cause of disunion and now, please Allah, it shall be the cause of reunion.\" As soon as day dawned she seated herself on the royal throne and sent for the ship-master, who came into the presence and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, \"Where didst thou leave the owner of these olives?\" Quoth he, \"O King of the age, we left him in the land of the Magians and he is a gardener there.\" She rejoined, \"Except thou bring him to me, thou knowest not the harm which awaiteth thee and thy ship.\" Then she bade them seal up the magazines of the merchants and said to them, \"Verily the owner of these olives hath borrowed of me and I have a claim upon him for debt and, unless ye bring him to me, I will without fail do you all die and seize your goods.\" So they went to the captain and promised him the hire of the ship, if he would go and return a second time, saying, \"Deliver us from this masterful tyrant.\" Accordingly the skipper embarked and set sail and Allah decreed him a prosperous voyage, till he came to the Island of the Magians and, landing by night, went up to the garden. Now the night was long upon Kamar al-Zaman, and he sat, bethinking him of his beloved, and bewailing what had befallen him and versifying,\n\n\"A night whose stars refused to run their course, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     A night of those which never seem outworn:\nLike Resurrection-day, of longsome length[FN#334] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     To him that watched and waited for the morn.\"\n\nNow at this moment, the captain knocked at the garden-gate, and Kamar al-Zaman opened and went out to him, whereupon the crew seized him and went down with him on board the ship and set sail forthright; and they ceased not voyaging days and nights, whilst Kamar al-Zaman knew not why they dealt thus with him; but when he questioned them they replied, \"Thou hast offended against the Lord of the Ebony Islands, the son-in-law of King Armanus, and thou hast stolen his monies, miserable that thou art!\" Said he, \"By Allah! I never entered that country nor do I know where it is!\" However, they fared on with him, till they made the Ebony Islands and landing, carried him up to the Lady Budur, who knew him at sight and said, \"Leave him with the eunuchs, that they may take him to the bath.\" Then she relieved the merchants of the embargo and gave the captain a robe of honour worth ten thousand pieces of gold; and, after returning to the palace, she went in that night to the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and told her what had passed, saying, \"Keep thou my counsel, till I accomplish my purpose, and do a deed which shall be recorded and shall be read by Kings and commoners after we be dead and gone.\" And when she gave orders that they bear Kamar al-Zaman to the bath, they did so and clad him in a royal habit so that, when he came forth, he resembled a willow-bough or a star which shamed the greater and lesser light[FN#335] and its glow, and his life and soul returned to his frame. Then he repaired to the palace and went in to the Princess Budur; and when she saw him she schooled her heart to patience, till she should have accomplished her purpose; and she bestowed on him Mamelukes and eunuchs, camels and mules. Moreover, she gave him a treasury of money and she ceased not advancing him from dignity to dignity, till she made him Lord High Treasurer and committed to his charge all the treasures of the state; and she admitted him to familiar favour and acquainted the Emirs with his rank and dignity. And all loved him, for Queen Budur did not cease day by day to increase his allowances. As for Kamar al-Zaman, he was at a loss anent the reason of her thus honouring him; and he gave gifts and largesse out of the abundance of the wealth; and he devoted himself to the service of King Armanus; so that the King and all the Emirs and people, great and small, adored him and were wont to swear by his life. Nevertheless, he ever marvelled at the honour and favour shown him by Queen Budur and said to himself, \"By Allah, there needs must be a reason for this affection! Peradventure, this King favoureth me not with these immoderate favours save for some ill purpose and, therefore, there is no help but that I crave leave of him to depart his realm.\" So he went in to Queen Budur and said to her, \"O King, thou hast overwhelmed me with favours, but it will fulfil the measure of thy bounties if thou take from me all thou hast been pleased to bestow upon me, and permit me to depart.\" She smiled and asked, \"What maketh thee seek to depart and plunge into new perils, whenas thou art in the enjoyment of the highest favour and greatest prosperity?\" Answered Kamar al- Zaman, \"O King, verily this favour, if there be no reason for it, is indeed a wonder of wonders, more by token that thou hast advanced me to dignities such as befit men of age and experience, albeit I am as it were a young child.\" And Queen Budur rejoined, \"The reason is that I love thee for shine exceeding loveliness and thy surpassing beauty; and if thou wilt but grant me my desire of thy body, I will advance thee yet farther in honour and favour and largesse; and I will make thee Wazir, for all thy tender age even as the folk made me Sultan over them and I no older than thou; so that nowadays there is nothing strange when children take the head and by Allah, he was a gifted man who said,\n\n'It seems as though of Lot's tribe were our days, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And crave with love to advance the young in years.'\"[FN#336]\n\nWhen Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was abashed and his cheeks flushed till they seemed a-flame; and he said, \"I need not these favours which lead to the commission of sin; I will live poor in wealth but wealthy in virtue and honour.\" Quoth she, \"I am not to be duped by thy scruples, arising from prudery and coquettish ways; and Allah bless him who saith,\n\n'To him I spake of coupling, but he said to me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    How long this noyous long persistency?'\nBut when gold piece I showed him, he cried, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   'Who from the Almighty Sovereign e'er shall flee?'\"\n\nNow when Kamar al-Zaman, heard these words and understood her verses and their import, he said, \"O King, I have not the habit of these doings, nor have I strength to bear these heavy burthens for which elder than I have proved unable; then how will it be with my tender age?\" But she smiled at his speech and retorted, \"Indeed, it is a matter right marvellous how error springeth from the disorder of man's intendiment!! Since thou art a boy, why standest thou in fear of sin or the doing of things forbidden, seeing that thou art not yet come to years of canonical responsibility; and the offences of a child incur neither punishment nor reproof? Verily, thou hast committed thyself to a quibble for the sake of contention, and it is thy duty to bow before a proposal of fruition, so henceforward cease from denial and coyness, for the commandment of Allah is a decree foreordained:[FN#337] indeed, I have more reason than thou to fear falling and by sin to be misled; and well inspired was he who said,\n\n'My prickle is big and the little one said, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     'Thrust boldly in vitals with lion-like stroke!\nThen I, ' 'Tis a sin!; and he, 'No sin to me! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   So I had him at once with a counterfeit poke.\"[FN#338]\n\nWhen Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, the light became darkness in his sight and he said, \"O King, thou hast in thy household fair women and female slaves, who have not their like in this age: shall not these suffice thee without me? Do thy will with them and let me go!\" She replied, \"Thou sayest sooth, but it is not with them that one who loveth thee can heal himself of torment and can abate his fever; for, when tastes and inclinations are corrupted by vice, they hear and obey other than good advice. So leave arguing and listen to what the poet saith,\n\n'Seest not the bazar with its fruit in rows? *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     These men are for figs and for sycamore[FN#339] those!'\n\nAnd what another saith,\n\n'Many whose anklet rings are dumb have tinkling belts, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And this hath all content while that for want must wail:\nThou bidd'st me be a fool and quit thee for her charms; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Allah forfend I leave The Faith, turn Infidel!\nNay, by thy rights of side-beard mocking all her curls, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor mott nor maid[FN#340] from thee my heart shall spell.'\n\nAnd yet another,\n\n'O beauty's Union! love for thee's my creed, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Free choice of Faith and eke my best desire:\nWomen I have forsworn for thee; so may *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Deem me all men this day a shaveling friar.'[FN#341]\n\nAnd yet another,\n\n'Even not beardless one with girl, nor heed *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     The spy who saith to thee ''Tis an amiss!'\nFar different is the girl whose feet one kisses *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And that gazelle whose feet the earth must kiss.'\n\nAnd yet another,\n\n'A boy of twice ten is fit for a King!'\n\nAnd yet another,\n\n'The penis smooth and round was made with anus best to match it, * Had it been made for cunnus' sake it had been formed like hatchet!'\n\nAnd yet another said,\n\n'My soul thy sacrifice!

So he rose up with her, on this condition, and went with her to her own boudoir, that she might quench the lowe of her lust, saying, \"There is no Majesty, and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the fated decree of the All- powerful, the All-wise!\"; and he doffed his bag-trousers, shamefull and abashed, with the tears running from his eyes for stress of affright. Thereat she smiled and making him mount upon a couch with her, said to him, \"After this night, thou shalt see naught that will offend thee.\" Then she turned to him bussing and bosoming him and bending calf over calf, and said to him, \"Put thy hand between my thighs to the accustomed place; so haply it may stand up to prayer after prostration.\" He wept and cried, \"I am not good at aught of this,\" but she said, \"By my life, an thou do as I bid thee, it shall profit thee!\" So he put out his hand, with vitals a-fire for confusion, and found her thighs cooler than cream and softer than silk. The touching of them pleasured him and he moved his hand hither and thither, till it came to a dome abounding in good gifts and movements and shifts, and said in himself, \"Perhaps this King is a hermaphrodite,[FN#348] neither man nor woman quite;\" so he said to her, \"O King, I cannot find that thou hast a tool like the tools of men; what then moved thee to do this deed?\" Then loudly laughed Queen Budur till she fell on her back,[FN#349] and said, \"O my dearling, how quickly thou hast forgotten the nights we have lain together!\" Then she made herself known to him, and he knew her for his wife, the Lady Budur, daughter of King al-Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas. So he embraced her and she embraced him, and he kissed her and she kissed him; then they lay down on the bed of pleasure voluptuous, repeating the words of the poet,\n\n\"When his softly bending shape bid him close to my embrace *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Which clips him all about like the tendrils of the vine\nAnd shed a flood of softness on the hardness of his heart, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     He yielded though at first he was minded to decline;\nAnd dreading lest the railer's eye should light upon his form, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Came armoured with caution to baffle his design:\nHis waist makes moan of hinder cheeks that weigh upon his feet *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Like heavy load of merchandise upon young camel li'en;\nGirt with his glances scymitar which seemed athirst for blood, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And clad in mail of dusky curls that show the sheeniest\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     shine,\nHis fragrance wafted happy news of footstep coming nigh, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And to him like a bird uncaged I flew in straightest line:\nI spread my cheek upon his path, beneath his sandal-shoon, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And lo! the stibium[FN#350] of their dust healed all my hurt\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     of eyne.\nWith one embrace again I bound the banner of our loves[FN#351] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    And loosed the knot of my delight that bound in bonds\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    malign:\nThen bade I make high festival, and straight came flocking in *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Pure joys that know not grizzled age[FN#352] nor aught of\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     pain and pine:\nThe full moon dotted with the stars the lips and pearly teeth *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That dance right joyously upon the bubbling face of wine:\nSo in the prayer-niche of their joys I yielded me to what *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Would make the humblest penitent of sinner most indign.\nI swear by all the signs[FN#353] of those glories in his face *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I'll ne'er forget the Chapter entituled Al-Ikhlas.\"[FN#354]\n\nThen Queen Budur told Kamar al-Zaman all that had befallen her from beginning to end and he did likewise; after which he began to upbraid her, saying, \"What moved thee to deal with me as thou hast done this night?\" She replied, \"Pardon me! for I did this by way of jest, and that pleasure and gladness might be increased.\" And when dawned the morn and day arose with its sheen and shone, she sent to King Armanus, sire of the Lady Hayat al-Nufus, and acquainted him with the truth of the case and that she was wife to Kamar al-Zaman. Moreover, she told him their tale and the cause of their separation, and how his daughter was a virgin, pure as when she was born. He marvelled at their story with exceeding marvel and bade them chronicle it in letters of gold. Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said, \"O King's son, art thou minded to become my son-in-law by marrying my daughter?\" Replied he, \"I must consult the Queen Budur, as she hath a claim upon me for benefits without stint.\" And when he took counsel with her, she said, \"Right is thy recking; marry her and I will be her handmaid; for I am her debtor for kindness and favour and good offices, and obligations manifold, especially as we are here in her place and as the King her father hath whelmed us with benefits.\"[FN#355] Now when he saw that she inclined to this and was not jealous of Hayat al-Nufus, he agreed with her upon this matter.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Seventeenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al- Zaman agreed with his wife, Queen Budur, upon this matter and told King Armanus what she had said; whereat he rejoiced with great joy. Then he went out and, seating himself upon his chair of estate, assembled all the Wazirs, Emirs, Chamberlains and Grandees, to whom he related the whole story of Kamar al-Zaman and his wife, Queen Budur, from first to last; and acquainted them with his desire to marry his daughter Hayat al-Nufus to the Prince and make him King in the stead of Queen Budur. Whereupon said they all, \"Since he is the husband of Queen Budur, who hath been our King till now, whilst we deemed her son-in-law to King Armanus, we are all content to have him to Sultan over us; and we will be his servants, nor will we swerve from his allegiance.\" So Armanus rejoiced hereat and, summoning Kazis and witnesses and the chief officers of state, bade draw up the contract of marriage between Kamar al-Zaman and his daughter, the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then he held high festival, giving sumptuous marriage-feasts and bestowing costly dresses of honour upon all the Emirs and Captains of the host; moreover he distributed alms to the poor and needy and set free all the prisoners. The whole world rejoiced in the coming of Kamar al-Zaman to the throne, blessing him and wishing him endurance of glory and prosperity, renown and felicity; and, as soon as he became King, he remitted the customs-dues and released all men who remained in gaol. Thus he abode a long while, ordering himself worthily towards his lieges; and he lived with his two wives in peace, happiness, constancy and content, lying the night with each of them in turn. He ceased not after this fashion during many years, for indeed all his troubles and afflictions were blotted out from him and he forgot his father King Shahriman and his former estate of honour and favour with him. After a while Almighty Allah blessed him with two boy children, as they were two shining moons, through his two wives; the elder whose name was Prince Amjad,[FN#356] by Queen Budur, and the younger whose name was Prince As'ad by Queen Hayat al-Nufus; and this one was comelier than his brother. They were reared in splendour and tender affection, in respectful bearing and in the perfection of training; and they were instructed in penmanship and science and the arts of government and horsemanship, till they attained the extreme accomplishments and the utmost limit of beauty and loveliness; both men and women being ravished by their charms. They grew up side by side till they reached the age of seventeen, eating and drinking together and sleeping in one bed, nor ever parting at any time or tide; wherefore all the people envied them. Now when they came to man's estate and were endowed with every perfection, their father was wont, as often as he went on a journey, to make them sit in his stead by turns in the hall of judgement; and each did justice among the folk one day at a time. But it came to pass, by confirmed fate and determined lot, that love for As'ad (son of Queen Hayat al-Nufus) rose in the heart of Queen Budur, and that affection for Amjad (son of Queen Budur) rose in the heart of Queen Hayat al-Nufus.[FN#357] Hence it was that each of the women used to sport and play with the son of her sister-wife, kissing him and straining him to her bosom, whilst each mother thought that the other's behaviour arose but from maternal affection. On this wise passion got the mastery of the two women's hearts and they became madly in love with the two youths, so that when the other's son came in to either of them, she would press him to her breast and long for him never to be parted from her; till, at last, when waiting grew longsome to them and they found no path to enjoyment, they refused meat and drink and banished the solace of sleep. Presently, the King fared forth to course and chase, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day in turn as was their wont.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Eighteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King fared forth to sport and hunt, bidding his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day by turn, as was their wont. Now Prince Amjad sat in judgement the first day, bidding and forbidding, appointing and deposing, giving and refusing; and Queen Hayat al-Nufus, mother of As'ad, wrote to him a letter suing for his favour and discovering to him her passion and devotion; altogether put tiny off the mask and giving him to know that she desired to enjoy him. So she took a scroll and thereon indited these cadences, \"From the love deranged * the sorrowful and estranged * whose torment is prolonged for the longing of thee! * Were I to recount to thee the extent of my care * and what of sadness I bear * the passion which my heart cloth tear * and all that I endure for weeping and unrest * and the rending of my sorrowful breast * my unremitting grief * and my woe without relief * and all my suffering for severance of thee * and sadness and love's ardency * no letter could contain it; nor calculation could compass it * Indeed earth and heaven upon me are strait; and I have no hope and no trust but what from thee I await * Upon death I am come nigh * and the horrors of dissolution I aby * Burning upon me is sore * with parting pangs and estrangement galore * Were I to set forth the yearnings that possess me more and more * no scrolls would suffice to hold such store * and of the excess of my pain and pine, I have made the following lines:- -\n\nWere I to dwell on heart-consuming heat, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unease and transports in my spins meet,\nNothing were left of ink and reeden pen *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor aught of paper; no, not e'en a sheet.\n\nThen Queen Hayat al-Nufus wrapped up her letter in a niece of costly silk scented with musk and ambergris; and folded it up with her silken hair-strings[FN#358] whose cost swallowed down treasures laid it in a handkerchief and gave it to a eunuch bidding him bear it to Prince Amjad.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Nineteenth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that she gave her missive to the eunuch in waiting and bade him bear it to Prince Amjad. And that eunuch went forth ignoring what the future hid for him (for the Omniscient ordereth events even as He willeth); and, going in to the Prince, kissed the ground between his hands and handed to him the letter. On receiving the kerchief he opened it and, reading the epistle and recognizing its gist he was ware that his father's wife was essentially an adulteress and a traitress at heart to her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman. So he waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and railed at women and their works, saying, \"Allah curse women, the traitresses, the imperfect in reason and religion!\"[FN#359] Then he drew his sword and said to the eunuch, \"Out on thee, thou wicked slave! Dost thou carry messages of disloyalty for thy lord's wife? By Allah, there is no good in thee, O black of hue and heart, O foul of face and Nature's forming!\" So he smote him on the neck and severed his head from his body; then, folding the kerchief over its contents he thrust it into his breast pocket and went in to his own mother and told her what had passed, reviling and reproaching her, and saying, \"Each one of you is viler than the other; and, by Allah the Great and Glorious, did I not fear ill-manneredly to transgress against the rights of my father, Kamar al-Zaman, and my brother, Prince As'ad, I would assuredly go in to her and cut off her head, even as I cut off that of her eunuch!\" Then he went forth from his mother in a mighty rage; and when the news reached Queen Hayat al-Nufus of what he had done with her eunuch, she abused him[FN#360] and cursed him and plotted perfidy against him. He passed the night, sick with rage, wrath and concern; nor found he pleasure in meat, drink or sleep. And when the next morning dawned Prince As'ad fared forth in his turn to rule the folk in his father's stead, whilst his mother, Hayat al-Nufus, awoke in feeble plight because of what she had heard from Prince Amjad concerning the slaughter of her eunuch. So Prince As'ad sat in the audience-chamber that day, judging and administering justice, appointing and deposing, bidding and forbidding, giving and bestowing. And he ceased not thus till near the time of afternoon-prayer, when Queen Budur sent for a crafty old woman and, discovering to her what was in her heart, wrote a letter to Prince As'ad, complaining of the excess of her affection and desire for him in these cadenced lines, \"From her who perisheth for passion and love-forlorn * to him who in nature and culture is goodliest born * to him who is conceited of his own loveliness * and glories in his amorous grace * who from those that seek to enjoy him averteth his face * and refuseth to show favour unto the self abasing and base * him who is cruel and of disdainful mood * from the lover despairing of good * to Prince As'ad * with passing beauty endowed * and of excelling grace proud * of the face moon bright * and the brow flower-white * and dazzling splendid light * This is my letter to him whose love melteth my body * and rendeth my skin and bones! * Know that my patience faileth me quite * and I am perplexed in my plight * longing and restlessness weary me * and sleep and patience deny themselves to me * but mourning and watching stick fast to me * and desire and passion torment me * and the extremes of languor and sickness have sheet me * Yet may my life be a ransom for thee * albeit thy pleasure be to slay her who loveth thee * and Allah prolong the life of thee * and preserve thee from all infirmity!\" And after these cadences she wrote these couplets,\n\n\"Fate hath commanded I become thy fere, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O shining like full moon when clearest clear!\nAll beauty dost embrace, all eloquence; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Brighter than aught within our worldly sphere:\nContent am I my torturer thou be: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply shalt alms me with one lovely leer!\nHappy her death who dieth for thy love! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     No good in her who holdeth thee unclear!\"\n\nAnd also the following couplets,\n\n\"Unto thee, As'ad! I of passion-pangs complain; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Have ruth on slave of love so burnt with flaming pain:\nHow long, I ask, shall hands of Love disport with me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With longings, dolour, sleepliness and bale and bane?\nAnon I 'plain of sea in heart, anon of fire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     In vitals, O strange case, dear wish, my fairest fain!\nO blamer, cease thy blame, and seek thyself to fly *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From love, which makes these eyne a rill of tears to rain.\nHow oft I cry for absence and desire, Ah grief! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But all my crying naught of gain for me shall gain:\nThy rigours dealt me sickness passing power to bear, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Thou art my only leach, assain me an thou deign!\nO chider, chide me not in caution, for I doubt *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     That plaguey Love to thee shall also deal a bout.\"\n\nThen Queen Budur perfumed the letter-paper with a profusion of odoriferous musk and, winding it in her hairstrings which were of Iraki silk, with pendants of oblong emeralds, set with pearls and stones of price, delivered it to the old woman, bidding her carry it to Prince As'ad.[FN#361] She did so in order to pleasure her, and going in to the Prince, straightway and without stay, found him in his own rooms and delivered to him the letter in privacy; after which she stood waiting an hour or so for the answer. When As'ad had read the paper and knew its purport, he wrapped it up again in the ribbons and put it in his bosom-pocket: then (for he was wrath beyond all measure of wrath) he cursed false women and sprang up and drawing his sword, smote the old trot on the neck and cut off her pate. Thereupon he went in to his mother, Queen Hayat al-Nufus, whom he found lying on her bed in feeble case, for that which had betided her with Prince Amjad, and railed at her and cursed her; after which he left her and fore-gathered with his brother, to whom he related all that had befallen him with Queen Budur, adding, \"By Allah, O my brother, but that I was ashamed before thee, I had gone in to her forthright and had smitten her head off her shoulders!\" Replied Prince Amjad, \"By Allah, O my brother, yesterday when I was sitting upon the seat of judgement, the like of what hath befallen thee this day befel me also with thy mother who sent me a letter of similar purport.\" And he told him all that had passed, adding, \"By Allah, O my brother, naught but respect for thee withheld me from going in to her and dealing with her even as I dealt with the eunuch!\" They passed the rest of the night conversing and cursing womankind, and agreed to keep the matter secret, lest their father should hear of it and kill the two women. Yet they ceased not to suffer trouble and foresee affliction. And when the morrow dawned, the King returned with his suite from hunting and sat awhile in his chair of estate; after which he sent the Emirs about their business and went up to his palace, where he found his two wives lying a-bed and both exceeding sick and weak. Now they had made a plot against their two sons and concerted to do away their lives, for that they had exposed themselves before them and feared to be at their mercy and dependent upon their forbearance. When Kamar al-Zaman saw them on this wise, he said to them, \"What aileth you?\" Whereupon they rose to him and kissing his hands answered, perverting the case and saying \"Know, O King, that thy two sons, who have been reared in thy bounty, have played thee false and have dishonoured thee in the persons of thy wives.\" Now when he heard this, the light became darkness in his sight, and he raged with such wrath that his reason fled: then said he to them, \"Explain me this matter.\" Replied Queen Budur, \"O King of the age, know that these many days past thy son As'ad hath been in the persistent habit of sending me letters and messages to solicit me to lewdness and adultery while I still forbade him from this, but he would not be forbidden; and, when thou wentest forth to hunt, he rushed in on me, drunk and with a drawn sword in his hand, and smiting my eunuch, slew him. Then he mounted on my breast, still holding the sword, and I feared lest he should slay me, if I gainsaid him, even as he had slain my eunuch; so he took his wicked will of me by force. And now if thou do me not justice on him, O King, I will slay myself with my own hand, for I have no need of life in the world after this foul deed.\" And Queen Hayat al-Nufus, choking with tears, told him respecting Prince Amjad a story like that of her sister-wife.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twentieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Queen Hayat al-Nufus told her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman, a story like that of her sister in wedlock, Budur, and, quoth she, \"The same thing befel me with thy son Amjad;\" after which she took to weeping and wailing and said, \"Except thou do me justice on him I will tell my father, King Armanus.\" Then both women wept with sore weeping before King Kamar al-Zaman who, when he saw their tears and heard their words, concluded that their story was true and, waxing wroth beyond measure of wrath, went forth thinking to fall upon his two sons and put them to death. On his way he met his father- in-law, King Armanus who, hearing of his return from the chase, had come to salute him at that very hour and, seeing him with naked brand in hand and blood dripping from his nostrils, for excess of rage, asked what ailed him. So Kamar al-Zaman told him all that his sons Amjad and As'ad had done and added, \"And here I am now going in to them to slay them in the foulest way and make of them the most shameful of examples.\" Quoth King Armanus (and indeed he too was wroth with them), \"Thou dost well, O my son, and may Allah not bless them nor any sons that do such deed against their father's honour. But, O my son, the sayer of the old saw saith, 'Whoso looketh not to the end hath not Fortune to friend.' In any case, they are thy sons, and it befitteth not that thou kill them with shine own hand, lest thou drink of their death-agony,[FN#362] and anon repent of having slain them whenas repentance availeth thee naught. Rather do thou send them with one of thy Mamelukes into the desert and let him kill them there out of thy sight, for, as saith the adage, 'Out of sight of my friend is better and pleasanter.'[FN#363] And when Kamar al-Zaman heard his father-in-law's words, he knew them to be just; so he sheathed his sword and turning back, sat down upon the throne of his realm. There he summoned his treasurer, a very old man, versed in affairs and in fortune's vicissitudes, to whom he said, \"Go in to my sons, Amjad and As'ad; bind their hands behind them with strong bonds, lay them in two chests and load them upon a mule. Then take horse thou and carry them into mid desert, where do thou kill them both and fill two vials with their blood and bring the same to me in haste.\" Replied the treasurer, \"I hear and I obey,\" and he rose up hurriedly and went out forthright to seek the Princes; and, on his road, he met them coming out of the palace-vestibule, for they had donned their best clothes and their richest; and they were on their way to salute their sire and give him joy of his safe return from his going forth to hunt. Now when he saw them, he laid hands on them, saying, \"Omy sons, know ye that I am but a slave commanded, and that your father hath laid a commandment on me; will ye obey his commandment?\" They said, \"Yes\"; whereupon he went up to them and, after pinioning their arms, laid them in the chests which he loaded on the back of a mule he had taken from the city. And he ceased not carrying them into the open country till near noon, when he halted in a waste and desolate place and, dismounting from his mare, let down the two chests from the mule's back. Then he opened them and took out Amjad and As'ad; and when he looked upon them he wept sore for their beauty and loveliness; then drawing his sword he said to them, \"By Allah, O my lords, indeed it is hard for me to deal so evilly by you; but I am to be excused in this matter, being but a slave commanded, for that your father King Kamar al-Zaman hath bidden me strike off your heads.\" They replied, \"O Emir, do the King's bidding, for we bear with patience that which Allah (to Whom be Honour, Might and Glory!) hath decreed to us; and thou art quit of our blood.\" Then they embraced and bade each other farewell, and As'ad said to the treasurer, \"Allah upon thee, O uncle, spare me the sight of my brother's death-agony and make me not drink of his anguish, but kill me first, for that were the easier for me.\" And Amjad said the like and entreated the treasurer to kill him before As'ad, saying, \"My brother is younger than I; so make me not taste of his anguish. And they both wept bitter tears whilst the treasurer wept for their weeping;\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the treasurer wept for their weeping; then the two brothers embraced and bade farewell and one said to the other, \"All this cometh of the malice of those traitresses, my mother and thy mother; and this is the reward of my forbearance towards thy mother and of thy for bearance towards my mother! But there is no Might and there is no Majesty save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning.\"[FN#364] And As'ad em braced his brother, sobbing and repeating these couplets,\n\n\"O Thou to whom sad trembling wights in fear complain! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   O ever ready whatso cometh to sustain!\nThe sole resource for me is at Thy door to knock, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   At whose door knock an Thou to open wilt not deign?\nO Thou whose grace is treasured in the one word, Be![FN#365] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Favour me, I beseech, in Thee all weals contain.\"\n\nNow when Amjad heard his brother's weeping he wept also and pressing him to his bosom repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"O Thou whose boons to me are more than one! *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose gifts and favours have nor count nor bound!\nNo stroke of all Fate's strokes e'er fell on me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But Thee to take me by the hand I found.\"\nThen said Amjad to the treasurer, \"I conjure thee by the One, Omnipotent, the Lord of Mercy, the Beneficent! slay me before my brother As'ad, so haply shall the fire be quencht in my heart's core and in this life burn no more.\" But As'ad wept and exclaimed, \"Not so: I will die first;\" whereupon quoth Amjad, \"It were best that I embrace thee and thou embrace me, so the sword may fall upon us and slay us both at a single stroke.\" Thereupon they embraced, face to face and clung to each other straitly, whilst the treasurer tied up the twain and bound them fast with cords, weeping the while. Then he drew his blade and said to them, \"By Allah, O my lords, it is indeed hard to me to slay you! But have ye no last wishes that I may fulfil or charges which I may carry out, or message which I may deliver?\" Replied Amjad, \"We have no wish; and my only charge to thee is that thou set my brother below and me above him, that the blow may fall on me first, and when thou hast killed us and returnest to the King and he asketh thee, 'What heardest thou from them before their death?'; do thou answer, 'Verily thy sons salute thee and say to thee, Thou knewest not if we were innocent or guilty, yet hast thou put us to death and hast not certified thyself of our sin nor looked into our case.'

Now the horse had cost a thousand gold pieces and on its back was a splendid saddle worth much money; so the treasurer threw down his sword, and ran after his beast.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when his horse ran away, the treasurer ran after it in huge concern, and ceased not running to catch the runaway till it entered a thicket. He followed it whilst it dashed through the wood, smiting the earth with its hoofs till it raised a dust-cloud which towered high in air; and snorting and puffing and neighing and waxing fierce and furious. Now there happened to be in this thicket a lion of terrible might; hideous to sight, with eyes sparkling light: his look was grim and his aspect struck fright into man's sprite. Presentry the treasurer turned and saw the lion making towards him; but found no way of escape nor had he his sword with him. So he said in himself, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This strait is come upon me for no other cause but because of Amjad and As'ad; and indeed this journey was unblest from the first!\" Meanwhile the two Princes were grievously oppressed by the heat and grew sore athirst, so that their tongues hung out and they cried for succour, but none came to their relief and they said, \"Would to Heaven we had been slain and were at peace from this pain! But we know not whither the horse hath fled, that the treasurer is gone and hath left us thus pinioned. If he would but come back and do us die, it were easier to us than this torture to aby.\" Said As'ad, \"O my brother, be patient, and the relief of Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) shall assuredly come to us; for the horse started not away save of His favour towards us, and naught irketh us but this thirst.\" Upon this he stretched and shook himself and strained right and left, till he burst his pinion-bonds; then he rose and unbound his brother and catching up the Emir's sword, said, \"By Allah, we will not go hence, till we look after him and learn what is become of him.\" Then they took to following on the trail till it led them to the thicket and they said to each other, \"Of a surety, the horse and the treasurer have not passed out of this wood.\" Quoth As'ad, \"Stay thou here, whilst I enter the thicket and search it;\" and Amjad replied, \"I will not let thee go in alone: nor will we enter it but together; so if we escape, we shall escape together and if we perish, we shall perish together.\" Accordingly both entered and found that the lion had sprang upon the treasurer, who lay like a sparrow in his grip, calling upon Allah for aid and signing with his hands to Heaven. Now when Amjad saw this, he took the sword and, rushing upon the lion, smote him between the eyes and laid him dead on the ground. The Emir sprang up, marvelling at this escape and seeing Amjad and As'ad, his master's sons, standing there, cast himself at their feet and exclaimed, \"By Allah, O my lords, it were intolerable wrong in me to do you to death. May the man never be who would kill you! Indeed, with my very life, I will ransom you.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the treasurer to Amjad and As'ad, \"With my life will I ransom you both!\" Then he hastily rose and, at once embracing them, enquired how they had loosed their bonds and come thither; whereupon they told him how the bonds of one of them had fallen loose and he had unbound the other, whereto they were helped by the purity of their intentions, and how they had tracked his trail till they came upon him. So he thanked them for their deed and went with them forth of the thicket; and, when they were in the open country, they said to him, \"O uncle, do our father's bidding.\" He replied, \"Allah forbid that I should draw near to you with hurt! But know ye that I mean to take your clothes and clothe you with mine; then will I fill two vials with the lion's blood and go back to the King and tell him I have out vou to death. But as for you two, fare ye forth into the lands, for Allah's earth is wide; and know, O my lords, that it paineth me to part from you.\" At this, they all fell a-weeping; then the two youths put off their clothes and the treasurer habited them with his own. Moreover he made two parcels of their dress and, filling two vials with the lion's blood, set the parcels before him on his horse's back. Presently he took leave of them and, making his way to the city, ceased not faring till he went in to King Kamar al-Zaman and kissed the ground between his hands. The King saw him changed in face and troubled (which arose from his adventure with the lion) and, deeming this came of the slaughter of his two sons, rejoiced and said to him, \"Hast thou done the work?\" \"Yes, O our lord,\" replied the treasurer and gave him the two parcels of clothes and the two vials full of blood. Asked the King, \"What didst thou observe in them; and did they give thee any charge?\" Answered the treasurer, \"I found them patient and resigned to what came down upon them and they said to me, 'Verily, our father is excusable; bear him our salutation and say to him, 'Thou art quit of our killing. But we charge thee repeat to him these couplets,\n\n'Verily women are devils created for us. We seek refuge with God from the artifice of the devils. They are the source of all the misfortunes that have appeared among mankind in the affairs of the world and of religion.'''[FN#373]\n\nWhen the King heard these words of the treasurer, he bowed his head earthwards, a long while and knew his sons' words to mean that they had been wrongfully put to death. Then he bethought himself of the perfidy of women and the calamities brought about by them; and he took the two parcels and opened them and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping,\u2014And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Kamar la-Zaman opened the two bundles and fell to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping, it so came to pass that he found, in the pocket of his son As'ad's raiment, a letter in the hand of his wife enclosing her hair strings; so he opened and read it and understanding the contents knew that the Prince had been falsely accused and wrongously. Then he searched Amjad's parcel of dress and found in his pocket a letter in the handwriting of Queen Hayat al-Nufus enclosing also her hair-strings; so he opened and read it and knew that Amjad too had been wronged; whereupon he beat hand upon hand and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I have slain my sons unjustly.\" And he buffeted his face, crying out, \"Alas, my sons! Alas, my long grief!\" Then he bade them build two tombs in one house, which he styled \"House of Lamentations,\" and had graved thereon his sons' names; and he threw himself on Amjad's tomb, weeping and groaning and lamenting, and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"O moon for ever set this earth below, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Whose loss bewail the stars which stud the sky!\nO wand, which broken, ne'er with bend and wave *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Shall fascinate the ravisht gazer's eye;\nThese eyne for jealousy I 'reft of thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Nor shall they till next life thy sight descry:\nI'm drowned in sea of tears for insomny *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Wherefore, indeed in S\u00e1hirah-stead[FN#374] I lie.\"\nThen he threw himself on As'ad's tomb, groaning and weeping and lamenting and versifying with these couplets,\n\"Indeed I longed to share unweal with thee, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    But Allah than my will willed otherwise:\nMy grief all blackens 'twixt mine eyes and space, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yet whitens all the blackness from mine eyes:[FN#375]\nOf tears they weep these eyne run never dry, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And ulcerous flow in vitals never dries:\nRight sore it irks me seeing thee in stead[FN#376] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Where slave with sovran for once levelled lies.\"\n\nAnd his weeping and wailing redoubled; and, after he had ended his lamentations and his verse, he forsook his friends and intimates, and denying himself to his women and his family, cut himself off from the world in the House of Lamentations, where he passed his time in weeping for his sons. Such was his case; but as regards Amjad and As'ad they fared on into the desert eating of the fruits of the earth and drinking of the remnants of the rain for a full month, till their travel brought them to a mountain of black flint[FN#377] whose further end was unknown; and here the road forked, one line lying along the midway height and the other leading to its head. They took the way trending to the top and gave not over following it five days, but saw no end to it and were overcome with weariness, being unused to walking upon the mountains or elsewhere.[FN#378] At last, despairing of coming to the last of the road, they retraced their steps and, taking the other, that led over the midway heights,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princes Amjad and As'ad returned from the path leading to the Mountain- head and took that which ran along the midway heights, and walked through all that day till nightfall, when As'ad, weary with much travel, said to Amjad, \"O my brother, I can walk no farther, for I am exceeding weak.\" Replied Amjad, \"O my brother, take courage! May be Allah will send us relief.\" So they walked on part of the night, till the darkness closed in upon them, when As'ad became weary beyond measure of weariness and cried out, \"O my brother, I am worn out and spent with walking,\" and threw himself upon the ground and wept. Amjad took him in his arms and walked on with him, bytimes sitting down to rest till break of day, when they came to the mountain-top and found there a stream of running water and by it a pomegranate-tree and a prayer-niche.[FN#379] They could hardly believe their eyes when they saw it; but, sitting down by that spring, drank of its water and ate of the fruit of that granado-tree; after which they lay on the ground and slept till sunrise, when they washed and bathed in the spring and, eating of the pomegranates, slept again till the time of mid-afternoon prayer. Then they thought to continue their journey, but As'ad could not walk, for both his feet were swollen. So they abode there three days till they were rested, after which they set out again and fared on over the mountain days and nights, tortured by and like to die of thirst, till they sighted a city gleaming afar off, at which they rejoiced and made towards it. When they drew near it, they thanked Allah (be His Name exalted!) and Amjad said to As'ad, \"O my brother, sit here, whilst I go to yonder city and see what it is and whose it is and where we are in Allah's wide world, that we may know through what lands we have passed in crossing this mountain, whose skirts had we followed, we had not reached this city in a whole year. So praised be Allah for safety!\" Replied As'ad, \"By Allah, O my brother, none shall go down into that city save myself, and may I be thy ransom! If thou leave me alone, be it only for an hour, I shall imagine a thousand things and be drowned in a torrent of anxiety on shine account, for I cannot brook shine absence from me.\" Amjad rejoined, \"Go then and tarry not. So As'ad took some gold pieces, and leaving his brother to await him, descended the mountain and ceased not faring on till he entered the city. As he threaded the streets he was met by an old man age-decrepit, whose beard flowed down upon his breast and forked in twain;[FN#380] he bore a walking-staff in his hand and was richly clad, with a great red turband on his head. When As'ad saw him, he wondered at his dress and his mien; nevertheless, he went up to him and saluting him said, \"Where be the way to the market, O my master?\" Hearing these words the Shaykh smiled in his face and replied, \"O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?\" As'ad rejoined, \"Yes, I am a stranger.\"\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Shaykh who met As'ad smiled in his face and said to him, \"O my son, meseemeth thou art a stranger?\" and As'ad replied, \"Yes, I am a stranger.\" Then rejoined the old man, \"Verily, thou gladdenest our country with thy presence, O my son, and thou desolatest shine own land by reason of shine absence. What wantest thou of the market?\" Quoth As'ad, \"O uncle, I have a brother, with whom I have come from a far land and with whom I have journeyed these three months; and, when we sighted this city, I left him, who is my elder brother, upon the mountain and came hither, purposing to buy victual and what else, and return therewith to him, that we might feed thereon.\" Said the old man, \"Rejoice in all good, O my son, and know thou that to-day I give a marriage-feast, to which I have bidden many guests, and I have made ready plenty of meats, the best and most delicious that heart can desire. So if thou wilt come with me to my place, I will give thee freely all thou lackest without asking thee a price or aught else. Moreover I will teach thee the ways of this city; and, praised be Allah, O my son, that I, and none other have happened upon thee.\" \"As thou wilt,\" answered As'ad, \"do as thou art disposed, but make haste, for indeed my brother awaiteth me and his whole heart is with me.\" The old man took As'ad by the hand and carried him to a narrow lane, smiling in his face and saying, \"Glory be to Him who hath delivered thee from the people of this city!\" And he ceased not walking till he entered a spacious house, wherein was a saloon and behold, in the middle of it were forty old men, well stricken in years, collected together and forming a single ring as they sat round about a lighted fire, to which they were doing worship and prostrating themselves.[FN#381] When As'ad saw this, he was confounded and the hair of his body stood on end though he knew not what they were; and the Shaykh said to them, \"O Elders of the Fire, how blessed is this day!\" Then he called aloud, saying, \"Hello, Ghazb\u00e1n!\" Whereupon there came out to him a tall black slave of frightful aspect, grim-visaged and flat nosed as an ape who, when the old man made a sign to him, bent As'ad's arms behind his back and pinioned them; after which the Shaykh said to him, \"Let him down into the vault under the earth and there leave him and say to my slave girl Such-an-one, 'Torture him night and day and give him a cake of bread to eat morning and evening against the time come of the voyage to the Blue Sea and the Mountain of Fire, whereon we will slaughter him as a sacrifice.'\" So the black carried him out at another door and, raising a flag in the floor, discovered a flight of twenty steps leading to a chamber[FN#382] under the earth, into which he descended with him and, laying his feet in irons, gave him over to the slave girl and went away. Meanwhile, the old men said to one another, \"When the day of the Festival of the Fire cometh, we will sacrifice him on the mountain, as a propitiatory offering whereby we shall pleasure the Fire.\" Presently the damsel went down to him and beat him a grievous beating, till streams of blood flowed from his sides and he fainted; after which she set at his head a scone of bread and a cruse of brackish water and went away and left him. In the middle of the night, he revived and found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating: so he wept bitter tears; and recalling his former condition of honour and prosperity, lordship and dominion, and his separation from his sire and his exile from his native land.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when As'ad found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating he recalled his whilome condition of honour and prosperity and dominion and lordship, and he wept and groaned aloud and recited these couplets,\n\n\"Stand by the ruined stead and ask of us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Nor deem we dwell there as was state of us:\nThe World, that parter, hath departed us; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Yet soothes not hate-full hearts the fate of us:\nWith whips a cursed slave girl scourges us, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And teems her breast with rancorous hate of us:\nAllah shall haply deign to unpart our lives, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Chastise our foes, and end this strait of us.\"\n\nAnd when As'ad had spoken his poetry, he put out his hand towards his head and finding there the crust and the cruse full of brackish water he ate a bittock, just enough to keep life in him, and drank a little water, but could get no sleep till morning for the swarms of bugs[FN#383] and lice. As soon as it was day, the slave girl came down to him and changed his clothes, which were drenched with blood and stuck to him, so that his skin came off with the shirt; wherefor he shrieked aloud and cried, \"Alas!\" and said, \"O my God, if this be Thy pleasure, increase it upon me! O Lord, verily Thou art not unmindful of him that oppresseth me; do Thou then avenge me upon him!\" And he groaned and repeated the following verses,\n\n\n\"Patient, O Allah! to Thy destiny *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     I bow, suffice me what Thou deign decree:\nPatient to bear Thy will, O Lord of me, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Patient to burn on coals of Ghaz\u00e1-tree:\nThey wrong me, visit me with hurt and harm; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Haply Thy grace from them shall set me free:\nFar be's, O Lord, from thee to spare the wronger *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O Lord of Destiny my hope's in Thee!\"\n\nAnd what another saith,\n\n\"Bethink thee not of worldly state, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Leave everything to course of Fate;\nFor oft a thing that irketh thee *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall in content eventuate;\nAnd oft what strait is shall expand, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And what expanded is wax strait.\nAllah will do what wills His will *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     So be not thou importunate!\nBut 'joy the view of coming weal *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Shall make forget past bale and bate.\"\n\nAnd when he had ended his verse, the slave-girl came down upon him with blows till he fainted again; and, throwing him a flap of bread and a gugglet of saltish water, went away and left him sad and lonely, bound in chains of iron, with the blood streaming from his sides and far from those he loved. So he wept and called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that As'ad called to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed; so he wept and groaned and complained and poured forth tears in floods and improvised these couplets,\n\n\"Easy, O Fate! how long this wrong, this injury, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Robbing each morn and eve my brotherhood fro' me?\nIs't not time now thou deem this length sufficiency *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Of woes and, O thou Heart of Rock, show clemency?\nMy friends thou wrongedst when thou madst each enemy *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Mock and exult me for thy wrongs, thy tyranny:\nMy foeman's heart is solaced by the things he saw *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   In me, of strangerhood and lonely misery:\nSuffice thee not what came upon my head of dole, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Friends lost for evermore, eyes wan and pale of blee?\nBut must in prison cast so narrow there is naught *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    Save hand to bite, with bitten hand for company;\nAnd tears that tempest down like goodly gift of cloud, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And longing thirst whose fires weet no satiety.\nRegretful yearnings, singulfs and unceasing sighs, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Repine, remembrance and pain's very ecstacy:\nDesire I suffer sore and melancholy deep, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   And I must bide a prey to endless phrenesy:\nI find me ne'er a friend who looks with piteous eye, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  And seeks my presence to allay my misery:\nSay, liveth any intimate with trusty love *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0   Who for mine ills will groan, my sleepless malady?\nTo whom moan I can make and, peradventure, he *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Shall pity eyes that sight of sleep can never see?\nThe flea and bug suck up my blood, as wight that drinks *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Wine from the proffering hand of fair virginity:\nAmid the lice my body aye remindeth me *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Of orphan's good in K\u00e1zi's claw of villainy:\nMy home's a sepulchre that measures cubits three, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Where pass I morn and eve in chained agony:\nMy wines are tears, my clank of chains takes music's stead, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Cares my dessert of fruit and sorrows are my bed.\"\n\nAnd when he had versed his verse and had prosed his prose, he again groaned and complained and remembered he had been and how he had been parted from his brother. Thus far concerning him; but as regards his brother Amjad, he awaited As'ad till mid-day yet he returned not to him: whereupon Amjad's vitals fluttered, the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirtieth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Amjad awaited his brother As'ad till mid-day and he returned not to him, Amjad's vitals fluttered; the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he poured forth abundant tears, exclaiming, \"Alas, my brother! Alas, my friend! Alas my grief! How I feared me we should be separated!\" Then he descended from the mountain-top with the tears running down his cheeks; and, entering the city, ceased not walking till he made the market. He asked the folk the name of the place and concerning its people and they said, \"This is called the City of the Magians, and its citizens are mostly given to Fire-worshipping in lieu of the Omnipotent King.\" Then he enquired of the City of Ebony and they answered, \"Of a truth it is a year's journey thither by land and six months by sea: it was governed erst by a King called Armanus; but he took to son- in-law and made King in his stead a Prince called Kamar al-Zaman distinguished for justice and munificence, equity and benevolence.\" When Amjad heard tell of his father, he groaned and wept and lamented and knew not whither to go. However, he bought a something of food and carried it to a retired spot where he sat down thinking to eat; but, recalling his brother, he fell a- weeping and swallowed but a morsel to keep breath and body together, and that against his will. Then he rose and walked about the city, seeking news of his brother, till he saw a Moslem tailor sitting in his shop so he sat down by him and told him his story; whereupon quoth the tailor, \"If he have fallen into the hands of the Magians, thou shalt hardly see him again: yet it may be Allah will reunite you twain. But thou, O my brother,\" he continued wilt thou lodge with me?\" Amjad answered, \"Yes\"; and the tailor rejoiced at this. So he abode with him many days, what while the tailor comforted him and exhorted him to patience and taught him tailoring, till he became expert in the craft. Now one day he went forth to the sea-shore and washed his clothes; after which he entered the bath and put on clean raiment; then he walked about the city, to divert himself with its sights and presently there met him on the way a woman of passing beauty and loveliness, without peer for grace and comeliness. When she saw him she raised her face-veil and signed to him by moving her eyebrows and her eyes with luring glances, and versified these couplets,\n\n\"I drooped my glance when seen thee on the way *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    As though, O slim-waist! felled by Sol's hot ray:\nThou art the fairest fair that e'er appeared, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Fairer to-day than fair of yesterday:[FN#384]\nWere Beauty parted, a fifth part of it *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     With Joseph or a part of fifth would stay;\nThe rest would fly to thee, shine ownest own; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Be every soul thy sacrifice, I pray!\"\n\nWhen Amjad heard these her words, they gladdened his heart which inclined to her and his bowels yearned towards her and the hands of love sported with him; so he sighed to her in reply and spoke these couplets,\n\n\"Above the rose of cheek is thorn of lance;[FN#385] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who dareth pluck it, rashest chevisance?\nStretch not thy hand towards it, for night long *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Those lances marred because we snatched a glance!\nSay her, who tyrant is and tempter too *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     (Though justice might her tempting power enhance):\u2014\nThy face would add to errors were it veiled; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Unveiled I see its guard hath best of chance!\nEye cannot look upon Sol's naked face; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     But can, when mist-cloud dims his countenance:\nThe honey-hive is held by honey-bee;[FN#386] *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Ask the tribe-guards what wants their vigilance?\nAn they would slay me, let them end their ire *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rancorous, and grant us freely to advance:\nThey're not more murderous, an charge the whole *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Than charging glance of her who wears the mole.\"\n\nAnd hearing these lines from Amjad she sighed with the deepest sighs and, signing to him again, repeated these couplets,\n\n\"'Tis thou hast trodden coyness path not I: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Grant me thy favours for the time draws nigh:\nO thou who makest morn with light of brow, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     And with loosed brow-locks night in lift to stye!\nThine idol-aspect made of me thy slave, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Tempting as temptedst me in days gone by:\n'Tis just my liver fry with hottest love: *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Who worship fire for God must fire aby:\nThou sellest like of me for worthless price; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     If thou must sell, ask high of those who buy.\"\nWhen Amjad heard these her words he said to her, \"Wilt thou come to my lodging or shall I go with thee to shine?\" So she hung her head in shame to the ground and repeated the words of Him whose Name be exalted, \"Men shall have the pre-eminence above women, because of those advantages wherein Allah hath caused the one of them to excel the other.\"[FN#387] Upon this, Amjad took the hint.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-first Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad took the woman's hint and understood that she wished to go with him whither he was going; he felt himself bounder to find a place wherein to receive her, but was ashamed to carry her to the house of his host, the tailor. So he walked on and she walked after him, and the two ceased not walking from street to street and place to place, till she was tired and said to him, \"O my lord, where is thy house?\" Answered he, \"Before us a little way.\" Then he turned aside into a handsome by-street, followed by the young woman, and walked on till he came to the end, when he found it was no thoroughfare and exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\" Then raising his eyes, he saw, at the upper end of the lane a great doer with two stone benches; but it was locked. So Amjad sat down on one of the benches and she on the other; and she said to him, \"O my lord, wherefore waitest thou?\" He bowed his head awhile to the ground then raised it and answered, \"I am awaiting my Mameluke who hath the key; for I bade him make me ready meat and drink and flowers, to deck the wine-service against my return from the bath.\" But he said to himself, \"Haply the time will be tedious to her and she will go about her business, leaving me here, when I will wend my own way.\" However, as soon as she was weary of long waiting, she said, \"O my lord, thy Mameluke delayeth; and here are we sitting in the street;\" and she arose and took a stone and went up to the lock. Said Amjad, \"Be not in haste, but have patience till the servant come.\" However, she hearkened not to him, but smote the wooden bolt with the stone and broke it in half, whereupon the door opened. Quoth he, \"What possessed thee to do this deed?\" Quoth she, \"Pooh, pooh, my lord! what matter it? Is not the house thy house and thy place?\" He said, \"There was no need to break the bolt.\" Then the damsel entered, to the confusion of Amjad, who knew not what to do for fear of the people of the house; but she said to him, \"Why dost thou not enter, O light of mine eyes and core of my heart?\" Replied he, \"I hear and obey; but my servant tarrieth long and I know not if he have done aught of what I bade him and specially enjoined upon him, or not.\" Hereupon he entered, sore in fear of the people of the house, and found himself in a handsome saloon with four dais'd recesses, each facing other, and containing closets and raised seats, all bespread with stuffs of silk and brocade; and in the midst was a jetting fountain of costly fashion, on whose margin rested a covered tray of meats, with a leather tablecloth hanging up and gem-encrusted dishes, full of fruits and sweet- scented flowers. Hard by stood drinking vessels and a candlestick with a single wax-candle therein; and the place was full of precious stuffs and was ranged with chests and stools, and on each seat lay a parcel of clothes upon which was a purse full of monies, gold and silver. The floor was paved with marble and the house bore witness in every part to its owner's fortune. When Amjad saw all this, he was confounded at his case and said to himself, \"I am a lost man! Verily we are Allah's and to Allah we are returning!\" As for the damsel, when she sighted the place she rejoiced indeed with a joy nothing could exceed, and said to him, \"By Allah, O my lord, thy servant hath not failed of his duty; for see, he hath swept the place and cooked the meat and set on the fruit; and indeed I come at the best of times.\" But he paid no heed to her, his heart being taken up with fear of the house- folk; and she said, \"Fie, O my lord, O my heart! What aileth thee to stand thus?\" Then she sighed and, giving him a buss which sounded like the cracking of a walnut, said, \"O my lord, an thou have made an appointment with other than with me, I will gird my middle and serve her and thee. Amjad laughed from a heart full of rage and wrath and came forwards and sat down, panting and saying to himself, \"Alack, mine ill death and doom when the owner of the place shall return!\" Then she seated herself by him and fell to toying and laughing, whilst Amjad sat careful and frowning, thinking a thousand thoughts and communing with himself, \"Assuredly the master of the house cannot but come, and then what shall I say to him? he needs must kill me and my life will be lost thus foolishly.\" Presently she rose and, tucking up her sleeves, took a tray of food on which she laid the cloth and then set it before Amjad and began to eat, saying, \"Eat, O my lord.\" So he came forward and ate; but the food was not pleasant to him; on the contrary he ceased not to look towards the door, till the damsel had eaten her fill, when she took away the tray of the meats and, setting on the dessert, fell to eating of the dried fruits. Then she brought the wine service and opening the jar, filled a cup and handed it to Amjad, who took it from her hand saying to him self, ' Ah, ah! and well away, when the master of the house cometh and seeth me!\"; and he kept his eyes fixed on the threshold, even with cup in hand. While he was in this case, lo! in came the master of the house, who was a white slave, one of the chief men of the city, being Master of the Horse[FN#388] to the King. He had fitted up this saloon for his pleasures, that he might make merry therein and be private with whom he would, and he had that day bidden a youth whom he loved and had made this entertainment for him. Now the name of this slave was Bah\u00e1dur,[FN#389] and he was open of hand, generous, munificent and fain of alms-giving and charitable works.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it wad the Two Hundred and Thirty-second Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Bahadur, the Master of the Horse and the owner of the house, came to the door of the saloon and found it open, he entered slowly and softly and looking in, with head advanced and out stretched neck, saw Amjad and the girl sitting before the dish of fruit and the wine-jar in front of them. Now Amjad at that moment had the cup in his hand and his face turned to the door; and when his glance met Bahadur's eyes his hue turned pale yellow and his side-muscles quivered, so seeing his trouble Bahadur signed to him with his finger on his lips, as much as to say, \"Be silent and come hither to me.\" Whereupon he set down the cup and rose and the damsel cried, \"Whither away?\" He shook his head and, signing to her that he wished to make water, went out into the passage barefoot. Now when he saw Bahadur he knew him for the master of the house; so he hastened to him and, kissing his hands, said to him, \"Allah upon thee, O my lord, ere thou do me a hurt, hear what I have to say.\" Then he told him who he was from first to last and acquainted him with what caused him to quit his native land and royal state, and how he had not entered his house of his free will, but that it was the girl who had broken the lock-bolt and done all this.[FN#390] When Bahadur heard his story and knew that he was a King's son, he felt for him and, taking compassion on him, said, \"Hearken to me, O Amjad, and do what I bid thee and I will guarantee thy safety from that thou fearest; but, if thou cross me, I will kill thee.\" Amjad replied, \"Command me as thou wilt: I will not gainsay thee in aught; no, never, for I am the freedman of thy bounty.\" Rejoined Bahadur, \"Then go back forthwith into the saloon, sit down in thy place and be at peace and at shine ease; I will presently come in to thee, and when thou seest me (remember my name is Bahadur) do thou revile me and rail at me, saying, 'What made thee tarry till so late?' And accept no excuse from me; nay, so far from it, rise and beat me; and, if thou spare me, I will do away thy life. Enter now and make merry and whatsoever thou seekest of me at this time I will bring thee forthwith; and do thou spend this night as thou wilt and on the morrow wend thy way. This I do in honour of thy strangerhood, for I love the stranger and hold myself bounder to do him devoir.\" So Amjad kissed his hand, and, returning to the saloon with his face clad in its natural white and red, at once said to the damsel, \"O my mistress, thy presence hath gladdened this shine own place and ours is indeed a blessed night.\" Quoth the girl, \"Verily I see a wonderful change in thee, that thou now welcomest me so cordially!\" So Amjad answered, \"By Allah, O my lady, methought my servant Bahadur had robbed me of some necklaces of jewels, worth ten thousand diners each; however, when I went out but now in concern for this, I sought for them and found them in their place. I know not why the slave tarrieth so long and needs must I punish him for it.\" She was satisfied with his answer, and they sported and drank and made merry and ceased not to be so till near sundown, when Bahadur came in to them, having changed his clothes and girt his middle and put on shoes, such as are worn of Mamelukes. He saluted and kissed the ground; then held his hands behind him and stood, with his head hanging down, as one who confesseth to a fault. So Amjad looked at him with angry eyes and asked, \"Why hast thou tarried till now, O most pestilent of slaves?\" Answered Bahadur, \"O my lord, I was busy washing my clothes and knew not of thy being here; for our appointed time was nightfall and not day-tide.\" But Amjad cried out at him, saying, \"Thou liest, O vilest of slaves! By Allah, I must needs beat thee.\" So he rose and, throwing Bahadur prone on the ground, took a stick and beat him gently; but the damsel sprang up and, snatching the stick from his hand, came down upon Bahadur so lustily, that in extreme pain the tears ran from his eyes and he ground his teeth together and called out for succour; whilst Amjad cried out to the girl \"Don't\"; and she cried out, \"Let me satisfy my anger upon him!\" till at last he pulled the stick out of her hand and pushed her away. So Bahadur rose and, wiping away his tears from his cheeks, waited upon them the while, after which he swept the hall and lighted the lamps; but as often as he went in and out, the lady abused him and cursed him till Amjad was wroth with her and said, \"For Almighty Allah's sake leave my Mameluke; he is not used to this.\" Then they sat and ceased not eating and drinking (and Bahadur waiting upon them) till midnight when, being weary with service and beating, he fell asleep in the midst of the hall and snored and snorted; whereupon the damsel, who was drunken with wine, said to Amjad, \"Arise, take the sword hanging yonder and cut me off this slave's head; and, if thou do it not, I will be the death of thee!\" \"What possesseth thee to slay my slave?\" asked Amjad; and she answered, \"Our joyaunce will not be complete but by his death. If thou wilt not kill him, I will do it myself.\" Quoth Amjad, \"By Allah's rights to thee, do not this thing!\" Quoth she, \"It must perforce be;\" and, taking down the sword, drew it and made at Bahadur to kill him; but Amjad said in his mind, \"This man hath entreated us courteously and sheltered us and done us kindness and made himself my slave: shall we requite him by slaughtering him? This shall never be!\" Then he said to the woman, \"If my Mameluke must be killed, better I should kill him than thou.\" So saying, he took the sword from her and, raising his hand, smote her on the neck and made her head fly from her body. It fell upon Bahadur who awoke and sat up and opened his eyes, when he saw Amjad standing by him and in his hand the sword dyed with blood, and the damsel lying dead. He enquired what had passed, and Amjad told him all she had said, adding, \"Nothing would satisfy her but she must slay thee; and this is her reward.\" Then Bahadur rose and, kissing the Prince's hand, said to him, \"Would to Heaven thou hadst spared her! but now there is nothing for it but to rid us of her without stay or delay, before the day-break.\" Then he girded his loins and took the body, wrapped it in an Ab\u00e1-cloak and, laying it in a large basket of palm-leaves, he shouldered it saying, \"Thou art a stranger here and knowest no one: so sit thou in this place and await my return till day-break. If I come back to thee, I will assuredly do thee great good service and use my endeavours to have news of thy brother; but if by sunrise I return not, know that all is over with me; and peace be on thee, and the house and all it containeth of stuffs and money are shine.\" Then he fared forth from the saloon bearing the basket; and, threading the streets, he made for the salt sea, thinking to throw it therein: but as he drew near the shore, he turned and saw that the Chief of Police and his officers had ranged themselves around him; and, on recognising him, they wondered and opened the basket, wherein they found the slain woman. So they seized him and laid him in bilboes all that night till the morning, when they carried him and the basket, as it was, to the King and reported the case. The King was sore enraged when he looked upon the slain and said to Bahadur, \"Woe to thee! Thou art always so doing; thou killest folk and castest them into the sea and takest their goods. How many murders hast thou done ere this?\" Thereupon Bahadur hung his head.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-third Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahadur hung down his head groundwards before the King, who cried out at him, saying, \"Woe to thee! Who killed this girl?\" He replied, \"O my lord! I killed her, and there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!\"[FN#391] So the King in his anger, commanded to hang him; and the hangman went down with him by the King's commandment, and the Chief of Police accompanied him with a crier who called upon all the folk to witness the execution of Bahadur, the King's Master of the Horse; and on this wise they paraded him through the main streets and the market-streets. This is how it fared with Bahadur; but as regards Amjad, he awaited his host's return till the day broke and the sun rose, and when he saw that he came not, he exclaimed, \"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Would I knew what is become of him?\" And, as he sat musing behold, he heard the crier proclaiming Bahadur's sentence and bidding the people to see the spectacle of his hanging at midday; whereat he wept and exclaimed, \"Verily, we are Allah's and to Him we are returning! He meaneth to sacrifice himself unjustly for my sake, when I it was who slew her. By Allah, this shall never be!\" Then he went from the saloon and, shutting the door after him, hurriedly threaded the streets till he overtook Bahadur, when he stood before the Chief of Police and said to him, \"O my lord, put not Bahadur to death, for he is innocent. By Allah, none killed her but I.\" Now when the Captain of Police heard these words, he took them both and, carrying them before the King, acquainted him with what Amjad had said; whereupon he looked at the Prince and asked him, \"Didst thou kill the damsel?\" He answered, \"Yes\" and the King said, \"Tell me why thou killedst her, and speak the truth.\" Replied Amjad, \"O King, it is indeed a marvellous event and a wondrous matter that hath befallen me: were it graven with needles on the eye-corners, it would serve as a warner to whoso would be warned!\" Then he told him his whole story and informed him of all that had befallen him and his brother, first and last; whereat the King was much startled and surprised and said to him, \"Know that now I find thee to be excusable; but list, O youth! Wilt thou be my Waz\u00edr?\" \"Hearkening and obedience,\" answered Amjad whereupon the King bestowed magnificent dresses of honour on him and Bahadur and gave him a handsome house, with eunuchs and officers and all things needful, appointing him stipends and allowances and bidding him make search for his brother As'ad. So Amjad sat down in the seat of the Wazirate and governed and did justice and invested and deposed and took and gave. Moreover, he sent out a crier to cry his brother throughout the city, and for many days made proclamation in the main streets and market-streets, but heard no news of As'ad nor happened on any trace of him. Such was his case; but as regards his brother, the Magi ceased not to torture As'ad night and day and eve and morn for a whole year's space, till their festival drew near, when the old man Bahram[FN#392] made ready for the voyage and fitted out a ship for himself.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahram, the Magian, having fitted out a ship for the voyage, took As'ad and put him in a chest which he locked and had it transported on board. Now it so came to pass that, at the very time of shipping it, Amjad was standing to divert himself by looking upon the sea; and when he saw the men carrying the gear and shipping it, his heart throbbed and he called to his pages to bring him his beast. Then, mounting with a company of his officers, he rode down to the sea-side and halted before the Magian's ship, which he commended his men to board and search. They did his bidding, and boarded the vessel and rummaged in every part, but found nothing; so they returned and told Amjad, who mounted again and rode back. But he felt troubled in mind; and when he reached his place and entered his palace, he cast his eyes on the wall and saw written thereon two lines which were these couplets,\n\n\"My friends! if ye are banisht from mine eyes, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     From heart and mind ye ne'er go wandering:\nBut ye have left me in my woe, and rob *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Rest from my eyelids while ye are slumbering.\"\n\nAnd seeing them Amjad thought of his brother and wept. Such was his case; but as for Bahram, the Magian, he embarked and shouted and bawled to his crew to make sail in all haste. So they shook out the sails and departed and ceased not to fare on many days and nights; and, every other day, Bahram took out As'ad and gave him a bit of bread and made him drink a sup of water, till they drew near the Mountain of Fire. Then there came out on them a storm-wind and the sea rose against them, so that the ship was driven out of her course till she took a wrong line and fell into strange waters; and, at last they came in sight of a city builded upon the shore, with a castle whose windows overlooked the main. Now the ruler of this city was a Queen called Marj\u00e1nah, and the captain said to Bahram, \"O my lord, we have strayed from our course and come to the island of Queen Marjanah, who is a devout Moslemah; and, if she know that we are Magians, she will take our ship and slay us to the last man. Yet needs must we put in here to rest and refit.\" Quoth Bahram, \"Right is thy recking, and whatso thou seest fit that will I do!\" Said the ship master, \"If the Queen summon us and question us, how shall we answer her?\"; and Bahram replied, \"Let us clothe this Moslem we have with us in a Mameluke's habit and carry him ashore with us, so that when the Queen sees him, she will suppose and say, 'This is a slave.' As for me I will tell her that I am a slave-dealer[FN#393] who buys and sells white slaves, and that I had with me many but have sold all save this one, whom I retained to keep my accounts, for he can read and write.\" And the captain said \"This device should serve.\" Presently they reached the city and slackened sail and cast the anchors; and the ship lay still, when behold, Queen Marjanah came down to them, attended by her guards and, halting before the vessel, called out to the captain, who landed and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, \"What is the lading of this thy ship and whom hast thou with thee?\"\" Quoth he, \"O Queen of the Age, I have with me a merchant who dealeth in slaves.\" And she said, \"Hither with him to me\"; whereupon Bahram came ashore to her, with As'ad walking behind him in a slave's habit, and kissed the earth before her. She asked, \"What is thy condition?\"; and he answered, \"I am a dealer in chattels.\" Then she looked at As'ad and, taking him for a Mameluke, asked him, \"What is thy name, O youth?\" He answered, \"Dost thou ask my present or my former name?\" \"Hast thou then two names?\" enquired she, and he replied (and indeed his voice was choked with tears), \"Yes; my name aforetime was Al-As'ad, the most happy, but now it is Al- Mu'tarr\u2014Miserrimus.\" Her heart inclined to him and she said, \"Canst thou write?\" \"Yes,'' answered he, and she gave him ink- case and reed-pen and paper and said to him, \"Write somewhat that I may see it.\" So he wrote these two couplets,\n\n\"What can the slave do when pursued by Fate, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     O justest Judge! whatever be his state?[FN#394]\nWhom God throws hand bound in the depths and says, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Beware lest water should thy body wet?\"[FN#395]\n\nNow when she read these lines, she had ruth upon him and said to Bahram, \"Sell me this slave.\" He replied, \"O my lady, I cannot sell him, for I have parted with all the rest and none is left with me but he.\" Quoth the Queen, \"I must need have him of thee, either by sale or way of gift.\" But quoth Bahram, \"I will neither sell him nor give him.\" Whereat she was wroth and, taking As'ad by the hand, carried him up to the castle and sent to Bahram, saying, \"Except thou set sail and depart our city this very night, I will seize all thy goods and break up thy ship.\" Now when the message reached the Magian, he grieved with sore grief and cried, \"Verily this voyage is on no wise to be commended.\" Then he arose and made ready and took all he needed and awaited the coming of the night to resume his voyage, saying to the sailors, \"Provide yourselves with your things and fill your water-skins, that we may set sail at the last of the night.\" So the sailors did their business and awaited the coming of darkness. Such was their case; but as regards Queen Marjanah, when she had brought As'ad into the castle, she opened the casements overlooking the sea and bade her handmaids bring food. They set food before As'ad and herself and both ate, after which the Queen called for wine.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Marjanah bade her handmaids bring wine and they set it before her, she fell to drinking with As'ad. Now, Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) filled her heart with love for the Prince and she kept filling his cup and handing it to him till his reason fled; and presently he rose and left the hall to satisfy a call of nature. As he passed out of the saloon he saw an open door through which he went and walked on till his walk brought him to a vast garden full of all manner fruits and flowers; and, sitting down under a tree, he did his occasion. Then he rose and went up to a jetting fountain in the garden and made the lesser ablution and washed his hands and face, after which he would have risen to go away; but the air smote him and he fell back, with his clothes undone and slept, and night overcame him thus. So far concerning him; but as concerns Bahram, the night being come, he cried out to his crew, saying, \"Set sail and let us away!\"; and the' answered, \"We hear and obey, but wait till we fill our water- skins and then we will set sail.\" So they landed with their water skins and went round about the castle, and found nothing but garden-walls: whereupon they climbed over into the garden and followed the track of feet, which led them to the fountain; and there they found As'ad lying on his back. They knew him and were glad to find him; and, after filling their water-skins, they bore him off and climbed the wall again with him and carried him back in haste to Bahram to whom they said, \"Hear the good tidings of thy winning thy wish; and gladden thy heart and beat thy drums and sound thy pipes; for thy prisoner, whom Queen Marjanah took from thee by force, we have found and brought back to thee\"; and they threw As'ad down before him. When Bahram saw him, his heart leapt for joy and his breast swelled with gladness. Then he bestowed largesse on the sailors and bade them set sail in haste. So they sailed forthright, intending to make the Mountain of Fire and stayed not their course till the morning. This is how it fared with them; but as regards Queen Marjanah, she abode awhile, after As'ad went down from her, awaiting his return in vain for he came not; thereupon she rose and sought him, yet found no trace of him. Then she bade her women light flambeaux and look for him, whilst she went forth in person and, seeing the garden- door open, knew that he had gone thither. So she went out into the garden and finding his sandals lying by the fountain, searched the place in every part, but came upon no sign of him; and yet she gave not over the search till morning. Then she enquired for the ship and they told her, \"The vessel set sail in the first watch of the night\"; wherefor she knew that they had taken As'ad with them, and this was grievous to her and she was sore an-angered. She bade equip ten great ships forthwith and, making ready for fight, embarked in one of the ten with her Mamelukes and slave-women and men-at-arms, all splendidly accoutred and weaponed for war. They spread the sails and she said to the captains, \"If you overtake the Magian's ship, ye shall have of me dresses of honour and largesse of money; but if you fail so to do, I will slay you to the last man.\" Whereat fear and great hope animated the crews and they sailed all that day and the night and the second day and the third day till, on the fourth they sighted the ship of Bahram, the Magian, and before evening fell the Queen's squadron had surrounded it on all sides, just as Bahram had taken As'ad forth of the chest and was beating and torturing him, whilst the Prince cried out for help and deliverance, but found neither helper nor deliverer: and the grievous bastinado sorely tormented him. Now while so occupied, Bahram chanced to look up and, seeing himself encompassed by the Queen's ships, as the white of the eye encompasseth the black, he gave himself up for lost and groaned and said, \"Woe to thee, O As'ad! This is all out of thy head.\" Then taking him by the hand he bade his men throw him overboard and cried, \"By Allah I will slay thee before I die myself!\" So they carried him along by the hands and feet and cast him into the sea and he sank; but Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) willed that his life be saved and that his doom be deferred; so He caused him to sink and rise again and he struck out with his hands and feet, till the Almighty gave him relief, and sent him deliverance; and the waves bore him far from the Magian's ship and threw him ashore. He landed, scarce crediting his escape, and once more on land he doffed his clothes and wrung them and spread them out to dry; whilst he sat naked and weeping over his condition, and bewailing his calamities and mortal dangers, and captivity and stranger hood. And presently he repeated these two couplets,\n\n\"Allah, my patience fails: I have no ward; *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     My breast is straitened and clean cut my cord;\nTo whom shall wretched slave of case complain *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0     Save to his Lord? O thou of lords the Lord!\"\n\nThen, having ended his verse, he rose and donned his clothes but he knew not whither to go or whence to come; so he fed on the herbs of the earth and the fruits of the trees and he drank of the streams, and fared on night and day till he came in sight of a city; whereupon he rejoiced and hastened his pace; but when he reached it,\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.\n\nWhen it Was the Two Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he reached the city the shades of evening closed around him and the gates were shut. Now by the decrees of Pate and man's lot this was the very city wherein he had been a prisoner and to whose King his brother Amjad was Minister. When As'ad saw the gate was locked, he turned back and made for the burial-ground, where finding a tomb without a door, he entered therein and lay down and fell asleep, with his face covered by his long sleeve.[FN#396] Meanwhile, Queen Marjanah, coming up with Bahram's ship, questioned him of As'ad. Now the Magian, when Queen Marjanah overtook him with her ships, baffled her by his artifice and gramarye; swearing to her that he was not with him and that he knew nothing of him. She searched the ship, but found no trace of her friend, so she took Bahram and, carrying him back to her castle, would have put him to death, but he ransomed himself from her with all his good and his ship; and she released him and his men. They went forth from her hardly believing in their deliverance, and fared on ten days' journey till they came to their own city and found the gate shut, it being eventide. So they made for the burial-ground, thinking to lie the night there and, going round about the tombs, as Fate and Fortune would have it, saw the building wherein As'ad lay wide open; whereat Bahram marvelled and said, \"I must look into this sepulchre.\" Then he entered and found As'ad lying in a corner fast asleep, with his head covered by his sleeve; so he raised his head, and looking in his face, knew him for the man on whose account he had lost his good and his ship, and cried, \"What! art thou yet alive?\" Then he bound him and gagged him without further parley, and carried him to his house, where he clapped heavy shackles on his feet and lowered him into the underground dungeon aforesaid prepared for the tormenting of Moslems, and he bade his daughter by name Bost\u00e1n,[FN#397] torture him night and day, till the next year, when they would again visit the Mountain of Fire and there offer him up as a sacrifice. Then he beat him grievously and locking the dungeon door upon him, gave the keys to his daughter. By and by, Bostan opened the door and went down to beat him, but finding him a comely youth and a sweet-faced with arched brows and eyes black with nature's Kohl,[FN#398] she fell in love with him and asked him, \"What is thy name?\" \"My name is As'ad,\" answered he; whereat she cried, \"Mayst thou indeed be happy as thy name,[FN#399] and happy be thy days! Thou deservest not torture and blows, and I see thou hast been injuriously entreated.\" And she comforted him with kind words and loosed his bonds. Then she questioned him of the religion of Al-Islam and he told her that it was the true and right Faith and that our lord Mohammed had approved himself by surpassing miracles[FN#400] and signs manifest, and that fire-worship is harmful and not profitable; and he went on to expound to her the tenets of Al-Islam till she was persuaded and the love of the True Faith entered her heart. Then, as Almighty Allah had mixed up with her being a fond affection for As'ad, she pronounced the Two Testimonies[FN#401] of the Faith and became of the people of felicity. After this, she brought him meat and drink and talked with him and they prayed together: moreover, she made him chicken stews and fed him therewith, till he regained strength and his sickness left him and he was restored to his former health. Such things befel him with the daughter of Bahram, the Magian; and so it happened that one day she left him and stood at the house-door when behold, she heard the crier crying aloud and saying, \"Whoso hath with him a handsome young man, whose favour is thus and thus, and bringeth him forth, shall have all he seeketh of money; but if any have him and deny it, he shall be hanged over his own door and his property shall be plundered and his blood go for naught.\" Now As'ad had acquainted Bostan bint Bahram with his whole history: so, when she heard the crier, she knew that it was he who was sought for and, going down to him, told him the news. Then he fared forth and made for the mansion of the Wazir, whom, when As'ad saw, exclaimed, \"By Allah, this Minister is my brother Amjad!\" Then he went up (and the damsel walking behind him) to the Palace, where he again saw his brother, and threw himself upon him; whereupon Amjad also knew him and fell upon his neck and they embraced each other, whilst the Wazir's Mamelukes dismounted and stood round them. They lay awhile insensible and, when they came to themselves, Amjad took his brother and carried him to the Sultan, to whom he related the whole story, and the Sultan charged him to plunder Bahram's house.\u2014And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.\n\nWhen it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,\n\nShe said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Sultan ordered Amjad to plunder Bahram's house and to hang its owner. So Amjad despatched thither for that purpose a company of men, who sacked the house and took Bahram and brought his daughter to the Wazir by whom she was received with all honour, for As'ad had told his brother the torments he had suffered and the kindness she had done him. Thereupon Amjad related in his turn to As'ad all that had passed between himself and the damsel; and how he had escaped hanging and had become Wazir; and they made moan, each to other, of the anguish they had suffered for separation. Then the Sultan summoned Bahram and bade strike off his head; but he said, \"O most mighty King, art thou indeed resolved to put me to death?\" Replied the King, \"Yes, except thou save thyself by becoming a Moslem.\" Quoth Bahram, \"O King, bear with me a little while!\" Then he bowed his head groundwards and presently raising it again, made pro fession of The Faith and islamised at the hands of the Sultan. They all rejoiced at his conversion and Amjad and As'ad told him all that had befallen them, whereat he wondered and said, \"O my lords, make ready for the journey and I will depart with you and carry you back to your father's court in a ship.\" At this they rejoiced and wept with sore weeping but he said, \"O my lords, weep not for your departure, for it shall reunite you with those you love, even as were Ni'amah and Naomi.\" \"And what befel Ni'amah and Naomi?\" asked they. \"They tell,\" replied Bahram, \"(but Allah alone is All knowing) the following tale of\n\n\nFootnotes:\n\n\n\n\n[FN#221] The \"topothesia\" is worthy of Shakespeare's day. \"Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1n\" is evidently a corruption of \"Kh\u00e1lidat\u00e1ni\" (for Kh\u00e1lid\u00e1t), the Eternal, as Ibn Wardi calls the Fortunate Islands, or Canaries, which owe both their modern names to the classics of Europe. Their present history dates from A.D. 1385, unless we accept the Dieppe-Rouen legend of Labat which would place the discovery in A.D. 1326.

If you marry one wife she holds herself your equal, answers you and \"gives herself airs\"; two are always quarrelling and making a hell of the house; three are \"no company\" and two of them always combine against the nicest to make her hours bitter. Four are company, they can quarrel and \"make it up\" amongst themselves, and the husband enjoys comparative peace. But the Moslem is bound by his law to deal equally with the four, each must have her dresses her establishment and her night, like her sister wives. The number is taken from the Jews (Arbah Turim Ev. Hazaer, i.) \"the wise men have given good advice that a man should not marry more than four wives.\" Europeans, knowing that Moslem women are cloistered and appear veiled in public, begin with believing them to be mere articles of luxury, and only after long residence they find out that nowhere has the sex so much real liberty and power as in the Moslem East. They can possess property and will it away without the husband's leave: they can absent themselves from the house for a month without his having a right to complain; and they assist in all his counsels for the best of reasons: a man can rely only on his wives and children, being surrounded by rivals who hope to rise by his ruin. As regards political matters the Circassian women of Constantinople really rule the Sultanate and there soignez la femme! is the first lesson of getting on in the official world.\n\n[FN#223] This two-bow prayer is common on the bride-night; and at all times when issue is desired.\n\n[FN#224] The older Camaralzaman=\"Moon of the age.\" Kamar is the moon between her third and twenty-sixth day: Hil\u00e1l during the rest of the month: Badr (plur.

Our grandfathers and grandmothers did well to wear bonnets-de-nuit, however ridiculous they may have looked.\n\n[FN#240] Iblis, meaning the Despairer, is called in the Koran (chaps. xviii. 48) \"One of the genii (Jinnis) who departed from the command of his Lord.\" Mr. Rodwell (in loco) notes that the Satans and Jinnis represent in the Koran (ii. 32, etc.) the evil-principle and finds an admixture of the Semitic Satans and demons with the \"Genii from the Persian (Babylonian ?) and Indian (Egyptian ?) mythologies.\"\n\n[FN#241] Of course she could not see his eyes when they were shut; nor is this mere Eastern inconsequence. The writer means, \"had she seen them, they would have showed,\" etc.\n\n[FN#242] The eyes are supposed to grow darker under the influence of wine and sexual passion.\n\n[FN#243] To keep off the evil eye.\n[FN#244] Like Dahnash this is a fanciful P. N., fit only for a Jinni. As a rule the appellatives of Moslem \"genii\" end in\u00fas (oos), as Tarn\u00fas, Huliy\u00e1nus, the Jewish in\u2014nas, as Jattunas; those of the Tars\u00e1 (the \"funkers\" i.e. Christians) in\u2014d\u00fas, as Sid\u00fas, and the Hindus in\u2014t\u00fas, as Nakt\u00fas (who entered the service of the Prophet Shays, or Seth, and was converted to the Faith). The King of the Genii is Malik Katsh\u00e1n who inhabits Mount Kaf; and to the west of him lives his son-in-law, Abd al-Rahman with 33,000 domestics: these names were given by the Apostle Mohammed. \"Baktan\u00fas\" is lord of three Moslem troops of the wandering Jinns, which number a total of twelve bands and extend from Sind to Europe. The Jinns, Divs, Peris (\"fairies\") and other pre-Adamitic creatures were governed by seventy-two Sultans all known as Sulayman and the last I have said was J\u00e1n bin J\u00e1n. The angel H\u00e1ris was sent from Heaven to chastise him, but in the pride of victory he also revolted with his followers the Jinns whilst the Peris held aloof. When he refused to bow down before Adam he and his chiefs were eternally imprisoned but the other Jinns are allowed to range over earth as a security for man's obedience. The text gives the three orders. flyers. walkers and divers.\n\n[FN#245] i.e. distracted (with love); the Lakab, or poetical name, of apparently a Spanish poet.\n\n[FN#246] Nothing is more \"anti-pathetic\" to Easterns than lean hips and flat hinder-cheeks in women and they are right in insisting upon the characteristic difference of the male and female figure. Our modern sculptors and painters, whose study of the nude is usually most perfunctory, have often scandalised me by the lank and greyhound-like fining off of the frame, which thus becomes rather simian than human.\n\n[FN#247] The small fine foot is a favourite with Easterns as well as Westerns. Ovid (A.A.) is not ashamed \"ad teneros Oscula (not basia or suavia) ferre pedes.\" Ariosto ends the august person in\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Il breve, asciutto, e ritondetto piece,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (The short-sized, clean-cut, roundly-moulded foot).\n\nAnd all the world over it is a sign of \"blood,\" i.e. the fine nervous temperament.\n\n[FN#248] i.e. \"full moons\": the French have corrupted it to\n\"Badoure\"; we to \"Badoura.\" winch is worse.\n\n[FN#249] As has been said a single drop of urine renders the clothes ceremoniously impure, hence a Stone or a handful of earth must be used after the manner of the torche-cul. Scrupulous Moslems, when squatting to make water, will prod the ground before them with the point o f stick or umbrella, so as to loosen it and prevent the spraying of the urine.\n\n[FN#250] It is not generally known to Christians that Satan has a wife called Aww\u00e1 (\"Haww\u00e1\" being the Moslem Eve) and, as Adam had three sons, the Tempter has nine, viz., Zu 'l-baysun who rules in bazars. Wassin who prevails in times of trouble. Awan who counsels kings; Haffan patron of wine-bibbers; Marrah of musicians and dancers; Masbut of news-spreaders (and newspapers ?); Dulh\u00e1n who frequents places of worship and interferes with devotion. Dasim, lord of mansions and dinner tables, who prevents the Faithful saying \"Bismillah\" and \"Inshallah,\" as commanded in the Koran (xviii. 23), and Lak\u00eds, lord of Fire worshippers (Herklots, chap. xxix. sect. 4).\n\n[FN#251] Strong perfumes, such as musk (which we Europeans dislike and suspect), are always insisted upon in Eastern poetry, and Mohammed's predilection for them is well known. Moreover the young and the beautiful are held (justly enough) to exhale a natural fragrance which is compared with that of the blessed in Paradise. Hence in the Mu'allakah of Imr al-Keys:\u2014\n\nBreathes the scent of musk when they rise to rove, *\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0    As the Zephyr's breath with the flavour o'clove.\n\nIt is made evident by dogs and other fine-nosed animals that every human being has his, or her, peculiar scent which varies according to age and health. Hence animals often detect the approach of death.\n\n[FN#252] Arab. \"Kahl\u00e1.\" This has been explained. Mohammed is said to have been born with \"Kohl'd eyes.\"\n\n[FN#253] Haw\u00e1 al-'uzr\u00ed, before noticed (Night cxiv.).\n\n[FN#254] These lines, with the N\u00e1zir (eye or steward), the H\u00e1jib (Groom of the Chambers or Chamberlain) and Joseph, are also repeated from Night cxiv. For the Nazir see Al-Hariri (Nos. xiii. and xxii.)\n\n[FN#255] The usual allusion to the H\u00far (Houris) from \"Hangar,\" the white and black of the eye shining in contrast. The Persian Magi also placed in their Heaven (Bihisht or Minu) \"Huran,\" or black-eyed nymphs, under the charge of the angel Zamiy\u00e1d.\n\n[FN#256] In the first hemistich, \"bi-shitt 'it w\u00e1dy\" (by the wady-bank): in the second, \"wa shatta 'l w\u00e1dy\" (\"and my slayer\"\u2014 i.e. w\u00e1dy act. part. of wady, killing\u2014\"hath paced away\").\n\n[FN#257] The double entendre is from the proper names Bud\u00far and Su'\u00e1d (Beatrice) also meaning \"auspicious (or blessed) full moons.\"\n\n[FN#258] Arab. \"H\u00e1zir\" (also Ahl al-hazer, townsmen) and B\u00e1di, a Badawi, also called \"Ahl al-Wabar,\" people of the camel's hair (tent) and A'ar\u00e1b (Nomadic) as opposed to Arab (Arab settled or not). They still boast with Ibn Abbas, cousin of Mohammed, that they have kerchiefs (not turbands) for crowns, tents for houses, loops for walls, swords for scarves and poems for registers or written laws.\n\n[FN#259] This is a peculiarity of the Jinn tribe when wearing hideous forms. It is also found in the Hindu Rakshasa.\n\n[FN#260] Which, by the by, are small and beautifully shaped. The animal is very handy with them, as I learnt by experience when trying to \"Rareyfy\" one at Bayrut.\n\n[FN#261] She being daughter of Al-Dimiry\u00e1t, King of the Jinns.\nMr. W. F. Kirby has made him the subject of a pretty poem.\n\n[FN#262] These lines have occurred in Night xxii. I give\nTorrens's version (p. 223) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#263] Arab. \"K\u00e1mat Alfiyyah,\" like an Alif, the first of the Arabic alphabet, the Heb. Aleph. The Arabs, I have said, took the flag or water leaf form and departed very far from the Egyptian original (we know from Plutarch that the hieroglyphic abecedarium began with \"a\"), which was chosen by other imitators, namely the bull's head, and which in the cursive form, especially the Phnician, became a yoke. In numerals \"Alif\" denotes one or one thousand. It inherits the traditional honours of Alpha (as opposed to Omega) and in books, letters and writings generally it is placed as a monogram over the \"Bismillah,\" an additional testimony to the Unity. (See vol. i. p. 1.) In medi\u00e6val Christianity this place of honour was occupied by the cross: none save the wildest countries have preserved it, but our vocabulary still retains Criss' (Christ-)cross Row, for horn-book, on account of the old alphabet and nine digits disposed in the form of a Latin cross. Hence Tickell (\"The Horn-book\"):\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        \u2014\u2014Mortals ne'er shall know\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        More than contained of old the Chris'-cross Row.\n\n[FN#264] The young man must have been a demon of chastity.\n\n[FN#265] Arab. \"Kir\u00e1t\" from i.e. bean, the seed of the Abrus precatorius, in weight=two to three (English) grains; and in length=one finger-breadth here; 24 being the total. The Moslem system is evidently borrowed from the Roman \"as\" and \"uncia.\"\n\n[FN#266] Names of women.\n\n[FN#267] Arab. \"Amsa\" (lit. he passed the evening) like \"asbaha\" (he rose in the morning) \"Azh\u00e1\" (he spent the forenoon) and \"bata\" (he spent the night), are idiomatically used for \"to be in any state, to continue\" without specification of time or season.\n\n[FN#268] Lit. \"my liver ;\" which viscus, and not the heart, is held the seat of passion, a fancy dating from the oldest days. Theocritus says of Hercules, \"In his liver Love had fixed a wound\" (Idyl. xiii.). In the Anthologia \"Cease, Love, to wound my liver and my heart\" (lib. vii.). So Horace (Odes, i. 2); his Latin Jecur and the Persian \"Jigar\" being evident congeners. The idea was long prevalent and we find in Shakespeare:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         Alas, then Love may be called appetite,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         No motion of the liver but the palate.\n\n[FN#269] A marvellous touch of nature, love ousting affection; the same trait will appear in the lover and both illustrate the deep Italian saying, \"Amor discende, non ascende.\" The further it goes down the stronger it becomes as of grand-parent for grand-child and vice versa.\n\n[FN#270] This tenet of the universal East is at once fact and unfact. As a generalism asserting that women's passion is ten times greater than man's (Pilgrimage, ii. 282), it is unfact. The world shows that while women have more philoprogenitiveness, men have more amativeness; otherwise the latter would not propose and would nurse the doll and baby. Pact, however, in low-lying lands, like Persian Mazanderan versus the Plateau; Indian Malabar compared with Mar\u00e1tha-land; California as opposed to Utah and especially Egypt contrasted with Arabia. In these hot damp climates the venereal requirements and reproductive powers of the female greatly exceed those of the male; and hence the dissoluteness of morals would be phenomenal, were it not obviated by seclusion, the sabre and the revolver. In cold-dry or hot-dry mountainous lands the reverse is the case; hence polygamy there prevails whilst the low countries require polyandry in either form, legal or illegal (i,e. prostitution) I have discussed this curious point of \"geographical morality\" (for all morality is, like conscience, both geographical and chronological), a subject so interesting to the lawgiver, the student of ethics and the anthropologist, in \"The City of the Saints \" But strange and unpleasant truths progress slowly, especially in England.\n\n[FN#271] This morning evacuation is considered, in the East, a sine qu\u00e2 non of health; and old Anglo-Indians are unanimous in their opinion of the \"bard fajar\" (as they mispronounce the dawn-clearance). The natives of India, Hind\u00fas (pagans) and Hind\u00eds (Moslems), unlike Europeans, accustom themselves to evacuate twice a day, evening as well as morning. This may, perhaps, partly account for their mildness and effeminacy; for:\u2014\n\nC'est la constipation qui rend l'homme rigoureux.\n\nThe English, since the first invasion of cholera, in October, 1831, are a different race from their costive grandparents who could not dine without a \"dinner-pill.\" Curious to say the clyster is almost unknown to the people of Hindostan although the barbarous West Africans use it daily to \"wash 'um belly,\" as the Bonney-men say. And, as Sonnini notes to propose the process in Egypt under the Beys might have cost a Frankish medico his life.\n\n[FN#272] The Egyptian author cannot refrain from this characteristic polissonnerie; and reading it out is always followed by a roar of laughter. Even serious writers like Al- Hariri do not, as I have noted, despise the indecency.\n\n[FN#273] \"'Long beard and little wits,\" is a saying throughout the East where the Kausaj (= man with thin, short beard) is looked upon as cunning and tricksy. There is a venerable Joe Miller about a schoolmaster who, wishing to singe his long beard short, burnt it off and his face to boot:\u2014which reminded him of the saying. A thick beard is defined as one which wholly conceals the skin; and in ceremonial ablution it must be combed out with the fingers till the water reach the roots. The Sunnat, or practice of the Prophet, was to wear the beard not longer than one hand and two fingers' breadth. In Persian \"K\u00faseh\" (thin beard) is an insulting term opposed to \"Khush-r\u00edsh,\" a well-bearded man. The Iranian growth is perhaps the finest in the world, often extending to the waist; but it gives infinite trouble, requiring, for instance, a bag when travelling. The Arab beard is often composed of two tufts on the chin-sides and straggling hairs upon the cheeks; and this is a severe mortification, especially to Shaykhs and elders, who not only look upon the beard as one of man's characteristics, but attach a religious importance to the appendage. Hence the enormity of Kamar al-Zaman's behaviour. The Persian festival of the vernal equinox was called Kusehnish\u00edn (Thin-beard sitting). An old man with one eye paraded the streets on an ass with a crow in one hand and a scourge and fan in the other, cooling himself, flogging the bystanders and crying heat! heat! (garm\u00e1! garm\u00e1!). For other particulars see Richardson (Dissertation, p. Iii.). This is the Italian Giorno delle Vecchie, Thursday in Mid Lent, March 12 (1885), celebrating the death of Winter and the birth of Spring.\n\n[FN#274] I quote Torrens (p. 400) as these lines have occurred in\nNight xxxviii.\n\n[FN#275] Moslems have only two names for week days, Friday,\nAl-Jum'ah or meeting-day, and Al-Sabt, Sabbath day, that is\nSaturday. The others are known by numbers after Quaker fashion\nwith us, the usage of Portugal and Scandinavia.\n\n[FN#276] Our last night.\n\n[FN#277] Arab. \"Tayf\"=phantom, the nearest approach to our \"ghost,\" that queer remnant of Fetishism imbedded in Christianity; the phantasma, the shade (not the soul) of tile dead. Hence the accurate Niebuhr declares, \"apparitions (i.e., of the departed) are unknown in Arabia.\" Haunted houses are there tenanted by Ghuls, Jinns and a host of supernatural creatures; but not by ghosts proper; and a man may live years in Arabia before he ever hears of the \"Tayf.\" With the Hindus it is otherwise (Pilgrimage iii. 144). Yet the ghost, the embodied fear of the dead and of death is common, in a greater or less degree, to all peoples; and, as modern Spiritualism proves, that ghost is not yet laid.\n\n[FN#278] Mr. Payne (iii. 133) omits the lines which are \u00e0propos de rein and read much like \"nonsense verses.\" I retain them simply because they are in the text.\n\n[FN#279] The first two couplets are the quatrain (or octave) in\nNight xxxv.\n\n[FN#280] Arab. \"Ar'ar,\" the Heb. \"Aroer,\" which Luther and the A.\nV. translate \"heath.\" The modern Aramaic name is \"Lizz\u00e1b\"\n(Unexplored Syria. i. 68).\n\n[FN#281] In the old version and the Bresl. Edit. (iii. 220) the\nPrincess beats the \"Kahram\u00e1nah,\" but does not kill her.\n\n[FN#282] 'This is still the popular Eastern treatment of the insane.\n\n[FN#283] Pers. \"Marz-b\u00e1n\" = Warden of the Marches, Margrave. The foster-brother in the East is held dear as, and often dearer than, kith and kin.\n\n[FN#284] The moderns believe most in the dawn-dream.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0        \u2014Quirinus\n\nPost mediam noctem visus, quum somnia vera.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          (Horace Sat. i. 10, 33,)\n\n[FN#285] The Bresl. Edit. (iii. 223) and Galland have \"Torf:\"\nLane (ii. 115) \"El-Tarf.\"\n\n[FN#286] Arab. \"Maghzal ;\" a more favourite comparison is with a tooth pick. Both are used by Nizami and Al-Hariri, the most \"elegant\" of Arab writers.\n\n[FN#287] These form a Kas\u00eddah, Ode or Elegy= rhymed couplets numbering more than thirteen: If shorter it is called a \"Ghazal.\" I have not thought it necessary to preserve the monorhyme.\n\n[FN#288] Sulaym\u00e1 dim. of Salm\u00e1= any beautiful woman Rab\u00e1b = the viol mostly single stringed: Tan'oum=she who is soft and gentle. These fictitious names are for his old flames.\n\n[FN#289] i.e. wine. The distich is highly fanciful and the conceits would hardly occur to a\n\n[FN#290] Arab. \"Andam,\" a term applied to Brazil-wood (also called \"Bakkam\") and to \"dragon's blood,\" but not, I think, to tragacanth, the \"goat's thorn,\" which does not dye. Andam is often mentioned in The Nights.\n\n[FN#291] The superior merit of the first (explorer, etc.) is a lieu commun with Arabs. So Al-Hariri in Preface quotes his predecessor:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Justly of praise the price I pay;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          The praise is his who leads the way.\n\n[FN#292] There were two Lukmans, of whom more in a future page.\n\n[FN#293] This symbolic action is repeatedly mentioned in The\nNights.\n\n[FN#294] Arab. \"Shakhs\"=a person, primarily a dark spot. So \"Saw\u00e1d\"=blackness, in Al-Hariri means a group of people who darken the ground by their shade.\n\n[FN#295] The first bath after sickness, I have said, is called\n\"Ghusl al-Sihhah,\"\u2014the Washing of Health.\n\n[FN#296] The words \"malady\" and \"disease\" are mostly avoided during these dialogues as ill-omened words which may bring on a relapse.\n\n[FN#297] Solomon's carpet of green silk which carried him and all his host through the air is a Talmudic legend generally accepted in Al-Islam though not countenanced by the Koran. chaps xxvii. When the \"gnat's wing\" is mentioned, the reference is to Nimrod who, for boasting that he was lord of all, was tortured during four hundred years by a gnat sent by Allah up his ear or nostril.\n\n[FN#298] The absolute want of morality and filial affection in the chaste young man is supposed to be caused by the violence of his passion, and he would be pardoned because he \"loved much.\"\n\n[FN#299] I have noticed the geomantic process in my \"History of Sindh\" (chaps. vii.). It is called \"Zarb al-Ram!\" (strike the sand, the French say \"frapper le sable\") because the rudest form is to make on the ground dots at haphazard, usually in four lines one above the other: these are counted and, if even-numbered, two are taken ( ** ); if odd one ( * ); and thus the four lines will form a scheme say * * * * * * This is repeated three times, producing the same number of figures; and then the combination is sought in an explanatory table or, if the practitioner be expert, he pronounces off-hand. The Nights speak of a \"Takht Raml\" or a board, like a schoolboy's slate, upon which the dots are inked instead of points in sand. The moderns use a \"Kura'h,\" or oblong die, upon whose sides the dots, odd and even, are marked; and these dice are hand-thrown to form the e figure. By way of complication Geomancy is mixed up with astrology and then it becomes a most complicated kind of ariolation and an endless study. \"Napoleon's Book of Fate,\" a chap-book which appeared some years ago, was Geomancy in its simplest and most ignorant shape. For the rude African form see my Mission to Dahome, i. 332, and for that of Darfour, pp. 360-69 of Shaykh Mohammed's Voyage before quoted.\n\n[FN#300] Translators understand this of writing marriage contracts; I take it in a more general sense.\n\n[FN#301] These lines are repeated from Night Ixxv.: with Mr. Payne's permission I give his rendering (iii. 153) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#302] The comparison is characteristically Arab.\n\n[FN#303] Not her \"face\": the head, and especially the back of the head, must always be kept covered, even before the father.\n\n[FN#304] Arab. \"Siw\u00e1k\"=a tooth-stick; \"Siw\u00e1-ka\"=lit. other than thou.\n\n[FN#305] Arab. \"Ar\u00e1k\"=tooth stick of the wild caper-tree; \"Ar\u00e1-ka\" lit.=I see thee. The capparis spinosa is a common desert-growth and the sticks about a span long (usually called Misw\u00e1k), are sold in quantities at Meccah after being dipped in Zemzem water. In India many other woods are used, date-tree, Salvadora, Achyrantes, phyllanthus, etc. Amongst Arabs peculiar efficacy accompanies the tooth-stick of olive, \"the tree springing from Mount Sinai\" (Koran xxiii. 20); and Mohammed would use no other, because it prevents decay and scents the mouth. Hence Koran, chaps. xcv. 1. The \"Misw\u00e1k\" is held with the unused end between the ring-finger and minimus, the two others grasp the middle and the thumb is pressed against the back close to the lips. These articles have long been sold at the Medical Hall near the \"Egyptian Hall,\" Piccadilly. They are better than our unclean tooth-brushes because each tooth gets its own especial rubbing' not a general sweep; at the same time the operation is longer and more troublesome. In parts of Africa as well as Asia many men walk about with the tooth-stick hanging by a string from the neck.\n\n[FN#306] The \"Mehari,\" of which the Algerine-French speak, are the dromedaries bred by the Mahrah tribe of Al-Yaman, the descendants of Mahrat ibn Haydan. They are covered by small wild camels (?) called Al-H\u00fash, found between Oman and Al-Shihr: others explain the word to mean \"stallions of the Jinns \" and term those savage and supernatural animals, \"Naj\u00e1ib al-Mahriyah\"nobles of the Mahrah.\n\n[FN#307] Arab. \"Khaznah\"=a thousand purses; now about \u00a35000. It denotes a large sum of money, like the \"Badrah,\" a purse containing 10,000 dirhams of silver (Al-Hariri), or 80,000 (Burckhardt Prov. 380); whereas the \"Nis\u00e1b\" is a moderate sum of money, gen. 20 gold dinars=200 silver dirhams.\n\n[FN#308] As The Nights show, Arabs admire slender forms; but the hips and hinder cheeks must be highly developed and the stomach fleshy rather than lean. The reasons are obvious. The Persians who exaggerate everything say e.g. (Husayn V\u00e1iz in the Anv\u00e1r-i-Suhayli):\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          How paint her hips and waist ? Who saw\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          A mountain (Koh) dangling to a straw (k\u00e1h)?\n\nIn Antar his beloved Abla is a tamarisk (T. Orientalis). Others compare with the palm-tree (Solomon), the Cypress (Persian, esp. Hafiz and Firdausi) and the Ar\u00e1k or wild Capparis (Arab.).\n\n[FN#309] Ubi aves ibi angel). All African travellers know that a few birds flying about the bush, and a few palm-trees waving in the wind, denote the neighbourhood of a village or a camp (where angels are scarce). The reason is not any friendship for man but because food, animal and vegetable, is more plentiful Hence Albatrosses, Mother Carey's (Mater Cara, the Virgin) chickens, and Cape pigeons follow ships.\n\n[FN#310] The stanza is called Al-Mukhammas=cinquains; the quatrains and the \"bob,\" or \"burden\" always preserve the same consonance. It ends with a Koranic lieu commun of Moslem morality.\n\n[FN#311] Moslem port towns usually have (or had) only two gates. Such was the case with Bayrut, Tyre, Sidon and a host of others; the faubourg-growth of modern days has made these obsolete. The portals much resemble the entrances of old Norman castles\u2014Arques for instance. (Pilgrimage i. 185.)\n\n[FN#312] Arab. \"Lis\u00e1m\"; before explained.\n\n[FN#313] i.e. Life of Souls (persons, etc.).\n\n[FN#314] Arab. \"Ins\u00e1nu-h\u00e1\"=her (i.e. their) man: i.e. the babes of the eyes: the Assyrian Ishon, dim. of Ish=Man; which the Hebrews call \"B\u00e1bat\" or \"Bit\" (the daughter) the Arabs \"Bubu (or Hadakat) al-Aye\"; the Persians \"Mardumak-i-chashm\" (mannikin of the eye); the Greeks and the Latins pupa, pupula, pupilla. I have noted this in the Lyricks of Camoens (p. 449).\n\n[FN#315] Ma'an bin Z\u00e1'idah, a soldier and statesman of the eighth century.\n\n[FN#316] The mildness of the Caliph Mu'\u00e1wiyah, the founder of the Ommiades, proverbial among the Arabs, much resembles the \"meekness\" of Moses the Law-giver, which commentators seem to think has been foisted into Numbers xii. 3.\n\n[FN#317] Showing that there had been no consummation of the marriage which would have demanded \"Ghusl,\" or total ablution, at home or in the Hammam.\n\n[FN#318] I have noticed this notable desert-growth.\n\n[FN#319] 'The \"situation\" is admirable, solution appearing so difficult and catastrophe imminent.\n\n[FN#320] This quatrain occurs in Night ix.: I have borrowed from\nTorrens (p. 79) by way of variety.\n\n[FN#321] The belief that young pigeon's blood resembles the virginal discharge is universal; but the blood most resembling man's is that of the pig which in other points is so very human. In our day Arabs and Hindus rarely submit to inspection the nuptial sheet as practiced by the Israelites and Persians. The bride takes to bed a white kerchief with which she staunches the blood and next morning the stains are displayed in the Harem. In Darfour this is done by the bridegroom. \"Prima Venus debet esse cruenta,\" say the Easterns with much truth, and they have no faith in our complaisant creed which allows the hymen-membrane to disappear by any but one accident.\n\n[FN#322] Not meaning the two central divisions commanded by the\nKing and his Wazir.\n\n[FN#323] Ironic\u00e8.\n\n[FN#324] Arab. \"Rasy\"=praising in a funeral sermon.\n\n[FN#325] Arab. \"Man\u00e1y\u00e1,\" plur. of \"Maniyat\" = death. Mr. R. S. Poole (the Academy, April 26, 1879) reproaches Mr. Payne for confounding \"Muniyat\" (desire) with \"Maniyat\" (death) but both are written the same except when vowel-points are used.\n\n[FN#326] Arab. \"Iddat,\" alluding to the months of celibacy which, according to Moslem law, must be passed by a divorced woman before she can re-marry.\n\n[FN#327] Arab. \"Tal\u00e1k bi'l-Sal\u00e1sah\"=a triple divorce which cannot be revoked; nor can the divorcer re-marry the same woman till after consummation with another husband. This subject will continually recur.\n\n[FN#328] An allusion to a custom of the pagan Arabs in the days of ignorant Heathenism The blood or brain, soul or personality of the murdered man formed a bird called Sady or H\u00e1mah (not the Hum\u00e1 or Hum\u00e1i, usually translated \"phnix\") which sprang from the head, where four of the five senses have their seat, and haunted his tomb, crying continually, \"Usk\u00fani!\"=Give me drink (of the slayer's blood) ! and which disappeared only when the vendetta was accomplished. Mohammed forbade the belief. Amongst the Southern Slavs the cuckoo is supposed to be the sister of a murdered man ever calling or vengeance.\n\n[FN#329] To obtain a blessing and show how he valued it.\n\n[FN#330] Well-known tribes of proto-historic Arabs who flourished before the time of Abraham: see Koran (chaps. xxvi. et passim).

In the Romance of \"Antar\" As\u00e1f\u00edr camels are beasts that fly like birds in fleetness. The reader must not confound the olives of the text with the hard unripe berries (\"little plums pickled in stale\") which appear at English tables, nor wonder that bread and olives are the beef-steak and potatoes of many Mediterranean peoples It is an excellent diet, the highly oleaginous fruit supplying the necessary carbon,\n\n[FN#333] Arab. \"Tamer al-Hindi\"=the \"Indian-date,\" whence our word \"Tamarind.\" A sherbet of the pods, being slightly laxative, is much drunk during the great heats; and the dried fruit, made into small round cakes, is sold in the bazars. The traveller is advised not to sleep under the tamarind's shade, which is infamous for causing ague and fever. In Sind I derided the \"native nonsense,\" passed the night under an \"Indian date-tree\" and awoke with a fine specimen of ague which lasted me a week.\n\n[FN#334] Moslems are not agreed upon the length of the Day of Doom when all created things, marshalled by the angels, await final judgment; the different periods named are 40 years, 70, 300 and 50,000. Yet the trial itself will last no longer than while one may milk an ewe, or than \"the space between two milkings of a she-camel.\" This is bringing down Heaven to Earth with a witness; but, after all, the Heaven of all faiths, including \"Spiritualism,\" the latest development, is only an earth more or less glorified even as the Deity is humanity more or less perfected.\n\n[FN#335] Arab. \"Al-Kamar\u00e1ni,\" lit. \"the two moons.\" Arab rhetoric prefers it to \"Shams\u00e1ni,\" or {`two suns,\" because lighter (akhaff), to pronounce. So, albeit Omar was less worthy than Abu-Bakr the two are called \"Al-Omar\u00e1ni,\" in vulgar parlance, Omarayn.\n\n[FN#336] Alluding to the angels who appeared to the Sodomites in the shape of beautiful youths (Koran xi.).\n\n[FN#337] Koran xxxiii. 38.\n\n[FN#338] \"Niktu-hu taklidan\" i.e. not the real thing (with a woman). It may also mean \"by his incitement of me.\" All this scene is written in the worst form of Persian-Egyptian blackguardism, and forms a curious anthropological study. The \"black joke\" of the true and modest wife is inimitable.\n\n[FN#339] Arab. \"Jam\u00edz\" (in Egypt \"Jammayz\") = the fruit of the true sycomore (F. Sycomorus) a magnificent tree which produces a small tasteless fig, eaten by the poorer classes in Egypt and by monkeys. The \"T\u00edn\" or real fig here is the woman's parts; the \"mulberry- fig,\" the anus. Martial (i. 65) makes the following distinction:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Dicemus ficus, quas scimus in arbore nasci,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Dicemus ficos, Caeciliane, tuos.\n\nAnd Modern Italian preserves a difference between fico and fica.\n\n[FN#340] Arab. \"Gh\u00e1niyat Az\u00e1r\u00e1\" (plur. of Azr\u00e1 = virgin): the former is properly a woman who despises ornaments and relies on \"beauty unadorned\" (i.e. in bed).\n\n[FN#341] \"Nihil usitatius apud monachos, cardinales, sacrificulos,\" says Johannes de la Casa Beneventius Episcopus, quoted by Burton Anat. of Mel. lib. iii. Sect. 2; and the famous epitaph on the Jesuit,\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Ci-git un Jesuite:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Passant, serre les fesses et passe vite!\n\n[FN#342] Arab. \"Kiblah\"=the fronting-place of prayer, Meccah for Moslems, Jerusalem for Jews and early Christians. See Pilgrimage (ii. 321) for the Moslem change from Jerusalem to Meccah and ibid. (ii. 213) for the way in which the direction was shown.\n\n[FN#343] The Koran says (chaps. ii.): \"Your wives are your tillage: go in therefore unto your tillage in what manner so ever ye will.\" Usually this is understood as meaning in any posture, standing or sitting, lying, backwards or forwards. Yet there is a popular saying about the man whom the woman rides (vulg. St. George, in France, le Postillon); \"Cursed be who maketh woman Heaven and himself earth!\" Some hold the Koranic passage to have been revealed in confutation of the Jews, who pretended that if a man lay with his wife backwards, he would beget a cleverer child. Others again understand it of preposterous venery, which is absurd: every ancient law-giver framed his code to increase the true wealth of the people\u2014population\u2014and severely punished all processes, like onanism, which impeded it. The Persians utilise the hatred of women for such misuse when they would force a wive to demand a divorce and thus forfeit her claim to Mahr (dowry); they convert them into catamites till, after a month or so, they lose all patience and leave the house.\n\n[FN#344] Koran lit 9: \"He will be turned aside from the Faith (or Truth) who shall be turned aside by the Divine decree;\" alluding, in the text, to the preposterous venery her lover demands.\n[FN#345] Arab. \"Fut\u00fah\" meaning openings, and also victories, benefits. The lover congratulates her on her mortifying self in order to please him.\n\n[FN#346] \"And the righteous work will be exalt\": (Koran xxxv. 11) applied ironically.\n\n[FN#347] A prolepsis of Tommy Moore:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         Your mother says, my little Venus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0         There's something not quite right between us,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0               And you're in fault as much as I,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Now, on my soul, my little Venus,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          I swear 'twould not be right between us,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0               To let your mother tell a lie.\n\nBut the Arab is more moral than Mr. Little. as he purposes to repent.\n\n[FN#348] Arab. \"Khunsa\" flexible or flaccid, from Khans=bending inwards, i.e. the mouth of a water-skin before drinking. Like Mukhannas, it is also used for an effeminate man, a passive sodomite and even for a eunuch. Easterns still believe in what Westerns know to be an impossibility, human beings with the parts and proportions of both sexes equally developed and capable of reproduction; and Al-Islam even provides special rules for them (Pilgrimage iii. 237). We hold them to be Buffon's fourth class of (duplicate) monsters belonging essentially to one or the other sex, and related to its opposite only by some few characteristics. The old Greeks dreamed, after their fashion, a beautiful poetic dream of a human animal uniting the contradictory beauties of man and woman. The duality of the generative organs seems an old Egyptian tradition, at least we find it in Genesis (i. 27) where the image of the Deity is created male and female, before man was formed out of the dust of the ground (ii. 7). The old tradition found its way to India (if the Hindus did not borrow the idea from the Greeks); and one of the forms of Mahadeva, the third person of their triad, is entitled \"Ardhan\u00e1r\u00ed\"=the Half-woman, which has suggested to them some charming pictures. Europeans, seeing the left breast conspicuously feminine, have indulged in silly surmises about the \"Amazons.\"\n\n[FN#349] This is a mere phrase for our \"dying of laughter\": the queen was on her back. And as Easterns sit on carpets, their falling back is very different from the same movement off a chair.\n\n[FN#350] Arab. \"Ismid,\" the eye-powder before noticed.\n\n[FN#351] When the Caliph (e.g. Al-T\u00e1'i li'llah) bound a banner to a spear and handed it to an officer, he thereby appointed him Sultan or Viceregent.\n\n[FN#352] Arab. \"Sh\u00e1ib al-ingh\u00e1z\"=lit. a gray beard who shakes head in disapproval.\n\n[FN#353] Arab. \"Ay\u00e1t\" = the Hebr. \"Ototh,\" signs, wonders or\nKoranic verses.\n\n[FN#354] The Chapter \"Al-Ikhl\u00e1s\" i.e. clearing (oneself from any faith but that of Unity) is No. cxii. and runs thus:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0          Say, He is the One God!\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0                The sempiternal God,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0           He begetteth not, nor is He begot,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0              And unto Him the like is not.\n\nIt is held to be equal in value to one-third of the Koran, and is daily used in prayer. Mr. Rodwell makes it the tenth.\n\n[FN#355] The Lady Budur shows her noble blood by not objecting to her friend becoming her Zarrat (sister-wife). This word is popularly derived from \"Zarar\"=injury; and is vulgarly pronounced in Egypt \"Durrah\" sounding like Durrah = a parrot (see Burckhardt's mistake in Prov. 314). The native proverb says, \"Ayshat al-durrah murrah,\" the sister-wife hath a bitter life. We have no English equivalent; so I translate indifferently co-wife, co-consort, sister-wife or sister in wedlock.\n\n[FN#356] Lane preserves the article \"El-Amjad\" and \"El-As'ad;\" which is as necessary as to say \"the John\" or \"the James,\" because neo-Latins have \"il Giovanni\" or \"il Giacomo.\" In this matter of the article, however, it is impossible to lay down a universal rule: in some cases it must be preserved and only practice in the language can teach its use. For instance, it is always present in Al-Bahrayn and al-Yaman; but not necessarily so with Irak and Najd.\n\n[FN#357] It is hard to say why this ugly episode was introduced.\nIt is a mere false note in a tune pretty enough.\n\n[FN#358] The significance of this action will presently appear.\n\n[FN#359] An \"Had\u00eds.\"\n\n[FN#360] Arab. \"Sabb\" = using the lowest language of abuse. chiefly concerning women-relatives and their reproductive parts.\n\n[FN#361] The reader will note in the narration concerning the two Queens the parallelism of the Arab's style which recalls that of the Hebrew poets. Strings of black silk are plaited into the long locks (an \"idiot-fringe\" being worn over the brow) because a woman is cursed \"who joineth her own hair to the hair of another\" (especially human hair). Sending the bands is a sign of affectionate submission; and, in extremes\" cases the hair itself is sent.\n\n[FN#362] i.e., suffer similar pain at the spectacle, a phrase often occurring.\n\n[FN#363] i.e., when the eye sees not, the heart grieves not.\n\n[FN#364] i.e., unto Him we shall return, a sentence recurring in almost every longer chapter of the Koran.\n\n[FN#365] Arab. \"Kun,\" the creative Word (which, by the by, proves the Koran to be an uncreated Logos); the full sentence being \"Kun fa k\u00e1na\" = Be! and it became. The origin is evidently, \"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light\" (Gen. i. 3); a line grand in its simplicity and evidently borrowed from the Egyptians, even as Yahveh (Jehovah) from \"Ankh\"=He who lives (Brugsch Hist. ii. 34).\n\n[FN#366] i.e. but also for the life and the so-called \"soul.\"\n\n[FN#367] Arab. \"Lay\u00e1li\"=lit. nights which, I have said, is often applied to the whole twenty-four hours. Here it is used in the sense of \"fortune\" or \"fate ;\" like \"days\" and \"days and nights.\"\n\n[FN#368] Abdullah ibn al-Zubayr a nephew of Ayishah, who had rebuilt the Ka'abah in A.H. 64 (A.D. 683), revolted (A.D. 680) against Yezid and was proclaimed Caliph at Meccah. He was afterwards killed (A.D. 692) by the famous or infamous Hajj\u00e1j general of Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, the fifth Ommiade, surnamed \"Sweat of a stone\" (skin-flint) and \"Father of Flies,\" from his foul breath. See my Pilgrimage, etc. (iii. 192-194), where are explained the allusions to the Ka'abah and the holy Black Stone.\n\n[FN#369] These lines are part of an elegy on the downfall of one of the Moslem dynasties in Spain, composed in the twelfth century by Ibn Abdun al-Andal\u00fasi. The allusion is to the famous conspiracy of the Kh\u00e1rijites (the first sectarians in Mohammedanism) to kill Ah, Mu'awiyah and Amru (so written but pronounced \"Amr\") al-As, in order to abate intestine feuds m Al-Islam. Ali was slain with a sword-cut by Ibn Muljam a name ever damnable amongst the Persians; Mu'awiyah escaped with a wound and Kharijah, the Chief of Police at Fustat or old Cairo was murdered by mistake for Amru. After this the sectarian wars began.\n\n[FN#370] Arab. \"Sar\u00e1b\"= (Koran, chaps. xxiv.) the reek of the Desert, before explained. It is called \"Lama,\" the shine, the loom, in Al-Hariri. The world is compared with the mirage, the painted eye and the sword that breaks in the sworder's hand.\n\n[FN#371] Arab. \"Duny\u00e1,\" with the common alliteration \"d\u00e1niyah\" (=Pers. \"d\u00fan\"), in prose as well as poetry means the things or fortune of this life opp. to \"Akhirah\"=future life.\n\n[FN#372] Arab. \"Walgh,\" a strong expression primarily denoting the lapping of dogs; here and elsewhere \"to swill, saufen.\"\n\n[FN#373] The lines are repeated from Night ccxxi. I give Lane's version (ii. 162) by way of contrast and\u2014warning.\n\n[FN#374] \"S\u00e1hirah\" is the place where human souls will be gathered on Doom-day: some understand by it the Hell Sa'\u00edr (No. iv.) intended for the Sabians or the Devils generally.\n\n[FN#375] His eyes are faded like Jacob's which, after weeping for Joseph, \"became white with mourning\" (Koran, chaps. xxi.). It is a stock comparison.\n\n[FN#376] The grave.\n\n[FN#377] Arab. \"Saww\u00e1n\" (popularly pronounced Suw\u00e1n) =\"Syenite\" from Syrene; generally applied to silex, granite or any hard stone.\n\n[FN#378] A proceeding fit only for thieves and paupers: \"Alpinism\" was then unknown. \"You come from the mountain\" (al-Jabal) means, \"You are a clod-hopper\"; and \"I will sit upon the mountain\"=turn anchorite or magician. (Pilgrimage i. 106.)\n\n[FN#379] Corresponding with wayside chapels in Catholic countries. The Moslem form would be either a wall with a prayer niche (Mibr\u00e1b) fronting Meccah-wards or a small domed room. These little oratories are often found near fountains, streams or tree-clumps where travellers would be likely to alight. I have described one in Sind (\"Scinde or the Unhappy Valley\" i. 79), and have noted that scrawling on the walls is even more common in the East than in the West; witness the monuments of old Egypt bescribbled by the Greeks and Romans. Even the paws of the Sphinx are covered with such graffiti; and those of Ipsambul or Abu S\u00edmbal have proved treasures to epigraphists.\n\n[FN#380] In tales this characterises a Persian; and Hero Rustam is always so pictured.\n\n[FN#381] The Parsis, who are the representatives of the old Guebres, turn towards the sun and the fire as their Kiblah or point of prayer; all deny that they worship it. But, as in the case of saints' images, while the educated would pray before them for edification (Labia) the ignorant would adore them (Dulia); and would make scanty difference between the \"reverence of a servant\" and the \"reverence of a slave.\" The human sacrifice was quite contrary to Guebre, although not to Hindu, custom; although hate and vengeance might prompt an occasional murder.\n\n[FN#382] These oubliettes are common in old eastern houses as in the medieval Castles of Europe, and many a stranger has met his death in them. They are often so well concealed that even the modern inmates are not aware of their existence.\n\n[FN#383] Arab. \"Bakk\"; hence our \"bug\" whose derivation (like that of \"cat\" \"dog\" and \"hog\") is apparently unknown to the dictionaries, always excepting M. Littr\u00e9's.\n\n[FN#384] i.e. thy beauty is ever increasing.\n\n[FN#385] Alluding, as usual, to the eye-lashes, e.g.\nAn eyelash arrow from an eyebrow bow.\n\n[FN#386] Lane (ii. 168) reads:\u2014\"The niggardly female is protected by her niggardness;\" a change of \"Nah\u00edlah\" (bee-hive) into \"Bakh\u00edlah\" (she skin flint).\n\n[FN#387] Koran iv. 38. The advantages are bodily strength, understanding and the high privilege of Holy War. Thus far, and thus far only, woman amongst Moslems is \"lesser\n\n[FN#388] Arab. \"Amir Y\u00e1kh\u00far,\" a corruption of \"Akhor\"=stable\n(Persian).\n\n[FN#389] A servile name in Persian, meaning \"the brave,\" and a title of honour at the Court of Delhi when following the name. Many English officers have made themselves ridiculous (myself amongst the number) by having it engraved on their seal-rings, e.g. Brown S\u00e1hib Bah\u00e1dur. To write the word \"Behadir\" or \"Bah\u00e1dir\" is to adopt the wretched Turkish corruption.\n\n[FN#390] \"Jerry Sneak\" would be the English reader's comment; but in the East all charges are laid upon women.\n\n[FN#391] Here the formula means \"I am sorry for it, but I couldn't help it.\"\n\n[FN#392] A noble name of the Persian Kings (meaning the planet\nMars) corrupted in Europe to Varanes.\n\n[FN#393] Arab. \"Jall\u00e1b,\" one of the three muharram\u00e1t or forbiddens, the H\u00e1rik al-hajar (burner of stone) the K\u00e1ti' al-shajar (cutter of trees, without reference to Hawarden N. B.) and the B\u00e1yi' al-bashar (seller of men, vulg. Jall\u00e1b). The two former worked, like the Italian Carbonari, in desert places where they had especial opportunities for crime. (Pilgrimage iii. 140.) None of these things must be practiced during Pilgrimage on the holy soil of Al-Hijaz\u2014not including Jeddah.\n\n[FN#394] The verses contain the tenets of the Murjiy sect which attaches infinite importance to faith and little or none to works. Sale (sect. viii.) derives his \"Morgians\" from the \"Jabrians\" (Jabari), who are the direct opponents of the \"Kadarians\" (Kadari), denying free will and free agency to man and ascribing his actions wholly to Allah. Lane (ii. 243) gives the orthodox answer to the heretical question:\u2014\n\nWater could wet him not if God please guard His own; *\nNor need man care though bound of hands in sea he's thrown:\nBut if His Lord decree that he in sea be drowned; *\nHe'll drown albeit in the wild and wold he wone.\n\nIt is the old quarrel between Predestination and Freewill which cannot be solved except by assuming a Law without a Lawgiver.\n\n[FN#395] Our proverb says: Give a man luck and throw him into the sea.\n\n[FN#396] As a rule Easterns, I repeat, cover head and face when sleeping especially in the open air and moonlight. Europeans find the practice difficult, and can learn it only by long habit.\n\n[FN#397] Pers. = a flower-garden. In Galland, Bahram has two daughters, Bostama and Cavam a. In the Bres. Edit. the daughter is \"Bostan\" and the slave-girl \"Kaw\u00e1m.\"\n\n[FN#398] Arab. \"Kah\u00edl\"=eyes which look as if darkened with antimony: hence the name of the noble Arab breed of horses \"Kuhaylat\" (Al-Ajuz, etc.).\n\n[FN#399] \"As'ad\"=more (or most) fortunate.\n\n[FN#400] This is the vulgar belief, although Mohammed expressly disclaimed the power in the Koran (chaps. xiii. 8), \"Thou art commissioned to be a preacher only and not a worker of miracles.\" \"Signs\" (Arab. Ay\u00e1t) may here also mean verses of the Koran, which the Apostle of Allah held to be his standing miracles. He despised the common miracula which in the East are of everyday occurrence and are held to be easy for any holy man. Hume does not believe in miracles because he never saw one. Had he travelled in the East he would have seen (and heard of) so many that his scepticism (more likely that testimony should be false than miracles be true) would have been based on a firmer foundation. It is one of the marvels of our age that whilst two-thirds of Christendom (the Catholics and the \"Orthodox\" Greeks) believe in \"miracles\" occurring not only in ancient but even in our present

Lyrics[Scene starts in a Christmas Store]\n\nKIMMY: This is a year-round Christmas store? You must be the happiest woman on Earth!\nTERRY: I'm a man.\nKIMMY: That's great. Anyway, I saw this...(pulls out a \"Help Wanted\" sign) at the sign store, and I bought it to prove how serious I am about working here.\nTERRY: Yeah, we're not really hiring. It's just...\nKIMMY: (screams)I've got a bomb! (in normal voice) And now that I've got your attention, here's my resume.(hands resume to Terry)\nTERRY: (looks at resume) This says you were a babysitter from 1997 to 1998, then there's a 15-year gap\nKIMMY: Look, I know I'm not perfect, but let me tell you about another imperfect employee. His name was Rudolph, and he was a joke. Some say his mother made it with a doorbell light, but when he was given a chance, Rudolph went down in history, and that reindeer's name was Rudolph. All I'm asking for is a chance to get my life back on track. Last week, I threw myself at a married man.\nI'm like a lollipop with a question mark on its wrapper. I don't know what's going on inside. But if anything can remind me of what's good and right in the world, it's this place. They say there's a war on Christmas. Well, sir, put me on the front line, 'cause if any Grinches or Scrooges dare come over that hill, I'll make them wish they'd never been born!\nCUTTO: Kimmy walking down the street in an elf costume. She spots a pair of Orthodox Jews.\n\nKIMMY: Oh, no. Those Santas must be coming from a funeral. I'm so sorry for your loss, Santas.\n\nAs Kimmy continues walking down the street, a car crashes into a cluster of trash cans right in front of her.\n\nKIMMY: Jeepers! (Jackie gets out of the car)\nJACKIE: Why is your phone going straight to voice mail?\nKIMMY: Jacqueline, hi! Huh? (Kimmy pulls out her phone and sees that Lillian has been on the phone with her for more than 70 minutes)\nLILLIAN: So not all toxic mold is black, but all black mold is toxic\nKIMMY: (puts phone away) What are you doing here?\nJACKIE: I need a place to stay. I just found out my ex-husband sold the town house. He's in escrow.\nKIMMY: Ugh. He's such an escrow.\nJACKIE: I had to clean out my closets and get the jewelry from the safe. (opens backseat door and starts getting something out of the car)\nKIMMY: Of course you can stay here, but wouldn't you rather be in a fancy hotel? When I did the Today Show, they put me in a hotel where the hallways had trays of free floor food.\nJACKIE: No, I can't afford that right now.\nKIMMY: But you have 12 million...\nJACKIE: (whispers) You shut your wet mouth! Don't ever let anyone know how little I got in the divorce. Now get me inside before someone helicopters over this neighborhood and sees me. (impersonating an old lady) Flores! Flores para los muertos! Are they buying it?\n\nCUTTO: Interior of Kimmy and Titus's apartment\n\nMrs. Voorhees Oh, wait. You're divorced. What do I call you now? Mrs. Voor-hers?\nJACKIE: Ms. White. That's my Sioux family name. It was given to us in the 1920s by a sarcastic census taker.\nJACKIE: Okay, Ms. White, what are you doing back in New York?\nJACKIE: Kimmy, I need your help.\nKIMMY: Help? That's what we elves are born to do.\nJACKIE: Oh, you are dressed like an elf. I just assumed it was the trucker pills. So what's the hardest thing in the world for a trophy wife to do? Lose the jerk but keep the perks. Trademark me.\nJulian's the jerk, and the perks are everything I worked him so hard to achieve. And I'm gonna get it all back.\n[Theme Song]\n\nJACKIE: The first thing we have to do is let the city know I'm back.\nKIMMY: I'll get my jumbo sidewalk chalk.\nJACKIE: Luckily, the gatekeepers of New York society are all moms at St. Clotilde's School for Fancy Boys, where Buckley is kept.\n\nCUTTO: A scene with the moms at the St. Clotilde's School for Fancy Boys\n\nJACKIE: They're thin, they're rich, and I'm their natural enemy A gorgeous divorcee with the pelvic floor of a 12-year-old boy.\nKIMMY: Gross.\nJACKIE: But if I can win over their queen, the others will follow.\nDEIRDRE: Reg is dragging me to the prewar auction at J. O. Brothers tonight, and I am not doing that sober, so who's up for margaritas after Pilates Stella McCartney vegan ankle boot bahn mi detox?\n\nAll of the other mothers laugh\n\nCUTTO: Present time, Kimmy's apartment\n\nJACKIE: Deirdre Robespierre.\nKIMMY: Owen R's mom? He's so cool!\nJACKIE: I have custody of Buckley this week. You go to after-school pickup and let the other nannies know I'm back. If anyone asks where I've been, just say the Cote d'Azur. (Kimmy attempts to pronounce \"Cote d'Azur\") Right, I forgot. Say I've been in Europe Traveling and trying to figure out how to spend my half of $3 billion. Got it? Okay, now I'm meeting a broker to look at apartments.You know what to do\n\nThere's a crashing sound and Jackie screams\nTITUS: Heavenly Father!\n\nKimmy walks into Titus's room\nKIMMY: Titus, what happened? Much like Icarus, a friend of mine who once put too much stuff in his closet, I put too much stuff in my closet.\n\nTitus points at his closet which is now a mess. He looks at Jackie, confused, and looks back at Kimmy\n\nKIMMY: Oh, my gosh. Oh, Jacqueline's gonna be staying with us for a few days. You two have met before, right?\nJACKIE: Doorman at Barney's.\nTITUS: We buried a robot together. (Jackie exits) I can't believe \"clo-zay\" is gone.\nKIMMY: Well, do you really need all these clothes? I mean, when's the last time you wore red suspender shorts or puffy white gloves? Yes. Mickey-Mousing hasn't been a thing in the community for quite some time.\nKIMMY: So why don't you get rid of some of this stuff?\nTITUS: Because each one of these pieces is a little piece of me. Especially this pleather vest that melted onto me after I fell asleep at a beach.\nKIMMY: Then give it to Goodwill. When I was a kid, that's where I got my cool nurse shoes, and I was all, \"Hi, I'm a nurse. After our shift, let's go to the bar at the Ramada.\"\nTITUS: The world would be a better place if everyone dressed more like me. Speaking of which, is that my elf costume? Oh, no, I left mine in that river.\n\nCUTTO: Kimmy entering Jackie's old home, she looks in a drawer and finds her ID and pockets it.\n\nKIMMY: There's my ID.\nXAN: What the hell are you doing here?\nKIMMY: Being in a stupid-face contest and coming in second.\nXAN: Well, I'm here cleaning my room out to take stuff back to Connecticut. Connecticut! Do you know what my life is like now because of you? I'm on a field hockey team. I scored twice against Country Day, and it's all your fault!\nKIMMY: Are you seriously still mad at me? I did it for your own good, Xan. Someday you'll thank me.\nXAN: Yeah, when pigs fly. Oh, my God. I sound so lame now!\nKIMMY: And stupid. Pigs fly all the time, Xan, or did you think prize pigs walk to international pig competitions?\n\nXan groans and exits while Kimmy, feeling victorious, blows the smoke from her finger as if it's a recently-fired pistol and holsters it\n\nCUTTO: Titus's apartment where Titus and Lillian are trying to figure out what clothes to give away\n\nTITUS: This is not gonna be easy.\nLILLIAN: I get it. After all these years, I still haven't thrown away my late husband's clothes and not just 'cause I dress up in them to cash his disability checks.\nTITUS: I suppose I could part with this. (picks up a white t-shirt that says \"Pick Me Bob!\") It's irrelevant now that Drew Carey's the host of the show.\nLILLIAN: Yeah.\nTITUS: And my bunion outgrew these limited-edition Air Jordache thigh-tops. (picks up a pair of unreasonably long boots) Oh, and these shants. Oh, shorts that are as long as pants. Bye, shants.\nLILLIAN: Good for you, Titus.\nTITUS: Good for mankind, Lillian. Imagine a world where everyone shares my sense of fabulousness. There'd be no more war, no more famine, no more stupid polo shirts where the horse is, like, the whole shirt!\nLILLIAN: Oh, yay! (Titus begins stuffing his old clothes in a trashbag) Go, Titus!\n\nCUTTO: The School for Fancy Boys, Kimmy enters and tries to strike up a conversation with some parents\n\nKIMMY: Hey, guys. Remember me? I brought in those nut brownies that almost killed a couple kids? Cool, cool. (Owen enters) Owen R. (Kimmy walks towards him and starts talking to the woman who is taking care of Owen) You must be Owen's nanny. Whatevs. (The woman turns around and reveals herself as Deirdre Robespierre) I love you.\nDEIRDRE: Oh, you're Kimmy, Buckley's nanny.\nKIMMY: You smell like summer.\nDEIRDRE: It's actually pre-fall, but you're sweet. So where has Jacqueline been? We miss her.\nKIMMY: Traveling in Yerp. Euur-up.\nDEIRDRE: Well, please tell her I would love to see her whenever she has time.\nKIMMY: She would like that.\nDEIRDRE: Oh, any chance she could do a playdate today?  (pulls out phone) Owen has blimping until 3:00. Would 3:30 work?\nKIMMY: (pulls out phone to, imitating Deirdre, scrolls through pictures of herself and a squirrel) Um checking calendar. Let me see. Aww Hmm. Yes?\nDEIRDRE: Oh, then it's a date. (uses Siri) Buckley playdate, 3:30.\nKIMMY: (also uses Siri) Owen playdate, 3:30.\nSIRI: I found the following on the web for \"urine playmate, teen dirty.\"\nKIMMY: Siri, no!\n\nDeirdre waves goodbye, exits.\n\nCUTTO: Titus and Lillian walking through the city\n\nLILLIAN: Now they filled in the sinkhole. Where am I supposed to number two when I have a gentleman caller?\n\nTitus looks confused and disgusted, they walk into a store\n\nTITUS: (door clicks indicating their presence) Pardon me, do you have any more mannequins? My pieces will warrant a window display.\nSTORE OWNER: Mannequins? No, we don't have...Hey! Sicko! Beat it! (the man the store owner is referring to leaves) You got donations, just throw 'em on the pile.\n\nStore owner indicates a pile of old clothes in a messy pile. Titus looks disheartened\n\nTITUS: All the better. My clothes will be plucked from this hellhole like so many little orphans Annie.\nLILLIAN: Exactly. Your clothes are special, like Annie.\nTITUS: The rest of this stuff, it's ugly. No one wants it, like the other orphans, who eventually aged out of the system. (Titus carefully puts his clothes onto the pile) I'm so proud.(they leave the store)\n\nCUTTO: Jackie looking at papers in Kimmy and Titus's apartment, Kimmy enters\n\nJACKIE: Well, my apartment search has been a disaster. Everything is either too expensive or just horrible. Look at this view. If I can see New Jersey, that means it can see me.\nKIMMY: Okay, so at pickup, I talked to Mrs. Robespierre\nJACKIE: What? She was there? Her style, how effortless was it on a scale from none to zero?\nKIMMY: Look, after school, I dropped Buckley off at Little League, even though he didn't have any equipment\nJACKIE: Because he's an owner. He just watches the games from his luxury tree.\nKIMMY: Okay, but later today, he has a playdate with Owen and Owen's mom.\nJACKIE: Oh, Kimmy! I could just kiss you! (gets up, ready to kiss Kimmy) But we shouldn't, right? (uncomfortable silence, then she goes to the closet to get changed) Because I should go get dressed. Maybe I've been overthinking this. I mean, I haven't been gone that long, and I am the best to be around. Listen to this laugh. (laughs derisively) More rosee? (closes closet door) I am fun, and I absolutely underestimated Deirdre.\nKIMMY: What a sweetheart! She's so nice. She remembered my name, and she said since you've been traveling, she'll come to you.\n\nJackie punches a hole in Kimmy's closet door and then slides the door open\n\nJACKIE: (whispers) And where exactly do you expect her to go? Perhaps we should meet at the apartment that I don't have? Or did you expect her to come here? To this?\nKIMMY: I call it Kimmy's Klubhouse, with two K's.\nJACKIE: (sits down slowly) That's why Deirdre wanted to have a playdate, to see how I'm living now.\nKIMMY: Can't you just say we'll meet in the park?\nJACKIE: She'll see right through that. People don't go to the park when they have their own backyards and terraces. Unless you have something even better planned.\nKIMMY: Like visiting a place where it's Christmas all year and you have to guess whether it's a man?\nJACKIE: It has to be something that requires access, connections, special treatment. I went to a playdate once where the kids got to run the Greek economy.\nKIMMY: We can beat that. What are nine-year-old boys into? Koosh balls. Pokemon. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\nJACKIE: Yes, the Mutant Ninja Turtles. I can work with that.\nKIMMY: Really? That one's still a thing? Why?\nJACKIE: Focus up, Kimmy. I need you to run back to the town house (Kimmy starts running, exits, and then re-enters)\nKIMMY: Just practicing. I knew there was more plan. What's up?\n\nCUTTO: Jackie's old townhouse, Kimmy is singing the TMNT theme song\n\nKIMMY: (singing) Heroes in a half shell! Turtle power! Whoever wrote that song deserves to be a billionaire! (passes by a poster that says \"Chuck Lorre Wrote That Song)\n\nCUTTO: Hallway in townhouse\n\nKIMMY: (breaks into a box labeled \"Playdate Wine\" and notices Xan)Oh. What are you still doing here? Are you crying?\nXAN: (sarcastic) No, this is the cool way to do your makeup now.\nKIMMY: I know. I subscribe to Teen Beat.\nXAN: You're insane.\nKIMMY: Look, I know change is hard\nXAN: Do you? This house has been the only constant in my life. Every year, it's like, \"Here's your new mom, your new school, your new nose\" (realizes she said too much) What? No. Shut up!\nKIMMY: I actually had to leave my home when I was about your age.\nXAN: Yeah? (stands up) Well, I bet you hate the person who made you do it. Guess what, Kimmy. For me, that person's you.(exits)\nKIMMY: But that makes me the Reverend. I'm not the Reverend.\n\nKimmy begins picking something up when she notices a poster on the wall that says \"Yes You Are\". She looks distraught\n\nCUTTO: Owen and Buckley playing with weapons in the park while Deirdre and Jackie watch, Kimmy enters with bags\nJackie: Oh, Kimmy. Wonderful. (Kimmy hands her bags) Thank you.\nDEIRDRE: Thank you.\nJACKIE: Oh, Kimmy, I also need you to (loudly) call my hotel. My suite is so big, I keep getting lost. Have them send up a guide monkey. (to Kimmy, quietly) Does Deirdre look impressed? (Kimmy goes to look) Damn it, don't look. Does she?\nKIMMY: I'm a good person, right?\nJACKIE: Who cares?\nKIMMY: I know I'm not perfect. I sometimes look at magazine covers without paying for them, and I've made some kissing mistakes\nJACKIE: Hey. Making out with John Mayer is just part of living in New York.\nKIMMY: But I also help you all the time, and I don't step on cracks, even though I haven't seen my mother in years, and sending Xan to Connecticut was for her own good. It doesn't make me the Reverend.\n\nDeirdre walks over with the boys who are now wearing masks and tortious shells on their back\n\nDEIRDRE: I think it's time for some Mutant Ninja Turtles to go an adventure! These costumes are just wonderful.\nJACKIE: The tortoise shells were collected by Buckley's grandfather during a hunting trip to the Galapagos.\nDEIRDRE: Oh.\nJACKIE: (directed at Kimmy) We need to get through this, Schmidt. You're not the Reverend, okay? Now get these kids underground, and don't let the police see you.\n\nKIMMY: (talking to the kids, leading them away) All right, Turtles! Let's go to your secret hideout in the sewer! Yeah! Okay, come on.\nJACKIE: Be safe.\nDEIRDRE: Bye.\n\nKimmy pulls the sewer cap out of the ground with both of her arms with less effort than it should take to pull off such a feat. Deirdre and Jackie stare, amazed.\n\nJACKIE: She should not be able to do that.\n\nBUCKLEY: Look, a rat! Is it Master Splinter?\nOWEN: Mm-hmm.\nBUCKLEY: Oh, yeah! There's hundreds of them.\nJACKIE: Ugh.\nDEIRDRE: So how's the apartment hunt?\nJACKIE: Everything's too affordable. I really like that new building that Rem Koolhaas and Michael Stipe designed.\nDEIRDRE: The Rem Koolhaas, R.E.M. Cool House? Hmm? Oh, a Birkin bag.\nJACKIE: It's the one that's made entirely out of famous Internet cats.\nDEIRDRE: Oh, no, no, I know. It's just, those came out last year. This is exactly why I love you, Jacqueline. You don't care what anybody thinks.\nJACKIE: Oh, Deirdre. I never can tell if you're trying to help me or destroy me! (both fake laughter)\nDEIRDRE: (laughs) I honestly don't know! I have a degree in political science from Princeton, and all that wasted mental energy has to go somewhere.(both fake laughter)\n\nCUTTO: Titus and Lillian walking back into the same store where Titus donated his old clothes\n\nLILLIAN: I'll be in intimates.\n\nTitus walks past the bag of clothes he donated and notices that there's a five dollar price tag on the entire bag\n\nTITUS: Is this some sort of joke? Is this sticker a phone call from Crank Yankers? Is it? (a man walks over and rummages around inside the bag) The culottes can also be used as pants for stuffed animals.\n\nThe man looks through the bag for a while before settling on wearing the bag but not the actual clothes themselves. Titus looks offended\n\nLILLIAN: Hey, Titus, you got a D battery on you? I want to whip a Philadelphia snowball at those hipsters. (points at hipsters near the checkout desk)\nTITUS: Millennials. They'll appreciate me.\nFEMALE HIPSTER: Millennia, this is perfect. (holding the pair of pants Titus donated, Titus looks happy) For our sketch show about ladies who work at Jennifer Convertibles!\nTITUS: Unacceptable! You people don't know the meaning of the word \"sensuali-Titus-travaganza!\" That's it! (picks up all of the clothes he donates) Donation canceled! Pearls before swine! I should have known better. You people don't deserve Titus!\nLILLIAN: (wearing a bra over her clothes that she clearly found in the store) And I was wearing this when I came in.\nSTORE OWNER: (at the man who was previously told to leave the store) Hey! Buddy, get out of here! (man leaves, wearing a tennis/raquetball outfit)\n\nCUTTO: Titus and Lillian walking down the street with Titus holding a large bundle of his old clothes\n\nTITUS: This is why I never open myself up to the world. I just get rejected like a crinkly dollar bill in a vending machine!\nLILLIAN: Titus, no. You're very smooth. You're like a pudding man.\nTITUS: Good-bye, cruel world! (throws old clothes in dumpster) I wish Bruce Willis had let that asteroid hit you! Hashtag spoiler alert!\n\nCUTTO: Deirdre and Jackie walking down the street, laughing, they find Kimmy, Owen, and Buckley\n\nBUCKLEY: We killed Bebop the pig man and ate so much pizza!\nDEIRDRE: Well, this was so much fun. I would say, \"See you tonight,\" but lucky for you, you don't have a husband. I just mean you don't have a husband who drags you to auctions every other night. You know Reg and his art. He and his sister have the world's largest collection of Greek incest pottery.\nJACKIE: Well, let me come with you. I'll keep you company.\nDEIRDRE: Oh, that's so sweet, but it's just no fun when you can't bid.\nJACKIE: I'm not sure I know what you mean.\nDEIRDRE: Darling, can I tell you something? As a friend?\nJACKIE: I don't know. Can you?\nDEIRDRE: I'm honestly not sure. I have a 150 IQ, but I spent all morning picking out dog stationery. Maybe I'm just tormenting you just to feel alive, but also there is a chance this is real empathy. We may never know!\nJACKIE: Okay, friend, what is it? Some hateful rumor about my divorce?\nDEIRDRE: Oh, you are not as dumb as I say people say you are. Look, I hate to dignify this, but there is a rumor that you only got $12 million from Julian.\nJACKIE: Wow. That is absurd. I've never had 12 of anything. $12 million. I mean, would a dozenaire have a chauffeured Bentley? I don't think so. Get in the car, kids. Let's get in the car. See you tonight, sweetie.  (as they get in the car, Jackie slides out to the other side over a man, Kimmy and Buckley follow) Excuse me. Stay down. (crawling carefully) Get to that bus.\nBUCKLEY: What's a bus?\nJACKIE: I can't keep this up.\n\nCUTTO: Titus's bedroom where Titus is on his bed, depressed.\n\nLILLIAN: Titus! Titus, you'll never believe it!\nTITUS: Go away, Lillian. I've decided to live as a bed from now on.\nLILLIAN: But your clothes are gone! Somebody took 'em!\nTITUS: (gets up) They did?\nLILLIAN: Yeah! Oh, that's Wait a minute. (looks around suspiciously)\nLILLIAN: Oh, Titus, you are not on Crank Yankers. It's not a show anymore, and they would call you. (Titus smiles)\n\nCUTTO: The dumpster where Titus left his clothes\n\nTITUS: I just wish we could have met the chic sophisticate that was rummaging through a Dumpster on a hot weekday afternoon.\nLILLIAN: I'm just happy there's another Titus out there.\nTITUS: It's too bad we'll never know who he is. He could have been my stunt double if I were ever to get cast in a movie that involves stairs.\nLILLIAN: Well, I'll see you back at the house. I found some unshredded mail in there, so I'm gonna go open up a Kohl's card.\n\nTitus finds a clothing item that used to belong to him, and then another, and then another, forming a breadcrumb trail of clothes\n\nTITUS: One of my Mickey-Mousing gloves. Other Titus must have dropped it. Teddy von Bearington's pants and/or my culottes. My shants!\n\nCUTTO: A truck, where a few more articles of Titus's clothes are scattered. A construction worker comes over to talk to him.\n\nMIKEY: Can I help you, pal?\nTITUS: So sorry. It's just that I threw away some clothes earlier, and then I Hansel-and-Gretel'd myself to your backless car thingy.\nMIKEY: Hang on. I know you.\nTITUS: I don't think so. I am an enigma.\nMIKEY: No, dude, you're the...You're the first guy I ever hit on. I'm Mikey? I came out to you.\nTITUS: Of course. I remember your wrists. Titus Andromedon. You may know me from my attendance at such films as Must Love Dogs and the first 20 minutes of Interstellar. Anyway, you dropped these.\nMIKEY: Sorry. I'm not exactly out out at work, you know? I got to put up a front. Go to the strip club with the guys, airbrush a hot chick on the back of my truck. (shows the back of his truck, which has a graphic of Tilda Swinton)\nTITUS: Oh I get it. Putting yourself out there is scary.\nMIKEY: Right? And with the gay stuff, I don't know where to start. Sometimes I snazz things up at work, like Like with this shirt, but then the guys start razzing me, like, \"How's it going, Mr. Shirt?\" That kind of thing. But when I saw your clothes in the Dumpster, I just...Just thought they were real beautiful.\nTITUS: Thank you. That's...Thank you. Well, goodbye forever.\nMIKEY: Titus, wait. Don't you think it's...I don't know...A sign, running into each other like this? Do we believe in signs, us homos? I can say that, right?\nTITUS: It's America. You can say anything except...(drill drowns out what Titus is saying) Jezebel.\nMIKEY: Right, well, look, you already rejected me once, but you remind me of Carlos Delgado from the Mets, and that's just hot, and, uh, whatever. You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. Right?\nTITUS: Mathematically, no. But I do know what you're saying.\nMIKEY: Okay. So...(imitates a basketball player taking a shot) You want to go out sometime?\nTITUS: Oh. (chuckles, then becomes serious, writes down his number on Mikey's hand and walks away while Mikey celebrates)\n\nCUTTO: Kimmy's apartment, Kimmy washes her hands while Jackie is on the couch, talking to her\n\nJACKIE: This isn't gonna work. I can't do it, and I'm not a quitter, Kimmy. I watched Interstellar all the way to the end.\nKIMMY: You can't keep doing this?\nJACKIE: Yes, me. Is there anyone else here?\nKIMMY: I try to be a good person, but I don't feel good at all, and it's not just the sewer pizza. Xan hates me, Owen got a rat bite, and all you're doing is lying about how much money you have, where you live, what monkeys do at hotels. And how come? So you can go back to your dumb life you hated? What's the point?\nJACKIE: I don't know about Xan. Did you see her? Did she get fat in Connecticut? But you're helping me do something really important and good.\nKIMMY: 'Splain it.\nJACKIE: I came back to New York to help my family.\nKIMMY: By turning into a Deirdre and making me fight a gutter pig?\nJACKIE: The Dutch bought Manhattan for $24 worth of beads. Today it's worth a trillion, and I plan to make up the difference.\nKIMMY: But who even has that much beads? Maybe Michael's Arts & Crafts. Ask for Jan!\nJACKIE: Every year, men like Deirdre's husband donate billions to charity. They support art museums, wiener disease research, super PACs that drive poor people to the circus on election day.\nKIMMY: And you get free peanuts.\nJACKIE: You know who Robin Hood is?\nKIMMY: Uh, yeah. That Disney movie where Robin Hood's a fox? When you were little, did you think he was handsome? And then, like, your crotch gets a headache?\nJACKIE: Are you kidding? That voice and how he didn't wear pants? Well, I'm trying to be Robin Hood. Take from the rich and give to the poor. If I can get back into Deirdre's world, I can start a charity that will make up for 400 years of Dutch oppression, but I won't get a penny unless I'm taken seriously, and if I fail, I can't go back home.\nKIMMY: You know, in the bunker, when a new girl showed up, there was one way she could get instant respect. Go up to the toughest-looking girl there and punch her in the face.\n\nCUTTO: Flashback of the bunker, Kimmy is talking to Cyndee.\n\nKIMMY: What does the Reverend even see in her?\nCYNDEE: It's like, talk American, right? (Donna walks in and punches Cyndee in the face, knocking her to the ground, Kimmy gasps)\nDONNA: (in Spanish) Now you're all my bitches! Mm!\n\nAs Cyndee gets up, Gretchen walks in and punches her in the face again, knocking her to the ground.\n\nKIMMY: Who the heck are you?\nGRETCHEN: I'm Gretchen. I just got here.\n\nCUTTO: Present Time, Kimmy's apartment\n\nKIMMY: After that, no one messes with you. I don't know what the rich blonde lady version of a bunker punch is\nJACKIE: I do. Kimmy, I need you to go back to the town house and get Julian's father's slave auction paddle.\nKIMMY: Father? That's not long enough ago.\nJACKIE: And, look, I know I've been making you run back and forth all day, but I can't go back to that house. Too many terrible memories.\nKIMMY: That's it! (stands up) That's how I help Xan!\nJACKIE: Did you hear? She got fat in Connecticut.\n\nCUTTO: Jackie's old townhouse, Xan is leaning agains a wall with benchmarks of her life. Kimmy enters\n\nKIMMY: You must have a lot of great memories in this house.\nXAN: I don't get it. I was putting Windex in your food, like, every day.\nKIMMY: I bet each room in this house is special to you. Obviously this one is. It's funny, 'cause this is also where your tutor Charles and I would tongue out in secret.\nXAN: Wait. What?\nKIMMY: Oh, yeah. We'd be all (imitating two people making out) Oh, yeah! Gimme! Oh, yeah!\nXAN: Wh-Why are you doing that? Ew!\n\nCUTTO: Another room in the house\n\nKIMMY: You must have a lot of great memories in here. Breakfast on Christmas morning, hanging out with your friends, to say nothing of lunch! I did a lot of stuff here, too. For example playing \"Sexy Cat Burglar Avoiding Lasers\" (Kimmy plays \"Sexy Cat Burglar Avoiding Lasers\" while Xan watches). Rapping my cool Kimmy raps.\n\nKimmy raps, using a wooden spoon as a microphone while Jan watches\n\nKIMMY: Xan's got a plan With her friend Jan in the tan van, man Aww (beatboxes)\n\nCUTTO: Kimmy shows Xan two mirrors facing each other, creating a never-ending, repeating mirage\n\nKIMMY: And look, a world of infinite Kimmys.\nXAN: Please stop!\n\nCUTTO: Townhouse balcony\n\nKIMMY: Any good memories out here?\nXAN: No.\nKIMMY: Cool, 'cause this is where I threw up baked beans and sewer pizza.\nXAN: You what? When?\nKIMMY: Right now! (vomits)\n\nCUTTO: Xan and Kimmy walk back inside, Xan takes off her sweater angrily\n\nXAN: Damn it, Kimmy, that's where I had my first kiss. You're like an HGTV renovation team. You come into someone's home and ruin it with your stupidity. You ruined the house I grew up in. (grabs bags and starts walking away)\nKIMMY: I bet that makes it easier to leave.\nXAN: Do you think you're helping me?\nKIMMY:You're heading for the door.\nXAN: (smiles) You're so weird.\nKIMMY: In bed! (snaps as Xan leaves)\nAUCTIONEER: Going once, going twice...\nKIMMY: What are you doing?\nJACKIE: Using my $12 million to punch Deirdre in her white mouth.\nAUCTIONEER: Sold to the lady in the front row for $11 1/2 million.\n\nKimmy throws away Jackie's bidding sign\n\nAUCTIONEER: I'm so sorry. I didn't recognize you, Mrs. Voorhee I mean Ms. White.\n\nRoom applauds, Jackie and Kimmy exit, acknowledging Deirdre on their way out\n\nDEIRDRE: She must have taken Julian for all he's worth, and now she's returned in full, like Alcibiades to Athens, and I have become her Eupolis. Oh, I picked up Mookie's stationery.\n\nJackie walks out of the room, panicked expression on her face\n\n[End]Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/859080",

if you\u2019re following me on twitter you know I had diarrhea today. Am I using that website properly? Sometimes I like to sit on the toilet reverse. \u201cWe\u2019re listening.\u201d Its nice right? You can turn around; you can lean on the tank. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be here for a while.\u201d Yea, the people that are clapping right now are the ones like \u201cOk, all kidding aside, he is a genius.\u201d No no no. It\u2019s the simplicity. I\u2019ve been sitting on that thing my whole life, you\u2019re telling me I can turn around have a bowl of cereal? Yea, set the alarm ten minutes later? Multitask. All right, nobody should eat while on the toilet. \u201cBut I\u2019m lactose intolerant and i've always wanted to enjoy a bowl of puffins with whole milk.\u201d It\u2019s more of an almond milk cereal but live your dream. Somebody emailed me and they were like \u201cHey dipshit.\u201d Uh, which for the record is a wonderful subject line if you ever want me to read your emails. \u201cOh, lets see what this nice fan has to say. You had me at hello.\u201d He\u2019s like \u201cYou know you have to take your pants completely off to sit on the toilet backwards.\u201d Touch\u00e9. All right, so I don\u2019t research, it\u2019s a pre-shower shit agreed? Can we move on sticklers to every joke detail? You ever have a post shower shit? Oh, might as well go back to bed and start your whole day over. Things are wrong, that\u2019s not the order of events, there\u2019s a glitch in the matrix, this worlds not real, Mom! Wipe me! I recently started flat-ironing my ball hair. Come no ladies you know how it is, if you have curly hair you just want straight hair. So now when people see my balls they\u2019re like \u201coh my goodness that looks really really good. Isn\u2019t that damaging to the hair?\u201d I'm like \u201cyea, but what are you gonna do?\u201d I wish Victoria beckham would knock it off with all the cute do\u2019s I can't keep up. My ! balls still have the \u201906 posh. Remember that little trendy l! ittle cu t? Posh spice? Looks like my testicles. Am I the only person that hopes David beckham has sex with brad Pitt? I don\u2019t know who\u2019s in charge of casting in Hollywood but make it happen before one of ems out of their prime. Can you imagine those two men together making love? Oh, if there\u2019s a man in here that\u2019s junk doesn\u2019t wiggle just a little bit at the thought of those two men together, this has nothing to do with your homophobic sexual preference, at that level its art you monkey. Ok? You should be honored to share the same restroom with those Greek gods. Can you imagine if they had a child? \u201cAhhhhh.\u201d \u201cThe f- was that simba? What the fuck was that simba? That\u2019s the beckham Pitt kid? That\u2019s pittcum? The most beautiful child the world has ever seen?\u201d picture baby Jesus, with better abs. that\u2019s a good-looking baby. If they ha a baby Abercrombie store they\u2019d hire him to work the front door. Right? Just standing there, shirtless, propped up, he can't stand! yet, just leaning against the wall. Big poster, big poster of himself just standing there, little tight pampers. And you\u2019d walk in and you\u2019d be like \u201c I don\u2019t wanna say this, but I wanna fuck that baby. Oh man do I wanna fuck that baby. If I had three wishes two of them would be to fuck that baby and the third would be for more wishes. Oh you can't do that. Then I wanna fuck the baby a third time. I would like to use all three wishes, for banging that baby.\u201d Go ahead dumb people be offended by a joke that doesn\u2019t have a plausible premise. Oh id love to read your email, \u201cI felt you went over the line a bit, when you theoretically wanted to fornicate with a mythical child.\u201d Heads up Mormons this jokes gonna sting. Next time a golden plate falls from the heavens, go ahead and put it in your spam file. Lets not base your entire life on a religion that\u2019s old enough for my dad to be like, \u201coh yea, that\u2019s not true. That didn\u2019t happen. I don\u2019t know why the! y\u2019re wearing their pajamas under their clothes. I assume tha! t their god wants them to be comfy.\u201d The Mormon Church spent twenty million dollars in the state of California, making sure that queers didn\u2019t legally get married. Successfully I might add. So I guess we\u2019re not all as liberal as we thought. And this is what I say to the most conservative person, that\u2019s so terrified of gay marriage becoming legal, just because the state says its legal, its not like gods gonna let them into heaven. So you can still sleep sound every night knowing that goal line defense is up at the pearly gates just going \u201cyou\u2019re not getting in here faggots.\u201dYou might also like1Embed"}, {"_type":

I know that now, and I would never try to deny it. But this is actually okay, because I will never satisfy a woman, either.\n\nShould I be writing such thoughts? Perhaps not. Perhaps it\u2019s a bad idea. I can definitely foresee a scenario where that first paragraph could come back to haunt me, especially if I somehow became marginally famous. If I become marginally famous, I will undoubtedly be interviewed by someone in the media, 1 and the interviewer will inevitably ask, \u201cFifteen years ago, you wrote that no woman could ever satisfy you. Now that you\u2019ve been married for almost five years, are those words still true?\u201d And I will have to say, \u201cOh, God no. Those were the words of an entirely different person\u2014a person whom I can\u2019t even relate to anymore. Honestly, I can\u2019t image an existence without _____. She satisfies me in ways that I never even considered. She saved my life, really.\u201d\n\nNow, I will be lying. I won\u2019t really feel that way. But I\u2019ll certainly say those words, and I\u2019ll deliver them with the utmost sincerity, even though those sentiments will not be there. So then the interviewer will undoubtedly quote lines from this particular paragraph, thereby reminding me that I swore I would publicly deny my true feelings, and I\u2019ll chuckle and say, \u201cCome on, Mr. Rose. That was a literary device. You know I never really believed that.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: I do believe that. It\u2019s the truth now, and it will be in the future. And while I\u2019m not exactly happy about that truth, it doesn\u2019t make me sad, either. I know it\u2019s not my fault.\n\nIt\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, really. Or maybe it\u2019s everyone\u2019s fault. It should be everyone\u2019s fault, because it\u2019s everyone\u2019s problem. Well, okay\u2026not everyone. Not boring people, and not the profoundly retarded. But whenever I meet dynamic, nonretarded Americans, I notice that they all seem to share a single unifying characteristic: the inability to experience the kind of mind-blowing, transcendent romantic relationship they perceive to be a normal part of living. And someone needs to take the fall for this. So instead of blaming no one for this (which is kind of cowardly) or blaming everyone (which is kind of meaningless), I\u2019m going to blame John Cusack.\n\nI once loved a girl who almost loved me, but not as much as she loved John Cusack. Under certain circumstances, this would have been fine; Cusack is relatively good-looking, he seems like a pretty cool guy (he likes the Clash and the Who, at least), and he undoubtedly has millions of bones in the bank. If Cusack and I were competing for the same woman, I could easily accept losing. However, I don\u2019t really feel like John and I were \u201ccompeting\u201d for the girl I\u2019m referring to, inasmuch as her relationship to Cusack was confined to watching him as a two-dimensional projection, pretending to be characters who don\u2019t actually exist. Now, there was a time when I would have thought that detachment would have given me a huge advantage over Johnny C., inasmuch as my relationship with this woman included things like \u201ctalking on the phone\u201d and \u201cnuzzling under umbrellas\u201d and \u201ceating pancakes.\u201d However, I have come to realize that I perceived this competition completely backward; it was definitely an unfair battle, but not in my favor. It was unfair in Cusack\u2019s favor. I never had a chance.\nIt appears that countless women born between the years of 1965 and 1978 are in love with John Cusack. I cannot fathom how he isn\u2019t the number-one box-office star in America, because every straight girl I know would sell her soul to share a milkshake with that motherfucker. For upwardly mobile women in their twenties and thirties, John Cusack is the neo-Elvis. But here\u2019s what none of these upwardly mobile women seem to realize: They don\u2019t love John Cusack. They love Lloyd Dobler. When they see Mr. Cusack, they are still seeing the optimistic, charmingly loquacious teenager he played in Say Anything, a movie that came out more than a decade ago. That\u2019s the guy they think he is; when Cusack played Eddie Thomas in America\u2019s Sweethearts or the sensitive hit man in Grosse Pointe Blank, all his female fans knew he was only acting\u2026but they assume when the camera stopped rolling, he went back to his genuine self\u2026which was someone like Lloyd Dobler\u2026which was, in fact, someone who is Lloyd Dobler, and someone who continues to have a storybook romance with Diane Court (or with Ione Skye, depending on how you look at it). And these upwardly mobile women are not alone. We all convince ourselves of things like this\u2014not necessarily about Say Anything, but about any fictionalized portrayals of romance that happen to hit us in the right place, at the right time. This is why I will never be completely satisfied by a woman, and this is why the kind of woman I tend to find attractive will never be satisfied by me. We will both measure our relationship against the prospect of fake love.\n\nFake love is a very powerful thing. That girl who adored John Cusack once had the opportunity to spend a weekend with me in New York at the Waldorf-Astoria, but she elected to fly to Portland instead to see the first U.S. appearance by Coldplay, a British pop group whose success derives from their ability to write melodramatic alt-rock songs about fake love. It does not matter that Coldplay is absolutely the shittiest fucking band I\u2019ve ever heard in my entire fucking life, or that they sound like a mediocre photocopy of Travis (who sound like a mediocre photocopy of Radiohead), or that their greatest fucking artistic achievement is a video where their blandly attractive frontman walks on a beach on a cloudy fucking afternoon. None of that matters. What matters is that Coldplay manufactures fake love as frenetically as the Ford fucking Motor Company manufactures Mustangs, and that\u2019s all this woman heard. \u201cFor you I bleed myself dry,\u201d sang their block-head vocalist, brilliantly informing us that stars in the sky are, in fact, yellow. How am I going to compete with that shit? That sleepy-eyed bozo isn\u2019t even making sense. He\u2019s just pouring fabricated emotions over four gloomy guitar chords, and it ends up sounding like love. And what does that mean? It means she flies to fucking Portland to hear two hours of amateurish U.K. hyper-slop, and I sleep alone in a $270 hotel in Manhattan, and I hope Coldplay gets fucking dropped by fucking EMI and ends up like the Stone fucking Roses, who were actually a better fucking band, all things considered.\n\nNot that I\u2019m bitter about this. Oh, I concede that I may be taking this particular example somewhat personally\u2014but I do think it\u2019s a perfect illustration of why almost everyone I know is either overtly or covertly unhappy. Coldplay songs deliver an amorphous, irrefutable interpretation of how being in love is supposed to feel, and people find themselves wanting that feeling for real. They want men to adore them like Lloyd Dobler would, and they want women to think like Aimee Mann, and they expect all their arguments to sound like Sam Malone and Diane Chambers. They think everything will work out perfectly in the end (just like it did for Helen Fielding\u2019s Bridget Jones and Nick Hornby\u2019s Rob Fleming), and they don\u2019t stop believing, because Journey\u2019s Steve Perry insists we should never do that. In the nineteenth century, teenagers merely aspired to have a marriage that would be better than that of their parents; personally, I would never be satisfied unless my marriage was as good as Cliff and Clair Huxtable\u2019s (or at least as enigmatic as Jack and Meg White\u2019s).\n\nPundits are always blaming TV for making people stupid, movies for desensitizing the world to violence, and rock music for making kids take drugs and kill themselves. These things should be the least of our worries. The main problem with mass media is that it makes it impossible to fall in love with any acumen of normalcy. There is no \u201cnormal,\u201d because everybody is being twisted by the same sources simultaneously. You can\u2019t compare your relationship with the playful couple who lives next door, because they\u2019re probably modeling themselves after Chandler Bing and Monica Geller. Real people are actively trying to live like fake people, so real people are no less fake. Every comparison becomes impractical. This is why the impractical has become totally acceptable; impracticality almost seems cool. The best relationship I ever had was with a journalist who was as crazy as me, and some of our coworkers liked to compare us to Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen. At the time, I used to think, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s completely valid: We fight all the time, our love is self-destructive, and\u2014if she was mysteriously killed\u2014I\u2019m sure I\u2019d be wrongly arrested for second-degree murder before dying from an overdose.\u201d We even watched Sid & Nancy in her parents\u2019 basement and giggled the whole time. \u201cThat\u2019s us,\u201d we said gleefully. And like I said\u2014this was the best relationship I ever had. And I suspect it was the best one she ever had, too.\n\nOf course, this media transference is not all bad. It has certainly worked to my advantage, just as it has for all modern men who look and talk and act like me. We all owe our lives to Woody Allen. If Woody Allen had never been born, I\u2019m sure I would be doomed to a life of celibacy. Remember the aforementioned woman who loved Cusack and Coldplay? There is absolutely no way I could have dated this person if Woody Allen didn\u2019t exist. In tangible terms, she was light-years out of my league, along with most of the other women I\u2019ve slept with. But Woody Allen changed everything. Woody Allen made it acceptable for beautiful women to sleep with nerdy, be spectacled goofballs; all we need to do is fabricate the illusion of intellectual humor, and we somehow have a chance. The irony is that many of the women most susceptible to this scam haven\u2019t even seen any of Woody\u2019s movies, nor would they want to touch the actual Woody Allen if they ever had the chance (especially since he\u2019s proven to be an \u00fcber-pervy clarinet freak). If asked, most of these foxy ladies wouldn\u2019t classify Woody Allen as sexy, or handsome, or even likable. But this is how media devolution works: It creates an archetype that eventually dwarfs its origin. By now, the \u201cWoody Allen Personality Type\u201d has far greater cultural importance than the man himself.\n\nNow, the argument could be made that all this is good for the sexual bloodstream of Americana, and that all these Women Who Want Woody are being unconsciously conditioned to be less shallow than their sociobiology dictates. Self-deprecating cleverness has become a virtue. At least on the surface, movies and television actively promote dating the nonbeautiful: If we have learned anything from the mass media, it\u2019s that the only people who can make us happy are those who don\u2019t strike us as being particularly desirable. Whether it\u2019s Jerry Maguire or Sixteen Candles or Who\u2019s the Boss or Some Kind of Wonderful or Speed Racer, we are constantly reminded that the unattainable icons of perfection we lust after can never fulfill us like the platonic allies who have been there all along.\n\n2 If we all took media messages at their absolute face value, we\u2019d all be sleeping with our best friends. And that does happen, sometimes.\n\n3 But herein lies the trap: We\u2019ve also been trained to think this will always work out over the long term, which dooms us to disappointment. Because when push comes to shove, we really don\u2019t want to have sex with our friends\u2026unless they\u2019re sexy. And sometimes we do want to have sex with our blackhearted, soul-sucking enemies\u2026assuming they\u2019re sexy. Because that\u2019s all it ever comes down to in real life, regardless of what happened to Michael J. Fox in Teen Wolf.\n\nThe mass media causes sexual misdirection: It prompts us to need something deeper than what we want. This is why Woody Allen has made nebbish guys cool; he makes people assume there is something profound about having a relationship based on witty conversation and intellectual discourse. There isn\u2019t. It\u2019s just another gimmick, and it\u2019s no different than wanting to be with someone because they\u2019re thin or rich or the former lead singer of Whiskeytown. And it actually might be worse, because an intellectual relationship isn\u2019t real at all. My witty banter and cerebral discourse is always completely contrived. Right now, I have three and a half dates worth of material, all of which I pretend to deliver spontaneously.\n\n4 This is my strategy: If I can just coerce women into the last half of that fourth date, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s ball game. I\u2019ve beaten the system; I\u2019ve broken the code; I\u2019ve slain the Minotaur. If we part ways on that fourth evening without some kind of conversational disaster, she probably digs me. Or at least she thinks she digs me, because who she digs is not really me. Sadly, our relationship will not last ninety-three minutes (like Annie Hall) or ninety-six minutes (like Manhattan). It will go on for days or weeks or months or years, and I\u2019ve already used everything in my vault. Very soon, I will have nothing more to say, and we will be sitting across from each other at breakfast, completely devoid of banter; she will feel betrayed and foolish, and I will suddenly find myself actively trying to avoid spending time with a woman I didn\u2019t deserve to be with in the first place.\n\nPerhaps this sounds depressing. That is not my intention. This is all normal. There\u2019s not a lot to say during breakfast. I mean, you just woke up, you know? Nothing has happened. If neither person had an especially weird dream and nobody burned the toast, breakfast is just the time for chewing Cocoa Puffs and/or wishing you were still asleep. But we\u2019ve been convinced not to think like that. Silence is only supposed to happen as a manifestation of supreme actualization, where both parties are so at peace with their emotional connection that it cannot be expressed through the rudimentary tools of the lexicon; otherwise, silence is proof that the magic is gone and the relationship is over (hence the phrase \u201cWe just don\u2019t talk anymore\u201d). For those of us who grew up in the media age, the only good silence is the kind described by the hair metal band Extreme. \u201cMore than words is all I ever needed you to show,\u201d explained Gary Cherone on the Pornograffiti album. \u201cThen you wouldn\u2019t have to say that you love me, cause I\u2019d already know.\u201d This is the difference between art and life: In art, not talking is never an extension of having nothing to say; not talking always means something. And now that art and life have become completely interchangeable, we\u2019re forced to live inside the acoustic power chords of Nuno Bettencourt, even if most of us don\u2019t necessarily know who the fuck Nuno Bettencourt is.\n\nWhen Harry Met Sally hit theaters in 1989. I didn\u2019t see it until 1997, but it turns out I could have skipped it entirely. The movie itself isn\u2019t bad (which is pretty amazing, since it stars Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal), and there are funny parts and sweet parts and smart dialogue, and\u2014all things considered\u2014it\u2019s a well-executed example of a certain kind of entertainment.5 Yet watching this film in 1997 was like watching the 1978 one-game playoff between the Yankees and the Red Sox on ESPN Classic: Though I\u2019ve never sat through the pitch sequence that leads to Bucky Dent\u2019s three-run homer, I know exactly what happened. I feel like I remember it, even though I don\u2019t. And\u2014more important\u2014I know what it all means. Knowing about sports means knowing that Bucky Dent is the living, breathing, metaphorical incarnation of the BoSox\u2019s undying futility; I didn\u2019t have to see that game to understand the fabric of its existence. I didn\u2019t need to see When Harry Met Sally, either. Within three years of its initial release, classifying any intense friendship as \u201ctotally a Harry-Met-Sally situation\u201d had a recognizable meaning to everyone, regardless of whether or not they\u2019d actually seen the movie. And that meaning remains clear and remarkably consistent: It implies that two platonic acquaintances are refusing to admit that they\u2019re deeply in love with each other. When Harry Met Sally cemented the plausibility of that notion, and it gave a lot of desperate people hope. It made it realistic to suspect your best friend may be your soul mate, and it made wanting such a scenario comfortably conventional. The problem is that the Harry-Met-Sally situation is almost always tragically unbalanced. Most of the time, the two involved parties are not really \u201cbest friends.\u201d Inevitably, one of the people has been in love with the other from the first day they met, while the other person is either (a) wracked with guilt and pressure, or (b) completely oblivious to the espoused attraction. Every relationship is fundamentally a power struggle, and the individual in power is whoever likes the other person less. But When Harry Met Sally gives the powerless, unrequited lover a reason to live. When this person gets drunk and tells his friends that he\u2019s in love with a woman who only sees him as a buddy, they will say, \u201cYou\u2019re wrong. You\u2019re perfect for each other. This is just like When Harry Met Sally! I\u2019m sure she loves you\u2014she just doesn\u2019t realize it yet.\u201d Nora Ephron accidentally ruined a lot of lives.\n\nI remember taking a course in college called \u201cCommunication and Society,\u201d and my professor was obsessed by the belief that fairy tales like \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d and \u201cLittle Red Riding Hood\u201d were evil. She said they were part of a latent social code that hoped to suppress women and minorities. At the time, I was mildly outraged that my tuition money was supporting this kind of crap; years later, I have come to recall those pseudo-savvy lectures as what I loved about college. But I still think they were probably wasteful, and here\u2019s why: Even if those theories are true, they\u2019re barely significant. \u201cThe Three Little Pigs\u201d is not the story that is fucking people up. Stories like Say Anything are fucking people up. We don\u2019t need to worry about people unconsciously \u201cabsorbing\u201d archaic secret messages when they\u2019re six years old; we need to worry about all the entertaining messages people are consciously accepting when they\u2019re twenty-six. They\u2019re the ones that get us, because they\u2019re the ones we try to turn into life. I mean, Christ: I wish I could believe that bozo in Coldplay when he tells me that stars are yellow. I miss that girl. I wish I was Lloyd Dobler. I don\u2019t want anybody to step on a piece of broken glass. I want fake love. But that\u2019s all I want, and that\u2019s why I can\u2019t have it.\n\n1. Hopefully Charlie Rose, if he\u2019s still alive.\n\n2. The notable exceptions being Vertigo(where the softhearted Barbara Bel Geddes gets jammed by sexpot Kim Novak) and My So-Called Life (where poor Brian Krakow never got any play, even though Jordan Catalano couldn\u2019t fucking read).\n\n3. \u201cSometimes\u201d meaning \u201cduring college.\u201d\n\n4. Here\u2019s one example I tend to deploy on second dates, and it\u2019s rewarded with an endearing guffaw at least 90 percent of the time: I ask the woman what religion she is. Inevitably, she will say something like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sort of Catholic, but I\u2019m pretty lapsed in my participation,\u201d or \u201cOh, I\u2019m kind of Jewish, but I don\u2019t really practice anymore.\u201d Virtually everyone under the age of thirty will answer that question in this manner. I then respond by saying, \u201cYeah, it seems like everybody I meet describes themselves as \u2018sort of Catholic\u2019 or \u2018sort of Jewish\u2019 or \u2018sort of Methodist.\u2019 Do you think all religions have this problem? I mean, do you think there are twenty-five-year-old Amish people who say, \u2018Well, I\u2019m sort of Amish. I currently work as a computer programmer, but I still believe pants with metal zippers are the work of Satan.\u2019\u201d\n\n5. \u201cA certain kind\u201d meaning \u201cbad.\u201dEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1532891", "artist_names": "P.J.

She was manned almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho's story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod's main-mast. Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting record.\n\n*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head, still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.\n\nFor my humor's sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one saint's eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden Inn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.\n\n\"Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket, was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days' sail eastward from the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.\n\"Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.\n\n\"'Lakeman!\u2014Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?' said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\n\n\"On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but\u2014I crave your courtesy\u2014may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now, gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate, those grand fresh-water seas of ours,\u2014Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and Superior, and Michigan,\u2014possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many of the ocean's noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East, dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer, and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives. Yet was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slave's right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt\u2014but, gentlemen, you shall hear.\n\n\"It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho's leak seemed again increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length; that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.\n\n\"Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen\u2014that bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupper-holes.\n\n\"Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ours\u2014watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower, and make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may, gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroy's snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne's father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.\n\n\"Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with his gay banterings.\n\n\"'Aye, aye, my merry lads, it's a lively leak this; hold a cannikin, one of ye, and let's have a taste. By the Lord, it's worth bottling! I tell ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish only began the job; he's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of 'em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him to jump overboard and scatter 'em. They're playing the devil with his estate, I can tell him. But he's a simple old soul,\u2014Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.'\n\n\"'Damn your eyes! what's that pump stopping for?' roared Radney, pretending not to have heard the sailors' talk. 'Thunder away at it!'\n\n\"'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. 'Lively, boys, lively, now!' And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's utmost energies.\n\n\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large.\n\n\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men.\n\n\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being\u2014a repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved\u2014this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\n\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.\n\n\"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do his bidding.\n\n\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\n\n\"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to yourself.' But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions. Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale.\n\n\"Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their mastheads. They were both Canallers.\n\n\"'Canallers!' cried Don Pedro. 'We have seen many whale-ships in our harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are they?'\n\n\"'Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal. You must have heard of it.'\n\n\"'Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.'\n\n\"'Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha's very fine; and ere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such information may throw side-light upon my story.'\n\n\"For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire breadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly corrupt and often lawless life. There's your true Ashantee, gentlemen; there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you; under the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches. For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.\n\n\"'Is that a friar passing?' said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the crowded plazza, with humorous concern.\n\n\"'Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella's Inquisition wanes in Lima,' laughed Don Sebastian. 'Proceed, Senor.'\n\n\"'A moment! Pardon!' cried another of the company. 'In the name of all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast\u2014\"Corrupt as Lima.\" It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than billiard-tables, and for ever open\u2014and \"Corrupt as Lima.\" So, too, Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St. Mark!\u2014St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you pour out again.'\n\"Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is he. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore, all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.\n\n\"'I see! I see!' impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles. 'No need to travel! The world's one Lima. I had thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were cold and holy as the hills.\u2014But the story.'\n\n\"I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm's way, the valiant captain danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade.\n\n\"'Come out of that, ye pirates!' roared the captain, now menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. 'Come out of that, ye cut-throats!'\n\n\"Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt's) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.\n\n\"'Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?' demanded their ringleader.\n\n\"'Turn to! turn to!\u2014I make no promise;\u2014to your duty! Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!' and he once more raised a pistol.\n\n\"'Sink the ship?' cried Steelkilt. 'Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What say ye, men?' turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their response.\n\n\"The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:\u2014'It's not our fault; we didn't want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was boy's business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw; ain't those mincing knives down in the forecastle there, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to yourself; say the word; don't be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we're your men; but we won't be flogged.'\n\n\"'Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!'\n\n\"'Look ye, now,' cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him, 'there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for the cruise, d'ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don't want a row; it's not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we won't be flogged.'\n\n\"'Turn to!' roared the Captain.\n\n\"Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:\u2014'I tell you what it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby rascal, we won't lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don't do a hand's turn.'\n\n\"'Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I'll keep ye there till ye're sick of it. Down ye go.'\n\n\"'Shall we?' cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.\n\n\"As the Lakeman's bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway.\n\n\"Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them\u2014ten in number\u2014leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained neutral.\n\n\"All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after breaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship.\n\n\"At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck, summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it, the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were left.\n\n\"'Better turn to, now?' said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\n\n\"'Shut us up again, will ye!' cried Steelkilt.\n\n\"'Oh certainly,' the Captain, and the key clicked.\n\n\"It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants must come out.\n\n\"Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.\n\n\"Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till morning. 'Damn ye,' cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them, 'the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!'\n\n\"At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all round\u2014thought, upon the whole, he would do so\u2014he ought to\u2014justice demanded it; but for the present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.\n\n\"'But as for you, ye carrion rogues,' turning to the three men in the rigging\u2014'for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;' and, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\n\n\"'My wrist is sprained with ye!' he cried, at last; 'but there is still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn't give up. Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.'\n\n\"For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort of hiss, 'What I say is this\u2014and mind it well\u2014if you flog me, I murder you!'\n\n\"'Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me'\u2014and the Captain drew off with the rope to strike.\n\n\"'Best not,' hissed the Lakeman.\n\n\"'But I must,'\u2014and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.\n\n\"Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope, said, 'I won't do it\u2014let him go\u2014cut him down: d'ye hear?'\n\n\"But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale man, with a bandaged head, arrested them\u2014Radney the chief mate. Ever since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak; but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe.\n\n\"'You are a coward!' hissed the Lakeman.\n\n\"'So I am, but take that.' The mate was in the very act of striking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt's threat, whatever that might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps clanged as before.\n\n\"Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up, besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew. Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own instance they were put down in the ship's run for salvation. Still, no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed, that mainly at Steelkilt's instigation, they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing\u2014namely, not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale.\n\n\"But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief mate's watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.\n\n\"During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship's side. In this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two o'clock, in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below.\n\n\"'What are you making there?' said a shipmate.\n\n\"'What do you think? what does it look like?'\n\n\"'Like a lanyard for your bag; but it's an odd one, seems to me.'\n\n\"'Yes, rather oddish,' said the Lakeman, holding it at arm's length before him; 'but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven't enough twine,\u2014have you any?'\n\n\"But there was none in the forecastle.\n\n\"'Then I must get some from old Rad;' and he rose to go aft.\n\n\"'You don't mean to go a begging to HIM!' said a sailor.\n\n\"'Why not? Do you think he won't do me a turn, when it's to help himself in the end, shipmate?' and going to the mate, he looked at him quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given him\u2014neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the Lakeman's monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent helm\u2014nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seaman's hand\u2014that fatal hour was then to come; and in the fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.\n\n\"But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done.\n\n\"It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, 'There she rolls! there she rolls!' Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.\n\n\"'Moby Dick!' cried Don Sebastian; 'St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?'\n\n\"'A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;\u2014but that would be too long a story.'\n\n\"'How? how?' cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.\n\n\"'Nay, Dons, Dons\u2014nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more into the air, Sirs.'\n\n\"'The chicha! the chicha!' cried Don Pedro; 'our vigorous friend looks faint;\u2014fill up his empty glass!'\n\n\"No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.\u2014Now, gentlemen, so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the ship\u2014forgetful of the compact among the crew\u2014in the excitement of the moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy. 'The White Whale\u2014the White Whale!' was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were lowered, the mate's got the start; and none howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale's topmost back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale's slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.\n\n\"Meantime, at the first tap of the boat's bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose again, with some tatters of Radney's red woollen shirt, caught in the teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\n\n\"In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port\u2014a savage, solitary place\u2014where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.\n\n\"The ship's company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a reinforcement to his crew.\n\n\"On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.\n\n\"'What do you want of me?' cried the captain.\n\n\"'Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?' demanded Steelkilt; 'no lies.'\n\n\"'I am bound to Tahiti for more men.'\n\n\"'Very good. Let me board you a moment\u2014I come in peace.' With that he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale, stood face to face with the captain.\n\n\"'Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightning strike me!'\n\n\"'A pretty scholar,' laughed the Lakeman. 'Adios, Senor!' and leaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.\n\n\"Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.\n\n\"Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived, and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all right there, again resumed his cruisings.\n\n\"Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him.\n\n\"'Are you through?' said Don Sebastian, quietly.\n\n\"'I am, Don.'\n\n\"'Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions, this your story is in substance really true? It is so passing wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me if I seem to press.'\n\n\"'Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don Sebastian's suit,' cried the company, with exceeding interest.\n\n\"'Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn, gentlemen?'\n\n\"'Nay,' said Don Sebastian; 'but I know a worthy priest near by, who will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised? this may grow too serious.'\n\n\"'Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?'\n\n\"'Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the company to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.'\n\n\"'Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists you can.'\n\n\"'This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,' said Don Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.\n\n\"'Let me remove my hat.

During the night the story had come unwound and spun down so that the police understood: Mr. Salmon was crazy with grief and had gone out to the cornfield seeking revenge. It fit what they knew of him, his persistent phone calls, his obsession with the neighbor, and Detective Fenerman having visited that same day to tell my parents that for all intents and purposes my murder investigation had entered a sort of hiatus. No clues were left to pursue. No body had been found.\nThe surgeon had to operate on his knee to replace the cap with a purselike suture that partially disabled the joint. As I watched the operation I thought of how much like sewing it seemed, and I hoped that my father was in more capable hands than if he had been brought to me. In home ec my hands had been clumsy. Zipper foot or baster, I got them all confused.\nBut the surgeon had been patient. A nurse had filled him in on the story as he washed and scrubbed his hands. He remembered reading about what had happened to me in the papers. He was my father\u2019s age and had children of his own. He shivered as he stretched his gloves out over his hands. How alike he and this man were. How very different.\n\nIn the dark hospital room, a fluorescent bar light buzzed just behind my father\u2019s bed. As dawn approached it was the only light in the room until my sister walked in.\n\nMy mother and sister and brother woke to the sounds of the police sirens and came down into the dark kitchen from their bedrooms.\n\u201cGo wake your father,\u201d my mother said to Lindsey. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he slept through this.\u201d\nAnd so my sister had gone up. Everyone now knew where to look for him: in only six months, the green chair had become his true bed.\n\u201cDad\u2019s not here!\u201d my sister yelled as soon as she realized. \u201cDad\u2019s gone. Mom! Mom! Dad\u2019s gone!\u201d For a rare moment Lindsey was a frightened child.\n\u201cDamn!\u201d my mother said.\n\u201cMommy?\u201d Buckley said.\nLindsey rushed into the kitchen. My mother faced the stove. Her back was a riddled mass of nerves as she went about making tea.\n\u201cMom?\u201d Lindsey asked. \u201cWe have to do something.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you see\u2026?\u201d my mother said, stopping for a moment with a box of Earl Grey suspended in the air.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe put the tea down, switched on the burner, and turned around. She saw something herself then: Buckley had gone to cling to my sister as he anxiously sucked his thumb.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone off after that man and gotten himself in trouble.\u201d\n\u201cWe should go out, Mom,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cWe should go help him.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cMom, we have to help Daddy.\u201d\n\u201cBuckley, stop milking your thumb!\u201d\nMy brother burst into hot panicked tears, and my sister reached her arms down to pull him in tighter. She looked at our mother.\n\u201cI\u2019m going out to find him,\u201d Lindsey said.\n\u201cYou are doing no such thing,\u201d my mother said. \u201cHe\u2019ll come home in good time. We\u2019re staying out of this.\u201d\n\u201cMom,\u201d Lindsey said, \u201cwhat if he\u2019s hurt?\u201d\nBuckley stopped crying long enough to look back and forth from my sister to my mother. He knew what hurt meant and who was missing from the house.\nMy mother gave Lindsey a meaningful look. \u201cWe are not discussing this further. You can go up to your room and wait or wait with me. Your choice.\u201d\nLindsey was dumbfounded. She stared at our mother and knew what she wanted most: to flee, to run out into the cornfield where my father was, where I was, where she felt suddenly that the heart of her family had moved. But Buckley stood warm against her.\n\u201cBuckley,\u201d she said, \u201clet\u2019s go back upstairs. You can sleep in my bed.\u201d\nHe was beginning to understand: you were treated special and, later, something horrible would be told to you.\nWhen the call came from the police, my mother went immediately to the front closet. \u201cHe\u2019s been hit with our own baseball bat!\u201d she said, grabbing her coat and keys and lipstick. My sister felt more alone than she had ever been but also more responsible. Buckley couldn\u2019t be left by himself, and Lindsey wasn\u2019t even able to drive. Besides, it made the clearest sense in the world. Didn\u2019t the wife belong most at the husband\u2019s side?\nBut when my sister was able to get Nate\u2019s mother on the line \u2013 after all, the commotion in the cornfield had awakened the whole neighborhood \u2013 she knew what she would do. She called Samuel next. Within an hour, Nate\u2019s mother arrived to take Buckley, and Hal Heckler pulled up to our house on his motorcycle. It should have been exciting \u2013 clutching on to Samuel\u2019s gorgeous older brother, riding on a motorcycle for the first time \u2013 but all she could think of was our father.\nMy mother was not in his hospital room when Lindsey entered; it was just my father and me. She came up and stood on the other side of his bed and started to cry quietly.\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d she said. \u201cAre you okay, Daddy?\u201d\nThe door opened a crack. It was Hal Heckler, a tall handsome slash of a man.\n\u201cLindsey,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you out in the visitors\u2019 area in case you need a ride home.\u201d\nHe saw her tears when she turned around. \u201cThanks, Hal. If you see my mother\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell her you\u2019re in here.\u201d\nLindsey took my father\u2019s hand and watched his face for movement. My sister was growing up before my eyes. I listened as she whispered the words he had sung to the two of us before Buckley was born:\nStones and bones;\nsnow and frost;\nseeds and beans and polliwogs.\nPaths and twigs, assorted kisses,\nWe all know who Daddy misses!\nHis two little frogs of girls, that\u2019s who.\nThey know where they are, do you, do you?\nI wish a smile had come curling up onto my father\u2019s face, but he was deep under, swimming against drug and nightmare and waking dream. For a time leaden weights had been tied by anesthesia to the four corners of his consciousness. Like a firm waxen cover it had locked him away tight into the hard-blessed hours where there was no dead daughter and no gone knee, and where there was also no sweet daughter whispering rhymes.\n\u201cWhen the dead are done with the living,\u201d Franny said to me, \u201cthe living can go on to other things.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the dead?\u201d I asked. \u201cWhere do we go?\u201d\nShe wouldn\u2019t answer me.\n\nLen Fenerman had rushed to the hospital as soon as they put the call through. Abigail Salmon, the dispatcher said, requesting him.\nMy father was in surgery, and my mother was pacing back and forth near the nurses\u2019 station. She had driven to the hospital in her raincoat with only her thin summer nightgown beneath it. She had her beating-around-the-yard ballet flats on her feet. She hadn\u2019t bothered to pull her hair back, and there hadn\u2019t been any hair elastics in her pockets or purse. In the dark foggy parking lot of the hospital she had stopped to check her face and applied her stock red lipstick with a practiced hand.\nWhen she saw Len approaching from the end of the long white corridor, she relaxed.\n\u201cAbigail,\u201d he said when he grew closer.\n\u201cOh, Len,\u201d she said. Her face puzzled up on what she could say next. His name had been the sigh she needed. Everything that came next was not words.\nThe nurses at their station turned their heads away as Len and my mother touched hands. They extended this privacy veil habitually, as a matter of course, but even so they could see this man meant something to this woman.\n\u201cLet\u2019s talk in the visitors\u2019 area,\u201d Len said and led my mother down the corridor.\nAs they walked she told him my father was in surgery. He filled her in on what had happened in the cornfield.\n\u201cApparently he said he thought the girl was George Harvey.\u201d\n\u201cHe thought Clarissa was George Harvey?\u201d My mother stopped, incredulous, just outside the visitors\u2019 area.\n\u201cIt was dark out, Abigail. I think he only saw the girl\u2019s flashlight. My visit today couldn\u2019t have helped much. He\u2019s convinced that Harvey is involved.\u201d\n\u201cIs Clarissa all right?\u201d\n\u201cShe was treated for scratches and released. She was hysterical. Crying and screaming. It was a horrible coincidence, her being Susie\u2019s friend.\u201d\nHal was slumped down in a darkened corner of the visitors\u2019 area with his feet propped up on the helmet he\u2019d brought for Lindsey. When he heard the voices approaching he stirred.\nIt was my mother and a cop. He slumped back down and let his shoulder-length hair obscure his face. He was pretty sure my mother wouldn\u2019t remember him.\nBut she recognized the jacket as Samuel\u2019s and for a moment thought, Samuel\u2019s here, but then thought, His brother.\n\u201cLet\u2019s sit,\u201d Len said, indicating the connected modular chairs on the far side of the room.\n\u201cI\u2019d rather keep walking,\u201d my mother said. \u201cThe doctor said it will be an hour at least before they have anything to tell us.\u201d\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have cigarettes?\u201d\n\u201cYou know I do,\u201d Len said, smiling guiltily. He had to seek out her eyes. They weren\u2019t focusing on him. They seemed to be preoccupied, and he wished he could reach up and grab them and train them on the here and now. On him.\n\u201cLet\u2019s find an exit, then.\u201d\nThey found a door to a small concrete balcony near my father\u2019s room. It was a service balcony for a heating unit, so even though it was cramped and slightly chilly, the noise and the hot exhaust of the humming hydrant beside them shut them into a capsule that felt far away. They smoked cigarettes and looked at each other as if they had suddenly and without preparation moved on to a new page, where the pressing business had already been highlighted for prompt attention.\n\u201cHow did your wife die?\u201d my mother asked.\n\u201cSuicide.\u201d\nHer hair was covering most of her face, and watching her I was reminded of Clarissa at her most self-conscious. The way she behaved around boys when we went to the mall. She would giggle too much and flash her eyes over at them to see where they were looking. But I was also struck by my mother\u2019s red mouth with the cigarette going up and away from it and smoke trailing out. I had seen this mother only once before \u2013 in the photograph. This mother had never had us.\n\u201cWhy did she kill herself?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the question that preoccupies me most when I\u2019m not preoccupied by things like your daughter\u2019s murder.\u201d\nA strange smile came across my mother\u2019s face.\n\u201cSay that again,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Len looked at her smile, wanted to reach out and trace the corners of it with his fingertips.\n\u201cMy daughter\u2019s murder,\u201d my mother said.\n\u201cAbigail, are you okay?\u201d\n\u201cNo one says it. No one in the neighborhood talks about it. People call it the \u2018horrible tragedy\u2019 or some variation on that. I just want it to be spoken out loud by somebody. To have it said aloud. I\u2019m ready \u2013 I wasn\u2019t ready before.\u201d\nMy mother dropped her cigarette onto the concrete and let it burn. She took Len\u2019s face in her hands.\n\u201cSay it,\u201d she said.\n\u201cYour daughter\u2019s murder.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nAnd I watched that flat red mouth move across an invisible line that separated her from the rest of the world. She pulled Len in to her and slowly kissed him on the mouth. He seemed to hesitate at first. His body tensed, telling him NO, but that NO became vague and cloudy, became air sucked into the intake fan of the humming hydrant beside them. She reached up and unbuttoned her raincoat. He placed his hand against the thin gauzy material of her summer gown.\nMy mother was, in her need, irresistible. As a child I had seen her effect on men. When we were in grocery stores, stockers volunteered to find the items on her list and would help us out to the car. Like Ruana Singh, she was known as one of the pretty mothers in the neighborhood; no man who met her could help but smile. When she asked a question, their beating hearts gave in.\nBut still, it had only ever been my father who stretched her laughter out into the rooms of the house and made it okay, somehow, for her to let go.\nBy tacking on extra hours here and there and skipping lunches, my father had managed to come home early from work every Thursday when we were little. But whereas the weekends were family time, they called that day \u201cMommy and Daddy time.\u201d Lindsey and I thought of it as good-girl time. It meant no peeps out of us as we stayed quiet on the other side of the house, while we used my father\u2019s then sparsely filled den as our playroom.\nMy mother would start preparing us around two.\n\u201cBath time,\u201d she sang, as if she were saying we could go out to play. And in the beginning that was how it felt. All three of us would rush up to our rooms and put on bathrobes. We would meet in the hallway \u2013 three girls \u2013 and my mother would take us by the hands and lead us into our pink bathroom.\nBack then she talked to us about mythology, which she had studied in school. She liked to tell us stories about Persephone and Zeus. She bought us illustrated books on the Norse gods, which gave us nightmares. She had gotten her master\u2019s in English \u2013 having fought tooth and nail with Grandma Lynn to go so far in school \u2013 and still held on to vague ideas of teaching when the two of us were old enough to be left on our own.\nThose bath times blur together, as do all the gods and goddesses, but what I remember most is watching things hit my mother while I looked at her, how the life she had wanted and the loss of it reached her in waves. As her firstborn, I thought it was me who took away all those dreams of what she had wanted to be.\nMy mother would lift Lindsey out of the tub first, dry her, and listen to her chatter about ducks and cuts. Then she would get me out of the tub and though I tried to be quiet the warm water made my sister and me drunk, and we talked to my mother about everything that mattered to us. Boys that teased us or how another family down the block had a puppy and why couldn\u2019t we have one too. She would listen seriously as if she were mentally noting the points of our agenda on a steno pad to which she would later refer.\n\u201cWell, first things first,\u201d she summed up. \u201cWhich means a nice nap for the two of you!\u201d\nShe and I would tuck Lindsey in together. I stood by the bed as she kissed my sister on her forehead and brushed back her hair from her face. I think competition started there for me. Who got the better kiss, the longer time after the bath with Mom.\nLuckily, I always won this. When I look back now I see that my mother had become \u2013 and very quickly after they moved into that house \u2013 lonely. Because I was the oldest, I became her closest friend.\nI was too little to know what she was really saying to me, but I loved to be hushed to sleep by the soft lullaby of her words. One of the blessings of my heaven is that I can go back to these moments, live them again, and be with my mother in a way I never could have been. I reach my hand across the Inbetween and take the hand of that young lonely mother in mine.\nWhat she said to a four-year-old about Helen of Troy: \u201cA feisty woman who screwed things up.\u201d About Margaret Sanger: \u201cShe was judged by her looks, Susie. Because she looked like a mouse, no one expected her to last.\u201d Gloria Steinem: \u201cI feel horrible, but I wish she\u2019d trim those nails.\u201d Our neighbors: \u201cAn idiot in tight pants; oppressed by that prig of a husband; typically provincial and judgmental of everyone.\u201d\n\u201cDo you know who Persephone is?\u201d she asked me absently one Thursday. But I didn\u2019t answer. By then I\u2019d learned to hush when she brought me into my room. My sister\u2019s and my time was in the bathroom as we were being toweled off. Lindsey and I could talk about anything then. In my bedroom it was Mommy\u2019s time.\nShe took the towel and draped it over the spindle knob of my four-poster bed. \u201cImagine our neighbor Mrs. Tarking as Persephone,\u201d she said. She opened the drawer of the dresser and handed me my underpants. She always doled out my clothes piecemeal, not wanting to pressure me. She understood my needs early. If I was aware I would have to tie laces I would not have been able to put my feet into socks.\n\u201cShe\u2019s wearing a long white robe, like a sheet draped over her shoulders, but made out of some nice shiny or light fabric, like silk. And she has sandals made of gold and she\u2019s surrounded by torches which are light made out of flames\u2026\u201d\nShe went to the drawer to get my undershirt and absentmindedly put it over my head instead of leaving it to me. Once my mother was launched I could take advantage of it \u2013 be the baby again. I never protested and claimed to be grown up or a big girl. Those afternoons were about listening to my mysterious mother.\nShe pulled back the tough-cord Sears bedspread, and I scooted over to the far side along the wall. She always checked her watch then and afterward she would say, \u201cJust for a little while,\u201d and slide off her shoes and slip in between the sheets with me.\nFor both of us it was about getting lost. She got lost in her story. I got lost in her talk.\nShe would tell me about Persephone\u2019s mother, Demeter, or Cupid and Psyche, and I would listen to her until I fell asleep. Sometimes my parents\u2019 laughter in the room beside me or the sounds of their late-afternoon lovemaking would wake me up. I would lie there in half-sleep, listening. I liked to pretend that I was in the warm hold of a ship from one of the stories my father read to us, and that all of us were on the ocean and the waves were rolling gently up against the sides of the ship. The laughter, the small sounds of muffled moaning, would usher me back under into sleep.\n\nBut then my mother\u2019s escape, her half-measure return to the outside world, had been smashed when I was ten and Lindsey nine. She\u2019d missed her period and had taken the fateful car trip to the doctor. Underneath her smile and exclamations to my sister and me were fissures that led somewhere deep inside her. But because I didn\u2019t want to, because I was a child, I chose not to follow them. I grabbed the smile like a prize and entered the land of wonder of whether I would be the sister to a little boy or to a little girl.\nIf I had paid attention, I would have noticed signs. Now I see the shifting, how the stack of books on my parents\u2019 bedside table changed from catalogs for local colleges, encyclopedias of mythology, novels by James, Eliot, and Dickens, to the works of Dr. Spock. Then came gardening books and cookbooks until for her birthday two months before I died, I thought the perfect gift was Better Homes and Gardens Guide to Entertaining. When she realized she was pregnant the third time, she sealed the more mysterious mother off. Bottled up for years behind that wall, that needy part of her had grown, not shrunk, and in Len, the greed to get out, to smash, destroy, rescind, overtook her. Her body led, and in its wake would be the pieces left to her.\nIt was not easy for me to witness, but I did.\nTheir first embrace was hurried, fumbled, passionate.\n\u201cAbigail,\u201d Len said, his two hands now on either side of her waist underneath the coat, the gauzy gown barely a veil between them. \u201cThink of what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m tired of thinking,\u201d she said. Her hair was floating above her head because of the fan beside them \u2013 in an aureole. Len blinked as he looked at her. Marvelous, dangerous, wild.\n\u201cYour husband,\u201d he said.\n\u201cKiss me,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease.\u201d\nI was watching a beg for leniency on my mother\u2019s part. My mother was moving physically through time to flee from me. I could not hold her back.\nLen kissed her forehead hard and closed his eyes. She took his hand and placed it on her breast. She whispered in his ear. I knew what was happening. Her rage, her loss, her despair. The whole life lost tumbling out in an arc on that roof, clogging up her being. She needed Len to drive the dead daughter out.\nHe pushed her back into the stucco surface of the wall as they kissed, and my mother held on to him as if on the other side of his kiss there could be a new life.\nOn my way home from the junior high, I would sometimes stop at the edge of our property and watch my mother ride the ride-on mower, looping in and out among the pine trees, and I could remember then how she used to whistle in the mornings as she made her tea and how my father, rushing home on Thursdays, would bring her marigolds and her face would light up yellowy in delight. They had been deeply, separately, wholly in love \u2013 apart from her children my mother could reclaim this love, but with them she began to drift. It was my father who grew toward us as the years went by; it was my mother who grew away.\n\nBeside his hospital bed, Lindsey had fallen asleep while holding our father\u2019s hand. My mother, still mussed, passed by Hal Heckler in the visitors\u2019 area, and a moment later so did Len. Hal didn\u2019t need more than this. He grabbed his helmet and went off down the hall.\nAfter a brief visit to the ladies\u2019 room, my mother was heading in the direction of my father\u2019s room when Hal stopped her.\n\u201cYour daughter\u2019s in there,\u201d Hal called out. She turned.\n\u201cHal Heckler,\u201d he said, \u201cSamuel\u2019s brother. I was at the memorial service.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t recognize you.\u201d\n\u201cNot your job,\u201d he said.\nThere was an awkward pause.\n\u201cSo, Lindsey called me and I brought her here an hour ago.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cBuckley\u2019s with a neighbor,\u201d he said.\n\u201cOh.\u201d She was staring at him. In her eyes she was climbing back to the surface. She used his face to climb back to.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a little upset \u2013 that\u2019s understandable, right?\u201d\n\u201cPerfectly,\u201d he said, speaking slowly. \u201cI just wanted to let you know that your daughter is in there with your husband. I\u2019ll be in the visitors\u2019 area if you need me.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. She watched him turn away and paused for a moment to listen to the worn heels of his motorcycle boots reverberate down the linoleum hall.\nShe caught herself then, shook herself back to where she was, never guessing for a second that that had been Hal\u2019s purpose in greeting her.\nInside the room it was dark now, the fluorescent light behind my father flickering so slightly it lit only the most obvious masses in the room. My sister was in a chair pulled up alongside the bed, her head resting on the side of it with her hand extended out to touch my father. My father, deep under, was lying on his back. My mother could not know that I was there with them, that here were the four of us so changed now from the days when she tucked Lindsey and me into bed and went to make love to her husband, our father. Now she saw the pieces. She saw that my sister and father, together, had become a piece. She was glad of it.\nI had played a hide-and-seek game of love with my mother as I grew up, courting her attention and approval in a way that I had never had to with my father.\nI didn\u2019t have to play hide-and-seek anymore. As she stood in the darkened room and watched my sister and father, I knew one of the things that heaven meant. I had a choice, and it was not to divide my family in my heart.\nLate at night the air above hospitals and senior citizen homes was often thick and fast with souls. Holly and I watched sometimes on the nights when sleep was lost to us. We came to realize how these deaths seemed choreographed from somewhere far away. Not our heaven. And so we began to suspect that there was a place more all-encompassing than where we were.\nFranny came to watch with us in the beginning.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of my secret pleasures,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAfter all these years I still love to watch the souls that float and spin in masses, all of them clamoring at once inside the air.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see anything,\u201d I said that first time.\n\u201cWatch closely,\u201d she said, \u201cand hush.\u201d\nBut I felt them before I saw them, small warm sparks along my arms. Then there they were, fireflies lighting up and expanding in howls and swirls as they abandoned human flesh.\n\u201cLike snowflakes,\u201d Franny said, \u201cnone of them the same and yet each one, from where we stand, exactly like the one before.\u201dEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/3291190", "artist_names": "Breez Evahflowin' (Ft.

transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.\n\nTHE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you.\n\n\nTHE ANSWERS Round behind the stable.\n\n(A deaf mute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus' dance. A chain of children's hands imprisons him.)\n\nTHE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute.\nTHE IDIOT (Lifts a palsied left arm and gurgles.) Grhahute!\n\nTHE CHILDREN Where's the great light?\n\nTHE IDIOT (Gobbing.) Ghaghahest.\n\n(They release him. He jerks on. A pygmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbish tip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a papershuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy ups with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrofulous child. Cissy Caffrey's voice, still young, sings shrill from a lane.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY\n\n\n\nI gave it to Molly\nBecause she was jolly,\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton, swaggersticks tight in their oxters, as they march unsteadily rightaboutface and burst together from their mouths a volleyed fart. Laughter of men from the lane. A hoarse virago retorts.)\n\nTHE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet.\n\n(She sings.)\nI gave it to Nelly\nTo stick in her belly\nThe leg of the duck\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Private Cart and Private Compton turn and counterretort, their tunics bloodbright in a lampglow, black sockets of caps on their blond copper polls. Stephen Dedalus and Lynch pass through the crowd close to the redcoats.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Jerks his finger.) Way for the parson.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Turns and calls.) What ho, parson!\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Her voice soaring higher.)\n\nShe has it, she got it,\nWherever she put it\nThe leg of the duck.\n\n\n(Stephen, flourishing the ashplant in his left hand, chants with joy the introit for paschal time. Lynch, his jockey cap low on his brow, attends him, a sneer of discontent wrinkling his face.)\n\nSTEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia.\n\n(The famished snaggletusks of an elderly bawd protrude from a doorway.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her voice whispering huskily.) Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst.\nSTEPHEN (Altius aliqantulum) Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista.\n\nTHE BAWD (Spits in their trail her jet of venom.) Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence.\n\n(Edy Boardman, sniffling, crouched with Bertha Supple, draws her shawl across her nostrils.)\n\nEDY BOARDMAN (Bickering.) And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant.\n\nSTEPHEN (Triumphaliter.) Salvi facti i sunt.\n\n(He flourishes his ashplant shivering the lamp image, shattering light over the world. A liver and white spaniel on the prowl slinks after him, growling. Lynch scar's it with a kick.)\n\nLYNCH So that?\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks behind.) So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm.\n\nLYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street!\n\nSTEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love.\n\nLYNCH Ba!\n\nSTEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick.\n\nLYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going?\n\nSTEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam.\n\n(Stephen thrusts the ashplant on him and slowly holds out his hands, his head going back till both hands are a span from his breast, down turned in planes intersecting, the fingers about to part, the left being higher.)\n\nLYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk.\n\n(They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset.\n\nSnakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy.\n\nAt Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.)\n\nBLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah!\n\n(He disappears into Olhousen's, the pork butcher's, under the downcoming rollshutter. A few moments later he emerges from under the shutter puffing Poldy, blowing Bloohoom. In each hand he holds a parcel, one containing a lukewarm pig's crubeen, the other a cold sheep's trotter sprinkled with wholepepper He gasps, standing upright. Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)\n\nBLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run?\n\n(He takes breath with care and goes forward slowly towards the lampset siding. The glow leaps again.)\n\nBLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight.\n\n(He stands at Cormack's corner watching.)\n\nBLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe. (He hums cheerfully.) London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire! (He catches sight of the navvy lurching through the crowd at the farther side of Talbot street.) I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here.\n\n(He darts to cross the road. Urchins shout.)\n\nTHE URCHINS Mind out, mister! (Two cyclists, with lighted paper lanterns aswing, swim by him, grazing him, their bells rattling.)\n\nTHE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall.\n\nBLOOM (Halts erect stung by a spasm.) Ow.\n\n(He looks round, darts forward suddenly. Through rising fog a dragon sandstrewer, travelling at caution, slews heavily down upon him, its huge red headlight winking, its trolley hissing on the wire. The motorman bangs his footgong.)\n\nTHE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo.\n\n(The brake cracks violently. Bloom, raising a policeman's whitegloved hand, blunders stifflegged, out of the track. The motorman thrown forward, pugnosed, on the guidewheel, yells as he slides past over chains and keys.)\n\nTHE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick?\n\nBLOOM (Bloom trickleaps to the curbstone and halts again. He brushes a mudflake from his cheek with a parcelled hand.) No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential. (He feels his trouser pocket.) Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast. (He closes his eyes an instant.) Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow!\n\n(A sinister figure leans on plaited legs against O'Beirnes wall, a visage unknown, injected with dark mercury. From under a wideleaved sombrero the figure regards him with evil eye.)\n\nBLOOM Buenos noches, se\u00f1orita Blanca, que calle es esta?\n\nTHE FIGURE (Impassive, raises a signal arm.) Password. Sraid Mabbot.\n\nBLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath. (He mutters.) Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater.\n\n(He steps forward. A sackshouldered ragman bars his path. He steps left, ragsackman left.)\n\nBLOOM I beg. (He swerves, sidles, stepsaside, slips past and on.)\n\nBLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon? I who lost my way and contributed to the columns of the Irish Cyclist the letter headed, In darkest Stepaside. Keep, keep, keep to the right. Rags and bones, at midnight. A fence more likely. First place murderer makes for. Wash off his sins of the world.\n\n(Jacky Caffrey, hunted by Tommy Caffrey, runs full tilt against Bloom.)\n\nBLOOM O!\n\n(Shocked, on weak hams, he halts. Tommy and Jacky vanish there, there. Bloom pats with parcelled hands watch, fobpocket, bookpocket, pursepocket, sweets of sin, potato soap.)\n\nBLOOM Beware of pickpockets. Old thieves' dodge. Collide. Then snatch your purse.\n\n(The retriever approaches sniffling, nose to the ground. A sprawled form sneezes. A stooped bearded figure appears garbed in the long caftan of an elder in Zion and a smoking cap with magenta tassels. Horned spectacles hang down at the wings of the nose. Yellow poison streaks are on the drawn face.)\n\nRUDOLPH Second halfcrown waste money today. I told you not go with drunken goy ever. So. You catch no money.\n\nBLOOM (Hides the crubeen and trotter behind his back and, crestfallen, feels warm and cold feetmeat) Ja, ich weiss, papachi.\n\nRUDOLPH What you making down this place? Have you no soul? (With feeble vulture talons he feels the silent face of Bloom) Are you not my son Leopold, the grandson of Leopold? Are you not my dear son Leopold who left the house of his father and left the god of his fathers Abraham and Jacob?\n\nBLOOM (With precaution.) I suppose so, father. Mosenthal. All that's left of him.\n\nRUDOLPH (Severely.) One night they bring you home drunk as dog after spend your good money. What you call them running chaps?\n\nBLOOM (In youth's smart blue Oxford suit with white vestslips, narrowshouldered, in brown Alpine hat, wearing gent's sterling silver waterbury keyless watch and double curb Albert with seal attached, one side of him coated with stiffening mud.) Harriers, father. Only that once.\n\nRUDOLPH Once! Mud head to foot. Cut your hand open. Lockjaw. They make you kaput, Leopoldleben. You watch them chaps.\n\nBLOOM (Weakly.) They challenged me to a sprint. It was muddy. I slipped.\n\nRUDOLPH (With contempt) Ooim nachez. Nice spectacles for your poor mother!\n\nBLOOM Mamma!\n\nELLEN BLOOM (In pantomime dame's stringed mobcap, crinoline and bustle, widow Twankey's blouse with muttonleg sleeves buttoned behind, grey mittens and cameo brooch, her hairplaited in a crisping net, appears over the staircase banisters, a slanted candlestick in her hand and cries out in shrill alarm.) O blessed Redeemer, what have they done to him! My smelling salts! (She hauls up a reef of skirt and ransacks the pouch of her striped blay petticoat. A phial, an Agnus Dei, a shrivelled potato and a celluloid doll fall out.) Sacred Heart of Mary, where were you at all, at all?\n\n(Bloom, mumbling, his eyes downcast, begins to bestow his parcels in his filled pockets but desists, muttering.)\n\nA VOICE (Sharply.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Who? (He ducks and wards off a blow clumsily.) At your service.\n\n(He looks up. Beside her mirage of datepalms a handsome woman in Turkish costume stands before him. Opulent curves fill out her scarlet trousers and jacket slashed with gold. A wide yells cummerbund girdles her. A white yashmak violet in the night, covers her face, leaving free only her lace dark eyes and raven hair.)\n\nBLOOM Molly!\n\nMARION Welly? Mrs Marion from this out, my dear man, when you speak to me. (Satirically.) Has poor little hubby cold feet waiting so long?\n\nBLOOM (Shifts from foot to foot.) No, no. Not the least little bit.\n\n(He breathes in deep agitation, swallowing gulps of air questions, hopes, crubeens for her supper things to tell her excuses, desire, spellbound. A coin gleams on her forehead. On her feet are jewelled toerings. Her ankles are linked by a slender fetterchain. Beside her a camel, hooded with a turreting turban, waits. A silk ladder of innumerable rungs climbs to his bobbing howdah. He ambles near with disgruntled hindquarters. Fiercely she slaps his haunch, her goldcurb wristbangles angriling, scolding him in Moorish.)\n\nMARION Nebrakada! Feminimum.\n\n(The camel, lifting a foreleg, plucks from a tree a lace mango fruit, offers it to his mistress, blinking, in his cloven hoof then droops his head and, grunting, with uplifted neck, fumbles to kneel. Bloom stoops his back for leapfrog.)\n\nBLOOM I can give you... I mean as your business menagerer Mrs Marion... if you...\n\nMARION So you notice some change? (Her hands passing slowly over her trinketed stomacher. A slow friendly mockery in her eyes.) O Poldy, Poldy, you are a poor old stick in the mud! Go and see life. See the wide world.\n\nBLOOM I was just going back for that lotion whitewax, orangeflower water. Shop closes early on Thursday. But the first thing in the morning. (He pats divers pockets.) This moving kidney. Ah!\n\n(He points to the south, then to the east. A cake of new clean lemon soap arises, diffusing light and perfume.)\n\nTHE SOAP\n\nWe're a capital couple are Bloom and I;\nHe brightens the earth, I polish the sky.\n\n\n(The freckled face of Sweny, the druggist, appears in the disc of the soapsun.)\n\nSWENY Three and a penny, please.\n\nBLOOM Yes. For my wife, Mrs Marion. Special recipe.\n\nMARION (Softly.) Poldy!\n\nBLOOM Yes, ma'am?\n\nMARION Ti trema un poco il cuore?\n\n(In disdain she saunters away, plump as a pampered pouter pigeon, humming the duet from Don Giovanni)\n\nBLOOM Are you sure about that Voglio? I mean the pronunciati...\n\n(He follows, followed by the sniffing terrier. The elderly bawd seizes his sleeve, the bristles of her chinmole glittering.)\n\nTHE BAWD Ten shillings a maidenhead. Fresh thing was never touched. Fifteen. There's no-one in it only her old father that's dead drunk.\n\n(She points. In the gap of her dark den furtive, rainbedraggled Bridie Kelly stands.)\n\nBRIDIE Hatch street. Any good in your mind?\n\n(With a squeak she flaps her bat shawl and runs. A burly rough pursues with booted strides. He stumbles on the steps, recovers, plunges into gloom. Weak squeaks of laughter are heard, weaker.)\n\nTHE BAWD (Her wolfeyes shining.) He's getting his pleasure. You won't get a virgin in the flash houses. Ten shillings. Don't be all night before the polis in plain clothes sees us. Sixtyseven is a bitch.\n\n(Leering Gerty MacDowell limps forward. She draws from behind ogling, and shows coyly her bloodied clout.)\n\nGERTY With all my worldly goods I thee and thou. (She murmurs.) You did that. I hate you.\n\nBLOOM I? When? You're dreaming. I never saw you.\n\nTHE BAWD Leave the gentleman alone, you cheat. Writing the gentleman false letters. Streetwalking and soliciting. Better for your mother take the strap to you at the bedpost, hussy like you.\n\nGERTY (To Bloom.) When you saw all the secrets of my bottom drawer. (She paws his sleeve, slobbering.) Dirty married man! I love you for doing that to me.\n\n(She slides away crookedly. Mrs Breen in man's frieze overcoat with loose bellows pockets, stands in the causeway, her roguish eyes wideopen, smiling in all her herbivorous buckteeth.)\n\nMRS BREEN Mr.\n\nBLOOM (Coughs gravely.) Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant .\n\nMRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp!\n\nBLOOM (Hurriedly.) Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary...\n\nMRS BREEN (Holds up a finger.) Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly! (Slily.) Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!\n\nBLOOM (Looks behind.) She often said she'd like to visit. Slumming. The exotic, you see. Negro servants too in livery if she had money. Othello black brute. Eugene Stratton. Even the bones and cornerman at the Livermore christies. Bohee brothers. Sweep for that matter.\n\n(Tom and Sam Bohee, coloured coons in white duck suits, scarlet socks, upstarched Sambo chokers and lace scarlet asters in their buttonholes leap out. Each has his banjo slung. Their paler smaller negroid hands jingle the twingtwang wires. Flashing white Kaffir eyes and tusks they rattle through a breakdown in clumsy clogs, twinging, singing, back to back, toe heel, heel toe, with smackfatclacking nigger lips.)\n\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nThere's someone in the house, I know,\nThere's someone in the house with Dina\nPlaying on the old banjo.\n\n\n(They whisk black masks from raw babby faces: then, chuckling, chortling, trumming, twanging they diddle diddle cakewalk dance away.)\n\nBLOOM (With a sour tenderish smile.) A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second?\n\nMRS BREEN (Screams gaily.) O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself!\n\nBLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you. (Gloomily.) 'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle.\n\nMRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply. (She puts out her hand inquisitively.) What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear.\n\nBLOOM (Seizes her wrist with his free hand.) Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box?\n\nMRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies.\n\nBLOOM (Squire of dames, in dinner jacket, with watered-silk facings, blue masonic badge in his buttonhole, black bow and mother-of-pearl studs, a prismatic champagne glass tilted in his hand.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty.\n\nMRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song.\n\nBLOOM (Meaningfully dropping his voice.) I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present.\n\nMRS BREEN (Gushingly.) Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me. (She rubs sides with him.) After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company.\n\nBLOOM (Wearing a purple Napoleon hat with an amber halfmoon, his fingers and thumbs passing slowly down to her soft moist meaty palm which she surrenders gently.) The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly. (Tenderly, as he slips on her finger a ruby ring.) L\u00e0 ci darem la mano.\n\nMRS BREEN (In a onepiece eveningfrock executed in moonlight blue, a tinsel sylph's diadem on her brow with her dancecard fallen beside her moonblue satin slipper curves her palm softly, breathing quickly.) Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart.\n\nBLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that. (His clenched fist at his brow.) Think what it means. All you meant to me then. (Hoarsely.) Woman, it's breaking me! (Dennis Breen, whitetallhatted, with Wisdom Hely's sandwich board, shuffles past them in cadet slippers, his dull beard thrust out, muttering to right and left. Little Alf Bergan, cloaked in the pall of the ace of spaces, dogs him to left and right, doubled in laughter.)\n\nALF BERGAN (Points jeering at the sandwich boards.) U.p.: Up.\n\nMRS BREEN (To Bloom.) High jinks below stairs. (She gives him the glad eye.) Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to.\n\nBLOOM (Shocked.) Molly's best friend! Could you?\n\nMRS BREEN (Her pulpy tongue between her lips, offers a pigeon kiss.) Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there?\n\nBLOOM (Off handedly.) Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer. Trenchant exponent of Shakespeare. Unfortunately threw away the programme. Rattling good place round there for pig's feet. Feel.\n\n(Richie Goulding, three ladies' hats pinned on his head, appears weighted to one side by the black legal bag of Collis and Ward on which a skull and crossbones are painted in white limewash. He ins it and shows it full of polonies, kippered, herrings, Findon haddies and tightpacked pills.)\n\nRICHIE Best value in Dub.\n\n(Bald Pat, bothered beetle, stands on the curbstone, folding his napkin, waiting to wait.)\n\nPAT (Advances with a tilted dish of spillspilling gravy.) Steak and kidney. Bottle of lager. Hee hee hee. Wait till I wait.\n\nRICHIE Goodgod. Inev erate inall...\n\n(With hanging head he marches doggedly forward. The navvy, lurching by, gores him with his flaming pronghorn.)\n\nRICHIE (With a cry of pain, his hand to his back) Ah! Bright's! Lights!\n\nBLOOM (Points to the navvy.) A spy. Don't attract attention. I hate stupid crowds. I am not on pleasure bent. I am in a grave predicament.\n\nMRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story.\n\nBLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason.\n\nMRS BREEN (All agog.) O, not for worlds.\n\nBLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us?\n\nMRS BREEN Let's.\n\n(The bawd makes an unheeded sign. Bloom walks on with Mrs Breen. The terrier follows, whining piteously, wagging his tail.)\n\nTHE BAWD Jewman's melt!\n\nBLOOM (In an oatmeal sporting suit, a sprig of woodbine in the lapel, tony buff shirt, shepherd's plaid Saint Andrew's cross scarftie, white spats, fawn dustcoat on his arm, tawny red brogues, fieldglasses in bandolier and a grey billycock hat.) Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it?\n\nMRS BREEN (In smart Saxe tailormade, white velours hat and spider veil.) Leopardstown.\n\nBLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose...\n\nMRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser!\n\nBLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop.\n\nMRS BREEN (Squeezes his arm, simpers.) Naughty cruel I was.\n\nBLOOM (Low, secretly, ever more rapidly.) And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was .\n\nMRS BREEN Too.\n\nBLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across .\n\nMRS BREEN (Eagerly.) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(She fades from his side. Followed by the whining dog he walks on towards hellsgates. In an archway a standing woman, bent forward, her feet apart, pisses cowily. Outside a shuttered pub a bunch of loiterers listen to a tale which their broken snouted gaffer rasps out with raucous humour. An armless pair of them flop wrestling, growling, in maimed sodden playfight.)\n\nTHE GAFFER (Crouches, his voice twisted in his snout.) And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers.\n\nTHE LOITERERS (Guffaw with cleft palates.) O jays!\n\n(Their paintspeckled hats wag. Spattered with size and lime of their lodges they frisk limblessly about him.)\n\nBLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman.\n\nTHE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter.\n\n(Bloom passes. Cheap whores, singly, coupled, shawled, dishevelled, call from lanes, doors, corners.)\n\nTHE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you.\n\n(He plodges through their sump towards the lighted street beyond. From a bulge of window curtains a gramophone rears a battered brazen trunk. In the shadow a shebeenkeeper haggles with the navvy and the two redcoats.)\n\nTHE NAVVY (Belching.) Where's the bloody house?\n\nTHE SHEBEENKEEPER Purdon street. Shilling a bottle of stout. Respectable woman.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Gripping the two redcoats, staggers forward with them.) Come on, you British army!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Behind his back.) He aint half balmy.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (LAughs.) What ho!\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To the navvy.) Portobello barracks canteen. You ask for Carr. Just Carr.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nWe are the boys. Of Wexford.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Say! What price the sergeantmajor?\n\nPRIVATE CARR Bennett? He's my pal. I love old Bennett.\n\nTHENAVVY (Shouts.)\n\nThe galling chain.\nAnd free our native land.\n\n\n(He staggers forward, dragging them with him. Bloom stops, at fault. The dog approaches, his tongue outlolling, panting.)\n\nBLOOM Wildgoose chase this. Disorderly houses. Lord knows where they are gone. Drunks cover distance double quick. Nice mixup. Scene at Westland row. Then jump in first class with third ticket. Then too far. Train with engine behind. Might have taken me to Malahide or a siding for the night or collision. Second drink does it. Once is a dose. What am I following him for? Still, he's the best of that lot. If I hadn't heard about Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy I wouldn't have gone and wouldn't have met. Kismet. He'll lose that cash. Relieving office here. Good biz for cheapjacks, organs. What do ye lack? Soon got, soon gone. Might have lost my life too with that mangongwheeltracktrolleyglarejuggernaut only for presence of mind. Can't always save you, though. If I had passed Truelock's window that day two minutes later would have been shot. Absence of body. Still if bullet only went through my coat get damages for shock, five hundred pounds. What was he? Kildare street club toff. God help his gamekeeper.\n\n(He gazes ahead reading on the wall a scrawled chalk legend Wet Dream and a phallic design.)\n\nOdd! Molly drawing on the frosted carriagepane at Kingstown. What's that like? (Gaudy dollwomen loll in the lighted doorways, in window embrasures, smoking birdseye cigarettes. The odour of the sicksweet weed floats towards him in slow round ovalling wreaths.)\n\nTHE WREATHS Sweet are the sweets. Sweets of sin.\n\nBLOOM My spine's a bit limp. Go or turn? And this food? Eat it and get all pigsticky. Absurd I am. Waste of money. One and eightpence too much. (The retriever drives a cold snivelling muzzle against his hand, wagging his tail.) Strange how they take to me. Even that brute today. Better speak to him first. Like women they like rencontres. Stinks like a polecat. Chacun son go\u00fbt. He might be mad. Fido. Uncertain in his movements. Good fellow! Garryowen! (The wolfdog sprawls on his back, wriggling obscenely with begging paws, his long black tongue lolling out.) Influence of his surroundings. Give and have done with it. Provided nobody. (Calling encouraging words he shambles back with a furtive poacher's tread, dogged by the setter into a dark stalestunk corner. He unrolls one parcel and goes to dump the crubeen softly but holds back and feels the trotter.) Sizeable for threepence. But then I have it in my left hand. Calls for more effort. Why? Smaller from want of use. O, let it slide. Two and six.\n\n(With regret he lets unrolled crubeen and trotter slide. The mastiff mauls the bundle clumsily and gluts himself with growling greed, crunching the bones. Two raincaped watch approach, silent, vigilant. They murmur together.)\n\nTHE WATCH Bloom. Of Bloom. For Bloom. Bloom.\n\n(Each lays a hand on Blooms shoulder.)\n\nFIRST WATCH Caught in the act. Commit no nuisance.\n\nBLOOM (Stammers.) I am doing good to others.\n\n(A covey of gulls, storm petrels, rises hungrily from Liffey slime with Banbury cakes in their beaks.)\n\nTHE GULLS Kaw kave kankury kake.\n\nBLOOM The friend of man. Trained by kindness.\n\n(He points. Bob Doran, toppling from a high bars tool, sways over the munching spaniel.)\n\nBOB DORAN Towser. Give us the paw. Give the paw.\n\n(The bulldog growls, his scruff standing, a gobbet of pigs knuckle between his molars through which rabid scrumspittle dribbles. Bob Doran falls silently into an area.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Prevention of cruelty to animals.\n\nBLOOM (Enthusiastically.) A noble work! I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising.\n\n(Signor Maffei, passion pale, in liontamer's costume with diamond studs in his shirtfront, steps forward, holding a circus paper hoop, a curling carriagewhip and a revolver with which he covers the going boarhound.)\n\nSIGNOR MAFFEI (With a sinister smile.) Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena. (He glares.) I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers. (With a bewitching smile.) I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring.\n\nFIRST WATCH Come. Name and address.\n\nBLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes! (He takes off his high grade hat, saluting.) Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin.\n\nFIRST WATCH Proof.\n\n(A card falls from inside the leather headband of Bloom's hat.)\n\nBLOOM (In red fez, cadi's dress coat with broad green sash, wearing a false badge of the Legion of Honour, picks up the card hastily and offers it.) Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton, 27 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Reads.) Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting.\n\nSECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned.\n\nBLOOM (Produces from his heartpocket a crumpled yellow flower.) This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name. (Plausibly.) You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag. (He murmurs privately and confidentially.) We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement. (He shoulders the second watch gently.) Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it. (He turns gravely to the first watch.) Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy. (To the second watch gaily.) I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail.\n\n(A dark mercurialised face appears, leading a veiled figure.)\n\nTHE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him. He was drummed out of the army.\n\nMARTHA (Thickveiled, a crimson halter round her neck, a copy of the Irish Times in her hand, in tone of reproach, pointing.) Henry! Leopold! Leopold! Lionel, thou lost one! Clear my name.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Sternly.) Come to the station.\n\nBLOOM (Scared, hats himself steps back, then, plucking at his heart and lifting his right forearm on the square, he gives the sign and dueguard of fellowcraft.) No, no, worshipful master, light of love. Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned.\n\nMARTHA (Sobbing behind her veil.) Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt.\n\nBLOOM (Behind his hand.) She's drunk. The woman is inebriated. (He murmurs vaguely the past of Ephraim.) Shitbroleeth.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Tears in his eyes, to Bloom.) You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself.\n\nBLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift.\n\nFIRST WATCH Regiment.\n\nBLOOM (Turns to the gallery.) The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign.\n\nA VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain?\n\nBLOOM (His hand on the shoulder of the first watch.) My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could. (With quiet feeling.) Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank.\n\nFIRST WATCH Profession or trade.\n\nBLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up...\n\n(Myles Crawford strides out jerkily, a quill between his teeth. His scarlet beak blazes within the aureole of his straw hat. He dangles a hank of Spanish onions in one hand and holds with the other hand a telephone receiver nozzle to his ear.)\n\nMYLES CRAWFORD (His cock's wattles wagging.) Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom?\n\n(Mr Philip Beaufoy, palefaced, stands in the witnessbox, in accurate morning dress, outbreast pocket with peak of handkerchief showing, creased lavender trousers and patent boots. He cames a lace portfolio labelled Matcham's Masterstrokes.)\n\nBEAUFOY (Drawls.) No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom.\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs with hangdog meekness.) That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ?\n\nBEAUFOY (His lip upcurled, smiles superciliously on the court.) You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university.\n\nBLOOM (Indistinctly.) University of life. Bad art.\n\nBEAUFOY (Shouts.) It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man! (He extends his portfolio.) We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast.\n\nA VOICE FROM THE GALLERY\n\nMoses, Moses, king of the jews,\nWiped his arse in the Daily News.\n\n\nBLOOM (Bravely.) Overdrawn.\n\nBEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter! (To the court.) Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age.\n\nBLOOM (To the court.) And he, a bachelor, how.\n\nFIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll.\n\nTHE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid!\n\n(Mary Driscoll, a slipshod servant girl, approaches. She has a bucket on the crook of her arm and a scouringbrush in her hand.)\n\nSECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Indignantly.) I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.\n\nFIRST WATCH What do you tax him with?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am.\n\nBLOOM (In housejacket of ripplecloth, flannel trousers, heelless slippers, unshaven, his hair rumpled softly.) I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Excitedly.) As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters!\n\nFIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen?\n\nMARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing.\n\nBLOOM She counterassaulted.\n\nMARY DRISCOLL (Scornfully.) I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet!\n\n(General laughter.)\n\nGEORGES FOTTRELL (Clerk of the crown and peace, resonantly.) Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement.\n\n(Bloom, pleading not guilty and holding a fullblown waterlily, begins a long unintelligible speech. They would hear what counsel had to say in his stirring address to the grand-jury. He was down and out but, though branded as a black sheep, if he might say so, he meant to reform, to retrieve the memory of the past in a purely sisterly way and return to nature as a purely domestic animal. A seven months' child, he had been carefully brought up and nurtured by an aged bedridden parent. There might have been lapses of an erring father but he wanted to turn over a new leaf and now, when at long last in sight of the whipping post, to lead a homely life in the evening of his days, permeated by the affectionate surroundings of the heaving bosom of the family. An acclimatised Britisher he had seen that summer eve from the footplate of an engine cab of the Loop line railway company while the rain refrained from falling glimpses, as it were, through the windows of loveful households in Dublin city and urban district of scenes truly rural of happiness of the better land with Dockrell's wallpaper at one and ninepence a dozen, innocent British born bairns lisping prayers to the Sacred Infant, youthful scholars grappling with their pensums, model young ladies playing on the pianoforte or anon all with fervour reciting the family rosary round the crackling Yulelog while in the boreens and green lanes the colleens with their swains strolled what times the strains of the organtoned melodeon Britannia metalbound with four acting stops and twelvefold bellows, a sacrifice, greatest bargain ever... )\n\n(Renewed laughter. He mumbles incoherently. Reporters complain that they cannot hear.)\n\nLONGHAND AND SHORTHAND (Without looking up from their notebooks.) Loosen his boots.\n\nPROFESSOR MACHUGH (From the presstable, coughs and calls.) Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits.\n\n(The crossexamination proceeds re Bloom and the bucket. A lace bucket. Bloom himself Bowel trouble. In Beaver street. Gripe, yes. Quite bad. A plasterers bucket. By walking stifflegged. Suffered untold misery. Deadly agony. About noon. Love or burgundy. Yes, some spinach. Crucial moment. He did not look in the bucket. Nobody. Rather a mess. Not completely. A Titbits back number.)\n\n(Uproar and catcalls. Bloom, in a torn frockcoat stained with whitewash, dinged silk hat sideways on his head, a strip of sticking-plaster across his nose, talks inaudibly.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (In barrister's grey wig and stuffgown, speaking with a voice of pained protest.) This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact.\n\nBLOOM (Barefoot, pigeonbreasted, in lascar's vest and trousers, apologetic toes turned in, opens his tiny mole's eyes and looks about him dazedly, passing a slow hand across his forehead. Then he hitches his belt sailor fashion and with a shrug of oriental obeisance salutes the court, pointing one thumb heavenward.) Him makee velly muchee fine night. (He begins to lilt simply.)\n\nLi li poo lil chile,\nBlingee pigfoot evly night.\nPayee two shilly...\n\n\n(He is howled down.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Hotly to the populace.) This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter. (Bloom takes J. J. O'Molloy's hand and raises it to his lips.) I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown. (To Bloom.) I suggest that you will do the handsome thing.\n\nBLOOM A penny in the pound.\n\n(The mirage of the lake of Kinnereth with blurred cattle cropping in silver haze is projected on the wall. Moses Dlugacz, ferreteyed albino, in blue dungarees, stands up in the gallery, holding in each hand an orange citron and a pork kidney.)\n\nDLUGACZ (Hoarsely.) Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. 13.\n\n(J. J. O'Molloy steps on to a low plinth and holds the lapel of his coat with solemnity. His face lengthens, grows pale and bearded, with sunken eyes, the blotches of phthisis and hectic cheekbones of John F. Taylor. He applies his handkerchief to his mouth and scrutinises the galloping tide of rosepink blood.)\n\nJ. J. O'MOLLOY (Almost voicelessly.) Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words. (He assumes the avine head, foxy moustache and proboscidal eloquence of Seymour Bushe.) When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt. (A paper with something written on it is handed into court.)\n\nBLOOM (In court dress.) Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society. (Carelessly.) I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said...\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (In lowcorsaged opal balldress and elbowlength ivory gloves, wearing a sabletrimmed brick quilted dolman, a comb of brilliants and panache of osprey in her hair.) Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (In cap and seal coneymantle, wrapped up to the nose, steps out of her brougham and scans through tortoiseshell quizzingglasses which she takes from inside her huge opossum muff.) Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him!\n\n(A crowd of sluts and ragamuffins sues forward.)\n\nTHE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS (Screaming.) Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo!\n\nSECOND WATCH (Produces handcuffs.) Here are the darbies.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (In amazon costume, hard hat, jackboots cockspurred, vermilion waistcoat, fawn musketeer gauntlets with bra idea drums, long train held up and hunting crop with which she strikes her welt constantly.) Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely (his wife as he solemnly assured me, taken by him from nature), practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Me too.\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too.\n\n(Several highly respectable Dublin ladies hold up improper letters received from Bloom.)\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Stamps her jingling spurs in a sudden paroxysm of sudden fury.) I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive.\n\nBLOOM (His eyes closing, quails expectantly.) Here? (He squirms.) Again! (He pants cringing.) I love the danger.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it!\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man!\n\nBLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Laughs derisively.) O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury.\n\nMRS BELLINGHAM (Shakes her muff and quizzing-glasses vindictively.) Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him.\n\nBLOOM (Shuddering, shrinking, joins his hands with hangdog mien.) O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once. (He offers the other cheek.)\n\nMRS YELVERTON BARRY (Severely.) Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced!\n\nTHE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS (Unbuttoning her gauntlet violently.) I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold. (She swishes her hunting crop savagely in the air.) Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready?\n\nBLOOM (Trembling, beginning to obey.) The weather has been so warm.\n\n(Davy Stephens, ringleted, passes with a bevy of barefoot newsboys.)\n\nDAVY STEPHENS Messenger of the Sacred Heart and Evening Telegraph with Saint Patrick's Day Supplement. Containing the new addresses of all the cuckolds in Dublin.\n\n(The very reverend Canon O'Hanlon in cloth of gold cope elevates and exposes a marble timepiece. Before him Father Conroy and the reverend John Hughes S.J. bend low.)\n\nTHE TIMEPIECE (Unportalling.)\n\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\nCuckoo\n\n\n(The brass quoits of a bed are heard to jingle.)\n\nTHE QUOITS Jigjag, Jigajiga. Jigjag.\n\n(A panel of fog rolls back rapidly, revealing rapidly in the jurybox the faces of Martin Cunningham, foreman silkhatted, Jack Power Simon Dedalus, Tom Kernan, Ned Lambert, John Henry Menton, Myles Crawford, Lenehan, Paddy Leonard Nosey Flynn, M'Coy and the featureless face of a Nameless One.)\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE Bareback riding. Weight for age. Gob, he organised her.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads turned to his voice.) Really?\n\nTHE NAMELESS ONE (Snarls.) Arse over tip. Hundred shillings to five.\n\nTHE JURORS (All their heads lowered in assent.) Most of us thought as much.\n\nFIRST WATCH He is a marked man. Another girl's plait cut. Wanted: Jack the Ripper. A thousand pounds reward.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Awed, whispers.) And in black. A mormon. Anarchist.\n\nTHE CRIER (Loudly.) Whereas Leopold Bloom of no fixed abode is a well-known dynamitard, forger, bigamist, bawd and cuckold ad a public nuisance to the citizens of Dublin and whereas at this commission of assizes the most honourable.\n\n(His Honour sir Frederick Falkiner recorder of Dublin, in judicial garb of grey stone rises from the bench, stonebearded. He bears in his arms an umbrella sceptre. From his forehead arise starkly the Mosaic ramshorns.)\n\nTHE RECORDER I will put an end to this white slave traffic and rid Dublin of this odious pest. Scandalous! (He dons the black cap.) Let him be taken, Mr Subsheriff, from the dock where he now stands and detained in custody in Mountjoy prison during His Majesty's pleasure and there be hanged by the neck until he is dead and therein fail not at your peril or may the Lord have-mercy on your soul. Remove him. (A black skullcap descends upon his head.)\n\n(The subsheriff long John Fanning appears, smoking a pungent Henry Clay.)\n\nLONG JOHN FANNING (Scowls and calls with rich rolling utterance.) Who'll hang Judas Iscariot?\n\n(H. Rumbold, master barber in a bloodcoloured jerk in and tanner's apron, a rope coiled over his shoulder mounts the block. A life preserver and a nailstudded bludgeon are stuck in his belt. He rubs grimly his grapping hands, knobbed with knuckledusters.)\n\nRUMBOLD (To the recorder with sinister familiarity.) Hanging Harry, your Majesty, the Mersey terror. Five guineas a jugular. Neck or nothing.\n\n(The bells of George's church toll slowly, loud dark iron.)\n\nTHE BELLS Heigho! Heigho!\n\nBLOOM (Desperately.) Wait. Stop. Gulls. Good heart. I saw. Innocence. Girl in the monkeyhouse. Zoo. Lewd chimpanzees. (Breathlessly.) Pelvic basin. Her artless blush unmanned me. (Overcome with emotion.) I left the precincts. (He turns to a figure in the crowd, appealing.) Hynes, may I speak to you? You know me. That three shillings you can keep. If you want a little more .\n\nHYNES (Coldly.) You are a perfect stranger.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Points to the corner.) The bomb is here. FIRST WATCH Infernal machine with a time fuse. BLOOM No, no. Pig's feet. I was at a funeral. FIRST WATCH (Draws his truncheon.) Liar!\n\n(The beagle lifts his snout, showing the grey scorbutic face of Paddy Dignam. He has gnawed all. He exhales a putrid carcasefed breath. He grows to human size and shape. His dachshund coat becomes a brown mortuary habit. His green eyeflashes bloodshot. Half of one ear all the nose and both thumbs are ghouleaten.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (In a hollow voice.) It is true. It was my funeral. Doctor Finucane pronounced life extinct when I succumbed to the disease from natural causes.\n\n(He lifts his mutilated ashen face moonwards and bays lugubriously.)\n\nBLOOM (In triumph.) You hear?\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Bloom, I am Paddy Dignam's spirit. List, list, O list!\n\nBLOOM The voice is the voice of Esau.\n\nSECOND WATCH (Blesses himself.) How is that possible?\n\nFIRST WATCH It is not in the penny catechism.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM By metempsychosis. Spooks.\n\nA VOICE O rocks.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (Earnestly.) Once I was in the employ of Mr J. H. Menton, solicitor, commissioner for oaths and affidavits, of 27 Bachelor's Walk. Now I am defunct, the wall of the heart hypertrophied. Hard lines. The poor wife was awfully cut up. Dow is she bearing it? Keep her off that bottle of sherry. (He looks round him.) A lamp. I must satisfy an animal need. That buttermilk didn't agree with me.\n\n(The portly figure of John O'Connell, caretaker stands forth, holding a bunch of keys tied with crape. Beside him stands Father Coffey, chaplain, toad bellied, wrynecked, in a surplice and bandanna nightcap, holding sleepily a staff of twisted poppies.)\n\nFATHER COFFEY (Yawns, then chants with a hoarse croak.) Namine. Jacobs Vobiscuits. Amen.\n\n(Foghorns stormily through his megaphone.) Dignam, Patrick T., deceased.\n\nPADDY DIGNAM (With pricked up ears, winces.) Overtones.\n\n(He wriggles forward, places an ear to the ground.) My masters' voice!\n\nJOHN O'CONNELL Burial docket letter number U. P. Eightyfive thousand. Field seventeen. House of Keys. Plot, one hundred and one.\n\n(Paddy Dignam listens with visible effort, thinking, his tailstiffpointed, his ears cocked.)\n\nPADDY DIGNAM Pray for the repose of his soul.\n\n(He worms down through a coal hole, his brown habit trailing its tether over rattling pebbles. After him toddles an obese grandfather rat on fungus turtle paws under a grey carapace. Dignam's voice, muffled, is heard baying under ground: Dignam's dead and gone below. Tom Rochford, robinredbreasted, in cap and breeches, jumps from his two-columned machine.)\n\nTOM ROCHFORD (A hand to his breastbone, bows.) Reuben J. A florin I find him. (He fixes the manhole with a resolute stare.) My turn now on. Follow me up to Carlow.\n\n(He executes a daredevil salmon leap in the air and is engulfed in the coalhole. Two discs on the columns wobble eyes of nought. All recedes. Bloom plodges forward again. He stands before a lighted house, listening. The kisses, winging from their bowers, fly about him, twittering, warbling, cooing.)\n\nTHE KISSES (Warbling.) Leo! (Twittering.) Icky licky micky sticky for Leo! (Cooing.) Coo coocoo! Yummyumm Wom worn! (Warbling.) Big comebig! Pirouette! Leopopold! (Twittering.) Leeolee! (Warbling.) O Leo!\n\n(They rustle, flutter upon his garments, alight, bright giddyflecks, silvery sequins.)\n\nBLOOM A man's touch. Sad music. Church music. Perhaps here.\n\n(Zoe Higgins, a young whore in a sapphire slip, closed with three bronze buckles, a slim black velvet fillet round her throat, nods, trips down the steps and accosts him.)\n\nZOE Are you looking for someone? He's inside with his friend.\n\nBLOOM Is this Mrs Mack's?\n\nZOE No, eightyone. Mrs Cohen's. You might go farther and fare worse. Mother Slipperslapper. (Familiarly.) She's on the job herself tonight with the vet, her tipster, that gives her all the winners and pays for her son in Oxford. Working overtime but her luck's turned today. (Suspiciously.) You're not his father, are you?\n\nBLOOM Not I!\n\nZOE You both in black. Has little mousey any tickles tonight?\n\n(His skin, alert, feels her fingertips approach. A hand slides over his left thigh.)\n\nZOE How's the nuts?\n\nBLOOM Off side. Curiously they are on the right. Heavier I suppose. One in a million my tailor, Mesias, says.\n\nZOE (In sudden alarm.) You've a hard chancre.\n\nBLOOM Not likely.\n\nZOE I feel it.\n\n(Her hand slides into his left trouser pocket and brings out a hard black shrivelled potato. She regards it and Bloom with dumb moist lips.)\n\nBLOOM A talisman. Heirloom.\n\nZOE For Zoe? For keeps? For being so nice, eh?\n\n(She puts the potato greedily into a pocket, then links his arm, cuddling him with supple warmth. He smiles uneasily. Slowly, note by note, oriental music is played. He gazes in the tawny crystal of her eyes, ringed with kohol. His smile softens.)\n\nZOE You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Forlornly.) I never loved a dear gazelle but it was sure to.\n\n(Gazelles are leaping, feeding on the mountains. Near are lakes. Round their shores file shadows black of cedargroves. Aroma rises, a strong hairgrowth of resin. It burns, the orient, a sky of sapphire, cleft by the bronze flight of eagles. Under it lies the womancity, nude, white, still, cool, in luxury. A fountain murmurs among damask roses. Mammoth roses murmur of scarlet winegrapes. A wine of shame, lust, blood exudes, strangely murmuring.)\n\nZOE (Murmuring singsong with the music, her odalisk lips lusciously smeared with salve of swinefat and rosewater.) Schorach ani wenowach, benoith Hierushaloim.\n\nBLOOM (Fascinated.) I thought you were of good stock by your accent.\n\nZOE And you know what thought did?\n\n(She bites his ear gently with little goldstopped teeth sending on him a cloying breath of stale garlic. The roses draw apart, disclose a sepulchre of the gold of kings and their mouldering bones.)\n\nBLOOM (Draws back, mechanically caressing her right bub with a flat awkward hand.) Are you a Dublin girl?\n\nZOE (Catches a stray hair deftly and twists it to her coil.) No bloody fear. I'm English. Have you a swaggerroot?\n\nBLOOM (As before.) Rarely smoke, dear. Cigar now and then. Childish device. (Lewdly.) The mouth can be better engaged than with a cylinder of rank weed.\n\nZOE Go on. Make a stump speech out of it.\n\nBLOOM (In workman's corduroy overalls, black gansy with red floating tie and apache cap.) Mankind is incorrigible. Sir Walter Raleigh brought from the new world that potato and that weed, the one a killer of pestilence by absorption, the other a poisoner of the ear, eye, heart, memory, will, understanding, all. That is to say, he brought the poison a hundred years before another person whose name I forget brought the food. Suicide. Lies. All our habits. Why, look at our public life!\n\n(Midnight chimes from distant steeples.)\n\nTHE CHIMES Turn again, Leopold! Lord Mayor of Dublin!\n\nBLOOM (In alderman's gown and chain.) Electors of Arran Quay, Inns Quay, Rotunda, Mountjoy and North Dock, better run a tramline, I say, from the cattlemarket to the river. That's the music of the future. That's my programme. Cui Bono? But our buccaneering Vanderdeckens in their phantom ship of finance...\n\nAN ELECTOR Three times three for our future chief magistrate!\n\n(The aurora borealis of the torchlight procession leaps.)\n\nTHE TORCH BEARERS Hooray!\n\n(Several wellknown burgesses, city magnates and freemen of the city shake hands with Bloom and congratulate him. Timothy Harrington, late thrice Lord Mayor of Dublin, imposing in mayoral scarlet, gold chain and white silk tie, confers with councillor Lorcan Sherlock, locum tenens. They nod vigorously in agreement.)\n\nLATE LORD MAYOR HARRINGTON (In scarlet robe with mace, gold mayoral chain and lace white silk scarf) That alder man sir Leo Bloom's speech be printed at the expense of the ratepayers. That the house in which he was born be ornamented with a commemorative tablet and that the thoroughfare hitherto known as Cow Parlour off Cork street be henceforth designated Boulevard Bloom.\n\nCOUNCILLOR LORCAN SHERLOCK Carried unanimously.\n\nBLOOM (Impassionedly.) These flying Dutchmen or lying Dutchmen as they recline in their upholstered poop, casting dice, what reck they? Machines is their cry, their chimera, their panacea. Laboursaving apparatuses, supplanters, bug-bears, manufactured monsters for mutual murder, hideous hobgoblins produced by a horde of capitalistic lusts upon our prostituted labour. The poor man starves while they are grassing their royal mountain stags or shooting peasants and phartridges in their purblind pomp of pelf and power. But their reign is rover for rever and ever and ev...\n\n(Prolonged applause. Venetian masts, maypoles and festal arches spring up. A streamer bearing the legends Cead Mille Failte and Mah Ttob Melek Israel spans the street. All the windows are thronged with sightseers, chiefly ladies. Along the route the regiments of the royal Dublin Fusiliers, the Kings Own Scottish Boraerers, the Cameron Highlanders and the Welsh Fusiliers, standing to attention, keep back the crowd. Boys from High school are perched on the lampposts, telegraph poles, windowsills, cornices, gutters, chimneypots, railings, rainspouts, whistling and cheering. The pillar of the cloud appears. A fife and drum band is heard in the distance playing the Kol Nidre. The beaters approach with imperial eagles hoisted, trailing banners and waving oriental palms. The chryselephantine papal standard rises high, surrounded by pennons of the civic flag. The van of the procession appears headed by John Howard Parnell, city marshal, in a chessboard tabard, the Athlone Poursuivant and Ulster King of Arms. They are followed by the Right Honourable Joseph Hutchinson, lord mayor of Dublin, the lord mayor of Cork, their worships the mayors of Limerick, Galway, Sligo and Watedord, twentyeight Irish representative peers, sirdars, grandees and maharajahs bearing the cloth of estate, the Dublin Metropolitan Fire Brigade, the chapter of the saints of finance in their plutocratic order of precedence, the bishop of Down and Connor His Eminence Michael cardinal Logue archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, His Grace, the most reverend Dr William Alexander archbishop of Armagh, primate of all Ireland, the chief rabbi, the presbyterian moderator, the heads of the baptist, anabaptist, methodist and Moravian chapels and the honorary secretary of the society of friends. her them march the guilds and trades and trainbands with flying colours: coopen, bird fanciers, millwrights, newspaper canvassers, law scriveners, masseurs, vintners, trussmakers, chimney sweeps, lard refiners, tabinet and poplin weavers, farriers, Italian warehousemen, church decorators, bootjack manufacturers, undertaken, silk mercers, lapidaries, salesmasters, corkcutters, assessors of fire losses, dyers and cleaners, export bottlers, fellmongers, ticketwriters, heraldic seal engravers, horse repository hands, bullion broken, cricket and archery outfitters, riddlemakers, egg and potato factors, hosiers and glovers, plumbing contractors. After them march gentlemen of the bed chamber Black Rod, Deputy Garter Gold Stick, the master of hone, the lord great chamberlain, the earl marshal, the high constable carrying the sword of state, saint Stephen's iron crown, the chalice and bible. Four buglers on foot blow a sennet. Beefeaten reply, winding clarions of welcome. Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crimson velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff the orb and sceptre with the dove, the curtana. He is seated on a milkwhite hone with long flowing crimson tail, richly caparisoned, with golden heads tall. Wild excitement. The ladies from their balconies throw down rosepetals. The air is perfumed with essences. The men cheer. Bloom's boys run amid the bystanders with branches of hawthorn and wrenbushes.)\n\nBLOOM'S BOYS\n\nThe wren, the wren,\nThe king of all birds,\nSaint Stephen's his day,\nWas caught in the furze.\n\n\nA BLACKSMITH (Murmurs.) For the Honour of God! And is that Bloom? He scarcely looks thirtyone.\n\nA PAVIOR AND FLAGGER That's the famous Bloom now, the world's greatest reformer. Hats off!\n\n(All uncover their heads.

He has the forehead of a thinker.\n\n(Bloom's weather. A sunburst appears in the northwest.)\n\nTHE BISHOP OF DOWN AND CONNOR I here present your un doubted emperor president and king chairman, the most serene and potent and very puissant ruler of this realm. God save Leopold the First!\n\nALL God save Leopold the First!\n\nBLOOM (In dalmatic and purple mantle, to the bishop of Down and Connor with dignity.) Thanks, somewhat eminent sir.\n\nWILLIAM, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (In purple stock and shovel hat.) Will you to your power cause law and mercy to be executed in all your judgments in Ireland and territories thereunto belonging?\n\nBLOOM (Placing his right hand on his testicles, swears.) So may the Creator deal with me. All this I promise to do.\n\nMICHAEL, ARCHBISHOP OF ARMAGH (Pours a cruse of hair oil over Bloom's head.) Gaudium magnum annuntio vobis. Habemus carneficem. Leopold, Patrick, Andrew, David, George, be thou anointed!\n\n(Bloom assumes a mantle of cloth of gold and puts on a ruby ring. He ascends and stands on the stone of destiny. The representative peers put on at the same time their twentyeight crowns. Joybells ring in Christ church, Saint Patrick's, George's and gay Malahide. Mirus bazaar fireworks go up from all sides with symbolical phallopyrotechnic designs. The peers do homage, one by one, approaching and genuflecting.)\n\nTHE PEERS I do become your liege man of life and limb to earthly worship.\n\n(Bloom holds up his right hand on which sparkles the Koh-i-Noor diamond. His palfrey neighs. Immediate silence. Wireless intercontinental and interplanetary transmitters are set for reception of message.)\n\nBLOOM My subjects! We hereby nominate our faithful charger Copula Felix hereditary Grand Vizier and announce that we have this day repudiated our former spouse and have bestowed our royal hand upon the princess Selene, the splendour of night.\n\n(The former morganatic spouse of Bloom is hastily removed in the Black Maria. The princess Selene, in moon blue robes, a silver crescent on her head, descends from a Sedan chair borne by two giants. An outburst of cheering.)\n\nJOHN HOWARD PARNELL (Raises the royal standard.) Illustrious Bloom! Successor to my famous brother!\n\nBLOOM (Embraces John Howard Parnell.) We thank you from our heart, John, for this right royal welcome to green Erin, the promised land of our common ancestors.\n\n(The freedom of the city is presented to him embodied in a charter. The keys of Dublin, crossed on a crimson cushion, are given to him. He shows all that he is wearing green socks.)\n\nTOM KERNAN You deserve it, your honour.\n\nBLOOM On this day twenty years ago we overcame the hereditary enemy at Ladysmith. Our howitzers and camel swivel guns played on his lines with telling effect. Half a league onward! They charge! All is lost now! Do we yield? No! We drive them headlong! Lo! We charge! Deploying to the left our light horse swept across the heights of Plevna and, uttering their warcry, Bonafide Sabaoth, sabred the Saracen gunners to a man.\n\nTHE CHAPEL OF FREEMAN TYPESETTERS Hear! Hear!\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN There's the man that got away James Stephens.\n\nA BLUECOAT SCHOOLBOY Bravo!\n\nAN OLD RESIDENT You're a credit to your country, sir, that's what you are.\n\nAN APPLEWOMAN He's a man like Ireland wants.\n\nBLOOM My beloved subjects, a new era is about to dawn. I, Bloom, tell you verily it is even now at hand. Yea, on the word of a Bloom, ye shall ere long enter into the golden city which is to be, the new Bloomusalem in the Nova Hibernia of the future.\n\n(Thirtytwo workmen wearing rosettes, from all the counties of Ireland, under the guidance of Derwan the builder construct the new Bloomusalem. It is a colossal edifice, with crystal roof built in the shape of a huge pork kidney, containing forty thousand rooms. In the course of its extension several buildings and monuments are demolished. Government offices are temporarily transferred to railway sheds. Numerous houses are razed to the ground. The inhabitants are lodged in barrels and boxes, all marked in red with the letters: L. B. Several paupers fall from a ladder. A part of the walls of Dublin, crowded with loyal sightseers, collapses.)\n\nTHE SIGHTSEERS (Dying) Morituri te salutant. (They die.)\n\n(A man in a brown macintosh springs up through a trap-door. He points an elongated finger at Bloom.)\n\nTHE MAN IN THE MACINTOSH Don't you believe a word he Says. That man is Leopold M'Intosh, the notorious fireraiser. His real name is Higgins.\n\nBLOOM Shoot him! Dog of a christian! So much for M'Intosh!\n\n(A cannonshot. The man in the macintosh disappears. Bloom with his sceptre strikes down poppies. The instantaneous deaths of many powerful enemies, graziers, members of parliament, members of standing committees, are reported. Bloom's bodyguard distribute Maundy money, commemoration medals, loaves and fishes, temperance badges, expensive Henry Clay cigars, free cowbones for soup, rubber preservatives, in sealed envelopes tied with gold thread, butter scotch, pineapple rock, billets doux in the form of cocked hats, readymade suits, porringers of toad in the hole, bottles of Jeyes' Fluid, purchase stamps, 40 days' indulgences, spurious coins, dairyfed pork sausages, theatre passes, season tickets available for all tram lines, coupons of the royal and privileged Hungarian lottery, penny dinner counters, cheap reprints of the World's Twelve Worst Books: Froggy and Fritz (politic), Care of the Baby (infantilic), So Meals for 7/6 (culinic), Was Jesus a Sun Myth?

A general rush and scramble. Women press forward to touch the hem of Bloom's robe. The lady Gwendolen Dubedat bursts through the throng, leaps on his horse and kisses him on both cheeks amid great acclamation. A magnesium flashlight photograph is taken. Babes and sucklings are held up.)\n\nTHE WOMEN Little father! Little father!\n\nTHE BABES AND SUCKLINGS\n\nClap clap hands till Poldy comes home,\nCakes in his pocket for Leo alone.\n\n\n(Bloom, bending down, pokes Baby Boardman gently in the stomach.)\n\n\nBABY BOARDMAN (Hiccups, curdled milk flowing from his mouth.) Hajajaja.\n\n\nBLOOM (Shaking hands with a blind stripling.) My more than Brother! (Placing his arms round the shoulders of an old couple.) Dear old friends!

Absence makes the heart grow younger. (He dances the Highland fling with grotesque antics.) Leg it, ye devils! (He kisses the bedsores of a palsied veteran.) Honourable wounds! (He trips up a fat policeman.) U.p.: up. U.p.: up. (He whispers in the ear of a blushing waitress and laughs kindly.) Ah, naughty, naughty! (He eats a raw turnip offered him by Maurice Butterly, farmer.) Fine! Splendid! (He refuses to accept three shillings offered him by Joseph Hynes, journalist.) My dear fellow, not at all! (He gives his coat to a beggar.) Please accept. (He takes part in a stomach race with elderly male and female cripples.) Come on, boys! Wriggle it, girls!\n\n\nTHE CITIZEN (Choked with emotion, brushes aside a tear in his emerald muffler.) May the good God bless him!\n\n\n(The rams' horns sound for silence. The standard of Zion is hoisted.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Uncloaks impressively, revealing obesity, unrolls a paper and reads solemnly.) Aleph Beth Ghimel Daleth Hagadah Tephilim Kosher Yom Kippur Hanukah Ros chaschana Beni Brith Bar Mitzvah Mazzoth Askenazim Meshuggah Talith.\n\n\n(An official translation is read by Jimmy Henry, assistant town clerk.)\n\n\nJIMMY HENRY The Court of Conscience is now open.

Lady Bloom accepts no presents.\n\nCROFTON This is indeed a festivity.\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) You call it a festivity. I call it a sacrament.\n\nALEXANDER KEYES When will we have our own house of keys?\n\nBLOOM I stand for the reform of municipal morals and the plain ten commandments. New worlds for old. Union of all, jew, moslem and gentile. Three acres and a cow for all children of nature. Saloon motor hearses. Compulsory manual labour for all. All parks open to the public day and night. Electric dishscrubbers. Tuberculosis, lunacy, war and mendicancy must now cease. General amnesty, weekly carnival, with masked licence, bonuses for all, esperanto the universal brotherhood.

The keeper of the Kildare Street Museum appears, dragging a lorry on which are the shaking statues of several naked goddesses, Venus Callipyge, Venus Pandemos Venus Metempsychosis, and plaster figures, also naked, representing the new nine muses, Commerce, Operatic Music, Amor Publicity, Manufacture, liberty of Speech, Plural Voting, Gastronomy, Private Hygiene, Seaside Concert Entertainments, Painless Obstetrics and Astronomy for the People.)\n\nFATHER FARLEY He is an episcopalian, an agnostic, an any thingarian seeking to overthrow our holy faith.\n\nMRS RIORDAN (Tears up her will.) I'm disappointed in you! You bad man!\n\nMOTHER GROGAN (Removes her boot to throw it at Bloom.) You beast! You abominable person!\n\nNOSEY FLYNN Give us a tune, Bloom.

Down with Bloom!\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Enthusiastically.) I'm a Bloomite and I glory in it. I believe in him in spite of all. I'd give my life for him, the funniest man on earth.\n\nBLOOM (Winks at the bystanders.) I bet she's a bonny lassie.\n\nTHEODORE PUREFOY (In fishing cap and oilskin jacket.) He employs a mechanical device to frustrate the sacred ends of nature.\n\nTHE VEILED SIBYL (Stabs herself.) My hero god! (She dies.)\n\n(Many most attractive and enthusiastic women also commit suicide by stabbing, drowning, drinking prussic acid, aconite, arsenic, opening their veins, refusing food, casting themselves under steamrollers, from the top of Nelson's Pillar, into the great vat of Guinness's brewery, asphyxiating themselves by placing their heads in gas ovens, hanging themselves in stylish garters, leaping from windows of different storeys.)\n\nALEXANDER J. DOWIE (Violently.) Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban!\n\nTHE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox!\n\n(Mother Grogan throws her boot at Bloom. Several shopkeepers from upper and lower Dorset street throw objects of little or no commercial value, hambones, condensed milk tins, unsaleable cabbage, stale bread, sheeps' tails, odd pieces of fat.)\n\nBLOOM (Excitedly.) This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number 2 Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf.\n\nDR MULLIGAN (In motor jerkin, green motoroggles on his brow.) Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to 5427 anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta.\n\n(Bloom holds his high grade hat over his genital organs.)\n\nDR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum.\n\nDR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent.\n\nDR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible.\n\nDR DIXON (Reads a bill of health.) Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby.\n\n(General commotion and compassion. Women faint. A wealthy American makes a street collection for Bloom. Gold and silver coins, bank cheques, banknotes, jewels, treasury bonds, maturing bills of exchange, I.O.U.s, wedding rings' watch-chains, lockets, necklaces and bracelets are rapidly collected.)\n\nBLOOM O, I so want to be a mother.\n\nMRS THORNTON (In nursetender's gown.) Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear.\n\n(Bloom embraces her tightly and bears eight male yellow and white children. They appear on a redcarpeted staircase adorned with expensive plants. All are handsome, with valuable metallic faces, wellmade, respectably dressed and wellconducted, speaking five modern languages fluently and interested in various arts and sciences. Each has his name printed in legible letters on his shirtfront: Nasodoro, Goldfinger, Chrysostomos, Maindor\u00e9e, Silversmile, Silberselber Vifargent, Panargros. They are immediately appointed to positions of high public trust in several different countries as managing directors of banks, traffic managers of railways, chairmen of limited liability companies, vice chairmen of hotel syndicates.)\n\nA VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David?\n\nBLOOM (Darkly.) You have said it.\n\nBROTHER BUZZ Then perform a miracle.\n\nBANTAM LYONS Prophesy who will win the Saint Leger.\n\n(Bloom walks on a net, covers his left eye with his left ear, passes through several walls, climbs Nelson's Pillar, hangs from the the ledge by his eyelids, eats twelve dozen oysters (shells included), heals several sufferers from kings evil, contracts his face so as to resemble many historical personages, lord Beaconsfield, lord Byron, Wat Tyler, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, Moses Mendelssohn, Henry Irving, Rip van Winkle, Rossuth, Jean Jacques Rousseau, Baron Leopold Rothschild, Robinson Crusoe, Sherlock Holmes, Pasteur, turns each foot simultaneously in different directions, bids the tide turn back, eclipses the sun by extending his little finger.)\n\nBRINI, PAPAL NUNCIO (In papal zouave's uniform, steel cuirasses as breastplate, armplates, thighplates, legplates, large profane moustaches and brown paper mitre.)

And under Ballybough bridge?\n\nA HOLLYBUSH And in the devil's glen?\n\nBLOOM (Blushes furiously all over from front to nates, three tears falling from his left eye.) Spare my past.\n\nTHE IRISH EVICTED TENANTS (In bodycoats, kneebreeches, with Donnybrook fair shillelaghs.) Sjambok him!\n\n(Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. He whistles Don Giovanni, a cenar teco. Artane orphans, joining hands, caper round him. Girls of the Prison Gate Mission, joining hands, caper round in the opposite direction.)\n\nTHE ARTANE ORPHANS\n\nYou big, you bog, you dirty dog!\nYou think the ladies love you!\n\n\nTHE PRISON GATE GIRLS\n\nIf you see kay\nTell him he may\nSee you in tea\nTell him from me.\n\n\nHORNBLOWER (In ephod and huntingcap, announces.) And he shall carry the sins of the people to Azazel, the spirit which is in the wilderness, and to Lilith, the nighthag. And they shall stone him and defile him, yea, all from Agendath Netaim and from Mizraim, the land of Ham.\n\n(All the people cast soft pantomime stones at Bloom. Many bonafide travellers and ownerless dogs come near him and defile him. Mastiansky and Citron approach in gaberdines, wearing long earlocks. They wag their beards at Bloom.)\n\nMASTIANSKY AND CITRON Belial! Laemlein of Istria! the false Messiah! Abulafia!\n\n(George S. Mesias, Bloom's tailor, appears, a tailor's goose under his arm, presenting a bill.)\n\nMESIAS To alteration one pair trousers eleven shillings.\n\nBLOOM (Rubs his hands cheerfully.) Just like old times. Poor Bloom!\n\n(Reuben J. Dodd, black bearded Iscariot, bad shepherd, bearing on his shoulders the drowned corpse of his son, approaches the pillory.)\n\nREUBEN J. (Whispers hoarsely.) The squeak is out. A split is gone for the flatties. Nip the first rattler.\n\nTHE FIRE BRIGADE Pflaap!\n\nBROTHER BUZZ (Invests Bloom in a yellow habit with embroidery of painted flames and high pointed hat. He places a bag of gunpowder round his neck and hands him over to the civil power, saying.) Forgive him his trespasses.\n\n(Lieutenant Myers of the Dublin Fire Brigade by general request sets fire to Bloom. Lamentations.)\n\nTHE CITIZEN Thank heaven!\n\nBLOOM (In a seamless garment marked I. H. S. stands upright amid phoenix flames.) Weep not for me, O daughters of Erin.\n\n(He exhibits to Dublin reporters traces of burning. The daughters of Erin, in black garments with lace prayerbooks and long lighted candles in their hands, kneel down and pray.)\n\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF ERIN Kidney of Bloom, pray for us. Flower of the Bath, pray for us. Mentor of Menton, pray for us. Canvasser for the Freeman, pray for us. Charitable Mason, pray for us. Wandering Soap, pray for us. Sweets of Sin, pray for us.

Potato Preservative against Plague and Pestilence, pray for us.\n\n(A choir of six hundred voices, conducted by Mr Vincent O'Brien, sings the Alleluia chorus, accompanied on the organ by Joseph Glynn. Bloom becomes mute, shrunken, carbonised.)\n\nZOE Talk away till you're black in the face.\n\nBLOOM (In caubeen with clay pipe stuck in the band, dusty brogues, an emigrant's red handkerchief bundle in his hand, leading a black bogoak pig by a sugaun, with a smile in his eye.) Let me be going now, woman of the house, for by all the goats in Connemara I'm after having the father and mother of a bating. (With a tear in his eye.) All insanity. Patriotism, sorrow for the dead, music, future of the race. To be or not to be. Life's dream is o'er. End it peacefully. They can live on. (He gazes far away mournfully.) I am ruined. A few pastilles of aconite. The blinds drawn. A letter. Then lie back to rest. (He breathes softly.) No more. I have lived. Fare. Farewell.\n\nZOE (Stiffly, her finger in her neckfillet.) Honest? Till the next time. (She sneers.) Suppose you got up the wrong side of the bed or came too quick with your best girl. O, I can read your thoughts.\n\nBLOOM (Bitterly.) Man and woman, love, what is it? A cork and bottle.\n\nZOE (In sudden sulks.) I hate a rotter that's insincere. Give a bleeding whore a chance.\n\nBLOOM (Repentantly.) I am very disagreeable. You are a necessary evil. Where are you from? London?\n\nZOE (Glibly.) Hog's Norton where the pigs play the organs. I'm Yorkshire born. (She holds his hand which is feeling for her nipple.) I say, Tommy Tittlemouse. Stop that and begin worse. Have you cash for a short time? Ten shillings?\n\nBLOOM (Smiles, nods slowly.) More, houri, more.\n\nZOE And more's mother? (She pats him offhandedly with velvet paws.) Are you coming into the musicroom to see our new pianola? Come and I'll peel off.\n\nBLOOM (Feeling his occiput dubiously with the unparalleled embarrassment of a harassed pedlar gauging the symmetry of her peeled pears.) Somebody would be dreadfully jealous if she knew. The greeneyed monster. (Earnestly.) You know how difficult it is. I needn't tell you.\n\nZOE (Flattered.) What the eye can't see the heart can't grieve for. (She pats him.) Come.\n\nBLOOM Laughing witch! The hand that rocks the cradle.\n\nZOE Babby!\n\nBLOOM (In babylinen and pelisse, bigheaded, with a caul of dark hair, fixes big eyes on her fluid slip and counts its bronze buckles with a chubby finger, his moist tongue tolling and lisping.) One two tlee: tlee tlwo tlone.\n\nTHE BUCKLES Love me. Love me not. Love me.\n\nZOE Silent means consent. (With little parted talons she captures his hand, her forefinger giving to his palm the pass touch of secret monitor, luring him to doom.) Hot hands cold gizzard.\n\n(He hesitates amid scents, music, temptations. She leads him towards the steps, drawing him by the odour of her armpits, the vice of her painted eyes, the rustle of her slip in whose sinuous folds lurks the lion reek of all the male brutes that have possessed her.)\n\nTHE MALE BRUTES (Exhaling sulphur of rut and dung and ramping in their loosebox, faintly roaring, their drugged heads swaying to and fro.) Good!\n\n(Zoe and Bloom reach the doorway where two sister whores are seated. They examine him curiously from under their pencilled brows and smile to his hasty bow. He trips awkwardly.)\n\nZOE (Her lucky hand instantly saving him.) Hoopsa! Don't fall upstairs.\n\nBLOOM The just man falls seven times. (He stands aside at the threshold.) After you is good manners.\n\nZOE Ladies first, gentlemen after.\n\n(She crosses the threshold. He hesitates. She turns and, holding out her hands, draws him over. He hops. On the an tiered rack of the hall hang a man's hat and waterproof Bloom uncovers himself but, seeing them, frowns, then smiles, preoccupied. A door on the return landing is thrown open. A man in purple shirt and grey trousers, brownsocked, passes with an apes gait, his bald head and goatee beard upheld, hugging a full waterjugjar his twotailed black braces dangling at heels. Averting his face quickly Bloom bends to examine on the halltable the spaniel eyes of a running fox: then, his lifted head sniffing, follows Zoe into the musicroom. A shade of mauve tissuepaper dims the light of the chandelier. Round and round a moth flies, colliding, escaping. The floor is covered with an oilcloth mosaic of jade and azure and cinnabar rhomboids. Footmarks are stamped over it in all senses, heel to heel, heel to hollow, toe to toe, feet locked, a morris of shuffling feet without body phantoms, all in a scrimmage higgledypiggledy. The walls are tapes-tried with a paper of yewfronds and clear glades. In the grate is spread a screen of peacock feathers. Lynch squats crosslegged on the hearth rug of matted hair, his cap back to the front. With a wand he beats time slowly. Kitty Ricketts, a bony pallid whore in navy costume, doeskin gloves rolled back from a coral wristlet, a chain purse in her hand, sits perched on the edge of the table swinging her leg and glancing at herself in the gilt mirror over the mantelpiece. A tag of her corset lace hangs slightly below her jacket. Lynch indicates mockingly the couple at the piano.)\n\nKITTY (Coughs behind her hand.) She's a bit imbecilic. (She signs with a waggling forefinger.) Blemblem. (Lynch lifts up her skirt and white petticoat with the wand. She settles them down quickly.) Respect yourself. (She hiccups, then bends quickly her sailor hat under which her hair glows, red with henna.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE More limelight, Charley. (She goes to the chandelier and turns the gas full cock.)\n\nKITTY (Peers at the gasjet.) What ails it tonight?\n\nLYNCH (Deeply.) Enter a ghost and hobgoblins.\n\nZOE Clap on the back for Zoe.\n\n(The wand in Lynch's hand flashes: a brass poker. Stephen stands at the pianola on which sprawl his hat and ashplant. With two fingers he repeats once more the series of empty fifths. Florry Talbot, a blond feeble goosefat whore in a tatterdemalion gown of mildewed strawberry, lolls spreadeagle in the sofa corner, her limp forearm pendent over the bolster, listening. A heavy stye droops over her sleepy eyelid.)\n\nKITTY (Hiccups again with a kick of her horsed foot.) O, excuse!\n\nZOE (Promptly.) Your boy's thinking of you. Tie a knot on your shift.\n\n(Kitty Ricketts bends her head. Her boa uncoils, slides, glides over her shoulder, back, arm, chair to the ground. Lynch lifts the curled caterpillar on his wand. She snakes her neck, nestling. Stephen glances behind at the squatted figure with its cap back to the front.)\n\nSTEPHEN As a matter of fact it is of no importance whether Benedetto Marcello found it or made it. The rite is the poet's rest. It may be an old hymn to Demeter or also illustrate Coela enarrant gloriam Domini. It is susceptible of nodes or modes as far apart as hyperphrygian and mixolydian and of texts so divergent as priests haihooping round David's that is Circe's or what am I saying Ceres' altar and David's tip from the stable to his chief bassoonist about his almightiness. Mais, nom de nom, that is another pair of trousers. Jetez la gourme. Faut que jeunesse se passe. (He stops, points at Lynch's cap, smiles, laughs.) Which side is your knowledge bump?\n\nTHE CAP (With saturnine spleen.) Bah! It is because it is. Woman's reason. Jewgreek is greekjew. Extremes meet. Death is the highest form of life. Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN You remember fairly accurately all my errors, boasts, mistakes. How long shall I continue to close my eyes to disloyalty? Whetstone!\n\nTHE CAP Bah!\n\nSTEPHEN Here's another for you. (He frowns.) The reason is because the fundamental and the dominant are separated by the greatest possible interval which .\n\nTHE CAP Which? Finish. You can't.\n\nSTEPHEN (With on effort.) Interval which. Is the greatest possible ellipse. Consistent with. The ultimate return. The octave. Which.\n\nTHE CAP Which? (Outside the gramophone begins to blare The Holy City.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Abruptly.) What went forth to the ends of the world to traverse not itself. God, the sun, Shakespeare, a commercial traveller, having itself traversed in reality itself, becomes that self. Wait a moment. Wait a second. Damn that fellow's noise in the street. Self which it itself was ineluctably preconditioned to become. Ecco!\n\nLYNCH (With a mocking whinny of laughter grins at Bloom and Zoe Higgins.) What a learned speech, eh?\n\nZOE (Briskly.) God help your head, he knows more than you have forgotten.\n\n(With obese stupidity Florry Talbot regards Stephen.)\n\nFLORRY They say the last day is coming this summer.\n\nKITTY No!\n\nZOE (Explodes in laughter.) Great unjust God!\n\nFLORRY (Offended.) Well, it was in the papers about Anti christ. O, my foot's tickling.\n\n(Ragged barefoot newsboys, jogging a wagtail kite, patterpast, yelling.)\n\nTHE NEWSBOYS Stop press edition. Result of the rockinghorse races. Sea serpent in the royal canal. Safe arrival of Antichrist.\n\n(Stephen turns and sees Bloom.)\n\nSTEPHEN A time, times and half a time.\n\n(Reuben J. Antichrist, wanderingjew, a clutching hand open on his spine, stumps forward. Across his loins is slung a pilgrims wallet from which protrude promissory notes and dishonoured bills. Aloft over his shoulder he bears a long boatpole from the hook of which the sodden huddled mass of his only son, saved from Liffey waters, hangs from the slack of its breeches. A hobgoblin in the image of Punch Costello, hipshot, crookbacked, hydrocephalic, prognathic with receding forehead and Ally Sloper nose, tumbles in somersaults through the gathering darkness.)\n\nALL What?\n\nTHE HOBGOBLIN (His jaws chattering, capers to and fro, goggling his eyes, squeaking, kangaroohopping, with outstretched clutching arms, then all at once thrusts his lipless face through the fork of his thighs.) Il vient! C'est moi! L'homme qui rit! L'homme primigene! (He whirls round and round with dervish howls.) Sieurs et dames, faites vos jeux! (He crouches juggling. Tiny roulette planets fly from his hands.) Les jeux son! faits! (The planets rush together, uttering crepitant cracks.) Rien n'va plus. (The planets, buoyant balloons, sail swollen up and away. He springs off into vacuum.)\n\nFLORRY (Sinking into torpor, crosses herself secretly.) The end of the world!\n\n(A female tepid effluvium leaks out from her. Nebulous obscurity occupies space. Through the drifting fog without the gramophone blares over coughs and feetshuffling.)\n\nTHE GRAMOPHONE Jerusalem! Open your gates and sing Hosanna...\n\n(A rocket rushes up the sky and bursts. A white star falls from it, proclaiming the consummation of all things and second coming of Elijah. Along an infinite invisible tight-rope taut from zenith to nadir the End of the World, a two headed octopus in gillies kilts, busby and tartan filibegs, whirls through the murk, head over heels, in the fob of the Three Lugs of Man.)\n\nTHE END OF THE WORLD (With a Scotch accent.) Wha'll dance the keel row, the keel row, the keel row?\n\n(Over the passing drift and choking breathcoughs, Elijah's voice, harsh as a corncrakes, jars on high. Perspiring in a loose lawn surplice with funnel sleeves he is seen, vergefaced above a rostrum about which the banner of old glory is draped. He thumps the parapet.)\n\nELIJAH No yapping, if you please, in this booth. Jake Crane, Creole Sue, Dave Campbell, Abe Kirschner, do your coughing with your mouths shut. Say, I am operating all this trunk line. Boys, do it now. God's time is 12.25. Tell mother you'll be there. Rush your order and you play a slick ace. Join on right here! Book through to eternity junction, the nonstop run. Just one word more. Are you a god or a doggone clod? If the second advent came to Coney Island are we ready? Florry Christ, Stephen Christ, Zoe Christ, Bloom Christ, Kitty Christ, Lynch Christ, it's up to you to sense that cosmic force. Have we cold feet about the cosmos? No. Be on the side of the angels. Be a prism. You have that something within, the higher self. You can rub shoulders with a Jesus, a Gautama, an Ingersoll. Are you all in this vibration? I say you are. You once nobble that, congregation, and a buck joyride to heaven becomes a back number. You got me? It's a lifebrightener, sure. The hottest stuff ever was. It's the whole pie with jam in. It's just the cutest snappiest line out. It is immense, supersumptuous. It restores. It vibrates. I know and I am some vibrator. Joking apart and getting down to bedrock, A. J. Christ Dowie and the harmonial philosophy, have you got that? O.K. Seventyseven west sixtyninth street. Got me? That's it. You call me up by sunphone any old time. Bumboosers, save your stamps.

Ahhkkk!\n\nELIJAH (In rolledup shirtsleeves, black in the face, shouts at the top of his voice, his arms uplifted.) Big Brother up there, Mr President, you hear what I done just been saying to you. Certainly, I sort of believe strong in you, Mr President. I certainly am thinking now Miss Higgins and Miss Ricketts got religion way inside them. Certainly seems to me I don't never see no wusser scared female than the way you been, Miss Florry, just now as I done seed you. Mr President, you come long and help me save our sisters dear. (He winks at his audience.) Our Mr President, he twig the whole lot and he ain't saying nothing.\n\nKITTY-KATE I forgot myself. In a weak moment I erred and did what I did on Constitution hill. I was confirmed by the bishop. My mother's sister married a Montmorency. It was a working plumber was my ruination when I was pure.\n\nZOE-FANNY I let him larrup it into me for the fun of it.\n\nFLORRY-TERESA It was in consequence of a portwine beverage on top of Hennessy's three stars I was guilty with Whelan when he slipped into the bed.\n\nSTEPHEN In the beginning was the word, in the end the world without end. Blessed be the eight beatitudes.\n\n(The beatitudes, Dixon, Madden, Crotthers, Costello, Lenehan, Bannon, Mulligan and Lynch in white surgical students' gowns, four abreast, goosestepping, tramp fast past in noisy marching.)\n\nTHE BEATITUDES (Incoherently.) Beer beef battledog buybull businum barnum buggerum bishop.\n\nLYSTER (In quakergrey kneebreeches and broadbrimmed hat, says discreetly.) He is our friend. I need not mention names. Seek thou the light.\n\n(He corantos by. Best enters in hairdresser attire, shinily laundered, his locks in curlpapers. He leads John Eglinton who wears a mandarin's kimono of Nankeen yellow, lizard-lettered, and a high pagoda hat.)\n\nBEST (Smiling, lifts the hat and displays a shaven poll from the crown of which bristles a pigtail toupee tied with an orange topknot.) I was just beautifying him, don't you know. A thing of beauty, don't you know. Yeats says, or I mean, Keats says. (Produces a greencapped dark lantern and flashes it towards a corner; with carping accent.) Esthetics and cosmetics are for the boudoir. I am out for truth. Plain truth for a plain man. Tanderagee wants the facts and means to get them.\n\n(In the cone of the search light behind the coalscuttle, ollave, holyeyed, the bearded figure of Mananaan MacLir broods, chin on knees. He rises slowly. A cold seawind blows from his druid mantle. About his head writhe eels and elvers. He is encrusted with weeds and shells. His right hand holds a bicycle pump. His left hand grasps a huge crayfish by its two talons.)\n\nMANANAAN MACLIR (With a voice of waves.) Aum! Hek! Wal! Ak! Lub! Mor! Ma! White yoghin of the Gods. Occult pimander of Hermes Trismegistos. (With a voice of whistling seawind.) Punarjanam patsypunjaub! I won't have my leg pulled. It has been said by one: beware the left, the cult of Shakti. (With a cry of stormbirds.) Shakti, Shiva! Dark hidden Father! (He smites with his bicycle pump the crayfish in his left hand. On its co-operative dial glow the twelve signs of the zodiac. He wails with the vehemence of the ocean.) Aum! Baum! Pyjaum! I am the light of the homestead, I am the dreamery creamery butter.\n\n(A skeleton judas hand strangles the light. The green light wanes to mauve. The gasjet wails whistling.)\n\nTHE GASJET Pooah! Pfuiiiiii!\n\n(Zoe runs to the chandelier and, crooking her leg, adjusts the mantle.)\n\nZOE Who has a fag as I'm here?\n\nLYNCH (Tossing a cigarette on to the table.) Here.\n\nZOE (Her head perched aside in mock pride.) Is that the way to hand the pot to a lady? (She stretches up to light the cigarette over the flame, twirling it slowly, showing the brown tufts of her armpits. Lynch with his poker lifts boldly a side of her slip. Bare from her garters up her flesh appears under the sapphire a nixie's green. She puffs calmly at her cigarette.) Can you see the beauty spot of my behind?\n\nLYNCH I'm not looking.\n\nZOE (Makes sheep's eyes.) No? You wouldn't do a less thing. Would you suck a lemon?\n\n(Squinting in mock shame she glances with sidelong meaning at Bloom, then twists round towards him, pulling her slip free of the poker. Blue fluid again flows over her flesh. Bloom stands, smiling desirously, twirling his thumbs. Kitty Ricketts licks her middle finger with her spittle and gazing in the mirror, smooths both eyebrows. Lipoti Virag, basilicogrammate, chutes rapidly down through the chimneyflue and struts two steps to the left on gawky pink stilts. He is sausaged into several overcoats and wears a brown macintosh under which he holds a roll of parchment. In his left eye flashes the monocle of Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell. On his head is perched an Egyptian pshent. Two quills project over his ears.)\n\nVIRAG (Heels together bows.) My name is Virag Lipoti, of Szombathely. (He coughs thoughtfully, drily.) Promiscuous nakedness is much in evidence hereabouts, eh? Inadvertently her backview revealed the fact that she is not wearing those rather intimate garments of which you are a particular devotee. The injection mark on the thigh I hope you perceived? Good.\n\nBLOOM Granpapachi. But...\n\nVIRAG Number two on the other hand, she of the cherry rouge and coiffeuse white, whose hair owes not a little to our tribal elixir of gopherwood, is in walking costume and tightly staysed by her sit, I should opine. Backbone in front, so to say. Correct me but I always understood that the act so performed by skittish humans with glimpses of lingerie appealed to you in virtue of its exhibitionististicicity. In a word. Hippogriff. Am I right?\n\nBLOOM She is rather lean.\n\nVIRAG (Not unpleasantly.) Absolutely! Well observed and those pannier pockets of the skirt and slightly pegtop effect are devised to suggest bunchiness of hip. A new purchase at some monster sale for which a gull has been mulcted. Meretricious finery to deceive the eye. Observe the attention to details of dustspecks. Never put on you tomorrow what you can wear today. Parallax! (With a nervous twitch of his head.) Did you hear my brain go snap? Pollysyllabax!\n\nBLOOM (An elbow resting in a hand, a forefinger against his cheek.) She seems sad.\n\nVIRAG (Cynically, his weasel teeth bared yellow, draws down his left eye with a finger and barks hoarsely.) Hoax! Beware of the flapper and bogus mournful. Lily of the alley. All possess bachelor's button discovered by Rualdus Colombus. Tumble her. Columble her. Chameleon. (More genially.) Well then, permit me to draw your attention to item number three. There is plenty of her visible to the naked eye. Observe the mass of oxygenated vegetable matter on her skull. What ho, she bumps! The ugly duckling of the party, longcasted and deep in keel.\n\nBLOOM (Regretfully.) When you come out without your gun.\n\nVIRAG We can do you all brands, mild, medium and strong. Pay your money, take your choice. How happy could you be with either...\n\nBLOOM With?...\n\nVIRAG (His tongue upcurling.) Lyum! Look. Her beam is broad. She is coated with quite a considerable layer of fat. Obviously mammal in weight of bosom you remark that she has in front well to the fore two protuberances of very respectable dimensions, inclined to fall in the noonday soupplate, while on her rere lower down are two additional protuberances, suggestive of potent rectum and tumescent for palpation which leave nothing to be desired save compactness. Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size. Pellets of new bread with fennygreek and gumbenjamin swamped down by potions of green tea endow them during their brief existence with natural pincushions of quite colossal blubber. That suits your book, eh? Fleshhotpots of Egypt to hanker after. Wallow in it. Lycopodium. (His throat twitches.) Slapbang! There he goes again.\n\nBLOOM The stye I dislike.\n\nVIRAG (Arches his eyebrows.) Contact with a goldring, they say. Argumentum ad feminam, as we said in old Rome and ancient Greece in the consulship of Diplodocus and Ichthyo saurus. For the rest Eve's sovereign remedy. Not for sale. Hire only. Huguenot. (He twitches.) It is a funny sound.\n\n(He coughs encouragingly.) But possibly it is only a wart. I presume you shall have remembered what I will have taught you on that head? Wheatenmeal with honey and nutmeg.\n\nBLOOM (Reflecting.) Wheatenmeal with lycopodium and syllabax. This searching ordeal. It has been an unusually fatiguing day, a chapter of accidents. Wait. I mean, wartsblood spreads warts, you said .\n\nVIRAG (Severely, his nose hardhumped, his side eye winking.) Stop twirling your thumbs and have a good old thunk. See, you have forgotten. Exercise your mnemotechnic. La causa \u00e8 santa. Tara. Tara. (Aside.) He will surely remember.\n\nBLOOM Rosemary also did I understand you to say or will power over parasitic tissues. Then nay no I have an inkling. The touch of a deadhand cures. Mnemo?\n\nVIRAG (Excitedly.) I say so. I say so. E'en so. Technic. (He taps his parchmentroll energetically.) This book tells you how to act with all descriptive particulars. Consult index for agitated fear of aconite, melancholy of muriatic, priapic pulsatilla. Virag is going to talk about amputation. Our old friend caustic. They must be starved. Snip off with horsehair under the denned neck. But, to change the venue to the Bulgar and the Basque, have you made up your mind whether you like or dislike women in male habiliments? (With a dry snigger.) You intended to devote an entire year to the study of the religious problem and the summer months of 1882 to square the circle and win that million. Pomegranate! From the sublime to the ridiculous is but a step. Pyjamas, let us say? Or stockingette gusseted knickers, closed? Or, put we the case, those complicated combinations, camiknickers? (He crows derisively.) Keekeereekee!\n\n(Bloom surveys uncertainly the three whores, then gazes at the veiled mauve light, hearing the everflying moth.)\n\nBLOOM I wanted then to have now concluded. Nightdress was never. Hence this. But tomorrow is a new day will be. Past was is today. What now is will then tomorrow as now was be past yester.\n\nVIRAG (Prompts into his ear in a pig's whisper.) Insects of the day spend their brief existence in reiterated coition, lured by the smell of the inferiorly pulchritudinous female possessing extendified pudendal verve in dorsal region. Pretty Poll! (His yellow parrotbeak gabbles nasally.) They had a proverb in the Carpathians in or about the year five thousand five hundred and fifty of our era. One tablespoonful of honey will attract friend Bruin more than half a dozen barrels of first choice malt vinegar. Bear's buzz bothers bees. But of this apart. At another time we may resume. We were very pleased, we others. (He coughs and, bending his brow, rubs his nose thoughtfully with a scooping hand.) You shall find that these night insects follow the light. An illusion for remember their complex unadjustable eye. For all these knotty points see the seventeenth book of my Fundamentals of Sexology or the Love Passion which Doctor L. B. says is the book sensation of the year. Some, to example, there are again whose movements are automatic. Perceive. That is his appropriate sun. Nightbird nightsun nighttown. Chase me, Charley! Buzz!\n\nBLOOM Bee or bluebottle too other day butting shadow on wall dazed self then me wandered dazed down shirt good job I...\n\nVIRAG (His face impassive, laughs in a rich feminine key.) Splendid! Spanish fly in his fly or mustard plaster on his dibble. (He gobbles gluttonously with turkey wattles.) Bubbly jock! Bubbly jock! Where are we? Open Sesame! Cometh forth! (He unrolls his parchment rapidly and reads, his glowworm's nose running backwards over the letters which he claws.) Stay, good friend. I bring thee thy answer Redbank oysters will shortly be upon us. I'm the best o'cook. Those succulent bivalves may help us and the truffles of Perigord, tubers dislodged through mister omnivorous porker, were unsurpassed in cases of nervous debility or viragitis. Though they stink yet they sting. (He wags head with cackling raillery.) Jocular. With my eyeglass in my ocular.\n\nBLOOM (Absently.) Ocularly woman's bivalve case is worse. Always open sesame. The cloven sex. Why they fear vermin, creeping things. Yet Eve and the serpent contradict. Not a historical fact. Obvious analogy to my idea. Serpents too are gluttons for woman's milk. Wind their way through miles of omnivorous forest to sucksucculent her breast dry. Like those bubblyjocular Roman matrons one reads of in Elephantuliasis.\n\nVIRAG (His mouth projected in hard wrinkles, eyes stonily forlornly closed, psalms in outlandish monotone.) That the cows with their those distended udders that they have been the known...\n\nBLOOM I am going to scream. I beg your pardon. Ah? So. (He repeats.) Spontaneously to seek out the saurian's lair in order to entrust their teats to his avid suction. Ant milks aphis. (Profoundly.) Instinct rules the world. In life. In death.\n\nVIRAG (Head askew, arches his back and hunched wing- shoulders, peers at the moth out of blear bulged eyes, points a homing claw and cries.) Who's Ger Ger? Who's dear Gerald? O, I much fear he shall be most badly burned. Will some pleashe pershon not now impediment so catastrophics mit agitation of firstclass tablenumpkin? (He mews.) Luss puss puss puss! (He sighs, draws back and stares sideways down with dropping underjaw.) Well, well. He doth rest anon.\n\nI'm a tiny tiny thing\nEver flying in the spring\nRound and round a ringaring.\nLong ago I was a king,\nNow I do this kind of thing\nOn the wing, on the wing!\nBing!\n\n\n(He rushes against the mauve shade flapping noisily.) Pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty pretty petticoats.\n\n(From left upper entrance with two sliding steps Henry Flower comes forward to left front centre. He wears a dark mantle and drooping plumed sombrero. He carries a silverstringed inlaid dulcimer and a longstemmed bamboo Jacobs pipe, its clay bowl fashioned as a female head. He wears dark velvet hose and silverbuckled pumps. He has the romantic Saviour's face with flowing locks, thin beard and moustache. His spindlelegs and sparrow feet are those of the tenor Mario, prince of Candia. He settles down his goffered ruffs and moistens his lips with a passage of his amorous tongue.)\n\nHENRY (In a low dulcet voice, touching the strings of his guitar.) There is a flower that bloometh.\n\n(Virag truculent, his jowl set, stares at the lamp. Grave Bloom regards Zoe's neck. Henry gallant turns with pendent dewlap to the piano.)\n\nSTEPHEN (To himself.) Play with your eyes shut. Imitate pa. Filling my belly with husks of swine. Too much of this. I will arise and go to my. Expect this is the. Steve, thou art in a parlous way. Must visit old Deasy or telegraph. Our interview of this morning has left on me a deep impression. Though our ages. Will write fully tomorrow. I'm partially drunk, by the way.

Lei rovina tutto.\n\nFLORRY Sing us something. Love's old sweet song.\n\nSTEPHEN No voice. I am a most finished artist. Lynch, did I show you the letter about the lute?\n\nFLORRY (Smirking.) The bird that can sing and won't sing.\n\n(The Siamese twins, Philip Drunk and Philip Sober two Oxford dons with lawnmowers, appear in the window embrasure. Both are masked with Matthew Arnold's face.)\n\nPHILIP SOBER Take a fool's advice. All is not well. Work it out with the buttend of a pencil, like a good young idiot. Three pounds twelve you got, two notes, one sovereign, two crowns, if youth but knew. Mooney's en ville, Mooney's sur mer, the Moira, Larchet's, Holles street hospital, Burke's. Eh? I am watching you.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Impatiently.) Ah, bosh, man. Go to hell! I paid my way. If I could only find out about octaves. Reduplication of personality. Who was it told me his name?\n\n(His lawnmower begins to purr.) Aha, yes. Zoe mou sas agapo. Have a notion I was here before. When was it not Atkinson his card I have somewhere? Mac somebody. Unmack I have it. He told me about, hold on, Swinburne, was it, no?\n\nFLORRY And the song?\n\nSTEPHEN Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.\n\nFLORRY Are you out of Maynooth? You're like someone I knew once.\n\nSTEPHEN Out of it now. (To himself.) Clever.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK AND PHILIP SOBER (Their lawnmowers purring with a rigadoon of grasshalms.) Clever ever. Out of it. Out of it. By the by have you the book, the thing, the ashplant? Yes, there it, yes. Cleverever outofitnow. Keep in condition. Do like us.\n\nZOE There was a priest down here two nights ago to do his bit of business with his coat buttoned up. You needn't try to hide, I says to him. I know you've a Roman collar.\n\nVIRAG Perfectly logical from his standpoint. Fall of man. (Harshly, his pupils waxing.) To hell with the pope! Nothing new under the sun. I am the Virag who disclosed the sex secrets of monks and maidens. Why I left the Church of Rome. Read the Priest, the Woman and the Confessional. Penrose. Flipperty Jippert. (He wriggles.) Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one. (He cries.) Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist. Woman squeals, bites, spucks. Man, now fierce angry, strikes woman's fat yadgana. (He chases his tail.) Piffpaff! Popo! (He stops, sneezes.) Pchp! (He worries his butt.) Prrrrrht!\n\nLYNCH I hope you gave the good father a penance. Nine glorias for shooting a bishop.\n\nZOE (Spouts walrus smoke through her nostrils.) He couldn't get a connection. Only, you know, sensation. A dry rush.\n\nBLOOM Poor man!\n\nZOE (Lightly.) Only for what happened him.\n\nBLOOM How?\n\nVIRAG (A diabolic rictus of black luminosity contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. He lifts a mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchias, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world.) A son of a whore. Apocalypse.\n\nKITTY And Mary Shortall that was in the lock with the pox she got from Jimmy Pidgeon in the blue caps had a child off him that couldn't swallow and was smothered with the convulsions in the mattress and we all subscribed for the funeral.\n\nPHILIP DRUNK (Gravely.)

And a prettier, a daintier head of winsome curls was never seen on a whores shoulders. Lynch puts on her hat. She whips it off.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughs.) And to such delights has Metchnikoff inoculated anthropoid apes.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Locomotor ataxy.\n\nZOE (Gaily.) O, my dictionary.\n\nLYNCH Three wise virgins.\n\nVIRAG (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming over his bony epileptic lips.) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orange flower. Panther, the Roman centurion, polluted her with his genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, his hand on his fork.) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries he jerks his hips in the cynical spasm.) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk!\n\n(Ben Jumbo Dollard, rubicund, musclebound, hairynostrilled, hugebearded, cabbageeared, shaggychested, shockmaned, fatpapped, stands forth, his loins and genitals tightened into a pair of black bathing bagslops.)\n\nBEN POLLARD (Nakkering castanet bones in his huge padded paws, yodels jovially in base barreltone.) When love absorbs my ardent soul.\n\n(The virgins, Nurse Callan and Nurse Quigley, burst through the ringkeepers and the ropes and mob him with open arms.)\n\nTHE VIRGINS (Gushingly.) Big Ben! Ben MacChree!\n\nA VOICE Hold that fellow with the bad breeches.\n\nBEN DOLLARD (Smites his thigh in abundant laughter.) Hold him now.\n\nHENRY (Caressing on his breast a severed female head, murmurs.) Thine heart, mine love. (He plucks his lutestrings.) When first I saw.\n\nVIRAG (Sloughing his skins, his multitudinous plumage moulting.) Rats! (He yawns; showing a coalblack throat and closes his jaws by an upward push of his parchment roll.) After having said which I took my departure. Farewell. Fare thee well. Dreck!\n\n(Henry Flower combs his moustache and beard rapidly with a pocketcomb and gives a cows lick to his hair. Steered by his rapier, he glides to the door his wild had slung behind him. Virag reaches the door in two ungainly stilthops, his tail cocked, and deftly claps sideways on the wall a pusyellow flybill, butting it with his head.)\n\nTHE FLYBILL K. 11. post no bills.

You would have preferred the fighting parson who founded the protestant error. But beware Antisthenes, the dog sage, and the last end of Anus Heresiarchus. The agony in the closet.\n\nLYNCH All one and the same God to her.\n\nSTEPHEN (Devoutly.) And Sovereign Lord of all things.\n\nFLORRY (To Stephen.) I'm sure you are a spoiled priest. Or a monk.\n\nLYNCH He is. A Cardinal's son.\n\nSTEPHEN Cardinal sin. Monks of the screw.\n\n(His Eminence, Simon Stephen Cardinal Dedalus, Primate of all Ireland, appears in the doorway, dressed in red soutane, sandals and socks. Seven dwarf simian acolytes, also in red, cardinal sins, uphold his train, peeping under it. He wears a battered silk hat sideways on his head. His thumbs are stuck in his armpits and his palms outspread. Round his neck hangs a rosary of corks ending on his breast in a corkscrew cross. Releasing his thumbs, he invokes grace from on high with lace wave gestures and proclaims with bloated pomp.)\n\nTHE CARDINAL\n\nConservio lies captured.\nHe lies in the lowest dungeon\nWith manacles and chains around his limbs\nWeighing upwards of three tons.\n\n\n(He looks at all for a moment, his right eye closed tight, his left cheek puffed out. Then, unable to repress his merriment, he rocks to and fro, ads akimbo, and sings with broad rollicking humour.) O, the poor little fellow Hi-hi-hi-hi-his legs they were yellow He was plump, fat and heavy and brisk as a snake But some bloody savage To graize his white cabbage He murdered Nell Flaherty's duckloving drake.\n\n(A multitude of midges swarms over his robe. He scratches himself with crossed arms at his ribs, grimacing, and exclaims.) I'm suffering the agony of the damned. By the hoky fiddle, thanks be to Jesus those funny little chaps are not unanimous. If they were they'd walk me off the face of the bloody globe.\n\n(His head aslant, he blesses curtly with fore and middle fingers, imparts the Easter kiss and doubleshuffles off comically, swaying his hat from side to side, shrinking quickly to the size of his train bearers. The dwarf acolytes, giggling, peeping, nudging, ogling, Easterkissing, zigzag behind him. His voice is heard mellow from afar, merciful, male, melodious.) Shall carry my heart to thee, Shall carry my heart to thee, And the breath of the balmy night Shall carry my heart to thee.\n\n(The trick doorhandle turns.)\n\nTHE DOORHANDLE Theeee.\n\nZOE The devil is in that door.\n\n(A male form passes down the creaking staircase and is heard taking the waterproof and hat from the rack. Bloom starts forward involuntarily and, half closing the door as he passes, takes the chocolate from his pocket and offers it nervously to Zoe.)\n\nZOE (Sniffs his hair briskly.) Hum. Thank your mother for the rabbits. I'm very fond of what I like.\n\nBLOOM (Hearing a male voice in talk with the whores on the doorstep, pricks his ears.) If it were he? After? Or because not? Or the double event?\n\nZOE (Tears open the silverfoil.) Fingers was made before forks. (She breaks off and nibbles a piece, gives a piece to Kitty Ricketts and then turns kittenishly to Lynch.) No objection to French lozenges? (He nods. She taunts him.) Have it now or wait till you get it? (He opens his mouth, his head cocked. She whirls the prize in left circle. His head follows. She whirls it back in right circle. He eyes her.) Catch.\n\n(She tosses a piece. With an adroit snap he catches it and bites it through with a crack.)\n\nKITTY (Chewing.) The engineer I was with at the bazaar does have lovely ones. Full of the best liqueurs. And the viceroy was there with his lady. The gas we had on the Toft's hobbyhorses. I'm giddy still.\n\nBLOOM (In Svengali's fur overcoat, with folded arms and Napoleonic forelock, frowns in ventriloquial exorcism with piercing eagle glance towards the door. Then, rigid, with left foot advanced, he makes a swift pass with impelling fingers and gives the sign of past master, drawing his right arm downwards from his left shoulder.) Go, go, go, I conjure you, whoever you are.\n\n(A male cough and tread are heard passing through the mist outside. Blooms features relax. He places a hand in his waistcoat, posing calmly. Zoe offers him chocolate.)\n\nBLOOM (Solemnly.) Thanks.\n\nZOE Do as you're bid. Here.\n\n(A firm heelclacking is heard on the stairs.)\n\nBLOOM (Takes the chocolate.) Aphrodisiac? But I thought it. Vanilla calms or? Mnemo. Confused light confuses memory. Red influences lupus. Colours affect women's characters, any they have. This black makes me sad. Eat and be merry for tomorrow. (He eats.) Influence taste too, mauve. But it is so long since I. Seems new. Aphro. That priest. Must come. Better late than never. Try truffles at Andrews.\n\n(The door opens. Bella Cohen, a massive whoremistress enters. She is dressed in a threequarter ivory gown, fringed round the hem with tasselled selvedge, and cools herself flirting a black horn fan like Minnie Hauck in Carmen. On her left hand are wedding and keeper rings. Her eyes are deeply carboned. She has a sprouting moustache. Her olive face is heavy, slightly sweated and fullnosed, with orangetainted nostrils. She has lace pendant beryl eardrops.)\n\nBELLA My word! I'm all of a mucksweat.\n\n(She glances around her at the couples. Then her eyes rest on Bloom with hard insistence. Her lace fan winnows wind towards her heated face, neck and embonpoint. Her falcon eyes glitter.)\n\nTHE FAN (Flirting quickly, then slowly.) Married, I see.\n\nBLOOM Yes... Partly, I have mislaid .\n\nTHE FAN (Half opening, then closing.) And the missus is master. Petticoat government.\n\nBLOOM (Looks down with a sheepish grin.) That is so.\n\nTHE FAN (Folding together, rests against her eardrop.) Have you forgotten me?\n\nBLOOM Yes. No.\n\nTHE FAN (Folded akimbo against her waist.) Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we? (Bella approaches, gently tapping with the fan.)\n\nBLOOM (Wincing.) Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) We have met. You are mine. It is fate.\n\nBLOOM (Cowed.) Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably... (He winces.) Ah!\n\nRICHIE GOULDING (Bagweighted, passes the door.) Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney.\n\nTHE FAN (Tapping.) All things end. Be mine. Now.\n\nBLOOM (Undecided.) All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards slowly.) You may.\n\nBLOOM (Looks downwards and perceives her unfastened bootlace. ) We are observed.\n\nTHE FAN (Points downwards quickly.) You must.\n\nBLOOM (With desire, with reluctance.) I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah!\n\n(Bella raises her gown slightly and, steadying her pose, lifts to the edge of a chair a plump buskined hoof and a full pastern, silksocked. Bloom, stifflegged ageing, bends over her hoof and with gentle fingers draws out and in her laces.)\n\nBLOOM (Murmurs lovingly.) To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris.\n\nTHE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight.\n\nBLOOM (Crosslacing.) Too tight?\n\nTHE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you.\n\nBLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now!\n\n(He knots the lace. Bella places her foot on the floor. Bloom raises his head. Her heavy face, her eyes strike him in mid-brow. His eyes grow dull, darker and pouched, his nose thickens.)\n\nBLOOM (Mumbles.) Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen.\n\nBELLO (With a hard basilisk stare, in a baritone voice.) Hound of dishonour!\n\nBLOOM (Infatuated.) Empress!\n\nBELLO (His heavy cheekchops sagging.) Adorer of the adulterous rump!\n\nBLOOM (Plaintively.) Hugeness!\n\nBELLO Dungdevourer!\n\nBLOOM (With sinews semiflexed.) Magnificence.\n\nBELLO Down! (He taps her on the shoulder with his fan.) Incline feet forward! Slide left foot one pace back. You will fall. You are falling. On the hands down!\n\nBLOOM (Her eyes upturned in the sign of admiration, closing.) Truffles!\n\n(With a piercing epileptic cry she sinks on all fours, grunting, snuffling, rooting at his feet, then lies, shamming dead with eyes shut tight, trembling eyelids, bowed upon the ground in the attitude of most excellent master.)\n\nBELLO (With bobbed hair purple gills, fat moustache rings round his shaven mouth, in mountaineer's puttees, green silverbuttoned coat, sport skirt and alpine hat with moor cock's feather, his hands stuck deep in his breeches pockets, places his heel on her neck and grinds it in.) Feel my entire weight. Bow, bondslave, before the throne of your despot's glorious heels, so glistening in their proud erectness.\n\nBLOOM (Enthralled, bleats.) I promise never to disobey.\n\nBELLO (Laughs loudly.) Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume.\n\n(Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe.\n\nZOE (Widening her slip to screen her.) She's not here.\n\nBLOOM (Closing her eyes.) She's not here.\n\nFLORRY (Hiding her with her gown.) She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir.\n\nKITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir.\n\nBELLO (Coaxingly.) Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety. (Bloom puts out her timid head.) There's a good girly now. (Bello grabs her hair violently and drags her forward.) I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready.\n\nBLOOM (Fainting.) Don't tear my.\n\nBELLO (Savagely.) The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life. (His forehead veins swollen, his face congested.) I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter. (He belches.) And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you.\n\n(He twists her arm. Bloom squeaks, turning turtle.)\n\nBLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't!\n\nBELLO (Twisting.) Another!\n\nBLOOM (Screams.) O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad!\n\nBELLO (Shouts.) Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you. (He slaps her face.)\n\nBLOOM (Whimpers.) You're after hitting me. I'll tell...\n\nBELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him.\n\nZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will.\n\nFLORRY I will. Don't be greedy.\n\nKITTY No, me. Lend him to me.\n\n(The brothel cook, Mrs Keogh, wrinkled, greybearded, in a greasy bib, men's grey and green socks and brogues, flour-smeared, a rollingpin stuck with raw pastry in her bare red arm and hand, appears at the door.)\n\nMRS KEOCH (Ferociously.) Can I help? (They hold and pinion Bloom.)\n\nBELLO (Squats, with a grunt, on Bloom's upturned face, puffing cigar-smoke, nursing a fat leg.) I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one. (He quenches his cigar angrily on Bloom's ear.) Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray?\n\nBLOOM (Goaded, buttocksmothered.) O! O! Monsters! Cruel one!\n\nBELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before. (He thrusts out a figged fist and foul cigar.) Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss. (He throws a leg astride and, pressing with horseman's knees, calls in a hard voice.) Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes. (He bends sideways and squeezes his mount's testicles roughly, shouting.) Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion. (He horserides cockhorse, leaping in the saddle.) The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop.\n\nFLORRY (Pulls at Bello.) Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you.\n\nZOE (Pulling at Florry.) Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress?\n\nBLOOM (Stifling.) Can't.\n\nBELLO Well, I'm not. Wait. (He holds in his breath.) Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst. (He uncorks himself behind: then, contorting his features, farts loudly.) Take that! (He recorks himself) Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters.\n\nBLOOM (A sweat breaking out over him.) Not man. (He sniffs.) Woman.\n\nBELLO (Stands up.) No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too.\n\nBLOOM (Shrinks.) Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails?\n\nBELLO (Points to his whores.) As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you...\n\nBLOOM (A chafing soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and lace male hands and nose, leering mouth.) I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift.\n\nBELLO (Jeers.) Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh?\n\nBLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine.\n\nBELLO (Guffaws.) Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton. (He guffaws again.) Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh?\n\nBLOOM (Her hands and features working.) It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful.\n\nBELLO (With wicked glee.) Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne.\n\nBLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy. (Earnestly.) And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet.\n\nBELLO (Sternly.) No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds.\n\nTHE SINS OF THE PAST (In a medley of voices.) He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order?\n\nBELLO (Whistles loudly.) Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once.\n\n(Mute inhuman faces throng forward, leering, vanishing, gibbering, Eooloohoom. Poldy Hock, Bootlaces a penny, cassidy's hag, blind stripling, Larry Rhinoceros, the girl, the woman, the whore, the other the... )\n\nBLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath...\n\nBELLO (Peremptorily.) Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... !\n\nBLOOM (Docile, gurgles.) I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant...\n\nBELLO (Imperiously.) O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to.\n\nBLOOM (Bows.) Master! Mistress! Mantamer!\n\n(He lifts his arms. His bangle bracelets fall.)\n\nBELLO (Satirically.) By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice? (He places a ruby ring on her finger.) And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, mistress.\n\nBELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives. (He chuckles.) My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh (I was in bed with him just now and another gentleman out of the Hanaper and Petty Bag office) is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers? (He points.) For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth. (He bares his arm and plunges it elbowdeep in Bloom's vulva.) There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon? (He shoves his arm in a bidder's face.) Here, wet the deck and wipe it round!\n\nA BIDDER A florin!\n\n(Dillon's lacquey rings his handbell.)\n\nA VOICE One and eightpence too much.\n\nTHE LACQUEY Barang!\n\nCHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean.\n\nBELLO (Gives a rap with his gavel.) Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa! (He brands his initial Con Bloom's croup.) So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen?\n\nA DARKVISAGED MAN (In disguised accent.) Hoondert punt sterlink.\n\nVOICES (Subdued.) For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid.\n\nBELLO (Gaily.) Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blas\u00e9 man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices.\n\nBLOOM (Bends his blushing face into his armpit and simpers with forefinger in mouth.) O, I know what you're hinting at now.\n\nBELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you? (He stoops and, peering, pokes with his fan rudely under the fat suetfolds of Bloom's haunches.) Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump. (Loudly.) Can you do a man's job?\n\nBLOOM Eccles Street.\n\nBELLO (Sarcastically.) I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot? (He spits in contempt.) Spittoon!\n\nBLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I.\n\nBELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle.\n\nBLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still...\n\nBELLO (Ruthlessly.) No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see.\n\n(Old Sleepy Hollow calls over the wold.)\n\nSLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle!\n\nBLOOM (In tattered moccasins with a rusty fowlingpiece, tip toeing, fingertipping, his haggard bony bearded face peering through the diamond panes, cries out.) I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he.\n\nBELLO (Laughs mockingly.) That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student.\n\n(Milly Bloom, fairhaired, greenvested, slimsandalled, her bluescab in the seawind simply swirling, breaks from the arms of her lover and calls, her young eyes wonderwide.)\n\nMILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown!\n\nBELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O.\n\nBLOOM They... I\n\nBELLO (Cuttingly.) Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's.\n\nBLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove...\n\nA VOICE Swear!\n\n(Bloom clenches his fists and crawls forward, a bowie knife between his teeth.)\n\nBELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean.\n\nBLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ?\n\n(He bites his thumb.)\n\nBELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool. (He explodes in a loud phlegmy laugh.) We'll manure you, Mr Flower! (He pipes scoffingly.) Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli!\n\nBLOOM (Clasps his head.) My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff... (He weeps tearlessly.)\n\nBELLO (Sneers.) Crybabby! Crocodile tears!\n\n(Bloom, broken, closely veiled for the sacrifice, sobs, his face to the earth. The passing bell is heard. Darkshawled figures of the circumcised, in sackcloth and ashes, stand by the wailing wall. M. Shulomowitz, Joseph Goldwater Moses Herzog, Harris Rosenberg, M. Moisel, J. Citron, Minnie Watchman, 0. Mastiansky, the Reverend Leopold Abramovitz, Chazen. With swaying arms they wail in pneuma over the recreant Bloom.)\n\nTHE CIRCUMCISED (In a dark guttural chant as they cast dead sea fruit upon him, no flowers.) Shema Israel Adonai Elohenu Adonai Echad.\n\nVOICES (Sighing.) So he's gone. Ah, yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? Never heard of him. No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.\n\n(From the suttee pyre the flame of gum camphire ascends. The pall of incense smoke screens and disperses. Out of her oak frame a nymph with hair unbound, lightly clad in teabrown art colours, descends from her grotto and passing under interlacing yews, stands over Bloom.)\n\nTHE YEWS (Their leaves whispering.) Sister. Our sister. Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Softly.) Mortal! (Kindly.) Nay, dost not weepest!\n\nBLOOM (Crawls jellily forward under the boughs, streaked by sunlight, with dignity.) This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit.\n\nTHE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married.\n\nBLOOM (Lifts a turtle head towards her lap.) We have met before. On another star.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Sadly.) Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo.\n\nBLOOM You mean Photo Bits?\n\nTHE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame.\n\nBLOOM (Humbly kisses her long hair.) Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray.\n\nTHE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise.\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent. (He sighs.) 'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Her fingers in her ears.) And words. They are not in my dictionary.\n\nBLOOM You understood them?\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Covers her face with her hand.) What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on?\n\nBLOOM (Apologetically.) I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Bends her head.) Worse! Worse!\n\nBLOOM (Reflects precautiously.) That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle.\n\n(The sound of a waterfall is heard in bright cascade.)\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS (Mingling their boughs.) Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days.\n\nJOHN WYSE NOLAN (In the background, in Irish National For ester's uniform, doffs his plumed hat.) Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland!\n\nTHE YEWS (Murmuring.) Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade?\n\nBLOOM (Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in nondescript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.) I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days.\n\n(Halcyon Days, high school boys in blue and white football jerseys and shorts, Master Donald Turnbull, Master Abraham Chatterton, Master Owen Goldberg, Master Jack Meredith, Master Percy Apjohn, stand in a clearing of the trees and shout to Master Leopold Bloom.)\n\nTHE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray!\n\n(They cheer.)\n\nBLOOM (Hobbledehoy, warmgloved, mammamufflered, stunned with spent snowballs, struggles to rise.) Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street. (He cheers feebly.) Hurray for the High School!\n\nTHE ECHO Fool!\n\nTHE YEWS (Rustling.) She is right, our sister. Whisper. (Whispered kisses are heard in all the wood. Faces of hamadryads peep out from the boles and among the leaves and break blossoming into bloom.) Who profaned our silent shade?\n\nTHE NYMPH (Coyly through parting fingers.) There! In the open air?\n\nTHE YEWS (Sweeping downward.) Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca\nPhoucaphouca Phoucaphouca.\n\n\nTHE NYMPH (With wide fingers.) O! Infamy!\n\nBLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw?\n\n(Staggering Bob, a whitepolled calf thrusts a ruminating head with humid nostrils through the foliage.)\n\nSTAGGERING BOB Me. Me see.\n\nBLOOM Simply satisfying a need. (With pathos.) No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play.\n\n(High on Ben Howth through rhododendrons a nannygoat passes, plumpuddered, buttytailed, dropping curvants.)\n\nTHE NANNYGOAT (Bleats.) Megegaggegg! Nannannanny!\n\nBLOOM (Hatless, flushed, covered with burn of thistledown and gotrepine.) Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases. (He gazes intently downwards on the water.) Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk. (Through silversilent summer air the dummy of Bloom, rolled in a mummy, rolls rotatingly from the Lion's Head cliff into the purple Waiting waters.)\n\nTHE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg?\n\n(Far out in the bay between Bailey and Kish lights the Erin's King sails, sending a broadening plume of coalsmoke from her funnel towards the land.)\n\nCOUNCILLOR NANNETI (Alone on deck, in dark alpaca, yellow kitefaced, his hand in his waistcoat opening, declaims.) When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have...\n\nBLOOM Done. Prff.\n\nTHE NYMPH (Loftily.) We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light. (She arches her body in lascivious crispation, placing her forefinger in her mouth.) Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ?\n\nBLOOM (Pacing the heather abjectly.) O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend.\n\nTHE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff. (She blushes and makes a knee.) And the rest.\n\nBLOOM (Dejected.) Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name. (With sudden fervour.) For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ?\n\n(Figures wind serpenting in slow woodland pattern around the treestems, cooeeing.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF KITTY (In the thicket.) Show us one of them cushions.\n\nTHE VOICE OF FLORRY Here.\n\n(A grouse wings clumsily through the underwood.)\n\nTHE VOICE OF LYNCH (In the thicket.) Whew! Piping hot!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ZOE (From the thicket.) Came from a hot place.\n\nTHE VOICE OF VIRAG (A birdchief bluestreaked and feathered in war panoply with his assegai, striding through a crackling canebrake over beechmast and acorns.) Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull!\n\nBLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full. It fills me full.\n\nTHE WATERFALL\n\nPhillaphulla Poulaphouca\nPoulaphouca Poulaphouca.\n\n\nTHE YEWS Ssh! Sister, speak!\n\nTHE NYMPH (Eyeless, in nun's white habit, coif and huge winged wimple, softly, with remote eyes.) Tranquilia convent. Sister Agatha. Mount Carmel, the apparitions of Knock and Lourdes. No more desire. (She reclines her head, sighing.) Only the ethereal. Where dreamy creamy gull waves o'er the waters dull.\n\n(Bloom half rises. His back trousers button snaps.)\n\nTHE BUTTON Bip!\n\n(Two sluts of the Coombe dance rainily by, shawled, yelling flatly.)\n\nTHE SLUTS\n\nO Leopold lost the pin of his drawers\nHe didn't know what to do,\nTo keep it up,\nTo keep it up.\n\n\nBLOOM (Coldly.) You have broken the spell. The last straw. If there were only ethereal where would you all be, postulants and novices? Shy but willing, like an ass pissing.\n\nTHE YEWS (Their silverfoil of leaves precipitating, their skinny arms ageing and swaying.) Deciduously!\n\nTHE NYMPH Sacrilege! To attempt my virtue! (A large moist stain appears on her robe.) Sully my innocence! You are not fit to touch the garment of a pure woman. (She clutches in her robe.) Wait, Satan. You'll sing no more lovesongs. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. (She draws a poniard and, clad in the sheathmail of an elected knight of nine, strikes at his loins.) Nekum!\n\nBLOOM (Starts up, seizes her hand.) Hoy! Nebrakada! Cat of nine lives! Fair play, madam. No pruning knife. The fox and the grapes, is it? What do we lack with your barbed wire? Crucifix not thick enough? (He clutches her veil.) A holy abbot you want or Brophy, the lame gardener, or the spoutless statue of the watercarrier or good Mother Alphonsus, eh Reynard?\n\nTHE NYMPH (With a cry, flees from him unveiled, her plaster cast cracking, a cloud of stench escaping from the cracks.) Poli... !\n\nBLOOM (Calls after her.) As if you didn't get it on the double yourselves. No jerks and multiple mucosities all over you. I tried it. Your strength our weakness. What's our stud fee? What will you pay on the nail? You fee men dancers on the Riviera, I read. (The fleeing nymph raises a keen.) Eh! I have sixteen years of black slave labour behind me. And would a jury give me five shillings alimony tomorrow, eh? Fool someone else, not me. (He sniffs.) But. Onions. Stale. Sulphur. Grease.\n\n(The figure of Bella Cohen stands before him.)\n\nBELLA You'll know me the next time.\n\nBLOOM (Composed, regards her.) Pass\u00e9e. Mutton dressed as lamb. Lone in the tooth and superfluous hairs. A raw onion the last thing at night would benefit your complexion. And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the glass eyes of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.\n\nBELLA (Contemptuously.) You're not game, in fact. (Her sowcunt barks.) Fohracht!\n\nBLOOM (Contemptuously.) Clean your nailless middle finger first, the cold spunk of your bully is dripping from your cockscomb. Take a handful of hay and wipe yourself.\n\nBELLA I know you, canvasser! Dead cod!\n\nBLOOM I saw him, kipkeeper! Pox and gleet vendor!\n\nBELLA (Turns to the piano.) Which of you was playing the dead march from Saul?\n\nZOE Me. Mind your cornflowers. (She darts to the piano and bangs chords on it with crossed arms.) The cat's ramble through the slag. (She glances back.) Eh? Who's making love to my sweeties? (She darts back to the table.) What's yours is mine and what's mine is my own.\n\n(Kitty disconcerted coats her teeth with the silver paper. Bloom approaches Zoe.)\n\nBLOOM (Gently.) Give me back that potato, will you? Zoe Forfeits, a fine thing and a superfine thing.\n\nBLOOM (With feeling.) It is nothing, but still a relic of poor mamma.\n\nZOE\n\nGive a thing and take it back\nGod'll ask you where is that\nYou'll say you don't know\nGod'll send you down below.\n\n\nBLOOM There is a memory attached to it. I should like to have it.\n\nSTEPHEN To have or not to have, that is the question.\n\nZOE Here. (She hauls up a reef of her slip, revealing her bare thigh and unrolls the potato from the top of her stocking.) Those that hides knows where to find.\n\nBELLA (Frowns.) Here. This isn't a musical peepshow. And don't you smash that piano. Who's paying here?\n\n(She goes to the pianola. Stephen fumbles in his pocket and, taking out a banknote by its corner, hands it to her.)\n\nSTEPHEN (With exaggerated politeness.) This silken purse I made out of the sow's ear of the public. Madam, excuse me. If you allow me. (He indicates vaguely Lynch and Bloom.) We are all in the same sweepstake, Kinch and Lynch. Dans ce bordel o\u00f9 tenons nostre \u00e9tat.\n\nLYNCH (Calls from the hearth.) Dedalus! Give her your blessing for me.\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands Bella a coin.) Gold. She has it.\n\nBELLA (Looks at the money, then at Zoe, Florry and Kitty.) Do you want three girls? It's ten shillings here.\n\nSTEPHEN (Delightedly.) A hundred thousand apologies. (He fumbles again and takes out and hands her two crowns.) Permit, brevi manu, my sight is somewhat troubled.\n\n(Bella goes to the table to count the money while Stephen talks to himself in monosyllables. Zoe bounds over to the table. Kitty leans over Zoe's neck. Lynch gets up, rights his cap and, clasping Kitty's waist, adds his head to the group.)\n\nFLORRY (Strives heavily to rise.) Ow! My foot's asleep. (She limps over to the table. Bloom approaches.)\n\nBELLA, ZOE. KITTY, LYNCH, BLOOM (Chattering and squabbling.) The gentleman... ten shillings... paying for the three allow me a moment... this gentleman pays separate who's touching it?... ow... mind who you're pinching... are you staying the night or a short time? who did?... you're a liar, excuse me... the gentle man paid down like a gentleman... drink... it's long after eleven.\n\nSTEPHEN (At the pianola, making a gesture of abhorrence.) No bottles! What, eleven? A riddle.\n\nZOE (Lifting up her pettigown and folding a half sovereign into the top of her stocking.) Hard earned on the flat of my back.\n\nLYNCH (Lifting Kitty from the table.) Come!\n\nKITTY Wait. (She clutches the two crowns.)\n\nFLORRY And me?\n\nLYNCH Hoopla! (He lifts her carries her and bumps her down on the sofa.)\n\nSTEPHEN The fox crew, the cocks flew, The bells in heaven Were striking eleven. 'Tis time for her poor soul To get out of heaven.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly lays a half sovereign on the table between Bella and Florry.) So. Allow me. (He takes up the pound note.) Three times ten. We're square.\n\nBELLA (Admiringly.) You're such a slyboots, old cocky. I could kiss you.\n\nZOE (Points.) Hum? Deep as a drawwell. (Lynch bends Kitty back over the sofa and kisses her. Bloom goes with the poundnote to Stephen.)\n\nBLOOM This is yours.\n\nSTEPHEN How is that? Le distrait or absentminded beggar. (He fumbles again in his pocket and draws out a handful of coins. An object falls.) That fell.\n\nBLOOM (Stooping, picks up and hands a box of matches.) This.\n\nSTEPHEN Lucifer. Thanks.\n\nBLOOM (Quietly.) You had better hand over that cash to me to take care of. Why pay more?\n\nSTEPHEN (Hands him all his coins.) Be just before you are generous.\n\nBLOOM I will but is it wise? (He counts.) One, seven, eleven, and five. Six. Eleven. I don't answer for what you may have lost.\n\nSTEPHEN Why striking eleven? Proparoxyton. Moment before the next Lessing says. Thirsty fox. (He laughs loudly.) Burying his grandmother. Probably he killed her.\n\nBLOOM That is one pound six and eleven. One pound seven, say.\n\nSTEPHEN Doesn't matter a rambling damn.\n\nBLOOM No, but...\n\nSTEPHEN (Comes to the table.) Cigarette, please. (Lynch tosses a cigarette from the sofa to the table.) And so Georgina Johnson is dead and married. (A cigarette appears on the table. Stephen looks at it.) Wonder. Parlour magic. Married. Hm. (He strikes a match and proceeds to light the cigarette with enigmatic melancholy.)\n\nLYNCH (Watching him.) You would have a better chance of lighting it if you held the match nearer.\n\nSTEPHEN (Brings the match nearer his eye.) Lynx eye. Must get glasses. Broke them yesterday. Sixteen years ago. Distance. The eye sees all flat. (He draws the match away. It goes out.) Brain thinks. Near: far. Ineluctable modality of the visible. (He frowns mysteriously.) Hm. Sphinx. The beast that has two backs at midnight. Married.\n\nZOE It was a commercial traveller married her and took her away with him.\n\nFLORRY (Nods.) Mr Lambe from London.\n\nSTEPHEN Lamb of London, who takest away the sins of our world.\n\nLYNCH (Embracing Kitty on the sofa, chants deeply.) Dona nobis pacem. (The cigarette slips from Stephens fingers. Bloom picks it up and throws it into the grate.)\n\nBLOOM Don't smoke. You ought to eat. Cursed dog I met. (To Zoe.) You have nothing?\n\nZOE Is he hungry?\n\nSTEPHEN (Extends his hand to her smiling and chants to the air of the bloodoath in the Dusk of the Gods.)\n\nHangende Hunger,\nFragende Frau,\nMacht uns alle kaput.\n\n\nZOE (Tragically.) Hamlet, I am thy father's gimlet! (She takes his hand.) Blue eyed beauty, I'll read your hand. (She points to his forehead.) No wit, no wrinkles. (She counts.) Two, three, Mars, that's courage. (Stephen shakes his head.) No kid.\n\nLYNCH Sheet lightning courage. The youth who could not shiver and shake. (To Zoe.) Who taught you palmistry?\n\nZOE (Turns.) Ask my ballocks that I haven't got. (To Stephen.) I see it in your face. The eye, like that. (She frowns with lowered head.)\n\nLYNCH (Laughing, slaps Kitty behind twice.) Like that. Pandy bat.\n\n(Twice loudly a pandybat cracks, the coffin of the pianola flies open, the bald little round jack-in-the-box head of Father Dolan springs up.)\n\nFATHER DOLAN Any boy want flogging? Broke his glasses? Lazy idle little schemer. See it in your eye.\n\n(Mild, benign, rectorial, reproving, the head of Don John Conmee rises from the pianola coffin.)\n\nDON JOHN CONMEE Now, Father Dolan! Now. I'm sure that Stephen is a very good little boy.\n\nZOE (Examining Stephen's palm.) Woman's hand.\n\nSTEPHEN (Murmurs.) Continue. Lie. Hold me. Caress. I never could read His handwriting except His criminal thumbprint on the haddock.\n\nZOE What day were you born?\n\nSTEPHEN Thursday. Today.\n\nZOE Thursday's child has far to go. (She traces lines on his hand.) Line of fate. Influential friends.\n\nFLORRY (Pointing.) Imagination.\n\nZOE Mount of the moon. You'll meet with a... (She peers at his hands abruptly.) I won't tell you what's not good for you. Or do you want to know?\n\nBLOOM (Detaches her fingers and offers his palm.) More harm than good. Here. Read mine.\n\nBELLA Show. (She turns up Bloom's hand.) I thought so. Knobby knuckles, for the women.\n\nZOE (Peering at Bloom's palm.) Gridiron. Travels beyond the sea and marry money.\n\nBLOOM Wrong.\n\nZOE (Quickly.) O, I see. Short little finger. Henpecked husband. That wrong?\n\n(Black Liz, a huge rooster hatching in a chalked circle, rises, stretches her wings and clucks.)\n\nBLACK LIZ Gara. Klook. Klook. Klook.\n\n(She sidles from her newlaid egg and waddles off.)\n\nBLOOM (Points to his hand.) That weal there is an accident. Fell and cut it twenty-two years ago. I was sixteen.\n\nZOE I see, says the blind man. Tell us news.\n\nSTEPHEN See? Moves to one great goal. I am twenty two too. Sixteen years ago I twentytwo tumbled, twentytwo years ago he sixteen fell off his hobbyhorse. (He winces.) Hurt my hand somewhere. Must see a dentist. Money?\n\n(Zoe whispers to Florry. They giggle. Bloom releases his hand and writes idly on the table in backhand, pencilling slow curves.)\n\nFLORRY What?\n\n(A hackneycar number three hundred and twentyfour, with a gallantbuttocked mare, driven by James Barton, Harmony Avenue, Donnybrook, trots past. Blazes Boylan and Lenehan sprawl swaying on the sideseats. The Ormond boots crouches behind on the axle. Sadly over the crossblind Lydia Douce and Mina Kennedy gaze.)\n\nTHE BOOTS (Jogging, mocks them with thumb and wriggling wormfingers.) Haw, haw, have you the horn?\n\n(Bronze by gold they whisper.)\n\nZOE (To Florry.) Whisper.\n\n(They whisper again.)\n\n(Over the well of the car Blazes Boylan leans, his boater straw set sideways, a red flower in his mouth. Lenehan, in a yachtsman's cap and white shoes, officiously detaches a long hair from Blazes Boylan s shoulder.)\n\nLENEHAN Ho! What do I here behold? Were you brushing the cobwebs off a few quims?\n\nBOYLAN (Seated, smiles.) Plucking a turkey.\n\nLENEHAN A good night's work.\n\nBOYLAN (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks.) Blazes Kate! Up to sample or your money back. (He holds out a forefinger.) Smell that.\n\nLENEHAN (Smells gleefully.) Ah! Lobster and mayonnaise. Ah!\n\nZOE AND FLORRY (Laugh together.) Ha ha ha ha.\n\nBOYLAN bumps surely from the car and calls loudly for all to hear. ) Hello, Bloom! Mrs Bloom up yet?\n\nBLOOM (In a flunkey's plum plush coat and kneebreeches, buff stockings and powdered wig.) I'm afraid not, sir, the last articles...\n\nBOYLAN (Tosses him sixpence.) Here, to buy yourself a gin and splash. (He hangs his hat smartly on a peg of Bloom's antlered head.) Show me in. I have a little private business with your wife. You understand?\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir. Yes, sir, Madam Tweedy is in her bath, sir.\n\nMARION He ought to feel himself highly honoured. (She plops splashing out of the water.) Raoul, darling, come and dry me. I'm in my pelt. Only my new hat and a carriage sponge.\n\nBOYLAN (A merry twinkle in his eye.) Topping!\n\nBELLA What? What is it?\n\n(Zoe whispers to her.)\n\nMARION Let him look, the pishogue! Pimp! And scourge himself! I'll write to a powerful prostitute or Bartholomona, the bearded woman, to raise weals out on him an inch thick and make him bring me back a signed and stamped receipt.\n\nBELLA (Laughing.) Ho ho ho ho.\n\nBOYLAN (To Bloom, over his shoulder.) You can apply your eye to the keyhole and play with yourself while I just go through her a few times.\n\nBLOOM Thank you, sir, I will, sir. May I bring two men chums to witness the deed and take a snapshot? (He holds an ointment jar.) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower?... Lukewarm water?...\n\nKITTY (From the sofa.) Tell us, Florry. Tell us. What.\n\n(Florry whispers to her. Whispering lovewords murmur lip-lapping loudly, poppysmic plopslop.)\n\nMINA KENNEDY (Her eyes upturned.) O, it must be like the scent of geraniums and lovely peaches! O, he simply idolises every bit of her! Stuck together! Covered with kisses!\n\nLYDIA DOUCE (Her mouth opening.) Yumyum. O, he's carrying her round the room doing it! Ride a cock horse. You could hear them in Paris and New York. Like mouthfuls of strawberries and cream.\n\nKITTY (Laughing.) Hee hee hee.\n\nBOYLAN'S VOICE (Sweetly, hoarsely, in the pit of his stomach.) Ah! Gooblazqruk brukarchkrasht!\n\nMARION'S VOICE (Hoarsely, sweetly rising to her throat.) O!

Hee hee!\n\nLYNCH (Points.) The mirror up to nature. (He laughs.) Hu hu hu hu hu hu.\n\n(Stephen and Bloom gaze in the mirror. The face of William Shakespeare, beardless, appears there, rigid in facial paralysis, crowned by the reflection of the reindeer antlered hatrack in the hall.)\n\nSHAKESPEARE (In dignified ventriloquy.) 'Tis the loud laugh bespeaks the vacant mind. (To Bloom.) Thou thoughtest as how thou wastest invisible. Gaze. (He crows with a black capon's laugh.) Iagogo! How my Oldfellow chokit his Thursdaymomun. Iagogogo!\n\nBLOOM (Smiles yellowly at the whores.)

Beneath her skirt appear her late husband's everyday trousers and turnedup boots, lace eights. She holds a Scottish widow's insurance policy and lace marqueeumbrella under which her brood runs with her, Patsy hopping on one short foot, his collar loose, a hank of porksteaks dangling, Freddy whimpering, Susy with a crying cods mouth, Alice struggling with the baby. She cuffs them on, her streamers flaunting aloft.)\n\nFREDDY Ah, ma, you're dragging me along!\n\nSUSY Mamma, the beeftea is fizzing over!\n\nSHAKESPEARE (With paralytic rage.) Weda seca whokilla farst.\n\n(The face of Martin Cunningham, bearded, refeatures Shakespeares beardless face. The marqueeumbrella sways drunkenly, the children run aside.

Give us some parleyvoo.\n\n(Stephen claps hat on head and leaps over to the fireplace, where he stands with shrugged shoulders, finny hands outspread, a painted smile on his face.)\n\nLYNCH (Pommelling on the sofa.)

The pack of staghounds follows, nose to the ground, sniffing their quarry, beaglebaying, burblbrblng to be blooded. Ward Union huntsmen and huntswomen live with them, hot for a kill. From Six Mile Point, Flathouse, Nine Mile Stone follow the footpeople with knotty sticks, salmongaffs, lassos, flockmasters with stockwhips, bearbaiters with tomtoms, toreadors with bullswords, grey negroes waving torches. The crowd bowls of dicers, crown and anchor players, thimbleriggers, broadsmen. Crows and touts, hoarse bookies in high wizard hats clamour deafeningly.)\n\nTHE CROWD\n\nCard of the races.

The field follows, a bunch of bucking mounts. Skeleton horses: Sceptre, Maximum the Second, Zinfandel, the Duke of Westminsters Shotover, Repulse, the Duke of Beauforts' Ceylon, prix de Paris. Dwarfs ride them, rusty armoured, leaping, leaping in their saddles. Last in a drizzle of rain, on a broken-winded isabelle nag, Cock of the North, the favourite, honey cap, green jacket, orange sleeves, Garrett Deasy up, gripping the reins, a hockey stick at the ready. His nag, stumbling on whitegaitered feet, jogs along the rocky road.)\n\nTHE ORANGE LODGES (Jeering.) Get down and push, mister. Last lap! You'll be home the night!\n\nGARRETT DEASY (Bolt upright, his nailscraped face plastered with postage stamps, brandishes his hockeystick, his blue eyes flashing in the prism of the chandelier as his mount lopes by at a schooling gallop.)

(He runs to the piano and takes his ashplant, beating his foot in tripudium.)\n\nZOE (Turns the drumhandle.) There.\n\n(She drops two pennies in the slot. Glow pink and violet lights start forth. The drum turns purring in low hesitation waltz. Professor Goodwin, in a bowknotted periwig, in court dress, wearing a stained inverness cape, bent in two from incredible age, totters across the room, his hands fluttering. He sits tinily on the piano stool and lifts and beats handless sticks of arms on the keyboard, nodding with damsels grace, his bowknot bobbing.)\n\nZOE (Twirls around herself heeltapping.) Dance. Anybody here for there? Who'll dance?\n\n(The pianola, with changing lights, plays in waltz time the prelude to My Girl's a Yorkshire Girl. Stephen throws his ashplant on the table and seizes Zoe around the waist. Florry and Bella push the table towards the fireplace. Stephen, aiming Zoe with exaggerated grace, begins to waltz her around the room. Her sleeve, falling from gracing arms, reveals a white fleshflower of vaccination. Bloom stands aside. Between the curtains, Professor Maginni inserts a leg on the toepoint of which spins a silk hat. With a deft kick, he sends it spinning to his crown and jauntyhatted skates in. He wears a slate frockcoat with claret silk lapels, a go-et of cream tulle, a green lowcut waistcoat, stock collar with white kerchief tight lavender trousers, patent pumps and canary gloves. In his buttonhole is a dahlia. He twirls in reversed directions a clouded cane, then wedges it tight in his oxter. He places a hand limply on his breastbone, bows and fondles his flower and buttons.)\n\nMAGINNI The poetry of motion, art of callisthenics. No connection with Madam Legget Byrne's or Levinstone's. Fancy dress balls arranged. Deportment. The Katty Lanner steps. So. Watch me! My terpsichorean abilities. (He minuets forward three paces on tripping bee's feet.) Tout le monde an avant! R\u00e9v\u00e9rence! Tout le monde en place!\n\n(The prelude ceases. Professor Goodwin, beating vague arms,shrivels, shrinks, his live cape falling about the stool. The air, in firmer waltz time, pounds. Stephen and Zoe circle freely. The lights change, glow, fade, gold, rose, violet.)\n\nTHE PIANOLA Two young fellows were talking about their girls, girls, girls, Sweethearts they'd left behind.\n\n(From a corner the morning hours run out, goldhaired, slim, in girlish blue, waspwaisted, with innocent hands. Nimbly they dance, twirling their skipping ropes. The hours of noon follow in amber gold. Laughing linked, high haircombs flashing, they catch the sun in mocking mirrors, lifting their arms.)\n\nMAGINNI (Clipclaps glovesilent hands.) Carr\u00e9! Avant deux! Breathe evenly! Balance!\n\n(The morning and noon hours waltz in their places, turning, advancing to each other, shaping their curves, bowing vis a vis.

The twilight hours advance, from long landshadows, dispersed, lagging, languideyed, their cheeks delicate with cipria and false faint bloom. They are in grey gauze with dark bat sleeves that flutter in the land breeze.)\n\nMAGINNI Avant! huit! Travers\u00e9! Salut! Cours de mains! Crois\u00e9!\n\n(The eight hours steal to the last place. Morning, noon and twilight hours retreat before them. They are masked, with daggered hair and bracelets of dull bells. Weary, they curchycurchy under veils.)\n\nTHE BRACELETS Heigho!

Los ronds! Los ponts! Chevaux de bois! Escargots!\n\n(Twining, receding, with interchanging hands, the night hours link, each with arching arms, in a mosaic of movements.

Remerciez!\n\nTHE PIANOLA\n\nBest, best of all,\nBaraabum!\n\n\nKITTY (Jumps up.) O, they played that on the hobbyhorses at the Mirus bazaar!\n\n(She runs to Stephen. He leaves Florry brusquely and seizes Kitty. A screaming bit tern's harsh high whistle shrieks.

He stops dead.)\n\nSTEPHEN Ho!\n\n(Stephen's mother, emaciated, rises stark through the floor in leper grey with a wreath of faded orange blossoms and a torn bridal veil, her face worn and noseless, green with grave mould. Her hair is scant and lank. She fixes her bluecircled hollow eyesockets on Stephen and opens her toothless mouth uttering a silent word. A choir of virgins and confessors sing voicelessly.)\n\nTHE CHOIR\n\nLiliata rutilantium te confessorum...\nIubilantium te virginum...\n\n\n(From the top of a tower Buck Mulligan, in particoloured jester's dress of puce and yellow and clown's cap with curling bell, stands gaping at her, a smoking buttered split scone in his hand.)\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN She's beastly dead. The pity of it! Mulligan meets the afflicted mother. (He upturns his eyes.) Mercurial Malachi.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (With the subtle smile of death's madness.) I was once the beautiful May Goulding. I am dead.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Horrorstruck.) Lemur, who are you? What bogey man's trick is this?\n\n\nBUCK MULLIGAN (Shakes his curling capbell.) The mockery of it! Kinch killed her dogsbody bitchbody. She kicked the bucket. (Tears of molten butter fall from his eyes into the scone.) Our great sweet mother! Epi oinopa ponton.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Comes nearer, breathing upon him softly her breath of wetted ashes.) All must go through it, Stephen. More women than men in the world. You too. Time will come.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Choking with fright, remorse and horror.) They said I killed you, mother. He offended your memory. Cancer did it, not I. Destiny.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (A green rill of bile trickling from a side of her mouth.) You sang that song to me. Love's bitter mystery.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Eagerly.) Tell me the word, mother, if you know now. The word known to all men.\n\n\nTHE MOTHER Who saved you the night you jumped into the train at Dalkey with Paddy Lee? Who had pity for you when you were sad among the strangers? Prayer is all powerful. Prayer for the suffering souls in the Ursuline manual, and forty days' indulgence. Repent, Stephen.\n\n\nSTEPHEN The ghoul! Hyena!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER I pray for you in my other world. Get Dilly to make you that boiled rice every night after your brain work. Years and years I loved you, O my son, my firstborn, when you lay in my womb.\n\n\nZOE (Fanning herself with the grate fan.) I'm melting!\n\n\nFLORRY (Points to Stephen) Look!

Raw head and bloody bones!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Her face drawing near and nearer, sending out an ashen breath.) Beware! (She raises her blackened, withered right arm slowly towards Stephen's breast with outstretched fingers.) Beware! God's hand! (A green crab with malignant red eyes sticks deep its grinning claws in Stephen's heart.)\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Strangled with rage.) Shite! (His features grow drawn and grey and old.)\n\n\nBLOOM (At the window.) What?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Ah non, par exemple! The intellectual imagination! With me all or not at all. Non serviam!\n\n\nFLORRY Give him some cold water. Wait. (She rushes out.)\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (Wrings her hands slowly, moaning desperately.) O Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on him! Save him from hell, O divine Sacred Heart!\n\n\nSTEPHEN No! No! No! Break my spirit all of you if you can! I'll bring you all to heel!\n\n\nTHE MOTHER (In the agony of her deathrattle.) Have mercy on Stephen, Lord, for my sake! Inexpressible was my anguish when expiring with love, grief and agony on Mount Calvary.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Nothung!\n\n\n(He hits his ashplant high with both hands and smashes the chandelier. Time's livid final flame leaps and, in the following darkness, ruin of all space, shattered glass and toppling masonry.)\n\n\nTHE GASJET Pwfungg!\n\n\nBLOOM Stop!\n\n\nLYNCH (Rushes forward and seizes Stephen's hand.) Here! Hold on! Don't run amok!\n\n\nBELLA Police!\n\n\n(Stephen, abandoning his ashplant, his head and arms thrown back stark, beats the ground and flees from the room past the whores at the door.)\nBELLA (Screams.) After him!\n\n\n(The two whores rush to the halldoors. Lynch and Kitty and Zoe stampede from the room. They talk excitedly. Bloom follows, returns.)\n\n\nTHE WHORES (Jammed in the doorway, pointing.) Down there.\n\n\nZOE (Pointing.) There. There's something up.\n\n\nBELLA Who pays for the lamp? (She seizes Bloom's coattail.) There. You were with him. The lamp's broken.\n\n\nBLOOM (Rushes to the hall, rushes back.) What lamp, woman?\n\n\nA WHORE He tore his coat.\n\n\nBELLA (Her eyes hard with anger and cupidity, points.) Who's to pay for that? Ten Shillings. You're a witness.\n\n\nBLOOM (Snatches up Stephen's ashplant.) Me? Ten shillings? Haven't you lifted enough off him? Didn't he...\n\n\nBELLA (Loudly.) Here, none of your tall talk. This isn't a brothel. A ten shilling house.\n\n\nBLOOM (His hand under the lamp, pulls the chain. Pulling, the gasjet lights up a crushed mauve purple shade. He raises the ashplant.) Only the chimney's broken. Here is all he...\n\n\nBELLA (Shrinks back and screams.) Jesus! Don't!\n\n\nBLOOM (Warding off a blow.) To show you how he hit the paper. There's not a sixpenceworth of damage done. Ten shillings!\n\n\nFLORRY (With a glass of water enters.) Where is he?\n\n\nBELLA Do you want me to call the police?\n\n\nBLOOM O, I know. Bulldog on the premises. But he's a Trinity student. Patrons of your establishment. Gentlemen that pay the rent. (He makes a masonic sign.) Know what I mean? Nephew of the vice-chancellor. You don't want a scandal.\n\n\nBELLA (Angrily.) Trinity! Coming down here ragging after the boat races and paying nothing. Are you my commander here? Where is he? I'll charge him. Disgrace him, I will. (She shouts.) Zoe! Zoe!\n\n\nBLOOM (Urgently.) And if it were your own son in Oxford! (Warningly.) I know.\n\n\nBELLA (Almost speechless.) Who are you incog?\n\n\nZOE (In the doorway.) There's a row on.\n\n\nBLOOM What? Where? (He throws a shilling on the table and shouts.) That's for the chimney. Where? I need mountain air. (He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail. He walks, runs, zigzags, gallops, lugs laid back. He is pelted with gravel, cabbagestumps, biscuitboxes, eggs, potatoes, dead codfish, womans slipperslappers. After him, freshfound, the hue and cry zigzag gallops in hot pursuit of follow my leader: 65 C 66 C night watch, John Henry Menton, Wisdom Hely, V.B.

You are my guests. The uninvited. By virtue of the fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy Caffrey.) Was he insulting you?\n\n\nSTEPHEN Addressed her in vocative feminine. Probably neuter. Ungenitive.\nVOICES No, he didn't. The girl's telling lies. He was in Mrs Cohen's. What's up? Soldiers and civilians.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY I was in company with the soldiers and they left me to do - you know and the young man ran up behind me. But I'm faithful to the man that's treating me though I'm only a shilling whore.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Catches sight of Kitty's and Lynch's heads.) Hail, Sisyphus. (He points to himself and the others.) Poetic. Neopoetic.\n\n\nVOICES She's faithfultheman.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY Yes, to go with him. And me with a soldier friend.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON He doesn't half want a thick ear, the blighter. Biff him one, Harry.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Cissy.) Was he insulting you while me and him was having a piss?\n\n\nLORD TENNYSON (In Union Jack blazer and cricket flannels, bareheaded, flowingbearded.) Their's not to reason why.\n\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Biff him, Harry.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (To Private Compton. ) I don't know your name but you are quite right. Doctor Swift says one man in armour will beat ten men in their shirts. Shirt is synechdoche. Part for the whole.\n\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (To the crowd.) No, I was with the private.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Amiably.) Why not? The bold soldier boy. In my opinion every lady for example...\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (His cap awry, advancing to Stephen.) Say, how would it be, governor, if I was to bash in your jaw?\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Looks up in the sky.) How? Very unpleasant. Noble art of self-pretence. Personally, I detest action. (He waves his hand) Hand hurts me slightly. Enfin, ce sont vos oignons.\n\n\n(To Cissy Caffrey.) Some trouble is on here. What is it, precisely?\n\n\nDOLLY GRAY (From her balcony waves her handkerchief giving the sign of the heroine of Jericho.) Rahab. Cook's son, goodbye. Safe home to Dolly. Dream of the girl you left behind and she will dream of you.\n\n\n(The soldiers turn their swimming eyes.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Elbowing through the crowd plucks Stephen's sleeve vigorously.) Come now, professor, that carman is waiting.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Turns.) Eh? (He disengages himself) Why should I not speak to him or to any human being who walks upright upon this oblate orange? (He points his finger.) I'm not afraid of what I can talk to if I see his eye. Retaining the perpendicular.\n\n\n(He staggers a pace back.)\n\n\nBLOOM (Propping him.) Retain your own.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Laughs emptily.) My centre of gravity is displaced. I have forgotten the trick. Let us sit down somewhere and discuss. Struggle for life is the law of existence but modern philirenists, notably the tsar and the king of England, have invented arbitration. (He taps his brow.) But in here it is I must kill the priest and the king.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Did you hear what the professor said? He's a professor out of the college.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE I did. I heard that.\n\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP He expresses himself with much marked refinement of phraseology.\n\n\nCUNTY KATE Indeed, yes. And at the same time with such apposite trenchancy.\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Pulls himself free and comes forward.) What's that you're saying about my king?\n\n\n(Edward the Seventh appears in an archway. He wears a white jersey on which an image of the Sacred Heart is stitched, with the insignia of Garter and Thistle, Golden Fleece, Elephant of Denmark, Skinners' and Probyns' horse, Lincoln's Inn bencher and ancient and honourable artillery company of Massachusetts. He sucks a red jujube. He is robed as a grand elect perfect and sublime mason with trowel and apron, marked made in Germany. In his left hand he holds a plasterers bucket on which is printed: D\u00e9fense d'uriner. A roar of welcome greets him.)\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Slowly, solemnly but indistinctly.) Peace, perfect peace. For identification bucket in my hand. Cheerio, boys. (He turns to his subjects.) We have come here to witness a clean straight fight and we heartily wish both men the best of good luck. Mahak makar a back.\n\n\n(He shakes hands with Private Carr, Private Compton, Stephen, Bloom and Lynch. General applause. Edward the Seventh lifts the bucket graciously in acknowledgement.)\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR (To Stephen.) Say it again.\n\n\nSTEPHEN (Nervous, friendly, pulls himself up.) I understand your point of view, though I have no king myself for the moment. This is the age of patent medicine. A discussion is difficult down here. But this is the point. You die for your country, suppose. (He places his arm on Private Carr's sleeve.) Not that I wish it for you. But I say: Let my country die for me. Up to the present it has done so. I don't want it to die. Damn death. Long live life!\n\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Levitates over heaps of slain in the garb and with the halo of Joking Jesus, a white jujube in his phosphorescent face.)\n\n\nMy methods are new and are causing surprise.\nTo make the blind see I throw dust in their eyes.\n\n\nSTEPHEN Kings and unicorns! (He falls back a pace.) Come somewhere and we'll... What was that girl saying?...\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Eh, Harry, give him a kick in the knackers. Stick one into Jerry.\n\nBLOOM (To the privates, softly.) He doesn't know what he's saying. Taking a little more than is good for him. Absinthe, the greeneyed monster. I know him. He's a gentleman, a poet. It's all right.\n\nSTEPHEN (Nods, smiling and laughing.) Gentleman, patriot, scholar and judge of impostors.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I don't give a bugger who he is. PRIVATE COMPTON We don't give a bugger who he is.\n\nSTEPHEN I seem to annoy them. Green rag to a bull.\n\n(Kevin Egan of Paris in black Spanish tasselled shirt and peep-o'-day boys hat signs to Stephen.)\n\nKEVIN EGAN H'lo. Bonjour! The vieille ogresse with the dents jaunes.\n\n(Patrice Egan peeps from behind, his rabbit face nibbling a quince leaf.)\n\nPATRICE Socialiste!\n\nDON EMILE PATRIZIO FRANZ RUPERT POPE HENNESSY (In medieval hauberk, two wild geese volant on his helm, with noble indignation points a mailed hand against the privates.) Were those eykes to footboden, big grand porcos of johnyellows todos covered of gravy!\n\nBLOOM (To Stephen.) Come home. You'll get into trouble.\n\nSTEPHEN (Swaying.) I don't avoid it. He provokes my intelligence.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP One immediately observes that he is of patrician lineage.\n\nTHE VIRAGO Green above the red, says he. Wolfe Tone.\n\nTHE BAWD The red's as good as the green, and better. Up the soldiers! Up King Edward!\n\nA ROUGH (Laughs.) Ay! Hands up to De Wet.\n\nTHE CITIZEN (With a huge emerald muffler and shillelagh, calls.)\n\nMay the God above\nSend down a cove\nWith teeth as sharp as razors\nTo slit the throat\nOf the English dogs\nThat hanged our Irish leaders.\n\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY (The rope noose round his neck, gripes in his issuing bowels with both hands.)\n\nI bear no hate to a living thing,\nBut love my country beyond the king.\n\n\nRUMBOLD, DEMON BARBER (Accompanied by two blackmasked assistants, advances with a gladstone bag which he opens.) Ladies and gents, cleaver purchased by Mrs Pearcy to slay Mogg. Knife with which Voisin dismembered the wife of a compatriot and hid remains in a sheet in the cellar, the unfortunate female's throat being cut from ear to ear. Phial containing arsenic retrieved from the body of Miss Barrow which sent Seddon to the gallows.\n\n(He jerks the rope, the assistants leap at the victims legs and drag him downward, grunting: the croppy boys tongue protrudes violently.)\n\nTHE CROPPY BOY Horhot ho hray ho rhother's hest.\n\n(He gives up the ghost. A violent erection of the hanged sends gouts of sperm spouting through his death clothes on to the cobblestones. Mrs Bellingham, Mrs Yelverton Barry and the Honourable Mrs Mervyn Talboys rush forward with their handkerchiefs to sop it up.)\n\nRUMBOLD I'm near it myself. (He undoes the noose.) Rope which hanged the awful rebel. Ten shillings a time as applied to His Royal Highness. (He plunges his head into the gaping belly of the hanged and draws out his head again clotted with coiled and smoking entrails.) My painful duty has now been done. God save the king!\n\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH (Dances slowly, solemnly, rattling his bucket and sings with soft contentment.)\n\nOn coronation day, on coronation day,\nO, Won't We have a merry time,\nDrinking whisky, beer and wine!\n\n\nPRIVATE CARR Here. What are you saying about my king?\n\nSTEPHEN (Throws up his hands.) O, this is too monotonous! Nothing. He wants my money and my life, though want must be his master, for some brutish empire of his. Money I haven't. (He searches his pockets vaguely.) Gave it to someone.\n\nPRIVATE CARR Who wants your bleeding money?\n\nSTEPHEN (Tries to move off.) Will some one tell me where I am least likely to meet these necessary evils? \u00e7a se voit aussi \u00e0 Paris. Not that I... But by Saint Patrick!...\n\n(The women's heads coalesce. Old Gummy Granny in sugarloaf hat appears seated on a toadstool, the deathflower of the potato blight on her breast.)\n\nSTEPHEN Aha! I know you, grammer! Hamlet, revenge! The old sow that eats her farrow!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Rocking to and fro.) Ireland's sweetheart, the king of Spain's daughter, alanna. Strangers in my house, bad manners to them! (She keens with banshee woe.) Ochone! Ochone! Silk of the kine! (She wails.) You met with poor old Ireland and how does she stand?\n\nSTEPHEN How do I stand you? The hat trick! Where's the third person of the Blessed Trinity? Soggarth Aroon? The reverend Carrion Crow.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Shrill.) Stop them from fighting!\n\nA ROUGH Our men retreated.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Tugging at his belt.) I'll wring the neck of any bugger says a word against my fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Terrified.) He said nothing. Not a word. A pure misunderstanding.\n\nTHE CITIZEN Erin go bragh!\n\n(Major Tweedy and the Citizen exhibit to each other medals, decorations, trophies of war wounds. Both salute with fierce hostility.)\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON Go it, Harry. Do him one in the eye. He's a proboer.\n\nSTEPHEN Did I? When?\n\nBLOOM (To the redcoats.) We fought for you in South Africa, Irish missile troops. Isn't that history? Royal Dublin Fusiliers. Honoured by our monarch.\n\nTHE NAVVY (Staggering past.) O, yes. O, God, yes! O, make the kwawr a krowawr! O! Bo!\n\n(Casqued halberdiers in armour thrust forward a pentice of gutted spear points. Major Tweedy, moustached like Turko the terrible, in bearskin cap with hackle plume and accoutrements, with epaulette, gilt chevrons and sabretache, his breast bright with medals, toes the line. He gives the pilgrim warrior's sign of the knights templars.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Growls gruffly.) Rorke's Drift! Up, guards, and at them! Mahal shalal hashbaz.\n\nPRIVATE CARR I'll do him in.\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Waves the crowd back.) Fair play, here. Make a bleeding butcher's shop of the bugger.\n\n(Massed bands blare Garryowen and God save the king.)\n\nCISSY CAFFREY They're going to fight. For me!\n\nCUNTY KATE The brave and the fair.\n\nBIDDY THE CLAP Methinks yon sable knight will joust it with the best.\n\nCUNTY KATE (Blushing deeply.) Nay, Madam. The gules doublet and merry Saint George for me!\n\nSTEPHEN The harlot's cry from street to street Shall weave old Ireland's windingsheet.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Loosening his belt, shouts.) I'll wring the neck of any fucking bastard says a word against my bleeding fucking king.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes Cissy Caffrey's shoulders.) Speak, you! Are you struck dumb? You are the link between nations and generations. Speak, woman, sacred lifegiver.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Alarmed seizes Private Carr's sleeve.) Amn't I with you? Amn't I your girl? Cissy's your girl. (She cries.) Police!\n\nSTEPHEN (Ecstatically, to Cissy Caffrey.)\n\nWhite thy fambles, red thy gan\nAnd thy quarrons dainty is.\n\n\nVOICES Police!\n\nDISTANT VOICES Dublin's burning! Dublin's burning! On fire, on fire!\n\n(Brimstone fires spring up. Dense clouds roll past. Heavy Gatling guns boom. Pandemonium. Troops deploy. Gallop of hoofs. Artillery. Hoarse commands. Bells clang. Backers shout. Drunkards bawl. Whores screech. Foghorns hoot. Cries of valour. Shrieks of dying. Pikes clash on cuirasses. Thieves rob the slain. Birds of prey, winging from the sea, rising from marsh lands, swooping from eyries, hover screaming, gannets, connorants, vultures, goshawks, climbing woodcocks, peregrines, merlin, blackgrouse, sea eagles, gulls, albatrosses, barnacle geese. The midnight sun is darkened. The earth trembles. The dead of Dublin from Prospect and Mount Jerome in white sheepskin overcoats and black goat-fell cloaks arise and appear to many. A chasm opens with a noiseless yawn. Tom Rochford, winner in athletes singlet and breeches, arrives at the head of the national hurdle handicap and leaps into the void. He is followed by a race of runners and leapers. In wild attitudes they spring from the brink. Their bodies plunge. Factory lasses with fancy clothes toss redhot Yorkshire baraabombs. Society ladies lift their skirts above their heads to protect themselves. laughing witches in red cutty sarks ride through the air on broomsticks. Quakerlyster plasters blisters. It rains dragon's teeth. Armed heroes spring up from furrows. They exchange in amity the pass of knights of the red cross and fight duels with cavalry sabres: Wolfe Tone against Henry Grattan, Smith O'Brien against Daniel O'Connell, Michael Davitt against Isaac Butt, Justin M'Carthy against Parnell, Arthur Griffith against John Redmond John O'Leary against liar O'Johnny, lord Edward Fitzgerald against lord Gerald Fitzedward, The O'Donoghue of the Glens against The Glens of The Donoghue. On an eminence, the centre of the earth, rises the field altar of Saint Barbara. Black candles rise from its gospel and epistle horns. From the high barbicans of the tower two shafts of light fall on the smokepalled altarstone. On the altarstone Mrs Mina Purefoy, goddess of unreason, lies naked, fettered, a chalice resting on her swollen belly. Father Malachi O'Flynn, in a long petticoat and reversed chasuble, his two left feet back to the front, celebrates camp mash. The Reverend Mr Hugh C. Haines love MA. in a plain cassock and mortar board, his head and collar back to the front, holds over the celebrants head an open umbrella.)\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN Introibo ad altare diaboli.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE To the devil which hath made glad my young days.\n\nFATHER MALACHI O'FLYNN (Takes from the chalice and elevates a blooddripping host.) Corpus Meum.\n\nTHE REVEREND MR HAINES LOVE (Raises high behind the celebrant's petticoats, revealing his grey bare hairy buttocks between which a carrot is stuck.) My body.\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE DAMNED Htengier Tnetopinmo Dog Drol eht rot, Aiulella!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Dooooooooooog!\n\nTHE VOICE OF ALL THE BLESSED Alleluia, for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth!\n\n(From on high the voice of Adonai calls.)\n\nADONAI Goooooooooood!\n\n(In strident discord peasants and townsmen of mange and Green factions sing Kick the Pope and Daily, daily sing to Mary.)\n\nPRIVATE CARR (With ferocious articulation.) I'll do him in, so help me fucking Christ! I'll wring the bastard fucker's bleeding blasted fucking windpipe!\n\nOLD GUMMY GRANNY (Thrusts a dagger towards Stephen's hand.) Remove him, acushla. At 8.35 a.m. you will be in heaven and Ireland will be free. (She prays.) O good God, take him!\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Lynch.) Can't you get him away?\n\nLYNCH He likes dialectic, the universal language. Kitty! (To Bloom.) Get him away, you. He won't listen to me. (He drags Kitty away.)\n\nSTEPHEN (Points.) Exit Judas. Et laqueo se suspendit.\n\nBLOOM (Runs to Stephen.) Come along with me now before worse happens. Here's your stick.\n\nSTEPHEN Stick, no. Reason. This feast of pure reason.\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (Pulling Private Carr.) Come on, you're boosed. He insulted me but I forgive him. (Shouting in his ear.) I forgive him for insulting me.\n\nBLOOM (Over Stephen's shoulder.) Yes, go. You see he's incapable.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Breaks loose.) I'll insult him.\n\n(He rushes towards Stephen, fists outstretched, and strikes him in the face. Stephen totters, collapses, falls stunned. He lies prone, his face to the sky, his hat rolling to the wall. Bloom follows and picks it up.)\n\nMAJOR TWEEDY (Loudly.) Carbine in bucket! cease fire! Salute!\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking furiously.) Ute ute ute ute ute ute uteute.\n\nTHE CROWD Let him up! Don't strike him when he's down! Air! Who? The soldier hit him. He's a professor. Is he hurted? Don't manhandle him! He's fainted!\n\n(The retriever, nosing on the fringe of the crowd, barks noisily.)\n\nWhat call had the redcoat to strike the gentleman and he under the influence? Let them go and fight the Boers!\n\nTHE BAWD Listen to who's talking! Hasn't the soldier a right to go with his girl? He gave him the coward's blow.\n\n(They grab at each other's hair, claw at each other and spit.)\n\nTHE RETRIEVER (Barking.) Wow wow wow.\n\nBLOOM (Shoves them back, loudly.) Get back, stand back!\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON (Tugging his comrade.) Here bugger off, Harry. There's the cops!\n\n(Two raincaped watch, tall, stand in the group)\n\nFIRST WATCH What's wrong here?\n\nPRIVATE COMPTON We were with this lady and he insulted us and assaulted my chum. (The retriever barks.) Who owns the bleeding tyke?\n\nCISSY CAFFREY (With expectation.) Is he bleeding?\n\nA MAN (Rising from his knees.) No. Gone off. He'll come to all right.\n\nBLOOM (Glances sharply at the man.) Leave him to me. I can easily...\n\nSECOND WATCH Who are you? Do you know him?\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Lurches towards the watch.) He insulted my lady friend.\n\nBLOOM (Angrily.) You hit him without provocation. I'm a witness. Constable, take his regimental number.\n\nSECOND WATCH I don't want your instructions in the discharge of my duty. PRIVATE COMPTON (Pulling his comrade.) Here, bugger off, Harry. Or Bennett'll have you in the lockup.\n\nPRIVATE CARR (Staggering as he is pulled away.) God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him.\n\nFIRST WATCH (Taking out his notebook.) What's his name?\n\nBLOOM (Peering over the crowd.) I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant.\n\nFIRST WATCH Name and address.\n\n(Corny Kelleher weepers round his hat, a death wreath in his hand, appears among the bystanders.)\n\nBLOOM (Quickly.) O, the very man! (He whispers.) Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back.\n\nSECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (To the watch, with drawling eye.) That's all right. I know him. Won a bit on the races. Gold cup. Throwaway. (He laughs.) Twenty to one. Do you follow me?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Turns to the crowd.) Here, what are you all gaping at? Move on out of that.\n\n(The crowd disperses slowly, muttering, down the lane.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Leave it to me, sergeant. That'll be all right. (He laughs, shaking his head.) We were often as bad ourselves, ay or worse. What? Eh, what?\n\nFIRST WATCH (Laughs.) I suppose so.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Nudges the second watch.) Come and wipe your name off the slate. (He lilts, wagging his head.) With my tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom tooraloom. What, eh, do you follow me?\n\nSECOND WATCH (Genially.) Ah, sure we were too.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Winking.) Boys will be boys. I've a car round there.\n\nSECOND WATCH All right, Mr Kelleher. Good night.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER I'll see to that.\n\nBLOOM (Shakes hands with both of the watch in turn.) Thank you very much gentlemen, thank you. (He mumbles confidentially.) We don't want any scandal, you understand. Father is a well known, highly respected citizen. Just a little wild oats, you understand.\n\nFIRST WATCH O, I understand, sir.\n\nSECOND WATCH That's all right, Sir.\n\nFIRST WATCH It was only in case of corporal injuries I'd have had to report it at the station.\n\nBLOOM (Nods rapidly.) Naturally. Quite right. Only your bounden duty.\n\nSECOND WATCH It's our duty.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Good night, men.\n\nTHE WATCH (Saluting together.) Night, gentlemen. (They move off with slow heavy tread.)\n\nBLOOM (Blows.) Providential you came on the scene. You have a car?.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs, pointing his thumb over his right shoulder to the car brought up against the scaffolding.) Two commercials that were standing fizz in Jammet's. Like princes, faith. One of them lost two quid on the race. Drowning his grief and were on for a go with the jolly girls. So I landed them up on Behan's car and down to nighttown.\n\nBLOOM I was just going home by Gardiner street when I happened to...\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Laughs.) Sure they wanted me to join in with the mots. No, by God, says I. Not for old stagers like myself and yourself. (He laughs again and leers with lacklustre eye.) Thanks be to God we have it in the house what, eh, do you follow me? Hah! hah! hah!\n\nBLOOM (Tries to laugh.) He, he, he! Yes. Matter of fact I was just visiting an old friend of mine there, Virag, you don't know him (poor fellow he's laid up for the past week) and we had a liquor together and I was just making my way home...\n\n(The horse neighs.)\n\nTHE HORSE Hohohohohohoh! Hohohohome!\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Sure it was Behan, our jarvey there, that told me after we left the two commercials in Mrs Cohen's and I told him to pull up and got off to see. (He laughs.) Sober hearsedrivers a specialty. Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what?\n\nBLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop.\n\n(Stephen, prone, breathes to the stars. Corny Kelleher asquint, drawls at the horse. Bloom in gloom, looms down.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (Scratches his nape.) Sandycove! (He bends down and calls to Stephen.) Eh! (He calls again.) Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him.\n\nBLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick.\n\nCORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it. No bones broken. Well, I'll shove along. (He laughs.) I've a rendezvous in the morning. Burying the dead. Safe home!\n\nTHE HORSE (Neighs.) Hohohohohome.\n\nBLOOM Good night. I'll just wait and take him along in a few...\n\n(Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it. The horse harness jingles.)\n\nCORNY KELLEHER (From the car, standing.) Night.\n\nBLOOM Night.\n\n(The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly. The car and horse back slowly, awkwardly and turn. Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Blooms plight. The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs. The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane. Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand. Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloolooloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephens hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)\n\nBLOOM Eh! Ho! (There is no answer he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!\n\nSTEPHEN (Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.) Who... drive... Fergus now. And pierce... wood's woven shade?...\n\n(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)\n\nBLOOM Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the wood shavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!\n\n(Murmurs.)\n\n... shadows... the woods\n... white breast... dim...\n\n\n(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen's face and form.)\n\nBLOOM (Communes with the night.) Face reminds me of his poor mother. In the shady wood. The deep white breast. Ferguson, I think I caught. A girl. Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.) in the rough sands of the sea. a cabletow's length from the shore... where the tide ebbs ... and flows...\n\n(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the page.)\n\nBLOOM (Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!\n\nRUDY (Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauveface. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet howknot. A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)10Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 14, "api_path": "/songs/151188", "artist_names": "James Joyce", "full_title": "Finnegan's Wake (Chap. 1.8) by\u00a0James\u00a0Joyce", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/ab566adfa0cd2c569387e58a62f401ff.300x487x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ab566adfa0cd2c569387e58a62f401ff.429x696x1.jpg", "id": 151188, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 218394, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1634429331, "path": "/James-joyce-finnegans-wake-chap-18-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-finnegans-wake-chap-18-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1941, "month": 9, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "September 1941", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 1941", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/ab566adfa0cd2c569387e58a62f401ff.300x487x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/ab566adfa0cd2c569387e58a62f401ff.429x696x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 1, "hot": false}, "title": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.8)", "title_with_featured": "Finnegan's Wake (Chap. 1.8)", "updated_by_human_at": 1634429331, "url": "https://genius.com/James-joyce-finnegans-wake-chap-18-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/22971", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/98f10611fc0aa6a525b9fbcab2ffa297.1000x600x1.jpg", "id": 22971, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9997f2e769ef85b9f941405cac99d1af.570x570x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "James Joyce", "slug": "James-joyce", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/James-joyce"}, "artist": "James Joyce", "lyrics": "Finnegan\u2019s Wake (Chap. 1.8) LyricsO\ntell me all about\nAnna Livia!

Look at the shirt of him ! Look at the dirt of it! He has all my water black on me. And it steeping and stuping since this time last wik. How many goes is it I wonder I washed it? I know by heart the places he likes to saale, duddurty devil! Scorching my hand and starving my fa-mine to make his private linen public. Wallop it well with your battle and clean it. My wrists are wrusty rubbing the mouldaw stains. And the dneepers of wet and the gangres of sin in it! What was it he did a tail at all on Animal Sendai? And how long was he under loch and neagh? It was put in the newses what he did, nicies and priers, the King fierceas Humphrey, with illysus dis-tilling, exploits and all. But toms will till. I know he well. Temp untamed will hist for no man. As you spring so shall you neap. O, the roughty old rappe! Minxing marrage and making loof. Reeve Gootch was right and Reeve Drughad was sinistrous! And the cut of him! And the strut of him! How he used to hold his head as high as a howeth, the famous eld duke alien, with a hump of grandeur on him like a walking wiesel rat. And his derry\u2019s own drawl and his corksown blather and his doubling stutter and his gullaway swank. Ask Lictor Hackett or Lector Reade of Garda Growley or the Boy with the Billyclub. How elster is he a called at all? Qu\u2019appelle? Huges Caput Earlyfouler. Or where was he born or how was he found? Urgothland, Tvistown on the Kattekat? New Hunshire, Concord on the Merrimake?

Who sold you that jackalantern\u2019s tale? Pemmican\u2019s pasty pie! Not a grasshoop to ring her, not an antsgrain of ore. In a gabbard he barqued it, the boat of life, from the harbourless Ivernikan Okean, till he spied the loom of his landfall and he loosed two croakers from under his tilt, the gran Phenician rover. By the smell of her kelp they made the pigeonhouse. Like fun they did! But where was Himself, the timoneer?

When they saw him shoot swift up her sheba sheath, like any gay lord salomon, her bulls they were ruhring, surfed with spree. Boyarka buah! Boyana bueh!

Do you know she was calling bakvandets sals from all around, nyumba noo, chamba choo, to go in till him, her erring cheef, and tickle the pontiff aisy-oisy? She was? Gota pot! Yssel that the limmat? As El Negro winced when he wonced in La Plate. O, tell me all I want to hear, how loft she was lift a laddery dextro! A coneywink after the bunting fell.

Sure she can\u2019t fiddan a dee, with bow or abandon! Sure, she can\u2019t! Tista suck. Well, I never now heard the like of that! Tell me moher. Tell me moatst. Well, old Humber was as glommen as grampus, with the tares at his thor and the buboes for ages and neither bowman nor shot abroad and bales allbrant on the crests of rockies and nera lamp in kitchen or church and giant\u2019s holes in Grafton\u2019s causeway and deathcap mushrooms round Funglus grave and the great tribune\u2019s barrow all darnels occumule, sittang sambre on his sett, drammen and drommen, usking queasy quizzers of his ruful continence, his childlinen scarf to encourage his obsequies where he\u2019d check their debths in that mormon\u2019s thames, be questing and handsetl, hop, step and a deepend, with his berths in their toiling moil, his swal-lower open from swolf to fore and the snipes of the gutter pecking his crocs, hungerstriking all alone and holding doomsdag over hunselv, dreeing his weird, with his dander up, and his fringe combed over his eygs and droming on loft till the sight of the sternes, after zwarthy kowse and weedy broeks and the tits of buddy and the loits of pest and to peer was Parish worth thette mess. You\u2019d think all was dodo belonging to him how he durmed adranse in durance vaal. He had been belching for severn years. And there she was, Anna Livia, she darent catch a winkle of sleep, purling around like a chit of a child, Wendawanda, a finger-thick, in a Lapsummer skirt and damazon cheeks, for to ishim bonzour to her dear dubber Dan. With neuphraties and sault from his maggias. And an odd time she\u2019d cook him up blooms of fisk and lay to his heartsfoot her meddery eygs, yayis, and staynish beacons on toasc and a cupenhave so weeshywashy of Greenland\u2019s tay or a dzoupgan of Kaffue mokau an sable or Sikiang sukry or his ale of ferns in trueart pewter and a shin-kobread (hamjambo, bana?) for to plaise that man hog stay his stomicker till her pyrraknees shrunk to nutmeg graters while her togglejoints shuck with goyt and as rash as she\u2019d russ with her peakload of vivers up on her sieve (metauwero rage it swales and rieses) my hardey Hek he\u2019d kast them frome him, with a stour of scorn, as much as to say you sow and you sozh, and if he didn\u2019t peg the platteau on her tawe, believe you me, she was safe enough. And then she\u2019d esk to vistule a hymn, The Heart Bowed Down or The Rakes of Mallow or Chelli Michele\u2019s La Calumnia \u0160 un Vermicelli or a balfy bit ov old Jo Robidson. Sucho fuffing a fifeing \u2018twould cut you in two! She\u2019d bate the hen that crowed on the turrace of Babbel. What harm if she knew how to cockle her mouth! And not a mag out of Hum no more than out of the mangle weight. Is that a faith? That\u2019s the fact. Then riding the ricka and roya romanche, Annona, gebroren aroostokrat Nivia, dochter of Sense and Art, with Sparks\u2019 pirryphlickathims funk-ling her fan, anner frostivying tresses dasht with virevlies, \u2014 while the prom beauties sreeked nith their bearers\u2019 skins!\u2014 in a period gown of changeable jade that would robe the wood of two cardinals\u2019 chairs and crush poor Cullen and smother Mac\u2013Cabe. O blazerskate! Theirs porpor patches! And brahming to him down the feedchute, with her femtyfyx kinds of fondling endings, the poother rambling off her nose: Vuggybarney, Wickerymandy! Hello, ducky, please don\u2019t die! Do you know what she started cheeping after, with a choicey voicey like water-glucks or Madame Delba to Romeoreszk? You\u2019ll never guess. Tell me. Tell me. Phoebe, dearest, tell, O tell me and I loved you better nor you knew. And letting on hoon var daft about the warbly sangs from over holmen: High hellskirt saw ladies hensmoker lily-hung pigger: and soay and soan and so firth and so forth in a tone sonora and Oom Bothar below like Bheri\u2013Bheri in his sandy cloak, so umvolosy, as deaf as a yawn, the stult! Go away! Poor deef old deary! Yare only teasing! Anna Liv? As chalk is my judge! And didn\u2019t she up in sorgues and go and trot doon and stand in her douro, puffing her old dudheen, and every shirvant siligirl or wensum farmerette walking the pilend roads, Sawy, Fundally, Daery or Maery, Milucre, Awny or Graw, usedn\u2019t she make her a simp or sign to slip inside by the sullyport? You don\u2019t say, the sillypost? Bedouix but I do! Calling them in, one by one (To Blockbeddum here! Here the Shoebenacaddie!) and legging a jig or so on the sihl to show them how to shake their benders and the dainty how to bring to mind the gladdest garments out of sight and all the way of a maid with a man and making a sort of a cackling noise like two and a penny or half a crown and holding up a silliver shiner. Lordy, lordy, did she so? Well, of all the ones ever I heard! Throwing all the neiss little whores in the world at him! To inny captured wench you wish of no matter what sex of pleissful ways two adda tammar a lizzy a lossie to hug and hab haven in Humpy\u2019s apron!\n\nAnd what was the wyerye rima she made! Odet! Odet! Tell me the trent of it while I\u2019m lathering hail out of Denis Florence MacCarthy\u2019s combies. Rise it, flut ye, pian piena! I\u2019m dying down off my iodine feet until I lerryn Anna Livia\u2019s cushingloo, that was writ by one and rede by two and trouved by a poule in the parco! I can see that, I see you are. How does it tummel? Listen now. Are you listening? Yes, yes! Idneed I am! Tarn your ore ouse! Essonne inne!\n\nBy earth end the cloudy but I badly went e brandnew bankside, bedamp and I do, and a plumper at that!\n\nFor the putty affair I have is wore out, so it is, sitting, yaping and waiting for my old Dane hodder dodderer, my life in death companion, my frugal key of our larder, my much-altered camel\u2019s hump, my jointspoiler, my maymoon\u2019s honey, my fool to the last Decemberer, to wake himself out of his winter\u2019s doze and bore me down like he used to.\nIs there irwell a lord of the manor or a knight of the shire at strike, I wonder, that\u2019d dip me a dace or two in cash for washing and darning his worshipful socks for him now we\u2019re run out of horse-brose and milk?\n\nOnly for my short Brittas bed made\u2019s as snug as it smells it\u2019s out I\u2019d lep and off with me to the slobs deua Tolka or the plage au Clontarf to feale the gay aire of my salt troublin bay and the race of the saywint up me ambushure.\n\nOnon! Onon! tell me more. Tell me every tiny teign. I want to know every single ingul. Down to what made the potters fly into jagsthole. And why were the vesles vet. That homa fever\u2019s winning me wome. If a mahun of the horse but hard me! We\u2019d be bundukiboi meet askarigal. Well, now comes the hazel-hatchery part. After Clondalkin the Kings\u2019s Inns. We\u2019ll soon be there with the freshet. How many aleveens had she in tool? I can\u2019t rightly rede you that. Close only knows. Some say she had three figures to fill and confined herself to a hundred eleven, wan by-wan bywan, making meanacuminamoyas. Olaph lamm et, all that pack? We won\u2019t have room in the kirkeyaard. She can\u2019t remember half of the cradlenames she smacked on them by the grace of her boxing bishop\u2019s infallible slipper, the cane for Kund and abbles for Eyolf and ayther nayther for Yakov Yea. A hundred and how? They did well to rechristien her Pluhurabelle. O loreley! What a loddon lodes! Heigh ho! But it\u2019s quite on the cards she\u2019ll shed more and merrier, twills and trills, sparefours and spoilfives, nord-sihkes and sudsevers and ayes and neins to a litter. Grandfarthring nap and Messamisery and the knave of all knaves and the joker. Heehaw! She must have been a gadabount in her day, so she must, more than most. Shoal she was, gidgad. She had a flewmen of her owen. Then a toss nare scared that lass, so aimai moe, that\u2019s agapo! Tell me, tell me, how cam she camlin through all her fellows, the neckar she was, the diveline? Casting her perils before our swains from Fonte-inMonte to Tidingtown and from Tidingtown tilhavet. Linking one and knocking the next, tapting a flank and tipting a jutty and palling in and pietaring out and clyding by on her eastway. Waiwhou was the first thur-ever burst? Someone he was, whuebra they were, in a tactic attack or in single combat. Tinker, tilar, souldrer, salor, Pieman Peace or Polistaman. That\u2019s the thing I\u2019m elwys on edge to esk. Push up and push vardar and come to uphill headquarters! Was it waterlows year, after Grattan or Flood, or when maids were in Arc or when three stood hosting? Fidaris will find where the Doubt arises like Nieman from Nirgends found the Nihil. Worry you sighin foh, Albern, O Anser? Untie the gemman\u2019s fistiknots, Qvic and Nuancee! She can\u2019t put her hand on him for the mo-ment. Tez thelon langlo, walking weary! Such a loon waybash \u2014 wards to row! She sid herself she hardly knows whuon the annals her graveller was, a dynast of Leinster, a wolf of the sea, or what he did or how blyth she played or how, when, why, where and who offon he jumpnad her and how it was gave her away. She was just a young thin pale soft shy slim slip of a thing then, sauntering, by silvamoonlake and he was a heavy trudging lurching lieabroad of a Curraghman, making his hay for whose sun to shine on, as tough as the oaktrees (peats be with them!) used to rustle that time down by the dykes of killing Kildare, for forstfellfoss with a plash across her. She thought she\u2019s sankh neathe the ground with nymphant shame when he gave her the tigris eye! O happy fault! Me wish it was he! You\u2019re wrong there, corribly wrong! Tisn\u2019t only tonight you\u2019re anacheronistic! It was ages behind that when nullahs were nowhere, in county Wickenlow, garden of Erin, before she ever dreamt she\u2019d lave Kilbride and go foaming under Horsepass bridge, with the great southerwestern windstorming her traces and the midland\u2019s grain-waster asarch for her track, to wend her ways byandby, robecca or worse, to spin and to grind, to swab and to thrash, for all her golden lifey in the barleyfields and pennylotts of Humphrey\u2019s fordofhurdlestown and lie with a landleaper, wellingtonorseher. Alesse, the lagos of girly days! For the dove of the dunas! Was-ut? Izod? Are you sarthin suir? Not where the Finn fits into the Mourne, not where the Nore takes lieve of Bl\u00fem, not where the Braye divarts the Farer, not where the Moy changez her minds twixt Cullin and Conn tween Cunn and Collin? Or where Neptune sculled and Tritonville rowed and leandros three bumped heroines two? Neya, narev, nen, nonni, nos ! Then whereabouts in Ow and Ovoca? Was it yst with wyst or Lucan Yokan or where the hand of man has never set foot? Dell me where, the fairy ferse time! I will if you listen. You know the dinkel dale of Luggelaw? Well, there once dwelt a local heremite, Michael Arklow was his river-end name, (with many a sigh I aspersed his lavabibs!) and one venersderg in junojuly, oso sweet and so cool and so limber she looked, Nance the Nixie, Nanon L\u2019Escaut, in the silence, of the sy-comores, all listening, the kindling curves you simply can\u2019t stop feeling, he plunged both of his newly anointed hands, the core of his cushlas, in her singimari saffron strumans of hair, parting them and soothing her and mingling it, that was deepdark and ample like this red bog at sundown. By that Vale Vowclose\u2019s lucydlac, the reignbeau\u2019s heavenarches arronged orranged her. Afroth-dizzying galbs, her enamelled eyes indergoading him on to the vierge violetian. Wish a wish! Why a why? Mavro! Letty Lerck\u2019s lafing light throw those laurals now on her daphdaph teasesong petrock. Maass! But the majik wavus has elfun anon meshes. And Simba the Slayer of his Oga is slewd. He cuddle not help himself, thurso that hot on him, he had to forget the monk in the man so, rubbing her up and smoothing her down, he baised his lippes in smiling mood, kiss akiss after kisokushk (as he warned her niver to, niver to, nevar) on Anna-na-Poghue\u2019s of the freckled forehead. While you\u2019d parse secheressa she hielt her souff\u2019. But she ruz two feet hire in her aisne aestumation. And steppes on stilts ever since. That was kissuahealing with bantur for balm! O, wasn\u2019t he the bold priest? And wasn\u2019t she the naughty Livvy? Nautic Naama\u2019s now her navn. Two lads in scoutsch breeches went through her before that, Barefoot Burn and Wallowme Wade, Lugnaquillia\u2019s noblesse pickts, before she had a hint of a hair at her fanny to hide or a bossom to tempt a birch canoedler not to mention a bulgic porterhouse barge. And ere that again, leada, laida, all unraidy, too faint to buoy the fairiest rider, too frail to flirt with a cygnet\u2019s plume, she was licked by a hound, Chirripa\u2013Chirruta, while poing her pee, pure and simple, on the spur of the hill in old Kippure, in birdsong and shearingtime, but first of all, worst of all, the wiggly livvly, she sideslipped out by a gap in the Devil\u2019s glen while Sally her nurse was sound asleep in a sloot and, feefee fiefie, fell over a spillway before she found her stride and lay and wriggled in all the stag-nant black pools of rainy under a fallow coo and she laughed innocefree with her limbs aloft and a whole drove of maiden hawthorns blushing and looking askance upon her.\n\nDrop me the sound of the findhorn\u2019s name, Mtu or Mti, som-bogger was wisness. And drip me why in the flenders was she frickled. And trickle me through was she marcellewaved or was it weirdly a wig she wore. And whitside did they droop their glows in their florry, aback to wist or affront to sea? In fear to hear the dear so near or longing loth and loathing longing? Are you in the swim or are you out? O go in, go on, go an! I mean about what you know. I know right well what you mean. Rother! You\u2019d like the coifs and guimpes, snouty, and me to do the greasy jub on old Veronica\u2019s wipers. What am I rancing now and I\u2019ll thank you? Is it a pinny or is it a surplice? Arran, where\u2019s your nose? And where\u2019s the starch? That\u2019s not the vesdre bene-diction smell. I can tell from here by their eau de Colo and the scent of her oder they\u2019re Mrs Magrath\u2019s. And you ought to have aird them. They\u2019ve moist come off her. Creases in silk they are, not crampton lawn. Baptiste me, father, for she has sinned! Through her catchment ring she freed them easy, with her hips\u2019 hurrahs for her knees\u2019dontelleries. The only parr with frills in old the plain. So they are, I declare! Welland well! If tomorrow keeps fine who\u2019ll come tripping to sightsee? How\u2019ll? Ask me next what I haven\u2019t got! The Belvedarean exhibitioners. In their cruisery caps and oarsclub colours. What hoo, they band! And what hoa, they buck! And here is her nubilee letters too. Ellis on quay in scarlet thread. Linked for the world on a flush-caloured field. Annan exe after to show they\u2019re not Laura Ke \u2014 own\u2019s. O, may the diabolo twisk your seifety pin! You child of Mammon, Kinsella\u2019s Lilith! Now who has been tearing the leg of her drawars on her? Which leg is it? The one with the bells on it. Rinse them out and aston along with you! Where did I stop? Never stop! Continuarration! You\u2019re not there yet. I amstel waiting. Garonne, garonne!\n\nWell, after it was put in the Mericy Cordial Mendicants\u2019 Sitter-dag-Zindeh\u2013Munaday Wakeschrift (for once they sullied their white kidloves, chewing cuds after their dinners of cheeckin and beggin, with their show us it here and their mind out of that and their when you\u2019re quite finished with the reading matarial), even the snee that snowdon his hoaring hair had a skunner against him. Thaw, thaw, sava, savuto! Score Her Chuff Exsquire! Everywhere erriff you went and every bung you arver dropped into, in cit or suburb or in addled areas, the Rose and Bottle or Phoenix Tavern or Power\u2019s Inn or Jude\u2019s Hotel or wherever you scoured the countryside from Nannywater to Vartryville or from Porta Lateen to the lootin quarter you found his ikom etsched tipside down or the cornerboys cammocking his guy and Morris the Man, with the role of a royss in his turgos the turrible, (Evro-peahahn cheic house, unskimmed sooit and yahoort, hamman now cheekmee, Ahdahm this way make, Fatima, half tum!) reeling and railing round the local as the peihos piped und uban-jees twanged, with oddfellow\u2019s triple tiara busby rotundarinking round his scalp. Like Pate-by-the-Neva or Pete-over-Meer. This is the Hausman all paven and stoned, that cribbed the Cabin that never was owned that cocked his leg and hennad his Egg. And the mauldrin rabble around him in areopage, fracassing a great bingkan cagnan with their timpan crowders. Mind your Grimm-father! Think of your Ma! Hing the Hong is his jove\u2019s hang \u2014 nomen! Lilt a bolero, bulling a law! She swore on croststyx nyne wyndabouts she\u2019s be level with all the snags of them yet. Par the Vulnerable Virgin\u2019s Mary del Dame! So she said to herself she\u2019d frame a plan to fake a shine, the mischiefmaker, the like of it you niever heard. What plan? Tell me quick and dongu so crould! What the meurther did she mague? Well, she bergened a zakbag, a shammy mailsack, with the lend of a loan of the light of his lampion, off one of her swapsons, Shaun the Post, and then she went and consulted her chapboucqs, old Mot Moore, Casey\u2019s Euclid and the Fashion Display and made herself tidal to join in the mascarete. O gig goggle of gigguels. I can\u2019t tell you how! It\u2019s too screaming to rizo, rabbit it all! Minneha, minnehi mina-aehe, minneho! O but you must, you must really! Make my hear it gurgle gurgle, like the farest gargle gargle in the dusky dirgle dargle! By the holy well of Mulhuddart I swear I\u2019d pledge my chanza getting to heaven through Tirry and Killy\u2019s mount of impiety to hear it all, aviary word! O, leave me my faculties, woman, a while! If you don\u2019t like my story get out of the punt. Well, have it your own way, so. Here, sit down and do as you\u2019re bid. Take my stroke and bend to your bow. Forward in and pull your overthepoise! Lisp it slaney and crisp it quiet. Deel me long-some. Tongue your time now. Breathe thet deep. Thouat\u2019s the fairway. Hurry slow and scheldt you go. Lynd us your blessed ashes here till I scrub the canon\u2019s underpants. Flow now. Ower more. And pooleypooley.\n\nFirst she let her hair fal and down it flussed to her feet its teviots winding coils. Then, mothernaked, she sampood herself with galawater and fraguant pistania mud, wupper and lauar, from crown to sole. Next she greesed the groove of her keel, warthes and wears and mole and itcher, with antifouling butter-scatch and turfentide and serpenthyme and with leafmould she ushered round prunella isles and eslats dun, quincecunct, allover her little mary. Peeld gold of waxwork her jellybelly and her grains of incense anguille bronze. And after that she wove a gar-land for her hair. She pleated it. She plaited it. Of meadowgrass and riverflags, the bulrush and waterweed, and of fallen griefs of weeping willow. Then she made her bracelets and her anklets and her armlets and a jetty amulet for necklace of clicking cobbles and pattering pebbles and rumbledown rubble, richmond and rehr, of Irish rhunerhinerstones and shellmarble bangles. That done, a dawk of smut to her airy ey, Annushka Lutetiavitch Pufflovah, and the lellipos cream to her lippeleens and the pick of the paintbox for her pommettes, from strawbirry reds to extra violates, and she sendred her boudeloire maids to His Affluence, Ciliegia Grande and Kirschie Real, the two chirsines, with respecks from his missus, seepy and sewery, and a request might she passe of him for a minnikin. A call to pay and light a taper, in Brie-on-Arrosa, back in a sprizzling. The cock striking mine, the stalls bridely sign, there\u2019s Zambosy waiting for Me! She said she wouldn\u2019t be half her length away. Then, then, as soon as the lump his back was turned, with her mealiebag slang over her shulder, Anna Livia, oysterface, forth of her bassein came.\n\nDescribe her! Hustle along, why can\u2019t you? Spitz on the iern while it\u2019s hot. I wouldn\u2019t miss her for irthing on nerthe. Not for the lucre of lomba strait. Oceans of Gaud, I mosel hear that! Ogowe presta! Leste, before Julia sees her! Ishekarry and washe-meskad, the carishy caratimaney? Whole lady fair? Duodecimo \u2014 roon? Bon a ventura? Malagassy? What had she on, the liddel oud oddity? How much did she scallop, harness and weights? Here she is, Amnisty Ann! Call her calamity electrifies man.\n\nNo electress at all but old Moppa Necessity, angin mother of injons. I\u2019ll tell you a test. But you must sit still. Will you hold your peace and listen well to what I am going to say now? It might have been ten or twenty to one of the night of Allclose or the nexth of April when the flip of her hoogly igloo flappered and out toetippit a bushman woman, the dearest little moma ever you saw, nodding around her, all smiles, with ems of embarras and aues to awe, between two ages, a judyqueen, not up to your elb. Quick, look at her cute and saise her quirk for the bicker she lives the slicker she grows. Save us and tagus! No more? Werra where in ourthe did you ever pick a Lambay chop as big as a battering ram? Ay, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m epte to forgetting, Like Liviam Liddle did Loveme Long. The linth of my hough, I say! She wore a ploughboy\u2019s nailstudded clogs, a pair of ploughfields in themselves: a sugarloaf hat with a gaudyquiviry peak and a band of gorse for an arnoment and a hundred streamers dancing off it and a guildered pin to pierce it: owlglassy bicycles boggled her eyes: and a fishnetzeveil for the sun not to spoil the wrinklings of her hydeaspects: potatorings boucled the loose laubes of her laudsnarers: her nude cuba stockings were salmospotspeckled: she sported a galligo shimmy of hazevaipar tinto that never was fast till it ran in the washing: stout stays, the rivals, lined her length: her bloodorange bockknickers, a two in one garment, showed natural nigger boggers, fancyfastened, free to undo: her black-stripe tan joseph was sequansewn and teddybearlined, with wavy rushgreen epaulettes and a leadown here and there of royal swansruff: a brace of gaspers stuck in her hayrope garters: her civvy codroy coat with alpheubett buttons was boundaried round with a twobar tunnel belt: a fourpenny bit in each pocketside weighed her safe from the blowaway windrush; she had a clothes-peg tight astride on her joki\u2019s nose and she kep on grinding a sommething quaint in her fiumy mouth and the rrreke of the fluve of the tail of the gawan of her snuffdrab siouler\u2019s skirt trailed ffiffty odd Irish miles behind her lungarhodes.\n\nHellsbells, I\u2019m sorry I missed her! Sweet gumptyum and no-body fainted! But in whelk of her mouths? Was her naze alight? Everyone that saw her said the dowce little delia looked a bit queer. Lotsy trotsy, mind the poddle! Missus, be good and don\u2019t fol in the say! Fenny poor hex she must have charred. Kickhams a frumpier ever you saw! Making mush mullet\u2019s eyes at her boys dobelon. And they crowned her their chariton queen, all the maids. Of the may? You don\u2019t say! Well for her she couldn\u2019t see herself. I recknitz wharfore the darling murrayed her mirror. She did? Mersey me! There was a koros of drouthdropping sur- facemen, boomslanging and plugchewing, fruiteyeing and flower-feeding, in contemplation of the fluctuation and the undification of her filimentation, lolling and leasing on North Lazers\u2019 Waal all eelfare week by the Jukar Yoick\u2019s and as soon as they saw her meander by that marritime way in her grasswinter\u2019s weeds and twigged who was under her archdeaconess bonnet, Avondale\u2019s fish and Clarence\u2019s poison, sedges an to aneber, Wit-upon-Crutches to Master Bates: Between our two southsates and the granite they\u2019re warming, or her face has been lifted or Alp has doped!\n\nBut what was the game in her mixed baggyrhatty? Just the tembo in her tumbo or pilipili from her pepperpot? Saas and taas and specis bizaas. And where in thunder did she plunder? Fore the battle or efter the ball? I want to get it frisk from the soorce. I aubette my bearb it\u2019s worth while poaching on! Shake it up, do, do! That\u2019s a good old son of a ditch! I promise I\u2019ll make it worth your while. And I don\u2019t mean maybe. Nor yet with a goodfor. Spey me pruth and I\u2019ll tale you true.\n\nWell, arundgirond in a waveney lyne aringarouma she pattered and swung and sidled, dribbling her boulder through narrowa mosses, the diliskydrear on our drier side and the vilde vetchvine agin us, curara here, careero there, not knowing which medway or weser to strike it, edereider, making chattahoochee all to her ain chichiu, like Santa Claus at the cree of the pale and puny, nistling to hear for their tiny hearties, her arms encircling Isola-bella, then running with reconciled Romas and Reims, on like a lech to be off like a dart, then bathing Dirty Hans\u2019 spatters with spittle, with a Christmas box apiece for aisch and iveryone of her childer, the birthday gifts they dreamt they gabe her, the spoiled she fleetly laid at our door! On the matt, by the pourch and inunder the cellar. The rivulets ran aflod to see, the glashaboys, the pollynooties. Out of the paunschaup on to the pyre. And they all about her, juvenile leads and ingenuinas, from the slime of their slums and artesaned wellings, rickets and riots, like the Smyly boys at their vicereine\u2019s levee. Vivi vienne, little Annchen! Vielo Anna, high life! Sing us a sula, O, susuria! Ausone sidulcis! Hasn\u2019t she tambre! Chipping her and raising a bit of a chir or a jary every dive she\u2019d neb in her culdee sacco of wabbash she raabed and reach out her maundy meerschaundize, poor souvenir as per ricorder and all for sore aringarung, stinkers and heelers, laggards and primelads, her furzeborn sons and dribblederry daughters, a thousand and one of them, and wickerpotluck for each of them.

That\u2019s what you may call a tale of a tub! And Hi-bernonian market! All that and more under one crinoline enve \u2014 lope if you dare to break the porkbarrel seal. No wonder they\u2019d run from her pison plague. Throw us your hudson soap for the honour of Clane! The wee taste the water left. I\u2019ll raft it back, first thing in the marne. Merced mulde! Ay, and don\u2019t forget the reckitts I lohaned you. You\u2019ve all the swirls your side of the cur-rent. Well, am I to blame for that if I have? Who said you\u2019re to blame for that if you have? You\u2019re a bit on the sharp side. I\u2019m on the wide. Only snuffers\u2019 cornets drifts my way that the cracka dvine chucks out of his cassock, with her estheryear\u2019s marsh narcissus to make him recant his vanitty fair. Foul strips of his chinook\u2019s bible I do be reading, dodwell disgustered but chickled with chuckles at the tittles is drawn on the tattlepage. Senior ga dito: Faciasi Omo! E omo fu fo. Ho! Ho! Senior ga dito: Faciasi Hidamo! Hidamo se ga facess\u2026. Ha! Ha! And Die Windermere Dichter and Lefanu (Sheridan\u2019s) old House by the Coachyard and Mill (J.) On Woman with Ditto on the Floss. Ja, a swamp for Alt-muehler and a stone for his flossies! I know how racy they move his wheel. My hands are blawcauld between isker and suda like that piece of pattern chayney there, lying below. Or where is it? Lying beside the sedge I saw it. Hoangho, my sorrow, I\u2019ve lost it! Aimihi! With that turbary water who could see? So near and yet so far! But O, gihon! I lovat a gabber.

A man and his bride embraced between them. Else I\u2019d have sprinkled and folded them only. And I\u2019ll tie my butcher\u2019s apron here. It\u2019s suety yet. The strollers will pass it by. Six shifts, ten kerchiefs, nine to hold to the fire and this for the code, the convent napkins, twelve, one baby\u2019s shawl. Good mother Jossiph knows, she said. Whose head? Mutter snores? Deataceas! Wharnow are alle her childer, say? In kingdome gone or power to come or gloria be to them farther? Allalivial, allalluvial! Some here, more no more, more again lost alla stranger.

And all the Dun-ders de Dunnes in Markland\u2019s Vineland beyond Brendan\u2019s herring pool takes number nine in yangsee\u2019s hats. And one of Biddy\u2019s beads went bobbing till she rounded up lost histereve with a marigold and a cobbler\u2019s candle in a side strain of a main drain of a manzinahurries off Bachelor\u2019s Walk. But all that\u2019s left to the last of the Meaghers in the loup of the years prefixed and between is one kneebuckle and two hooks in the front. Do you tell me. that now? I do in troth. Orara por Orbe and poor Las Animas! Ussa, Ulla, we\u2019re umbas all! Mezha, didn\u2019t you hear it a deluge of times, ufer and ufer, respund to spond? You deed, you deed! I need, I need!

Is that the great Finnleader himself in his joakimono on his statue riding the high hone there forehengist? Father of Otters, it is himself! Yonne there! Isset that? On Fallareen Common? You\u2019re thinking of Astley\u2019s Amphitheayter where the bobby restrained you making sugarstuck pouts to the ghostwhite horse of the Peppers. Throw the cobwebs from your eyes, woman, and spread your washing proper! It\u2019s well I know your sort of slop. Flap! Ireland sober is Ireland stiff Lord help you, Maria, full of grease, the load is with me! Your prayers. I sonht zo! Madammangut! Were you lifting your elbow, tell us, glazy cheeks, in Conway\u2019s Carrigacurra canteen? Was I what, hobbledyhips? Flop! Your rere gait\u2019s creakorheuman bitts your butts disagrees. Amn\u2019t I up since the damp tawn, marthared mary allacook, with Corri-gan\u2019s pulse and varicoarse veins, my pramaxle smashed, Alice Jane in decline and my oneeyed mongrel twice run over, soaking and bleaching boiler rags, and sweating cold, a widow like me, for to deck my tennis champion son, the laundryman with the lavandier flannels? You won your limpopo limp fron the husky hussars when Collars and Cuffs was heir to the town and your slur gave the stink to Carlow. Holy Scamander, I sar it again! Near the golden falls. Icis on us! Seints of light! Zezere! Subdue your noise, you hamble creature! What is it but a blackburry growth or the dwyergray ass them four old codgers owns. Are you meanam Tarpey and Lyons and Gregory? I meyne now, thank all, the four of them, and the roar of them, that draves that stray in the mist and old Johnny MacDougal along with them. Is that the Poolbeg flasher beyant, pharphar, or a fireboat coasting nyar the Kishtna or a glow I behold within a hedge or my Garry come back from the Indes? Wait till the honeying of the lune, love! Die eve, little eve, die! We see that wonder in your eye. We\u2019ll meet again, we\u2019ll part once more. The spot I\u2019ll seek if the hour you\u2019ll find. My chart shines high where the blue milk\u2019s upset. Forgivemequick, I\u2019m going! Bubye! And you, pluck your watch, forgetmenot. Your evenlode. So save to jurna\u2019s end! My sights are swimming thicker on me by the sha-dows to this place. I sow home slowly now by own way, moy \u2014 valley way. Towy I too, rathmine.\n\nAh, but she was the queer old skeowsha anyhow, Anna Livia, trinkettoes! And sure he was the quare old buntz too, Dear Dirty Dumpling, foostherfather of fingalls and dotthergills. Gammer and gaffer we\u2019re all their gangsters. Hadn\u2019t he seven dams to wive him? And every dam had her seven crutches. And every crutch had its seven hues. And each hue had a differing cry. Sudds for me and supper for you and the doctor\u2019s bill for Joe John. Befor! Bifur! He married his markets, cheap by foul, I know, like any Etrurian Catholic Heathen, in their pinky limony creamy birnies and their turkiss indienne mauves. But at milkidmass who was the spouse? Then all that was was fair. Tys Elvenland! Teems of times and happy returns. The seim anew. Ordovico or viricordo. Anna was, Livia is, Plurabelle\u2019s to be. Northmen\u2019s thing made southfolk\u2019s place but howmulty plurators made eachone in per-son? Latin me that, my trinity scholard, out of eure sanscreed into oure eryan! Hircus Civis Eblanensis! He had buckgoat paps on him, soft ones for orphans. Ho, Lord! Twins of his bosom. Lord save us! And ho! Hey? What all men. Hot? His tittering daugh-ters of. Whawk?\nCan\u2019t hear with the waters of. The chittering waters of. Flittering bats, fieldmice bawk talk. Ho! Are you not gone ahome? What Thom Malone? Can\u2019t hear with bawk of bats, all thim liffeying waters of. Ho, talk save us! My foos won\u2019t moos. I feel as old as yonder elm. A tale told of Shaun or Shem? All Livia\u2019s daughter-sons. Dark hawks hear us. Night! Night! My ho head halls. I feel as heavy as yonder stone. Tell me of John or Shaun? Who were Shem and Shaun the living sons or daughters of? Night now! Tell me, tell me, tell me, elm! Night night! Telmetale of stem or stone. Beside the rivering waters of, hitherandthithering waters of.
