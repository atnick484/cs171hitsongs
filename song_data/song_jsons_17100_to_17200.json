They appealed for support to the Seattle Central Labor Council, which recommended a city-wide strike, and in two weeks 110 locals-mostly American Federation of Labor, only a few IWW-voted to strike. The rank and file of each striking local elected three members to a General Strike Committee, and on February 6, 1939, at 10:00 A.M., the strike began.\n\nUnity was not easy to achieve. The TWW locals were in tension with the AFL locals. Japanese locals were admitted to the General Strike Committee but were not given a vote. Still, sixty thousand union members were out, and forty thousand other workers joined in sympathy.\n\nSeattle workers had a radical tradition. During the war, the president of the Seattle AFL, a socialist, was imprisoned for opposing the draft, was tortured, and there were great labor rallies in the streets to protest.\n\nThe city now stopped functioning, except for activities organized by the strikers to provide essential needs. Firemen agreed to stay on the job. Laundry workers handled only hospital laundry. Vehicles authorized to move carried signs \"Exempted by the General Strike Committee.\" Thirty-five neighborhood milk stations were set up. Every day thirty thousand meals were prepared in large kitchens, then transported to halls all over the city and served cafeteria style, with strikers paying twenty-five cents a meal, the general public thirty-five cents. People were allowed to eat as much as they wanted of the beef stew, spaghetti, bread, and coffee.\n\nA Labor War Veteran's Guard was organized to keep the peace. On the blackboard at one of its headquarters was written: \"The purpose of this organization is to preserve law and order without the use of force. No volunteer will have any police power or be allowed to carry weapons of any sort, but to use persuasion only.\" During the strike, crime in the city decreased. The commander of the U.S. army detachment sent into the area told the strikers' committee that in forty years of military experience he hadn't seen so quiet and orderly a city. A poem printed in the Seattle Union Record (a daily newspaper put out by labor people) by someone named Anise:\nWhat scares them most is\n\nThat NOTHING HAPPENS!\n\nThey are ready For DISTURBANCES.\n\nThey have machine guns\n\nAnd soldiers,\n\nBut this SMILING SILENCE\n\nis uncanny.\n\nThe business men\n\nDon't understand\n\nThat sort of weapon...\n\nIt is your SMILE\n\nThat is UPSETTING\n\nTheir reliance\nOn Artillery, brother!\n\nIt is the garbage wagons\n\nThat go along the street\n\nMarked \"EXEMPT\n\nby STRIKE COMMIITED.\"\n\nIt is the milk stations\n\nThat are getting better daily,\n\nAnd the three hundred\n\nWAR Veterans of Labor\n\nHandling the crowds\n\nWITHOUT GUNS,\n\nFor these things speak\n\nOf a NEW POWER\nAnd a NEW WORLD\n\nThat they do not feel\n\nAt HOME in.\n\nThe mayor swore in 2,400 special deputies, many of them students at the University of Washington. Almost a thousand sailors and marines were brought into the city by the U.S. government. The general strike ended after five days, according to the General Strike Committee because of pressure from the international officers of the various unions, as well as the difficulties of living in a shut-down city.\n\nThe strike had been peaceful. But when it was over, there were raids and arrests: on the Socialist party headquarters, on a printing plant. Thirty-nine members of the IWW were jailed as \"ring- leaders of anarchy.\"\n\nIn Centralia, Washington, where the IWW had been organizing lumber workers, the lumber interests made plans to get rid of the IWW. On November 11, 1919, Armistice Day, the Legion paraded through town with rubber hoses and gas pipes, and the IWW prepared for an attack. When the Legion passed the IWW hall, shots were fired-it is unclear who fired first. They stormed the hall, there was more firing, and three Legion men were killed.\n\nInside the headquarters was an IWW member, a lumberjack named Frank Everett, who had been in France as a soldier while the IWW national leaders were on trial for obstructing the war effort. Everett was in army uniform and carrying a rifle. He emptied it into the crowd, dropped it, and ran for the woods, followed by a mob. He started to wade across the river, found the current too strong, turned, shot the leading man dead, threw his gun into the river, and fought the mob with his fists. They dragged him back to town behind an automobile, suspended him from a telegraph pole, took him down, locked him in jail. That night, his jailhouse door was broken down, he was dragged out, put on the floor of a car, his genitals were cut off, and then he was taken to a bridge, hanged, and his body riddled with bullets.\n\nNo one was ever arrested for Everett's murder, but eleven Wobblies were put on trial for killing an American Legion leader during the parade, and six of them spent fifteen years in prison.\n\nWhy such a reaction to the general strike, to the organizing of the Wobblies? A statement by the mayor of Seattle suggests that the Establishment feared not just the strike itself but what it symbolized. He said:\n\nThe so-called sympathetic Seattle strike was an attempted revolution. That there was no violence does not alter the fact. .. . The intent, openly and covertly announced, was for the overthrow of the industrial system; here first, then everywhere. .. . True, there were no flashing guns, no bombs, no killings. Revolution, I repeat, doesn't need violence. The general strike, as practiced in Seattle, is of itself the weapon of revolution, all the more dangerous because quiet. To succeed, it must suspend everything; stop the entire life stream of a community. . .. That is to say, it puts the government out of operation. And that is all there is to revolt-no matter how achieved.\n\nFurthermore, the Seattle general strike took place in the midst of a wave of postwar rebellions all over the world. A writer in The Nation commented that year:\n\nThe most extraordinary phenomenon of the present time ... is the unprecedented revolt of the rank and file...\n\nIn Russia it has dethroned the Czar.... In Korea and India and Egypt and Ireland it keeps up an unyielding resistance to political tyranny. In England it brought about the railway strike, against the judgement of the men's own executives. In Seattle and San Francisco it has resulted in the stevedores' recent refusal to handle arms or supplies destined for the overthrow of the Soviet Government. In one district of Illinois it manifested itself in a resolution of striking miners, unanimously requesting their state executive \"to go to Hell\". In Pittsburgh, according to Mr. Gompers, it compelled the reluctant American Federation officers to call the steel strike, lest the control pass into the hands of the I.W.W.'s and other \"radicals\". In New York, it brought about the longshoremen's strike and kept the men out in defiance of union officials, and caused the upheaval in the printing trade, which the international officers, even though the employers worked hand in glove with them, were completely unable to control.\n\nThe common man .. . losing faith in the old leadership, has experienced a new access of self- confidence, or at least a new recklessness, a readiness to take chances on his own account . .. authority cannot any longer be imposed from above; it comes automatically from below.\n\nIn the steel mills of western Pennsylvania later in 1919, where men worked twelve hours a day, six days a week, doing exhausting work under intense heat, 100,000 steelworkers were signed up in twenty different AFL craft unions. A National Committee attempting to tie them together in their organizing drive found in the summer of 1919 \"the men are letting it be known that if we do not do something for them they will take the matter into their own hands.\"\n\nThe National Council was getting telegrams like the one from the Johnstown Steel Workers Council: \"Unless the National Committee authorizes a national strike vote to be taken this week we will be compelled to go on strike here alone.\" William Z. Foster (later a Communist leader, at this time secretary-treasurer to the National Committee in charge of organizing) received a telegram from organizers in the Youngstown district: \"We cannot he expected to meet the enraged workers, who will consider us traitors if strike is postponed.\"\n\nThere was pressure from President Woodrow Wilson and Samuel Gompers, AFL president, to postpone the strike. But the steelworkers were too insistent, and in September 1919, not only the 100,000 union men but 250,000 others went out on strike.\n\nThe sheriff of Allegheny County swore in as deputies five thousand employees of U.S. Steel who had not gone on strike, and announced that outdoor meetings would be forbidden. A report of the Interchurch World Movement made at the time said:\n\nIn Monessen .. . the policy of the State Police was simply to club men off the streets and drive them into their homes.... In Braddock .. . when a striker was clubbed in the street he would be taken to jail, kept there over night . . . Many of those arrested in Newcastle .. . were ordered not to be released until the strike was over.\n\nThe Department of Justice moved in, carrying out raids on workers who were aliens, holding them for deportation. At Gary, Indiana, federal troops were sent in.\n\nOther factors operated against the strikers. Most were recent immigrants, of many nationalities, many languages. Sherman Service, Inc., hired by the steel corporations to break the strike, instructed its men in South Chicago: \"We want you to stir up as much bad feeling as you possibly can between the Serbians and the Italians. Spread data among the Serbians that the Italians are going back to work.... Urge them to go back to work or the Italians will get their jobs.\" More than thirty thousand black workers were brought into the area as strikebreakers-they had been excluded from AFL unions and so felt no loyalty to unionism.\n\nAs the strike dragged on, the mood of defeat spread, and workers began to drift hack to work. After ten weeks, the number of strikers was down to 110,000, and then the National Committee called the strike off.\n\nIn the year following the war, 120,000 textile workers struck in New England and New Jersey, and 30,000 silk workers struck in Paterson, New Jersey. In Boston the police went out on strike, and in New York City cigarmakers, shirtmakers, carpenters, bakers, teamsters, and barbers were out on strike. In Chicago, the press reported, \"More strikes and lockouts accompany the mid-summer heat than ever known before at any one time.\" Five thousand workers at International Harvester and five thousand city workers were in the streets.\n\nWhen the twenties began, however, the situation seemed under control. The IWW was destroyed, the Socialist party falling apart. The strikes were beaten down by force, and the economy was doing just well enough for just enough people to prevent mass rebellion.\n\nCongress, in the twenties, put an end to the dangerous, turbulent flood of immigrants (14 million between 1900 and 1920) by passing laws setting immigration quotas: the quotas favored Anglo- Saxons, kept out black and yellow people, limited severely the coming of Latins, Slavs, Jews. No African country could send more than 100 people; 100 was the limit for China, for Bulgaria, for Palestine; 34,007 could come from England or Northern Ireland, but only 3,845 from Italy; 51,227 from Germany, but only 124 from Lithuania; 28,567 from the Irish Free State, but only 2,248 from Russia.\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan was revived in the 1920s, and it spread into the North. By 1924 it had 4M million members. The NAACP seemed helpless in the face of mob violence and race hatred everywhere. The impossibility of the black persons ever being considered equal in white America was the theme of the nationalist movement led in the 1920s by Marcus Garvey. He preached black pride, racial separation, and a return to Africa, which to him held the only hope for black unity and survival. But Garvey's movement, inspiring as it was to some blacks, could not make much headway against the powerful white supremacy currents of the postwar decade.\n\nThere was some truth to the standard picture of the twenties as a time of prosperity and fun-the Jazz Age, the Roaring Twenties. Unemployment was down, from 4,270,000 in 1921 to a little over 2 million in 1927. The general level of wages for workers rose. Some farmers made a lot of money. The 40 percent of all families who made over $2,000 a year could buy new gadgets: autos, radios, refrigerators. Millions of people were not doing badly-and they could be shut out of the picture the others-the tenant farmers, black and white, the immigrant families in the big cities either without work or not making enough to get the basic necessities.\n\nBut prosperity was concentrated at the top. While from 1922 to 1929 real wages in manufacturing went up per capita 1.4 percent a year, the holders of common stocks gained 16.4 percent a year. Six million families (42 percent of the total) made less than $1,000 a year. One-tenth of 1 percent of the families at the top received as much income as 42 percent of the families at the bottom, according to a report of the Brookings Institution. Every year in the 1920s, about 25,000 workers were killed on the job and 100,000 permanently disabled. Two million people in New York City lived in tenements condemned as rattraps.\n\nThe country was full of little industrial towns like Muncie, Indiana, where, according to Robert and Helen Lynd (Middletown), the class system was revealed by the time people got up in the morning: for two-thirds of the city's families, \"the father gets up in the dark in winter, eats hastily in the kitchen in the gray dawn, and is at work from an hour to two and a quarter hours before his children have to be at school.\"\n\nThere were enough well-off people to push the others into the background. And with the rich controlling the means of dispensing information, who would tell? Historian Merle Curti observed about the twenties:\n\nIt was, in fact, only the upper ten percent of the population that enjoyed a marked increase in real income. But the protests which such facts normally have evoked could not make themselves widely or effectively felt. This was in part the result of the grand strategy of the major political parties. In part it was the result of the fact that almost all the chief avenues to mass opinion were now controlled by large-scale publishing industries.\n\nSome writers tried to break through: Theodore Dreiser, Sinclair Lewis, Lewis Mumford. F. Scott Fitzgerald, in an article, \"Echoes of the Jazz Age,\" said: \"It was borrowed time anyway-the whole upper tenth of a nation living with the insouciance of a grand due and the casualness of chorus girls.\" He saw ominous signs amid that prosperity: drunkenness, unhappiness, violence:\n\nA classmate killed his wife and himself on Long Island, another tumbled \"accidentally\" from a skyscraper in Philadelphia, another purposely from a skyscraper in New York. One was killed in a speak-easy in Chicago; another was beaten to death in a speak-easy in New York and crawled home to the Princeton Club to die; still another had his skull crushed by a maniac's axe in an insane asylum where he was confined.\n\nSinclair Lewis captured the false sense of prosperity, the shallow pleasure of the new gadgets for the middle classes, in his novel Babbitt:\n\nIt was the best of nationally advertised and quantitatively produced alarm-clocks, with all modern attachments, including cathedral chime, intermittent alarm, and a phosphorescent dial. Babbitt was proud of being awakened by such a rich device. Socially it was almost as creditable as buying expensive cord tires.\n\nHe sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape, but he lay and detested the grind of the real-estate business, and disliked his family, and disliked himself for disliking them.\n\nWomen had finally, after long agitation, won the right to vote in 1920 with the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, but voting was still a middle-class and upper-class activity. Eleanor Flexner, recounting the history of the movement, says the effect of female suffrage was that \"women have shown the same tendency to divide along orthodox party lines as male voters.\"\n\nFew political figures spoke out for the poor of the twenties. One was Fiorello La Guardia, a Congressman from a district of poor immigrants in East Harlem (who ran, oddly, on both Socialist and Republican tickets). In the mid-twenties he was made aware by people in his district of the high price of meat. When La Guardia asked Secretary of Agriculture William Jardine to investigate the high price of meat, the Secretary sent him a pamphlet on how to use meat economically. La Guardia wrote back:\n\nI asked for help and you send me a bulletin. The people of New York City cannot feed their children on Department bulletins.. .. Your bulletins . .. are of no use to the tenement dwellers of this great city. The housewives of New York have been trained by hard experience on the economical use of meat. What we want is the help of your department on the meat profiteers who are keeping the hard-working people of this city from obtaining proper nourishment.\n\nDuring the presidencies of Harding and Coolidge in the twenties, the Secretary of the Treasury was Andrew Mellon, one of the richest men in America. In 1923, Congress was presented with the \"Mellon Plan,\" calling for what looked like a general reduction of income taxes, except that the top income brackets would have their tax rates lowered from 50 percent to 25 percent, while the lowest-income group would have theirs lowered from 4 percent to 3 percent. A few Congressmen from working-class districts spoke against the bill, like William P. Connery of Massachusetts:\n\nI am not going to have my people who work in the shoe factories of Lynn and in the mills in Lawrence and the leather industry of Peabody, in these days of so-called Republican prosperity when they are working but three days in the week think that I am in accord with the provisions of this bill. . .. When I see a provision in this Mellon tax bill which is going to save Mr. Mellon himself $800,000 on his income tax and his brother $600,000 on his, I cannot give it my support.\n\nThe Mellon Plan passed. In 1928, La Guardia toured the poorer districts of New York and said: \"I confess I was not prepared for what I actually saw. It seemed almost incredible that such conditions of poverty could really exist.\"\n\nBuried in the general news of prosperity in the twenties were, from time to time, stories of bitter labor struggles. In 1922, coal miners and railroad men went on strike, and Senator Burton Wheeler of Montana, a Progressive elected with labor votes, visited the strike area and reported:\n\nAll day long I have listened to heartrending stories of women evicted from their homes by the coal companies. I heard pitiful pleas of little children crying for bread. I stood aghast as I heard most amazing stories from men brutally beaten by private policemen. It has been a shocking and nerve- racking experience.\n\nA textile strike in Rhode Island in 1922 among Italian and Portuguese workers failed, but class feelings were awakened and some of the strikers joined radical movements. Luigi Nardella recalled:\n\n... my oldest brother, Guido, he started the strike. Guido pulled the handles on the looms in the Royal Mills, going from one section to the next shouting, \"Strike! Strike!\" . . . When the strike started we didn't have any union organizers... .. We got together a group of girls and went from mill to mill, and that morning we got five mills out. We'd motion to the girls in the mills, \"Come out! Come out!\" Then we'd go on to the next. . . .\n\nSomebody from the Young Workers' League came out to bring a check, and invited me to a meeting, and I went. Then I joined, and in a few years I was in the Risorgimento Club in Providence. We were anti-Fascists. I spoke on street corners, bring a stand, jump up and talk to good crowds. And we led the support for Sacco and Vanzetti.. . .\n\nAfter the war, with the Socialist party weakened, a Communist party was organized, and Communists were involved in the organization of the Trade Union Education League, which tried to build a militant spirit inside the AFL. When a Communist named Ben Gold, of the furriers' section of the TUEL, challenged the AFL union leadership at a meeting, he was knifed and beaten. In 1926, he and other Communists organized a strike of furriers who formed mass picket lines, battled the police to hold their lines, were arrested and beaten, but kept striking, until they won a forty-hour week and a wage increase.\n\nCommunists again played a leading part in the great textile strike that spread through the Carolinas and Tennessee in the spring of 1929. The mill owners had moved to the South to escape unions, to find more subservient workers among the poor whites. But these workers rebelled against the long hours, the low pay. They particularly resented the \"stretch-out\"-an intensification of work. For instance, -a weaver who had operated twenty-four looms and got $18.91 a week would be raised to $23, but he would be \"stretched out\" to a hundred looms and had to work at a punishing pace.\n\nThe first of the textile strikes was in Tennessee, where five hundred women in one mill walked out in protest against wages of $9 to $10 a week. Then at Gastonia, North Carolina, workers joined a new union, the National Textile Workers Union, led by Communists, which admitted both blacks and whites to membership. When some of them were fired, half of the two thousand workers went out on strike. An atmosphere of anti-Communism and racism built up and violence began. Textile strikes began to spread across South Carolina.\n\nOne by one the various strikes were settled, with some gains, but not at Gastonia. There, with the textile workers living in a tent colony, and refusing to renounce the Communists in their leadership, the strike went on. But strikebreakers were brought in and the mills kept operating. Desperation grew; there were violent clashes with the police. One dark night, the chief of police was killed in a gun battle and sixteen strikers and sympathizers were indicted for murder, including Fred Real, a Communist party organizer. Ultimately seven were tried and given sentences of from five to twenty years. They were released on bail, and left the state; the Communists escaped to Soviet Russia. Through all the defeats, the beatings, the murders, however, it was the beginning of textile mill unionism in the South.\n\nThe stock market crash of 1929, which marked the beginning of the Great Depression of the United States, came directly from wild speculation which collapsed and brought the whole economy down with it. But, as John Galbraith says in his study of that event (The Great Crash), behind that speculation was the fact that \"the economy was fundamentally unsound.\" He points to very unhealthy corporate and banking structures, an unsound foreign trade, much economic misinformation, and the \"bad distribution of income\" (the highest 5 percent of the population received about one-third of all personal income).\n\nA socialist critic would go further and say that the capitalist system was by its nature unsound: a system driven by the one overriding motive of corporate profit and therefore unstable, unpredictable, and blind to human needs. The result of all that: permanent depression for many of its people, and periodic crises for almost everybody. Capitalism, despite its attempts at self-reform, its organization for better control, was still in 1929 a sick and undependable system.\n\nAfter the crash, the economy was stunned, barely moving. Over five thousand banks closed and huge numbers of businesses, unable to get money, closed too. Those that continued laid off employees and cut the wages of those who remained, again and again. Industrial production fell by 50 percent, and by 1933 perhaps 15 million (no one knew exactly)- one-fourth or one-third of the labor force-were out of work. The Ford Motor Company, which in the spring of 1929 had employed 128,000 workers, was down to 37,000 by August of 1931. By the end of 1930, almost half the 280,000 textile mill workers in New England were out of work. Former President Calvin Coolidge commented with his customary wisdom: \"When more and more people are thrown out of work, unemployment results.\" He spoke again in early 1931, \"This country is not in good condition.\"\n\nClearly those responsible for organizing the economy did not know what had happened, were baffled by it, refused to recognize it, and found reasons other than the failure of the system. Herbert Hoover had said, not long before the crash: \"We in America today are nearer to the final triumph over poverty than ever before in the history of any land.\" Henry Ford, in March 1931, said the crisis was here because \"the average man won't really do a day's work unless he is caught and cannot get out of it. There is plenty of work to do if people would do it.\" A few weeks later he laid off 75,000 workers.\n\nThere were millions of tons of food around, but it was not profitable to transport it, to sell it. Warehouses were full of clothing, but people could not afford it. There were lots of houses, but they stayed empty because people couldn't pay the rent, had been evicted, and now lived in shacks in quickly formed \"Hoovervilles\" built on garbage dumps.\n\nBrief glimpses of reality in the newspapers could have been multiplied by the millions: A New York Times story in early 1932:\n\nAfter vainly trying to get a stay of dispossession until January 15 from his apartment at 46 Hancock Street in Brooklyn, yesterday, Peter J. Cornell, 48 years old, a former roofing contractor out of work and penniless, fell dead in the arms of his wife.\n\nA doctor gave the cause of his death as heart disease, and the police said it had at least partly been caused by the bitter disappointment of a long day's fruitless attempt to prevent himself and his family being put out on the street... .\n\nCornell owed $5 in rent in arrears and $39 for January which his landlord required in advance. Failure to produce the money resulted in a dispossess order being served on the family yesterday and to take effect at the end of the week.\n\nAfter vainly seeking assistance elsewhere, he was told during the day by the Home Relief Bureau that it would have no funds with which to help him until January 15.\n\nA dispatch from Wisconsin to The Nation, in late 1932:\n\nThroughout the middle west the tension between the farmers and authorities has been growing ... as a result of tax and foreclosure sales. In many cases evictions have been prevented only by mass action on the part of the farmers. However, until the Cichon homestead near Elkhorn, Wisconsin, was besieged on December 6 by a host of deputy sheriffs armed with machine-guns, rifles, shotguns, and tear-gas bombs, there had been no actual violence. Max Cichon's property was auctioned off at a foreclosure sale last August, but he refused to allow either the buyer or the authorities to approach his home. He held off unwelcome visitors with a shotgun. The sheriff called upon Cichon to submit peacefully. When he refused to do so, the sheriff ordered deputies to lay down a barrage of machine-gun and rifle fire . . . Cichon is now in jail in Elkhorn, and his wife and two children, who were with him in the house, are being cared for in the county hospital. Cichon is not a trouble-maker. He enjoys the confidence of his neighbors, who only recently elected him justice of the peace of the town of Sugar Creek. That a man of his standing and disposition should go to such lengths in defying the authorities is a clear warning that we may expect further trouble in the agricultural districts unless the farmers are soon helped.\n\nA tenement dweller on 113th Street in East Harlem wrote to Congressman Fiorello La Guardia in Washington:\n\nYou know my condition is bad. I used to get pension from the government and they stopped. It is now nearly seven months I am out of work. I hope you will try to do something for me.. .. I have four children who are in need of clothes and food.. .. My daughter who is eight is very ill and not recovering. My rent is due two months and I am afraid of being put out.\n\nIn Oklahoma, the farmers found their farms sold under the auctioneer's hammer, their farms turning to dust, the tractors coming in and taking over. John Steinbeck, in his novel of the depression, The Grapes of Wrath, describes what happened:\n\nAnd the dispossessed, the migrants, flowed into California, two hundred and fifty thousand, and three hundred thousand. Behind them new tractors were going on the land and the tenants were being forced off. And new waves were on the way, new waves of the dispossessed and the homeless, hard, intent, and dangerous. . ..\n\nAnd a homeless hungry man, driving the road with his wife beside him and his thin children in the back seat, could look at the fallow fields which might produce food but not profit, and that man could know how a fallow field is a sin and the unused land a crime against the thin children.. . .\n\nAnd in the south he saw the golden oranges hanging on the trees, the little golden oranges on the dark green trees; and guards with shotguns patrolling the lines so a man might not pick an orange for a thin child, oranges to be dumped if the price was low. . , .\n\nThese people were becoming \"dangerous,\" as Steinbeck said. The spirit of rebellion was growing. Mauritz Hallgren, in a 1933 book, Seeds of Revolt, compiled newspaper reports of things happening around the country:\n\nEngland, Arkansas, January 3, 1931. The long drought that ruined hundreds of Arkansas farms last summer had a dramatic sequel late today when some 500 farmers, most of them white men and many of them armed, marched on the business section of this town. .. . Shouting that they must have food for themselves and their families, the invaders announced their intention to take it from the stores unless it were provided from some other source without cost.\n\nDetroit, July 9, 1931. An incipient riot by 500 unemployed men turned out of the city lodging house for lack of funds was quelled by police reserves in Cadillac Square tonight. . ..\n\nIndiana Harbor, Indiana, August 5, 1931. Fifteen hundred jobless men stormed the plant of the Fruit Growers Express Company here, demanding that they be given jobs to keep from starving. The company's answer was to call the city police, who routed the jobless with menacing clubs.\n\nBoston, November 10, 1931. Twenty persons were treated for injuries, three were hurt so seriously that they may die, and dozens of others were nursing wounds from flying bottles, lead pipe, and stones after clashes between striking longshoremen and Negro strikebreakers along the Charlestown-East Boston waterfront.\n\nDetroit, November 28, 1931. A mounted patrolman was hit on the head with a stone and unhorsed and one demonstrator was arrested during a disturbance in Grand Circus Park this morning when 2000 men and women met there in defiance of police orders.\n\nChicago, April 1, 1932. Five hundred school children, most with haggard faces and in tattered clothes, paraded through Chicago's downtown section to the Board of Education offices to demand that the school system provide them with food.\n\nBoston, June 3, 1932. Twenty-five hungry children raided a buffet lunch set up for Spanish War veterans during a Boston parade. Two automobile-loads of police were called to drive them away.\n\nNew York, January 21, 1933. Several hundred jobless surrounded a restaurant just off Union Square today demanding they be fed without charge.. . .\n\nSeattle, February 16, 1933. A two-day siege of the County-City Building, occupied by an army of about 5,000 unemployed, was ended early tonight, deputy sheriffs and police evicting the demonstrators after nearly two hours of efforts.\n\nYip Harburg, the songwriter, told Studs Terkel about the year 1932: \"I was walking along the street at that time, and you'd see the bread lines. The biggest one in New York City was owned by William Randolph Hearst. He had a big truck with several people on it, and big cauldrons of hot soup, bread. Fellows with burlap on their feet were lined up all around Columbus Circle, and went for blocks and blocks around the park, waiting.\" Harburg had to write a song for the show Americana. He wrote \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\"\n\nOnce in khaki suits.\n\nGee, we looked swell,\n\nFull of that Yankee Doodle-de-dum.\n\nHalf a million boots went sloggin' through Hell,\n\nI was the kid with the drum.\n\nSay, don't you remember, they called me Al-\n\nIt was Al all the time.\n\nSay, don't you remember I'm your pal-\n\nBrother, can you spare a dime?\n\nIt was not just a song of despair. As Yip Harburg told Terkel:\n\nIn the song the man is really saying: I made an investment in this country. Where the hell are my dividends? ... It's more than just a bit of pathos. It doesn't reduce him to a beggar. It makes him a dignified human, asking questions-and a bit outraged, too, as he should be.\n\nThe anger of the veteran of the First World War, now without work, his family hungry, led to the march of the Bonus Army to Washington in the spring and summer of 1932. War veterans, holding government bonus certificates which were due years in the future, demanded that Congress pay off on them now, when the money was desperately needed. And so they began to move to Washington from all over the country, with wives and children or alone. They came in broken-down old autos, stealing rides on freight trains, or hitchhiking. They were miners from West Virginia, sheet metal workers from Columbus, Georgia, and unemployed Polish veterans from Chicago. One family- husband, wife, three-year-old boy-spent three months on freight trains coming from California. Chief Running Wolf, a jobless Mescalero Indian from New Mexico, showed up in full Indian dress, with bow and arrow.\n\nMore than twenty thousand came. Most camped across the Potomac River from the Capitol on Anacostia Flats where, as John Dos Passos wrote, \"the men are sleeping in little lean-tos built out of old newspapers, cardboard boxes, packing crates, bits of tin or tarpaper roofing, every kind of cockeyed makeshift shelter from the rain scraped together out of the city dump.\" The bill to pay off on the bonus passed the House, but was defeated in the Senate, and some veterans, discouraged, left. Most stayed-some encamped in government buildings near the Capitol, the rest on Anacostia Flats, and President Hoover ordered the army to evict them.\n\nFour troops of cavalry, four companies of infantry, a machine gun squadron, and six tanks assembled near the White House. General Douglas MacArthur was in charge of the operation, Major Dwight Eisenhower his aide. George S. Patton was one of the officers. MacArthur led his troops down Pennsylvania Avenue, used tear gas to clear veterans out of the old buildings, and set the buildings on fire. Then the army moved across the bridge to Anacostia. Thousands of veterans, wives, children, began to run as the tear gas spread. The soldiers set fire to some of the huts, and soon the whole encampment was ablaze. When it was all over, two veterans had been shot to death, an eleven-week-old baby had died, an eight-year-old boy was partially blinded by gas, two police had fractured skulls, and a thousand veterans were injured by gas.\n\nThe hard, hard times, the inaction of the government in helping, the action of the government in dispersing war veterans-all had their effect on the election of November 1932. Democratic party candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover overwhelmingly, took office in the spring of 1933, and began a program of reform legislation which became famous as the \"New Deal.\" When a small veterans' march on Washington took place early in his administration, he greeted them and provided coffee; they met with one of his aides and went home. It was a sign of Roosevelt's approach.\n\nThe Roosevelt reforms went far beyond previous legislation. They had to meet two pressing needs: to reorganize capitalism in such a way to overcome the crisis and stabilize the system; also, to head off the alarming growth of spontaneous rebellion in the early years of the Roosevelt administration- organization of tenants and the unemployed, movements of self-help, general strikes in several cities.\n\nThat first objective-to stabilize the system for its own protection- was most obvious in the major law of Roosevelt's first months in office, the National Recovery Act (NRA). It was designed to take control of the economy through a series of codes agreed on by management, labor, and the government, fixing prices and wages, limiting competition. From the first, the NRA was dominated by big businesses and served their interests. As Bernard Bellush says (The Failure of the N.R.A.), its Title I, it turned much of the nation's power over to highly organized, well-financed trade associations and industrial combines. The unorganized public, otherwise known as the consumer, along with the members of the fledgling trade-union movement, had virtually nothing to say about the initial organization of the National Recovery Administration, or the formulation of basic policy.\"\n\nWhere organized labor was strong, Roosevelt moved to make some concessions to working people. But: \"Where organized labor was weak, Roosevelt was unprepared to withstand the pressures of industrial spokesmen to control the . . . NRA codes.\" Barton Bernstein (Towards a New Past) confirms this: \"Despite the annoyance of some big businessmen with Section 7a, the NRA reaffirmed and consolidated their power. . . .\" Bellush sums up his view of the NRA:\n\nThe White House permitted the National Association of Manufacturers, the Chamber of Commerce, and allied business and trade associations to assume overriding authority... . Indeed, private administration became public administration, and private government became public government, insuring the marriage of capitalism with statism.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court in 1935 declared the NRA unconstitutional, it claimed it gave too much power to the President, but, according to Bellush, \". . . FDR surrendered an inordinate share of the power of government, through the NRA, to industrial spokesmen throughout the country.\"\n\nAlso passed in the first months of the new administration, the AAA (Agricultural Adjustment Administration) was an attempt to organize agriculture. It favored the larger farmers as the NRA favored big business. The TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) was an unusual entrance of government into business-a government-owned network of dams and hydroelectric plants to control floods and produce electric power in the Tennessee Valley. It gave jobs to the unemployed, helped the consumer with lower electric rates, and in some respect deserved the accusation that it was \"socialistic.\" But the New Deal's organization of the economy was aimed mainly at stabilizing the economy, and secondly at giving enough help to the lower classes to keep them from turning a rebellion into a real revolution.\n\nThat rebellion was real when Roosevelt took office:. Desperate people were not waiting for the government to help them; they were helping themselves, acting directly. Aunt Molly Jackson, a woman who later became active in labor struggles in Appalachia, recalled how she walked into the local store, asked for a 24-pound sack of flour, gave it to her little boy to take it outside, then filled a sack of sugar and said to the storekeeper, \"Well, I'll see you in ninety days. I have to feed some children . . . I'll pay you, don't worry.\" And when he objected, she pulled out her pistol (which, as a midwife traveling alone through the hills, she had a permit to carry) and said: \"Martin, if you try to take this grub away from me, God knows that if they electrocute me for it tomorrow, I'll shoot you six times in a minute.\" Then, as she recalls, \"I walked out, I got home, and these seven children was so hungry that they was a-grabbin the raw dough off-a their mother's hands and crammin it into their mouths and swallowing it whole.\"\n\nAll over the country, people organized spontaneously to stop evictions, in New York, in Chicago, in other cities-when word spread that someone was being evicted, a crowd would gather; the police would remove the furniture from the house, put it out in the street, and the crowd would bring the furniture back. The Communist party was active in organizing Workers Alliance groups in the cities. Mrs. Willye Jeffries, a black woman, told Studs Terkel about evictions:\n\nA lot of 'em was put out. They'd call and have the bailiffs come and sit them out, and as soon as they'd leave, we would put 'em back where they came out. All we had to do was call Brother Hilton. .. . Look, such and such a place, there's a family sittin' out there. Everybody passed through the neighborhood, was a member of the Workers Alliance, had one person they would call. When that one person came, he'd have about fifty people with him... . Take that stuff right on back up there. The men would connect those lights and go to the hardware and get gas pipe, and connect that stove back. Put the furniture back just like you had it, so it don't look like you been out the door.\n\nUnemployed Councils were formed all over the country. They were described by Charles R. Walker, writing in The Forum in 1932:\n\nI find it is no secret that Communists organize Unemployed Councils in most cities and usually lead them, but the councils are organized democratically and the majority rules. In one I visited at Lincoln Park, Michigan, there were three hundred members of which eleven were Communists... . The Council had a right wing, a left wing, and a center. The chairman of the Council ... was also the local commander of the American Legion. In Chicago there are 45 branches of the Unemployed Council, with a total membership of 22,000.\n\nThe Council's weapon is democratic force of numbers, and their function is to prevent evictions of the destitute, or if evicted to bring pressure to bear on the Relief Commission to find a new home; if an unemployed worker has his gas or his water turned off because he can't pay for it, to see the proper authorities; to see that the unemployed who are shoeless and clothesless get both; to eliminate through publicity and pressure discriminations between Negroes and white persons, or against the foreign born, in matters of relief ... to march people down to relief headquarters and demand they be fed and clothed. Finally to provide legal defense for all unemployed arrested for joining parades, hunger marches, or attending union meetings.\n\nPeople organized to help themselves, since business and government were not helping them in 1931 and 1932. In Seattle, the fishermen's union caught fish and exchanged them with people who picked fruit and vegetables, and those who cut wood exchanged that. There were twenty-two locals, each with a commissary where food and firewood were exchanged for other goods and services: barbers, seamstresses, and doctors gave of their skills in return for other things. By the end of 1932, there were 330 self-help organizations in thirty-seven states, with over 300,000 members. By early 1933, they seem to have collapsed; they were attempting too big a job in an economy that was more and more a shambles.\n\nPerhaps the most remarkable example of self-help took place in the coal district of Pennsylvania, where teams of unemployed miners dug small mines on company property, mined coal, trucked it to cities, and sold it below the commercial rate. By 1934, 5 million tons of this \"bootleg\" coal were produced by twenty thousand men using four thousand vehicles. When attempts were made to prosecute, local juries would not convict, local jailers would not imprison.\n\nThese were simple actions, taken out of practical need, but they had revolutionary possibilities. Paul Mattick, a Marxist writer, commented:\n\nAll that is really necessary for the workers to do in order to end their miseries is to perform such simple things as to take from where there is, without regard to established property principles or social philosophies, and to start to produce for themselves. Done on a broad social scale, it will lead to lasting results; on a local, isolated plane it will be ... defeated. ... The bootleg miners have shown in a rather clear and impressive way, that the so-much bewailed absence of a socialist ideology on the part of the workers really does not prevent workers from acting quite anticapitalistically, quite in accordance with their own needs. Breaking through the confines of private property in order to live up to their own necessities, the miners' action is, at the same time a manifestation of the most important part of class consciousness- namely, that the problems of the workers can be solved only by themselves.\n\nWere the New Dealers-Roosevelt and his advisers, the businessmen who supported him-also class- conscious? Did they understand that measures must be quickly taken, in 1933 and 1934, to give jobs, food baskets, relief, to wipe out the idea \"that the problems of the workers can be solved only by themselves\"? Perhaps, like the workers' class consciousness, it was a set of actions arising not from held theory, but from instinctive practical necessity.\n\nPerhaps it was such a consciousness that led to the Wagner-Connery Bill, introduced in Congress in early 1934, to regulate labor disputes. The bill provided elections for union representation, a board to settle problems and handle grievances. Was this not exactly the kind of legislation to do away with the idea that \"the problems of the workers can be solved only by themselves\"? Big business thought it was too helpful to labor and opposed it. Roosevelt was cool to it. But in the year 1934 a series of labor outbursts suggested the need for legislative action.\n\nA million and a half workers in different industries went on strike in 1934. That spring and summer, longshoremen on the West Coast, in a rank-and-file insurrection against their own union leadership as well as against the shippers, held a convention, demanded the abolition of the shape- up (a kind of early-morning slave market where work gangs were chosen for the day), and went out on strike.\n\nTwo thousand miles of Pacific coastline were quickly tied up. The teamsters cooperated, refusing to truck cargo to the piers, and maritime workers joined the strike. When the police moved in to open the piers, the strikers resisted en masse, and two were killed by police gunfire. A mass funeral procession for the strikers brought together tens of thousands of supporters. And then a general strike was called in San Francisco, with 130,000 workers out, the city immobilized.\n\nFive hundred special police were sworn in and 4,500 National Guardsmen assembled, with infantry, machine gun, tank and artillery units. The Los Angeles Times wrote:\n\nThe situation in San Francisco is not correctly described by the phrase \"general strike.\" What is actually in progress there is an insurrection, a Communist-inspired and -led revolt against organized government. There is but one thing to be done-put down the revolt with any force necessary.\n\nThe pressure became too strong. There were the troops. There was the AFL pushing to end the strike. The longshoremen accepted a compromise settlement. But they had shown the potential of a general strike.\n\nThat same summer of 1934, a strike of teamsters in Minneapolis was supported by other working people, and soon nothing was moving in the city except milk, ice, and coal trucks given exemptions by the strikers. Farmers drove their products into town and sold them directly to the people in the city. The police attacked and two strikers were killed. Fifty thousand people attended a mass funeral. There was an enormous protest meeting and a march on City Hall. After a month, the employers gave in to the teamsters' demands.\n\nIn the fall of that same year, 1934, came the largest strike of all- 325,000 textile workers in the South. They left the mills and set up flying squadrons in trucks and autos to move through the strike areas, picketing, battling guards, entering the mills, unbelting machinery. Here too, as in the other cases, the strike impetus came from the rank and file, against a reluctant union leadership at the top. The New York Times said: \"The grave danger of the situation is that it will get completely out of the hands of the leaders.\"\n\nAgain, the machinery of the state was set in motion. Deputies and armed strikebreakers in South Carolina fired on pickets, killing seven, wounding twenty others. But the strike was spreading to New England. In Lowell, Massachusetts, 2,500 textile workers rioted; in Saylesville, Rhode Island, a crowd of five thousand people defied state troopers who were armed with machine guns, and shut down the textile mill. In Woonsocket, Rhode Island, two thousand people, aroused because someone had been shot and killed by the National Guard, stormed through the town and closed the mill.\n\nBy September 18, 421,000 textile workers were on strike throughout the country. There were mass arrests, organizers were beaten, and the death toll rose to thirteen. Roosevelt now stepped in and set up a board of mediation, and the union called off the strike.\n\nIn the rural South, too, organizing took place, often stimulated by Communists, but nourished by the grievances of poor whites and blacks who were tenant farmers or farm laborers, always in economic difficulties but hit even harder by the Depression. The Southern Tenant Farmers Union started in Arkansas, with black and white sharecroppers, and spread to other areas. Roosevelt's AAA was not helping the poorest of farmers; in fact by encouraging farmers to plant less, it forced tenants and sharecroppers to leave the land. By 1935, of 6,800,000 farmers, 2,800,000 were tenants. The average income of a sharecropper was $312 a year. Farm laborers, moving from farm to farm, area to area, no land of their own, in 1933 were earning about $300 a year.\n\nBlack farmers were the worst off, and some were attracted to the strangers who began appearing in their area during the Depression, suggesting they organize. Nate Shaw recalls, in Theodore Rosengarten's remarkable interview (All God's Dangers):\n\nAnd durin of the pressure years, a union begin to operate in this country, called it the Sharecroppers Union-that was a nice name, I thought. '.. and I knowed what was goin on was a turnabout or the southern man, white and colored; it was somethin unusual. And I heard about it bein a organization for the poor class of people-that's just what I wanted to get into, too. I wanted to know the secrets of it enough that I could become in the knowledge of it... .\n\nMac Sloane, white man, said \"You stay out of it. These niggers runnin around here carryin on some kind of meetin-you better stay out of it.\"\n\nI said to myself, \"You a fool if you think you can keep me from joinin\". I went right on and joined it, just as quick as the next meetin come.. .. And he done just the thing to push me into it-gived me orders not to join.\n\nThe teachers of this organization begin to drive through this country- they couldn't let what they was doin be known. One of em was a colored fella; I disremember his name but he did a whole lot of time, holdin meetins with us-that was part of this job... .\n\nHad the meetins at our houses or anywhere we could keep a look and a watch-out that nobody was comin in on us. Small meetins, sometimes there'd be a dozen ... niggers was scared, niggers was scared, that's tellin the truth.\n\nNate Shaw told of what happened when a black farmer who hadn't paid his debts was about to be dispossessed:\n\nThe deputy said, \"I'm goin to take all old Virgil Jones got this morning.\" .. .\n\nI begged him not to do it, begged him. \"You'll dispossess him of bein able to feed his family.\"\n\nNate Shaw then told the deputy he was not going to allow it. The deputy came back with more men, and one of them shot and wounded Shaw, who then got his gun and fired back. He was arrested in late 1932, and served twelve years in an Alabama prison. His story is a tiny piece of the great unrecorded drama of the southern poor in those years of the Sharecroppers Union. Years after his release from prison, Nate Shaw spoke his mind on color and class:\n\nO, it's plain as your hand. The poor white man and the poor black man is sittin in the same saddle today-big dudes done branched em off that way. The control of a man, the controllin power, is in the hands of the rich man, . .. That class is standin together and the poor white man is out there on the colored list-I've caught that: ways and actions a heap of times speaks louder than words. .. .\n\nHosea Hudson, a black man from rural Georgia, at the age of ten a plowhand, later an iron worker in Birmingham, was aroused by the case of the Scottsboro Boys in 1931 (nine black youths accused of raping two white girls and convicted on flimsy evidence by all-white juries). That year he joined the Communist party. In 1932 and 1933, he organized unemployed blacks in Birmingham. He recalls:\n\nDeep in the winter of 1932 we Party members organized a unemployed mass meeting to be held on the old courthouse steps, on 3rd Avenue, North Birmingham.... It was about 7000 or more people turned out.. . Negroes and whites. .. .\n\nIn 1932 and '33 we began to organize these unemployed block committees in the various communities of Birmingham.... If someone get out of food. . .. We wouldn't go around and just say, \"That's too bad\". We make it our business to go see this person. .. . And if the person was willing ... we'd work with them. ...\n\nBlock committees would meet every week, had a regular meeting. We talked about the welfare question, what was happening, we read the Daily Worker and the Southern Worker to see what was going on about unemployed relief, what people doing in Cleveland . . . struggles in Chicago ... or we talk about the latest developments in the Scottsboro case. We kept up, we was on top, so people always wanted to come cause we had something different to tell them every time.\n\nIn 1934 and 1935 hundreds of thousands of workers, left out of the rightly controlled, exclusive unions of the American Federation of Labor, began organizing in the new mass production industries-auto, rubber, packinghouse. The AFL could not ignore them; it set up a Committee for Industrial Organization to organize these workers outside of craft lines, by industry, all workers in a plant belonging to one union. This Committee, headed by John Lewis, then broke away and became the CIO-the Congress of Industrial Organizations.\n\nBut it was rank-and-file strikes and insurgencies that pushed the union leadership, AFL and CIO, into action. Jeremy Brecher tells the story in his book Strike! A new kind of tactic began among rubber workers in Akron, Ohio, in the early thirties - the sit-down strike. The workers stayed in the plant instead of walking out, and this had clear advantages: they were directly blocking the use of strikebreakers; they did not have to act through union officials but were in direct control of the situation themselves; they did not have to walk outside in the cold and rain, but had shelter; they were not isolated, as in their work, or on the picket line; they were thousands under one roof, free to talk to one another, to form a community of struggle. Louis Adamic, a labor writer, describes one of the early sit-downs:\n\nSitting by their machines, cauldrons, boilers and work benches, they talked. Some realized for the first time how important they were in the process of rubber production. Twelve men had practically stopped the works! .. . Superintendents, foremen, and straw bosses were dashing about... In less than an hour the dispute was settled, full victory for the men.\n\nIn early 1936, at the Firestone rubber plant in Akron, makers of truck tires, their wages already too low to pay for food and rent, were faced with a wage cut. When several union men were fired, others began to stop work, to sit down on the job. In one day the whole of plant #1 was sitting down. In two days, plant #2 was sitting down, and management gave in. In the next ten days there was a sit-down at Goodyear. A court issued an injunction against mass picketing. It was ignored, and ISO deputies were sworn in. But they soon faced ten thousand workers from all over Akron. In a month the strike was won.\n\nThe idea spread through 1936. In December of that year began the longest sit-down strike of all, at Fisher Body plant #1 in Flint, Michigan. It started when two brothers were fired, and it lasted until February 1937. For forty days there was a community of two thousand strikers. \"It was like war,\" one said. \"The guys with me became my buddies.\" Sidney Fine in Sit-Down describes what happened. Committees organized recreation, information, classes, a postal service, sanitation. Courts were set up to deal with those who didn't take their turn washing dishes or who threw rubbish or smoked where it was prohibited or brought in liquor. The \"punishment\" consisted of extra duties; the ultimate punishment was expulsion from the plant. A restaurant owner across the street prepared three meals a day for two thousand strikers. There were classes in parliamentary procedure, public speaking, history of the labor movement. Graduate students at the University of Michigan gave courses in journalism and creative writing.\n\nThere were injunctions, but a procession of five thousand armed workers encircled the plant and there was no attempt to enforce the injunction. Police attacked with tear gas and the workers fought back with firehoses. Thirteen strikers were wounded by gunfire, but the police were driven back. The governor called out the National Guard. By this time the strike had spread to other General Motors plants. Finally there was a settlement, a six-month contract, leaving many questions unsettled but recognizing that from now on, the company would have to deal not with individuals but with a union.\n\nIn 1936 there were forty-eight sitdown strikes. In 1937 there were 477: electrical workers in St. Louis; shirt workers in Pulaski, Tennessee; broom workers in Pueblo, Colorado; trash collectors in Bridgeport, Connecticut; gravediggers in New Jersey; seventeen blind workers at the New York Guild for the Jewish Blind; prisoners in an Illinois penitentiary; and even thirty members of a National Guard Company who had served in the Fisher Body sit-down, and now sat down themselves because they had not been paid.\n\nThe sit-downs were especially dangerous to the system because they were not controlled by the regular union leadership. An AFL business agent for the Hotel and Restaurant Employees said:\n\nYou'd be sitting in the office any March day of 1937, and the phone would ring and the voice at the other end would say: \"My name is Mary Jones; I'm a soda clerk at Liggett's; we've thrown the manager out and we've got the keys. What do we do now?\" And you'd hurry over to the company to negotiate and over there they'd say, \"I think it's the height of irresponsibility to call a strike before you've ever asked for a contract\" and all you could answer was, \"You're so right.\"\n\nIt was to stabilize the system in the face of labor unrest that the Wagner Act of 1935, setting up a National Labor Relations Board, had been passed. The wave of strikes in 1936, 1937, 1938, made the need even more pressing. In Chicago, on Memorial Day, 1937, a strike at Republic Steel brought the police out, firing at a mass picket line of strikers, killing ten of them. Autopsies showed the bullets had hit the workers in the back as they were running away: this was the Memorial Day Massacre. But Republic Steel was organized, and so was Ford Motor Company, and the other huge plants in steel, auto, rubber, meatpacking, the electrical industry.\n\nThe Wagner Act was challenged by a steel corporation in the courts, but the Supreme Court found it constitutional-that the government could regulate interstate commerce, and that strikes hurt interstate commerce. From the trade unions' point of view, the new law was an aid to union organizing. From the government's point of view it was an aid to the stability of commerce.\n\nUnions were not wanted by employers, but they were more controllable-more stabilizing for the system than the wildcat strikes, the factory occupations of the rank and file. In the spring of 1937, a New York Times article carried the headline \"Unauthorized Sit-Downs Fought by CIO Unions.\" The story read: \"Strict orders have been issued to all organizers and representatives that they will be dismissed if they authorize any stoppages of work without the consent of the international officers. .. .\" The Times quoted John L. Lewis, dynamic leader of the CIO: \"A CIO contract is adequate protection against sit-downs, lie-downs, or any other kind of strike.\"\n\nThe Communist party, some of whose members played critical roles in organizing CIO unions, seemed to take the same position. One Communist leader in Akron was reported to have said at a party strategy meeting after the sit-downs: \"Now we must work for regular relations between the union and the employers-and strict observance of union procedure on the part of the workers.\"\n\nThus, two sophisticated ways of controlling direct labor action developed in the mid-thirties. First, the National Labor Relations Board would give unions legal status, listen to them, settling certain of their grievances. Thus it could moderate labor rebellion by channeling energy into elections-just as the constitutional system channeled possibly troublesome energy into voting. The NLRB would set limits in economic conflict as voting did in political conflict. And second, the workers' organization itself, the union, even a militant and aggressive union like the CIO, would channel the workers' insurrectionary energy into contracts, negotiations, union meetings, and try to minimize strikes, in order to build large, influential, even respectable organizations.\n\nThe history of those years seems to support the argument of Richard Cloward and Frances Piven, in their book Poor People's Movements, that labor won most during its spontaneous uprisings, before the unions were recognized or well organized: \"Factory workers had their greatest influence, and were able to exact their most substantial concessions from government, during the Great Depression, in the years before they were organized into unions. Their power during the Depression was not rooted in organization, but in disruption.\"\n\nPiven and Cloward point out that union membership rose enormously in the forties, during the Second World War (the CIO and AFL had over 6 million members each by 1945), but its power was less than before-its gains from the use of strikes kept getting whittled down. The members appointed to the NLRB were less sympathetic to labor, the Supreme Court declared sit-downs to be illegal, and state governments were passing laws to hamper strikes, picketing, boycotts.\n\nThe coming of World War II weakened the old labor militancy of the thirties because the war economy created millions of new jobs at higher wages. The New Deal had succeeded only in reducing unemployment from 13 million to 9 million. It was the war that put almost everyone to work, and the war did something else: patriotism, the push for unity of all classes against enemies overseas, made it harder to mobilize anger against the corporations. During the war, the CIO and AFL pledged to call no strikes.\n\nStill, the grievances of workers were such-wartime \"controls\" meant their wages were being controlled better than prices-that they felt impelled to engage in many wildcat strikes: there were more strikes in 1944 than in any previous year in American history, says Jeremy Brecher.\n\nThe thirties and forties showed more clearly than before the dilemma of working people in the United States. The system responded to workers' rebellions by finding new forms of control-internal control by their own organizations as well as outside control by law and force. But along with the new controls came new concessions. These concessions didn't solve basic problems; for many people they solved nothing. But they helped enough people to create an atmosphere of progress and improvement, to restore some faith in the system.\n\nThe minimum wage of 1938, which established the forty-hour week and outlawed child labor, left many people out of its provisions and set very low minimum wages (twenty-five cents an hour the first year). But it was enough to dull the edge of resentment. Housing was built for only a small percentage of the people who needed it. \"A modest, even parsimonious, beginning,\" Paul Conkin says (F.D.R. and the Origins of the Welfare State), but the sight of federally subsidized housing projects, playgrounds, vermin-free apartments, replacing dilapidated tenements, was refreshing. The TVA suggested exciting possibilities for regional planning to give jobs, improve areas, and provide cheap power, with local instead of national control. The Social Security Act gave retirement benefits and unemployment insurance, and matched state funds for mothers and dependent children-but it excluded farmers, domestic workers, and old people, and offered no health insurance. As Conkin says: \"The meager benefits of Social Security were insignificant in comparison to the building of security for large, established businesses.\"\n\nThe New Deal gave federal money to put thousands of writers, artists, actors, and musicians to work-in a Federal Theatre Project, a Federal Writers Project, a Federal Art Project: murals were painted on public buildings; plays were put on for working-class audiences who had never seen a play; hundreds of books and pamphlets were written and published. People heard a symphony for the first time. It was an exciting flowering of arts for the people, such as had never happened before in American history, and which has not been duplicated since. But in 1939, with the country more stable and the New Deal reform impulse weakened, programs to subsidize the arts were eliminated.\n\nWhen the New Deal was over, capitalism remained intact. The rich still controlled the nation's wealth, as well as its laws, courts, police, newspapers, churches, colleges. Enough help bad been given to enough people to make Roosevelt a hero to millions, but the same system that had brought depression and crisis-the system of waste, of inequality, of concern for profit over human need- remained.\n\nFor black people, the New Deal was psychologically encouraging (Mrs. Roosevelt was sympathetic; some blacks got posts in the administration), but most blacks were ignored by the New Deal programs. As tenant farmers, as farm laborers, as migrants, as domestic workers, they didn't qualify for unemployment insurance, minimum wages, social security, or farm subsidies. Roosevelt, careful not to offend southern white politicians whose political support he needed, did not push a bill against lynching. Blacks and whites were segregated in the armed forces. And black workers were discriminated against in getting jobs. They were the last hired, the first fired. Only when A. Philip Randolph, head of the Sleeping-Car Porters Union, threatened a massive march on Washington in 1941 would Roosevelt agree to sign an executive order establishing a Fair Employment Practices Committee. But the FEPC had no enforcement powers and changed little.\n\nBlack Harlem, with all the New Deal reforms, remained as it was. There 350,000 people lived, 233 persons per acre compared with 133 for the rest of Manhattan. In twenty-five years, its population had multiplied six times. Ten thousand families lived in rat-infested cellars and basements. Tuberculosis was common. Perhaps half of the married women worked as domestics. They traveled to the Bronx and gathered on street corners-\"slave markets,\" they were called-to be hired, Prostitution crept in. Two young black women, Ella Baker and Marvel Cooke, wrote about this in The Crisis in 1935:\n\nNot only is human labor bartered and sold for the slave wage, but human love is also a marketable commodity. Whether it is labor or love, the women arrive as early as eight a.m. and remain as late as one p.m. or until they are hired. In rain or shine, hot or cold, they wait to work for ten, fifteen, and twenty cents per hour.\n\nIn Harlem Hospital in 1932, proportionately twice as many people died as ill Bellvue Hospital, which was in the white area downtown. Harlem was a place that bred crime-\"the bitter blossom of poverty,\" as Roi Ottley and William Weatherby say in their essay \"The Negro in New York.\"\n\nOn March 19, 1935, even as the New Deal reforms were being passed, Harlem exploded. Ten thousand Negroes swept through the streets, destroying the property of white merchants. Seven hundred policemen moved in and brought order. Two blacks were killed.\n\nIn the mid-thirties, a young black poet named Langston Hughes wrote a poem, \"Let America Be America Again\":\n\n... I am the poor white, fooled and pushed apart,\n\nI am the Negro bearing slavery's scars.\n\nI am the red man driven from the land,\n\nI am the immigrant clutching the hope I seek-\n\nAnd finding only the same old stupid plan.\n\nOf dog eat dog, of mighty crush the weak... .\n\nO, let America be America again-\n\nThe land that never has been yet-\n\nAnd yet must be-the land where every man is free.\n\nThe land that's mine-the poor man's, Indian's, Negro's\n\nME-\n\nWho made America,\n\nWhose sweat and blood, whose faith and pain,\n\nWhose hand at the foundry, whose plow in the rain,\n\nMust bring back our mighty dream again.\n\nSure, call me any ugly name you choose-\n\nThe steel of freedom does not stain.\n\nFrom those who live like leeches on the people's lives,\n\nWe must take back our land again,\n\nAmerica! . . .\n\nAmericans of the thirties, however, North and South, blacks were invisible. Only the radicals made an attempt to break the racial barriers: Socialists, Trotskyists, Communists most of all. The CIO, influenced by the Communists, was organizing blacks in the mass production industries. Blacks were still being used as strikebreakers, but now there were also attempts to bring blacks and whites together against their common enemy. A woman named Mollie Lewis, writing in The Crisis, in 1938, told of her experience in a steel strike in Gary, Indiana:\n\nWhile the municipal government of Gary continues to keep the children apart in a system of separate schools, their parents are getting together in the union and in the auxiliary. ... The only public eating place in Gary where both races may be freely served is a cooperative restaurant largely patronized by members of the union and auxiliary. . ..\n\nWhen the black and white workers and members of their families are convinced that their basic economic interests are the same, they may be expected to make common cause for the advancement of these interests.. . .\n\nThere was no great feminist movement in the thirties. But many women became involved in the labor organizing of those years. A Minnesota poet, Meridel LeSeuer, was thirty-four when the great teamsters' strike tied up Minneapolis in 1934. She became active in it, and later described her experiences:\n\nI have never been in a strike before. ... The truth is I was afraid. ... \"Do you need any help?\" I said eagerly.... We kept on pouring thousands of cups of coffee, feeding thousands of men... . The cars were coming back. The announcer cried, \"This is murder.\" ... I saw them taking men out of cars and putting them on the hospital cots, on the floor. ... The picket cars keep coming in. Some men have walked back from the market, holding their own blood in.... Men, women and children are massing outside, a living circle close packed for protection. ,.. We have living blood on our skirts...\n\nTuesday, the day of the funeral, one thousand more militia were massed downtown.\n\nIt was over ninety in the shade. I went to the funeral parlors and thousands of men and women were massed there waiting in the terrific sun. One block of women and children were standing two hours waiting. I went over and stood near them. I didn't know whether I could march. I didn't like marching in parades. ... Three women drew me in. \"We want all to march,\" they said gently. \"Come with us.\". . .\n\nSylvia Woods spoke to Alice and Staughton Lynd years later about her experiences in the thirties as a laundry worker and union organizer:\n\nYou have to tell people things they can see. Then they'll say, \"Oh, I never thought of that\" or \"I have never seen it like that,\" . .. Like Tennessee. He hated black people. A poor sharecropper. . . . he danced with a black woman.... So I have seen people change. This is the faith you've got to have in people.\n\nMany Americans began to change their thinking in those days of crisis and rebellion. In Europe, Hitler was on the march. Across the Pacific, Japan was invading China. The Western empires were being threatened by new ones. For the United States, war was not far off.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/803580", "artist_names": "The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band", "full_title": "Some of

flow\n\n[Verse 2]\nWish I was back in the city\nInstead of this old bank of sand\nWith the sun beating down over the chimney tops\nAnd the one I love so close at hand\nIf I had wings and I could fly\nI know where I would go\nBut right now I\u2019ll just sit here so contentedly\nAnd watch the river flow\n[Chorus]\nPeople disagreeing on all just about everything, yeah\nMakes you stop and all wonder why\nWhy only yesterday I saw somebody on the street\nWho just couldn\u2019t help but cry\nOh, this old river keeps on rolling, though\nNo matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow\nAnd as long as it does I\u2019ll just sit here\nAnd watch the river flow\n\n[Chorus]\nPeople disagreeing everywhere you look\nMakes you want to stop and read a book\nWhy only yesterday I

Mmm Maybe at M&G's, after a shift. Still can't believe that place went out of business.\n\nKRASNER: I miss Copeland's.\n\nMISTY: Who doesn't? Whatever. Let's do this. Detective Mercedes Kelly Knight, badge 3-0-9-3-5.\n\nKRASNER: You know, you're not being recorded.\n\nMISTY: Of course I am. (to the one-way mirror) You know this is bullshit, right? Things got rough with a hostile witness. You think that's the first time this has ever happened?\n\nKrasner writes something down, which makes Misty uncomfortable.\nKRASNER: You lost control. And it's all about control with you, isn't it? I mean, that's why you were a point guard. You wanted to be the one to distribute the ball, right?\n\nMISTY: It's 'cause I was short, and it was the only way I could get on the court, so...\n\nKRASNER: 'Cause you had to play the game.\n\nMISTY: It's not a game for me.\n\nKRASNER: Then why get benched for something as stupid as getting physical with Claire Temple?\n\nKrasner shows Misty a photo of Stryker holding her at gunpoint. Misty instantly flashes back to that moment. The memory is hazy and surreal, unlike her \"Misty-vision\" crime scene recreations.\n\nSTRYKER (echoing): Do you love? Do you love? Hmm? Oh, come on. You're not gonna beg? Oh, come on. Not even a little bit?\n\nMISTY: If you gonna kill me, then just do it.\nMisty blinks and returns to the present. Her lip is trembling.\n\nKRASNER: What shook you? Was it losing your gun to one suspect while trying to arrest another without backup? Was it the extra eyes because of Scarfe? Was it this Luke Cage guy? What pushed you towards career suicide?\n\nMISTY (laughing): You know how many times I've been in this same goddamn box on the other side of the table? You think you are gonna break me? Bring it.\n\nKRASNER: Like I said, this is not an interrogation. I'm not here to break you. You've already done that yourself. The question is, how broken are you? And can you be fixed?\n\nA GARBAGE TRUCK\nLuke wakes up in the back of his garbage truck. He prods gently around his wounds and they make squishing sounds. He climbs out of the truck when it pauses and takes a whiff of himself.\n\nLUKE: Ugh! Sweet Christmas.\n\nOPENING THEME\n\nHARLEM'S PARADISE\nThe Delfonics are rehearsing.\n\nLEAD SINGER: Hold up, hold up. Somebody ain't playing that thing right. Tighten up over here. Tighten up over here, all right? Let's do this, man. We rehearsed it. Let's get this done.\n\nThey go into \"Stop and Look (And You Have Found Love\"\n\nIn the office above the club Shades is looking down through the newly replaced window.\n\nSHADES: So we've checked every truck, every landfill in every borough. And for all of that, we've got...\n\nZIP: Nothing yet.\n\nSHADES: Nothing yet. Nothing yet...\n\nSTRYKER: Y'all can't find Luke Cage? What, he just dissipated? Like smoke? See, that's the thing. Where there's smoke, there's fire.\n\nStryker pulls a finger gun out of his inside pocket. He points it around and pulls the imaginary trigger. A real gunshot rings out. He'd taken out his gun at hip level and shot Darnell while people were distracted by his finger gun.\n\nDownstairs the rehearsing magicians scatter.\n\nSTRYKER: There's nothing magical about it. Follow the smoke. Or the damn garbage truck.\n\nZip, Sugar, and Darnell leave.\n\nSHADES: Well you ain't Houdini.\n\nSTRYKER: And you ain't Rick from Casablanca, neither. What? You thought you could whisper in Mariah's ear have her do your dirty work then you're the new king with the big desk? Hmm Biggie photo...Delfonics crooning downstairs...You killed my friend, Shades. He was my number one seller. Who do you think gave him that Barron Claiborne there?\n\nSHADES: You don't have any friends.\n\nSTRYKER: \"A man of too many friends comes to ruin, but there is a friend who comes closer than a brother.\" Proverbs 18:24. Cornell Stokes was that friend for me. And I could trust him like I could my own brother.\n\nSHADES: Cornell was losing it. You trusted me to take care of him.\n\nSTRYKER: I trusted you to take care of it, not him. What? Did you think I was just gonna give it all to you? Give me one reason why I shouldn't splatter this pristine desk with your brain matter.\n\nZIP: Because it won't help you find Luke Cage any faster?\n\nSHADES: You're smarter than your name implies, Zip. Two rule books got me through the darkness.\nThe Bible and The 48 Laws of Power. Do you want to know what the 49th is? \"Luke Cage ain't dead until you find his goddamn body.\"\n\nTHE STREETS OF HARLEM\nLuke is limping through the streets. He comes across a laundromat and stumbles into it. He takes some clothes at random out of a dryer and puts them on.\n\nMEGAN MCLAREN (on TV): And today's top news, the shootout that occurred in Harlem last night. After an ambulance was forced off the street, it appears a chase led to a women's clinic where gunfire was exchanged. The fight continued to this historic theater where severe damage was wrought. Witnesses described two men at the center of this fight.\n\nAt this point Luke notices the news.\n\nMEGAN: Although police still have not detained any suspects, this man, Luke Cage, is wanted for questioning in connection with the recent murder of noted nightlife mogul Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes.\n\nLuke pulls on a hoodie and hurries out of the laundromat.\nTHE INTERROGATION ROOM\n\nKRASNER: You had it rough recently.\n\nMISTY: Where do you want to start?\n\nKRASNER: Who do you talk to when things get bad?\n\nMISTY: I...I used to talk to Scarfe.\n\nKRASNER: No husband. A boyfriend?\n\nMISTY: The last time somebody set me up, I ended up arresting the guy at the table.\n\nKRASNER: No.\n\nMISTY: Yeah. I did a background check, and he was wanted for robbery in three different states. They gave the dude a nickname at my precinct.\n\nKRASNER: Yeah?\n\nMISTY: Called him the \"Love Bandit.\" I still get shit about it. I see everything and I forget nothin'. Every investigation, every suspect, every murder, every crying mother It is all in my head.\n\nKRASNER: So who's the last person you dated?\n\nMISTY: That's personal.\n\nKRASNER: That's why we're here.\n\nMISTY: I met a guy at a bar. I wasn't nice to him, at all...But he didn't care. He was funny. He wasn't wearing a ring. And the first time he spoke to me, even in a low cut dress, he looked at my eyes not my breasts.\n\nKRASNER: So?\n\nMISTY: So, we talked. I could be myself. He thought I was pretty and he told me so. We had coffee.\n\nQuick cut to Misty and Luke having sex.\n\nKRASNER: I feel a \"but\" coming on.\n\nMISTY: But he wasn't who I thought he was.\n\nKRASNER: Just like Scarfe? How does that make you feel?\n\nMISTY: How do you think it makes me feel?\n\nFLASHBACK\nCottonmouth crashes through his office window. Mariah attacks him with the mic stand.\n\nMARIAH: I didn't want it!\n\nQuick cut to\nSPURLOCK'S MORTUARY\nwhere Mariah is standing over Cottonmouth's body.\n\nMARIAH: You don't remember Jazmine. How could you? She was fly. So damn fast. She used to drive Mama Mabel crazy with all her boyfriends. Malik was special, though. He was talented. Played drums on a lot of those Sugar Hill Records. The old ones. I really liked him. I thought they were good together. Mama Mabel couldn't stand him. She knew he was dabbling. Coke, smack. Malik wanted you, Cornell. He did. But he OD'd. And then Jazzy ran off. She told me, \"I'm not ready to be nobody's mama.\" And she just left. She left you, and there you were, wrapped in a blanket in a basket. Mama Mabel put you in my hands that very day. You always thought I called you \"Mo\" for \"Cottonmouth.\" Mo was for \"Moses.\"\n\nShades slowly opens the door. Mariah doesn't notice him.\n\nMARIAH: I wasn't ready to be nobody's mama, neither. I did try to protect you from...all the shit. I tried I tried to protect you from yourself but I didn't. I'm...\n\nThe door creaks and Mariah quickly tries to gather herself.\n\nSHADES: You did what you had to do.\n\nMARIAH: I don't know how this happened.\n\nSHADES: You made a choice...and now we have to pay the price. Diamondback is here to collect.\n\nMARIAH: Diamond-what?\n\nSHADES: He's not happy that Cornell is dead, and Luke Cage is still alive. Cage is in the wind right now, and I need your help to find him. Our frame doesn't work if he's not there to take the blame.\n\nMARIAH: What, you want me to call the police?\n\nSHADES: If it comes to that, sure. But right now we have more pressing concerns.\n\nMARIAH: You keep saying \"we.\"\n\nSHADES: Well, you. Like it or not the business is yours now.\n\nMARIAH: I have nothing to do with all of that.\n\nSHADES: You are the face now. And nature abhors a vacuum. You have to ensure a smooth transition for all of Cornell's clients, or it is going to be straight up chaos for you.\n\nTHE STREETS OF HARLEM\nDash cam view from a police car of Luke stumbling in the street.\n\nOFFICER: Dispatch, car 77-0-5. Sighting possible drunk. Should we engage?\n\nDISPATCHER: Is it our suspect?\n\nOFFICER: We've a black male, but need verification.\n\nThey sound their sirens to get Luke's attention. He reluctantly stops walking as they get out of their car.\nLUKE: Good morning. Is there a problem?\n\nOFFICER: No. You tell me.\nWhat's your name, son?\n\nLUKE: I'm just taking a walk. Minding my business.\n\nOFFICER: I need to see some ID.\n\nLUKE: To walk?\n\nOFFICER: Turn around, take down your hoodie.\n\nLUKE: May I ask why?\n\nOFFICER: Because I said so.\n\nOne of the officers pulls up a photo of Luke on his phone. They both draw their guns.\n\nOFFICER: Oh, shit. It is him!\n\nOFFICER: On the ground, now! Hands behind your back. Get on the ground, now!\n\nLUKE: I'm really sorry, guys.\n\nOFFICER: You're under arrest!\n\nLuke slaps the officer trying to cuff him, then turns around to protect him from his partner's gunfire. Luke then turns on shooter while he's trying to reload and pushes him so hard he flies through the air and crashes into the hood of his car. The dash cam caught it all. Luke pulls the officers to the sidewalk and steals their car.\nTHE INTERROGATION ROOM\nMisty is falling asleep on the table. Krasner comes back in with two cans of lemonade.\n\nKRASNER: Lemonade? Popular drink.\n\nMISTY: And it still is. That story in my file, too?\n\nKRASNER: What story? You know, I don't believe everything I read? I wanna hear you tell it.\n\nMISTY: Summer of '95, and every other car was playing either \"Shook Ones\" or \"Ice Cream.\" I was hanging out with my cousin, Cassandra. My mother told us never to walk around the neighborhood by ourselves but it was hot, and I was thirsty. And she was taking way too long talking to some cute boy. So I went to Ruiz Bodega by myself and got a lemonade. When I got back, she was gone. It took the cops two weeks to find her body. Disfigured, beaten. The boy, Mike Jones, ran a train on her with his crew. Nobody snitched. Cops didn't push. They didn't really give a shit. She was just another poor, worthless bitch from the Polo Grounds.\n\nKRASNER: So that's why you became a cop?\n\nMISTY: I apply foot to ass, and match lead for lead. I put murderers in handcuffs. I don't just seek justice, I stalk it. And that much should go in my record.\n\nKRASNER: With your resume, you could've been downtown years ago. Hell, you could've been a fed, but you chose to stay in Harlem.\n\nMISTY: I know this place, I know the players and I can make a difference here.\n\nKRASNER: Or use some of those old school connections to make a little money on the side, like your partner.\n\nMISTY: I didn't know anything about Scarfe. Or anything he was doing. He didn't buy new clothes, no new watch, no new girlfriend, no loose talk, nothing.\n\nKRASNER: But he'd been working for Cottonmouth for years.\n\nMISTY: And I trusted him so I didn't see it. And neither did anybody else in this damn department. So why do I get singled out for it?\n\nKRASNER: Because you were the closest to him. It's written all over your face. Not seeing it bothered you, didn't it?\n\nMISTY (sarcastically): 'Cause seeing is my thing, right? That's what made me such a good point guard. 'Cause I could see everything in my head. I knew exactly where people were gonna be, so I put the ball right where it needed to go.\n\nKRASNER: But you couldn't see Scarfe for what he was. Or were you blinded by your emotions?\n\nMISTY: You wouldn't say that if I was a man.\n\nKRASNER: Oh, that is not true.\n\nMISTY: Bullshit! Male cops can screw cop groupies in the back of their unmarked or their RMP, and you guys cheer. They get drunk and fight each other in the parking lot, and it's called blowing off steam. There's always a double standard.\n\nKRASNER: And you never screwed anyone that you shouldn't have while you were on the job?\n\nMISTY: No.\n\nKRASNER: But you choked out a witness. Own your shit. You went renegade when you went after Luke Cage alone. And it got way deeper than it should have. And this guy took the control away from you when he took your gun.\n\nAnother quick, shaky flashback to Stryker holding the gun to Misty's head.\n\nKRASNER: Then you're in a room alone with Miss Temple, and she insults you, and you lost control and you know it.\n\nMISTY: I need a break.\n\nShe gets up and leaves the room, tries to catch her breath in the hallway.\nCOLON'S GYM\nRepairs are underway to get the place back up after Luke's visit. Mariah picks her way through the chaos.\n\nMARIAH: What happened in here? You know what happened here.\n\nDOMINGO: Same as you. Sorry to hear about Cornell. Hope they get that bastard. He's bad for business.\n\nMARIAH: Well, yeah, I'm not here to talk about Luke Cage.\n\nDOMINGO: Well, it took a lot for you to walk through those doors without your people.\n\nMARIAH: Chico, please. I was from around here long before you even knew what that was. Besides, we all contribute to this city, one way or another.\n\nDOMINGO: \"Contribute?\" I never trusted your cousin and I trust you even less. Pretending to rise to the right side of the law. Girl, I know where you're from. That stank don't come off too easy.\n\nMARIAH: The thing my cousin built needs to continue.\n\nDOMINGO: And you're gonna be the one to run it?\n\nMARIAH: No. I need help.\n\nDOMINGO: Me?\n\nMARIAH: Not just you. Cornell had steady customers.\n\nDOMINGO: Not everybody liked your cousin. I mean, God respect the dead.\n\nMARIAH: Yeah, he got it done without a lot of needless violence. I want everybody to come to the table so I can discuss a transition. Maybe even a buyout.\n\nDOMINGO: There was something dangerous behind your eyes and this is it, huh?\n\nMARIAH: Cornell was who he was. I want something different. I don't want to have to look over my shoulder, Domingo. Gather all the bosses. I have a proposition that will benefit us all. So who gets an invitation?\n\nDOMINGO: Jacques Alef with the Macoute, Neville Barnwell with the Yardies. Juan Carlos Castro with the Cubanos. And the Chinese, they got their own thing going on downtown, but Peter Hong with the Koreans he might wanna holla.\n\nMARIAH: When?\n\nDOMINGO: Oh, that's gonna take me a few days.\n\nMARIAH: Tonight.\n\nSOLEDAD'S DINER\nClaire is researching in a booth. She searches \"elastic skin cells\" then emphasizes \"abalone shells\" in her notes.\n\nCLAIRE: Abalone shells...\n\nShe plugs in the flash drive Luke gave her. It's all encrypted so she can't read it, but she searches \"Seagate Burstein\" based on file titles.\n\nLuke comes in to sit next to her. Blood is seeping through to stain his hoodie.\n\nLUKE: Claire. Claire.\n\nCLAIRE: Everybody's looking for you. How did you not get caught?...He shot you again?\n\nShe quickly checks his new bullet wound.\n\nCLAIRE: Ugh! Why in the hell is this guy trying to kill you so bad? He's even going through the trouble of using bullets that could actually do it.\n\nLUKE: Willis was my, uh, my best friend. He's...He's delusional. Delusional and pissed.\n\nCLAIRE: Let me see...Ugh, your wound is getting infected, this looks bad. Who are you?\n\nLUKE: What do you mean?\n\nCLAIRE: I should say, \"What are you?\" I'm looking at your cells and I've never seen anything like it. I've been looking up sea shells to better understand the structure of your skin. Like I said you're amazing.\n\nLUKE: Only one man knows the science. And I am not going back to prison.\n\nCLAIRE: Is his name Dr. Noah Burstein? You gave me Reva's hard drive, remember? Do you talk to him?\n\nLUKE: No. Reva kept tabs just in case someone got cute. But I am not ready to reopen that door.\n\nCLAIRE: I don't think that you have very much choice. We need to get you out of here. My mom has a car. And we haven't totaled that one yet.\n\nMARIAH'S BROWNSTONE\nMariah is zoning out, looking at family photos.\n\nALEX: Excuse me. Excuse me? Madam Councilwoman?\n\nMARIAH: Not anymore.\n\nALEX: Have you seen the emails? The interview requests? Even Thembi Wallace wants another sit-down.\n\nMARIAH: Never.\n\nALEX: Can I show you something? Hit the news about 20 minutes ago. He attacked two cops and stole their cars.\n\nMARIAH: Cage?\n\nALEX: The cops are alive. They GPS'd the car, but someone leaked the footage. It was too hot to hold back.\n\nAlex shows Mariah the dash cam footage on a tablet.\n\nMARIAH: Huh. It's amazing.\n\nALEX: I know it's tough seeing the man that killed your cousin.\n\nMARIAH: They'll get him, Alex. Justice will prevail. You know, Cornell taught me to be strong, so I will be strong.\n\nALEX: People understand the threat...the kind of person you're up against. They're not talking about the money, or where it came from. I think if you play this right, you could have supporters with even deeper pockets behind you, who see this as a political issue, and see your cousin as a brave man who stood up to a freak.\n\nMARIAH: You would use my personal tragedy for strategic political advantage?\n\nALEX: Madam Councilwoman, I...\n\nMARIAH: I taught you well. Go home, Alex. I'm letting you off early.Thank you.\n\nTHE INTERROGATION ROOM\nMisty reenters the room, ready to start again.\n\nKRASNER: What happened out there that bothers you the most?\n\nMISTY: I lost my gun. Other than that, I wouldn't say it bothered me.\n\nKRASNER: I saw your hand shake the first time you looked at this photo. Why?\n\nMISTY: Because I remembered seeing myself see myself wondering what I would look like in a casket. I mean, how the hell did I get there? He got the drop on me. How in the hell did he do that? I could have disarmed him, like, ten different ways. Why didn't I do any of that? I couldn't help anybody, not even my damn self. He shoved my gun in my face and I froze. And you know what I thought about? I thought about Pop's funeral. I thought about my own funeral. I thought about my father, and what people would think about me. And this guy this guy was smiling...while he was toying with my life. It was fun for him. I didn't have control, and maybe I never did. And when Claire was talking sideways about me, all I wanted to do was take my control back....Oh, my God. What have I done?\n\nKRASNER: It's like anything else you've learned on the job. It's ugly but you can't move your gaze. You have to look and learn.\nThat's how you get answers. That's how you win.\n\nWe see Ridley watching this exchange through the one way mirror.\nON THE ROAD TO GEORGIA\nClaire is driving; Luke is in the passenger seat. He's grunting and suffering, so Claire holds his hand.\n\nLUKE: It's getting harder to breathe...These wounds are kicking my ass.\n\nCLAIRE: Hey, hey, hey, hey. You know, it passed before, it's gonna pass again, okay? I promise.\n\nLUKE: Can I get that with the money-back guarantee?\n\nCLAIRE: Breathe. See? You got this.\n\nLUKE:What if this is a one-way trip?\n\nCLAIRE: Hey, hey, you are gonna make it. You hear me? You're gonna make it just fine. We're gonna fix this. Don't even. You're not dying in my mom's car, okay?\n\nLUKE: It's the part you can't fix that's bothering me.\n\nCLAIRE: What do you mean?\n\nLUKE: Willis. Willis Stryker. He thinks he's my brother. Diamondback. He's...he's gotta be lying about my father. He...he can't be my brother.\n\nBURSTEIN'S FARMHOUSE\nClaire leaves Luke in the front seat and goes up to ring Burstein's doorbell. Burstein only opens the door a crack.\n\nCLAIRE: Hi. Sorry to ring so late. My name is Sandra Lopez. I'm currently majoring in prison studies at Boston University, and, uh, I was just wondering if I could ask you a few questions about your time at Seagate. My friend said that you worked there?\n\nBURSTEIN: Your friend was mistaken....what friend?\n\nCLAIRE: Carl Lucas.\n\nBURSTEIN: I don't know anybody by that name.\n\nHe tries to close the door. Claire catches it and shoves it open.\n\nCLAIRE: He's alive, Doc.\n\nBURSTEIN: That's impossible.\n\nCLAIRE: Your experiment worked. It changed him.\n\nBURSTEIN: Changed how?\n\nCLAIRE: You should see for yourself.\n\nBURSTEIN: He's here?\n\nCLAIRE: Yes.\n\nBURSTEIN: Where is he?\n\nClaire leads him over to her car.\n\nLUKE: What's up, Doc? I've always wanted to say that.\n\nBURSTEIN: Let's get him out of here\n\nThe two struggle to help him inside.\n\nBURSTEIN: Put him on the couch.\n\nCLAIRE: Come on, just a few more steps...easy, easy. Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy. Breathe. Breathe. Okay.\n\nBURSTEIN: You've got no scars. Nothing. That lab was totally destroyed. You mean it worked?\n\nLUKE: Yes and no. Until last night...I was bulletproof.\n\nBURSTEIN: Jesus Christ, kid. What did this to you?\n\nLUKE: They shot me with some crazy bullets.\n\nCLAIRE: They exploded inside of him.\n\nBURSTEIN: He should be dead.\n\nLUKE: My skin is now tough like armor.\n\nCLAIRE: I think maybe what makes him stronger is also pushing the shrapnel deeper into his organs. Trust me, it is impossible to cut into his skin.\n\nBURSTEIN: Look, I don't know what it is that you think I can do for you. My lab is not my lab anymore. I wouldn't know where to begin.\n\nCLAIRE: What if we can help you with that? Reva took this.\n\nShe holds up the flash drive.\n\nBURSTEIN: She shouldn't have done that.\n\nLUKE: Can you unlock it?\n\nBurstein takes it over to his laptop and enters a password. It works.\n\nBURSTEIN: Oh, my God. It's all here. Everything.\n\nCLAIRE: Everything you need?\n\nBURSTEIN: Everything I lost. So much more. Reva died for this, didn't she?\n\nCLAIRE: Luke refuses to talk about it...You okay?\n\nLuke coughs up blood.\n\nLUKE: They're killing me. Doc, you figure this shit out.\n\nThey help him out of the house and into\nBURSTEIN'S BARN\nThe barn is full of jerry-rigged machinery.\n\nLUKE: What is all this stuff?\n\nBURSTEIN: During the cover-up, I stole whatever I could.\n\nLUKE: What cover-up?\n\nBURSTEIN: They couldn't advertise Rackham's death, or the explosion that supposedly killed you, or Reva's data dump, so they they killed the whole thing...Here, let's set him down...I was so close to a breakthrough. That all ended when they thought you were dead. I started again from scratch, but never came close to replicating the Seagate incident.\n\nBurstein goes to unzip Luke's hoodie. Claire takes over for him.\n\nCLAIRE: I'm a nurse. I know the drill. I can help.\n\nLUKE: Why me? Why did you pick me? Because you were strong. Stronger than most.\n\nLUKE: That's not what Reva said. She said she begged you to do it.\n\nBURSTEIN: There's more to it than that, and you know it. She begged me, but you were already tabbed for the program.  Didn't Reva tell you about this?\n\nLUKE: No.\n\nBurstein approaches Luke with a scalpel.\n\nCLAIRE: That's not gonna do anything.\n\nBurstein breaks the scalpel against Luke's skin. Claire rolls her eyes.\n\nBURSTEIN: Oh, my God...Look, I gotta get a blood sample to cross check with Reva's data. Your DNA may be the X factor that made this whole thing work.\n\nCLAIRE: You mean, it could only work for Luke?\n\nBURSTEIN: Yeah, maybe. This wound is too septic to get a decent sample.\n\nCLAIRE: Are you saying you can't recreate what you did?\n\nBURSTEIN: It's not as straightforward as that. You know, penicillin, the X-ray machine [groans] [Burstein] the smallpox vaccine, pacemaker, even even even Viagra. Those were accidents. It's the same with Carl.\nClaire starts rifling through Burstein's equipment while he stands around.\n\nCLAIRE: This could work. If you go down his throat...\n\nBURSTEIN: We can puncture his mucus membrane.\n\nCLAIRE: Exactly.\n\nBURSTEIN: I like the way you think.\n\nLUKE: I don't.\n\nCLAIRE: Sorry.\n\nBURSTEIN: All right. Put your head back. Just open your mouth. I'll try to make this quick.\n\nCLAIRE: Breathe through your nose.\n\nBurstein pushes the needle into Luke's mouth and down his throat. He groans as blood starts to flow through the tube as Claire draws out the plunger of a large syringe.\n\nBURSTEIN: Easy, easy. Oh, here we go. It's working.\n\nTHE INTERROGATION ROOM\nRidley places Misty's shield on the table between them.\n\nRIDLEY: You see that?\n\nMISTY: That's my shield.\n\nRIDLEY: No, no, no. That's not your shield. That shield belongs to the city of New York and its people. And when you lose control, go upside somebody's head because you had a bad day or you feel powerless... r you screw the wrong person...\n\nMISTY: I didn't screw anybody!\n\nRIDLEY: Come on, now. You don't deserve to represent the people of New York, let alone protect them.\n\nMISTY: That's not true and you know it.\n\nRIDLEY: I do.\n\nMISTY: Look, we're wired differently. We run towards gunfire. We drink when we're sad. We screw when we're mad. And people hate us until they need us. And I hate that. But I love it, too.\n\nRIDLEY: We walk a higher path. It's not simple. It's very hard. And that is why people will always need us.\nShe pulls out a tablet and plays the dash cam video.\n\nRIDLEY: Hero of Harlem, my ass.\n\nMISTY: Look, if we're talking about a right path, it's not just about Luke Cage. You haven't even acknowledged the guy that held a gun to my head last night.\n\nRIDLEY: We will find out who that is.\n\nMISTY: And we still need to talk about Mariah Dillard. She is not innocent in all this.\n\nRIDLEY: Look, Mariah's not on the run for murder, assaulting two police officers. I need you to focus on bringing in Luke Cage.\n\nMISTY: Bullets bounce right off of him. Reason is the only thing that's gonna work. And it has to come from somebody he trusts.\n\nRidley laughs for a moment, then pushes Misty's shield and gun towards her.\n\nRIDLEY: Go get him.\n\nCOLON'S GYM\nShades stops Mariah just inside the door.\n\nSHADES: You ready for this?\n\nMARIAH: Like I said, ready as ever.\n\nSHADES: You need to understand where you are here. If they sense any weakness, any hesitation you're not just done politically you're done permanently.\n\nDOMINGO: You're late.\n\nMARIAH: I'm not. Looks like I'm right on time.\n\nJAMAICAN BOSS: Wagwan?\n\nMARIAH: Now that my cousin is gone, I'm making a few changes. I loved my cousin, but I didn't like what he did.\n\nCUBAN BOSS: Until he stopped serving you.\n\nKOREAN BOSS: Cut the crap, lady. What do you want to tell us?\n\nMARIAH: I'm out. My family is no longer to be associated with what you all do. I need to move in a more legitimate direction.\n\nHAITIAN BOSS: Need? That's a weak hand you're playing.\n\nMARIAH: My cousin has valuable assets and connections. I'll give them to you for a price.\n\nHAITIAN BOSS: And you walk away?\n\nMARIAH: I walk away.\n\nKOREAN BOSS: Why do I find that hard to believe?\n\nSTRYKER (emerging from the shadows): Because you're smart and stupid at the same time.\n\nHAITIAN BOSS: Diamondback, what are you doing here?\n\nSTRYKER: You invited me by not inviting me.\n\nKOREAN BOSS:  Excuse me?\n\nSTRYKER: Now, Peter when you don't buy my wares, or Jacques when you get them at a cheaper price from my competitors, you're messing with my money. And that pisses me off.\n\nStryker shoots the Korean boss in the head, then throws a knife between the Haitian boss's eyes.\n\nSTRYKER: Anybody else not made it to confessional this week? Your men outside are dead. Your greed superseded your common sense. So now, I have the pulpit. Rich men, camel and needles.\n\nDOMINGO: What do you want?\n\nSTRYKER: Hey, Neville, if you wanna test me...\n\nJAMAICAN BOSS: Ease up, man. I got no hackle with you now.\n\nCUBAN BOSS: We'll listen what you have to say.\n\nSTRYKER: Don't bother. Just by being here, you're already dead.\n\nStryker shoots the Jamaican boss through the throat. The bullet keeps going and kills the Cuban boss.\n\nSTRYKER: Two for the price of one.\n\nDOMINGO: What are you doing, man? You're gonna start a war.\n\nSTRYKER: \"And then many will fall away, and they will betray each other and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. But the one who endures to the end he will be saved.\"\n\nDOMINGO: You're crazy.\n\nSTRYKER: Crazy would be leaving you alive to run a very profitable drug business. But I got no beef with your cousins down south of the border so today is your lucky day.\n\nStryker turns on Mariah\n\nSTRYKER: But you? You! you're full of crazy. I just killed four people, and you didn't even flinch.\n\nMARIAH: You don't scare me.\n\nSTRYKER: No, I don't think I do. Tell me why we should be friends.\n\nMARIAH: Luke Cage. Clearly, we both have issues with him.\n\nSTRYKER: I heard he killed your cousin. Allegedly. Rest assured, I will end him when the time is right.\n\nMARIAH: But the time is not right. Have you even seen the dashboard footage that's all over the news? You don't you see the opportunity? You see a man you want dead who won't die. I see a marketer's dream. Why spend all your time killing and intimidating your criminal customers in the dark when you should be selling guns to police departments in the light? Guns that can handle these new threats.\n\nSTRYKER: Go on.\n\nMARIAH: Word is you have a weapon that can take him down. Kill Luke Cage. But if you do, and you go big, everyone else will come to you to help take down the rest of these super-freaks that are upsetting the natural order of things. You gotta go big pharma on this shit. You invent the disease, then you sell the cure.\n\nSTRYKER: Oh, Shades, now I see you were right. I like how she thinks. And who better to broker the deals, hmm?\n\nMARIAH: No. No, I'm out of this.\n\nSTRYKER: No. You're in way into this until I decide otherwise. Domingo. Sorry about the mess, hermano. But I have no doubt you have people that can clean up.\n\nDOMINGO: Why am I still alive, man?\n\nSTRYKER: 'Cause no one's coming at me. They'll ask around, so tell 'em I'll murderize everything in sight. 'Cause I don't care and I won't quit. You can't bargain with me. You buy or you die...You think Peter Luger's is still open?\nShades follows Diamondback out. Mariah sits down.\nHARLEM'S PARADISE\nThe Delfonics are performing again, this time in front of a big crowd.\n\nStryker is in the VIP area watching the performance.\n\nSHADES: That footage of Cage and the cops? It went viral. What do you want to do about it?\n\nSTRYKER: That's great...That's great. He's got nowhere to run now. We'll find him. It's all coming together.\n\nSHADES: But there's gonna be a...\n\nSTRYKER: Shh! I like this song.\n\nMisty is back at her desk. She clears her entire photo wall, replacing it with a few pictures of Luke, Cottonmouth, and Stryker.\nBURSTEIN'S FARMHOUSE\nLuke is sleeping, or unconscious. Claire strokes his head when Burstein isn't looking.\n\nBURSTEIN: We were working on creating this artificial skin for burn victims. We used a process called CRISPR to fuse the subject's DNA with another DNA to gain its attributes.\n\nCLAIRE: The foreign DNA was abalone shell, wasn't it?\n\nBURSTEIN: Uh, yeah. Where did you do your residency?\n\nCLAIRE: 145th Street. Um, and my fellowship in Hell's Kitchen.\n\nBURSTEIN: Well, you're correct. We already used abalone to build better combat equipment for soldiers. And to genetically enhance the durability, pliability, and healing properties of human epidermis.\n\nCLAIRE: Okay, so why are these bullets penetrating his skin then? Are they dipped in something?\n\nBURSTEIN: Well, perhaps. But more likely because of what they were made from. You see, uh, abalone is nearly impenetrable, but\nits stacked plates can be pushed apart under the right circumstances.\n\nLuke wakes and sits up. Claire immediately goes to his side.\n\nLUKE: Like what?\n\nCLAIRE: Hey.\n\nBURSTEIN: During the experiment, your skin cells were bonded with hydrogen covalent bonds at the exact point of acidity, temperature and saline concentration...\n\nLUKE: English, please.\n\nBURSTEIN: Well, see, I can replicate exactly the acidity and the saline portions of the experiment with the information that's on the Reva drive that you brought. But the the wild card is the temperature. Because of what Albert Rackham did, turning up the heat on the bath, I have no gauge as to the temperature that catalyzed the experiment.\n\nLUKE: How are you going to get this stuff out of me?\n\nBURSTEIN: Right. Uh...Imagine that your skin works like a form of Velcro, uh, under a sort of lock and key.\n\nCLAIRE: And in order to cut through it, he's got to weaken the lock and key, so we can remove the shrapnel.\n\nLUKE: How do you plan to do that?\n\nBURSTEIN: Uh, I'm going to dip your skin in boiling acid, and then, uh, remove the shrapnel. What? I've tried it with animals.\n\nLUKE:: He's putting me in a rotisserie spit?\n\nCLAIRE: Um...I think he wants to deep fry you. Like a turkey.\n\nBurstein flips some taps to start filling the bath.\n\nBURSTEIN: Now, look, we're only gonna have a short window to do this, uh, before your skin closes up again.\n\nLUKE: Just so we're clear, what could go wrong?\n\nBURSTEIN: Well, your your skin could peel off like wax paper, and, uh, after about ten seconds, you'd beg me to put a bullet in your head because the pain would be so bad. But your your head looks fine, so I I guess the bullet would ricochet off your skull.\n\nCut to a little while later. They're getting ready to submerge Luke.\n\nLUKE: Sweet Christmas.\n\nCLAIRE: If the procedure gets too painful, just raise your hand in a fist and I'll shut it down, okay?\n\nLUKE: Like this?\n\nCLAIRE: Right on.\n\nThey check that Burstein isn't listening.\n\nLUKE: You trust this dude?\n\nCLAIRE: Hell no.\n\nLUKE: If anything happens to me, if anything goes wrong, make sure he doesn't keep Reva's data. It cannot fall into the wrong hands. I don't care if you have to kill him.\n\nCLAIRE: I got you. But let's not go there, okay?\n\nLUKE: I'm serious. It's too dangerous. We can't have guys like me running around on every corner.\n\nCLAIRE: What are you talking about? There's nobody like you.\n\nBURSTEIN: All right, let's go.\n\nCLAIRE: Okay, okay.\n\nThey put a breathing apparatus over Luke's face.\n\nCLAIRE: Good? Okay.\n\nBURSTEIN: Good.\n\nThey lift the bed-thing holding Luke and start lowering it into the boiling acid.\n\nBURSTEIN: Keep your hands clear.\n\nCLAIRE: Yeah.\n\nBURSTEIN: All right. Down. Hang in there. It's going to be okay.\n\nLuke starts to scream as soon as it touches his skin.\n\nCLAIRE: How long do we keep him down?\n\nBURSTEIN: I don't know. Just have to let the acid do its work.\n\nCLAIRE: Now?\n\nBURSTEIN: Not yet.\n\nThe machine monitoring his vitals flashes a warning for cardiac distress. Claire starts to raise Luke out.\n\nBURSTEIN: What are you doing? He's not ready yet. All right. Hold on.\n\nThey try a scalpel on his skin but it breaks.\n\nBURSTEIN: Damn it. Dip him again.\n\nCLAIRE: What?\n\nBURSTEIN: Again! Again!\n\nCLAIRE: One more.\n\nThe monitor sounds another warning.\n\nCLAIRE: We're losing him.\n\nBURSTEIN: It's not working. Why isn't it working?\n\nCLAIRE: We're losing him!\n\nBURSTEIN: It's not working!\n\nCLAIRE:  What do we do?\n\nBURSTEIN: I don't know.\n\nThe monitor makes the \"flatlining\" sound. Luke's hand lifts out of the acid and makes a fist.\n\nCLAIRE: Shit!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1397178", "artist_names": "The 5th Dimension", "full_title":

while it\u2019s near to you\nDon't wait till it's gone\n\nWhen I was a baby, mama rocked me in her arms whenever I cried\nShe picked me up when life knocked me\nShe was always there by my side\nShe said one, one day there'll be a man in your life\nTo take the place of a mother\nNow he, he'll give you joy, a happy life\nBut swear by this advice:\nCherish what is dear to you while it's near to you\nDon't wait till it's gone\nCherish (what is) what\u2019s dear to you while it\u2019s near to you\nDon't wait till it\u2019s gone\n\nI strayed away from mama's advice\nAnd lost the only man in my life\nI never gave enough of myself\nSo he found love with somebody else\nNow my lover is gone\n'Cause I drove him to the arms of another love\nI lost a love, was warm and tender, 'cause I failed to remember:\n\nCherish (what is) what\u2019s dear to you while it's near to you\nDon't wait till it's gone\nCherish (what is) what's dear to you while it's near to you\nDon't wait till it's

roar\n\n[Chorus]\n(Stop the war, now)\nJust like thunder y\u2019all\nDon\u2019t put it off another day\nSing a song now\n(Stop the war, now)\nListen to me, y'all\n(Don\u2019t put it off) another day\nListen to me\n[Verse 2]\nA knock on the door, there's a letter from the war\nSaying, \"Greetings, we want you\"\nIf I refuse to fight they say that that ain\u2019t right\nAnd time you'll have to do\nSomebody please tell me what is war all about?\nAnd why must I kill against my will?\nI just can\u2019t figure it out\nOw!\n\n[Chorus]\n(Stop the war, now)\nGood God, hear me say\nDon\u2019t put it off another day\nEverybody sing\nStop the war, now, now, now, now\nDon\u2019t put it off another day\nAll we got to do is, listen\n(Give peace a chance)\nAww, don\u2019t throw another life away\n\n[Verse 3]\nListen to me now\nThink about all the soldiers\nThat are dead and gone today\nIf you\u2019d ask them to fight again\nWhat do you think they\u2019d say?\nI\u2019m not trying to be funny\nJust trying to get my point across\nWar is world's enemy #1\nIt\u2019s that time that we called it off\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nStop the war, now\nGood god, hear me say\nDon\u2019t put it off another day\nEverybody\u2019s singing\nStop the war, now\nDon\u2019t put it off another day\n\n[Bridge]\nAll we got to do is, Lord\nGive peace a chance\nDon\u2019t, don\u2019t throw another life away\n\n[Verse 4]\nCasualties pile up each day\nCemeteries are overflowing\nLeaders of the world (?)\nBut the death list keeps right on growin'\nAnd what does a mother get in return\nFor the life of the son she\u2019s lost?\nA few measly pennies a month\nA medal, a babe, and a doggone cost\n\n[Chorus]\nStop the war now\nGood God, hear me say\nDon\u2019t put it off another day\nEverybody sing\nStop the war, now\nDon\u2019t put it off another day\n[Verse 5]\nWhy can\u2019t we just (Give peace a chance)\nPlease!\nDon\u2019t throw another life away\nCan\u2019t you see?\nEnough blood has been shed by the wounded and the dead\nEnough blood has been shed by the wounded and the dead\nOw!\nEnough blood has been shed by the wounded and the dead\nOw!\n\n[Chorus]\nListen!\nStop the war, now\nGood God, everybody\nDon\u2019t put it off another day\n\n[Outro]\nThis is a message to the leaders of the world\n(Give peace a chance)\nAww!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0,

Lyrics[Verse 1: Intrinzik]\nYou fuckin haters must be blind to the fact\nThat I'm grinding, I got Tech N9ne on the track\nI'm supplying the crack all the hustlers need\nAnd my UGH fam make you busters bleed\nThis world, is all mine for the taking\nThis world, is my shrine in the making\nAll I gotta do is draw the line in the pavement\nWith the heart of a God and the mind of Satan\nI used to do a little but the little wouldn't do it\nSo the little got more and more\nUnderground Hustlin' started blowing up\nIntrinzik started growing up, I got both feet in the door\nImma make sure that my presence is known, in this world\nUse my words just to sever your dome, in this world\nINT up in Heaven just staring at the gates with Aaron Yates\nWe don't really care who hates\n[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]\nYo, this world is fucked up, this world is stuck up\nThey wanna hem you up and hang you up with your nuts cut\nThe blood and much guts, evil is a plus\nSnuffs in every dead bottle, the killers you must duck\nTrouble and animosity, tragic atrocities\nLove is an oddity, evil is the dichotomy\nIf you ain't got the love for me, get the fuck off of me\nTech is the prophesy, philosophies make them a mockery\nMurder and race hate, the world is that\nYou wanna vacate, the world is whack\nGun in your face, makes the world impact\nWith devil's who replace fate, the world in cracks\nHere come the fire, coming to fry ya\nComing to burn ya cause your maker denied ya\nTech N9ne got the wings taking me higher\nWhen the flames hit the world and the evil retire\n\n[Verse 3: U-Fol]\nFucked up, I'm like why not let my brain rot while I try pot\nMaybe sip booze and I been influenced to mix it with a mushroom\nOr two to boot, why's the computer always need to reboot\nMomma told me like imma tell you, I'm a virus\nMonsters do whatever we gotta do to survive this, I got a knife in my coat pocket\nI rock this knife more than a mic, I can't stop it\nI might go off, hands round your neck like a locket\nMy noggin is sick, it seem to only think twisted\nCats with a sick mind, that's like mine\nWe're all psychopathic on a wrath in a pack with a bunch of hatchets\nTwiztid Psychopathics like a tat, you can't take it back\nNo contracts, fuck rap, this is murder contrast\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Illson The Imortill]\nI don't ride no dicks on this cypher shit\nI'm the type of kid to come ignite your crib\nAnd then wife your chick with the finest shit\nI'm lying, trick, on the tyrant twitch\nI got that fire shit that'll fire kids\nGive it up, Burger King is hiring\nI'll be there too, fires fire your fryer in\nWe need a number 7, who the fuck hired him?\nI don't want your votes, I don't want your likes\nI don't give a fuck about a cypher hyped\nLast or first, my verse is the first to sure the nicest, right?\nMy raps absurd, I work the mic all night\nI run the night shift, you punks are eyelids\nCut you all off like a drunk that's driving\nPsylocibin, I fuck your mind kid\nI be an OG like what makes my eyes red\n\n[Verse 5: Mr. Grey]\nI never rap about money cause I got none\nThird world in my brain, soul at an auction\nOxen blood in my veins, yo concoction\nCaution, carful carnivore, cage boxing\nFlossin gasoline, listerine\nFlamethrower, smoke screen\n151 and a match, I burn 16s\nI got the murder weapon, just supply the scene, put em in a body bag\nThe world made me in the beginning, sinning had me grinning\nI'm a super villain, world kept spinning\nThen the devil started winning\nTell a motherfucker 'What you really wanna do'\nDo you use voodoo, or do it use you\nHeld hands with hex, left abused\nBad news since birth, Napalm fumes\nI bring doom in the light of the moon\nWe've been found fit for a fiery tomb\n[Verse 6: Insane Loc]\nI gotta get away-\nFrom the grind, in my mind\nI'm wasting my time\nSitting round waiting on flatline\nTime is changed, rearranged\nSame game, just different faces\nIt's like I'm walking in a snake pit\nEvery direction, a lesson with no blessing\nI'm stressing, Smith n Wesson for protection, I ain't bullshitting\nI know these streets real, streets kill\nKeep steel or wind up getting yo cap peeled\nThere's even bullets with no names\nKillers caught up in this game with no shame\nNo aim, left that boy with no brain\nInnocent, pray he died with no pain\nIt's so sad to see, tragedy\nIs the lord mad at me? Will he disconnect my battery?\nSo much strife in one lifetime\nIt's hard to live a life something like mine in this world\n\n[Verse 7: Spawn]\nGrabbing a mil, take it\nI'm ripping shit cause I'm wicked\nThe bitches say I'm delicious\nMy hated niggas, we kick it\nThe haters know that I'm vicious\nFrom times of being malicious\nI had to make a decision\nAnd follow my fucking vision\nThese haters don't fucking listen\nI'm a time bomb; hear the ticking\nSo nigga, stop all the bitching\nFeel the heat, get out the kitchen\nWant to pee? No pot to piss in\nFollow me, I got precision\nImma beat, hit hard collision\nSuck the D, yo bitch be wishing\nMH nigga, red and black nigga\nSo back back nigga, or we attack nigga\nI'm going bananas, wearing my black bandana\nHannah Montana couldn't handle my Joe Montana\nFrom Oklahoma to Atlanta, I'm playing these hoes Piana\nI'm talking about Rihanna, Savannah, Susanna, Joanna\nGiving these hoeos something they couldn't even fucking handle\nA nigga disappeared and ended up in Louisiana\n\n[Verse 8: Yung Snuff]\nWelcome to the underground, words are weapons\nSmith n Wesson, trigger the murder one through the sentence\nScribble lyrics to kill em, with a clip of number 2 pencil\nPistol wirst, whistling syllable, missile tips\nShut up, I'll hit you with the rhythm and bitch, you'll be missing limbs\nFlick of the fingertips, reaper with ink, he's speaking the beat to death\nSinking my teeth and blood shed effect em\nYou ain't contending, pretending you hawk venom\nBut dog, I char letters, ugh\nI spit unleaded, my pencil be giving enemas\nI chop the head off competitors, off my genitals\nConfederate, genereal, Gettysburg, taking the pen to war\nYou been a farse, bitch it's over, I'm calling menopause\nSpit it when Tech in the building and rappers act like a centerfold\nYou're pitiful, my penning considered lyrically criminal\nYou're fictional, I'm biblically mythical, ain't got shit to prove\nShit to lose, back to the block, kid I got shit to do\nHa\n\n[Verse 9: Doze]\nThis shit's for real, how these pricks can steal\nThey never miss a meal, they just sit and chill\nWhile I'm stuck with a list of bills\nThis motherfucker's so pissed, I'll kill\nGot ya chicks on the strip sucking dick for pills\nThey got my clique doing bits in provincial jails\nThey got everybody living in poverty while they caking\nI rep the wicked shit but I working with Satan\nPeople try to say I'm fucking crazy cause I rap\nBut I see people dumping new born baby's in the trash\nActing shady with ya cash, smash ya lady in the ass\nBecause no one's showing love as long as they be getting that\nThis a fucked up world, that's why I don't have kids\nI could bust up burl and they would smoke that shit\nWhile daddy's in the next room, chopping blow\nYour mom cops dough hosting donkey shows\n\n[Verse 10: Phat Six]\nBack on the track, I'm hitting it up ona dab\nWhen the opportunity falls in reach, I'm gon' grab\nImma take it and make it and aim it up like a mag\nI ain't never had clothes, I've been dressed in rags\nAnd my heart full of pain cause it done took a stab\nIt's bleeding I've been feigning for a life with a meaning\nI've been reading on the demons and I don't know how they're leading\nIt's deceiving how they get us and they put us in the deep end\nBut I stay afloat on my own, toxic pollution is home\nI've been running with the ball trying to put myself in the zone\nBut all I do is drop it, trying to take off like a rocket\nBreak it down and bag it and turn it into a profit\nI know you like a lineman and you here to stop it\nBut any motherfucker trying to disrespect\nWill catch a blow to the nose like Johnny Depp\n\n[Verse 11: Dead Arm]\nThe world today, fucked and deranged\nCall it strange but it's like a migraine\nAnd it stays in the brain and it brings on the pain\nTurn people every day into something inhumane\nSick in the head ever since the umbilical\nMy birth was a miracle, blessed to be lyrical\nThe world so pitiful, everything so typical\nPeople steal residuals, fucked individuals\nDead Arm now got a show with Tech (show with Tech)\nOpened up, killed it no regret (no regret)\nScreaming ovation, what I get\nNever thought I do a track with Prozak next\nBut I stay on the grind every time\nAnytime that I need to speak my mind, let out what's inside\nNo more confined like I'm wrapped in twine\nWon't let it bind, ease my mind, I won't be declined\n\n[Verse 12: Gangrene The Prophit]\n2-6-2, Wisco, Ayy\nLand of the hopeless cold but there ain't no shame\nHad a couple homies lose soul cause of no pay\nG-T-P to the plate, cause there ain't no way\nI'll take a knee, these haters mistaking me\nFor bitch-made in the genes, they nothing but fake, my G\nBoy we feed the streets, the team is now complete\nWe taking over everything in sight you see\nReady at the say, get em with the K.O\nSiha bout to come at ya head, you better lay low\nWaddup Kush, hey Smoke, we on our way bro\nGreen Nation Prophits taking names hoe\nNow I got a son so I gotta quit the gang bang\nI paid my dues, it's time to shine, I'm aging\nI been accused of dickriding the strange thing\nI pay no mind, cause every love is the same strain, one\n\n[Verse 13: Dees]\nThis world we live in is far from perfect\nPeople as a society tend not to inspect, ideas\nFreedom is an illusion\nPoliticans receive power only to abuse it\nThe media controls almost all of our beliefs\nThere aree so many wolves wearing the clothes of sheep\nIt's time for us to weed out these individuals\nTime to realise who are the real criminals\nPeople doing jail-time for a nick sack\nWhile mothers are free to smoke crack\nIt's a well known fact that the government lies\nThey live tax-free while we struggle to survive\nObama shuts down, government goes on vacation\nInstead of getting head, he wants to fuck the whole nation\nAll of this could've been prevented from coming\nBut Clinton had to have sexual relations with that woman\n\n[Verse 14: Playz]\nI'm climbing up the ladder backwards\nGotta watch the hater stature\nNever shocked, on static guard\nAlways armed for primitive actions\nA random asshole's patented plan\nTo spoil my day in a selfish manner\nBut I was placed to raise cadavers\nAnd turn some brains to fecal matter\nAn advocate of street justice, hunting down the bustas\nWith lethal injection of Satan's piss for baby fuckers\nYou can breathe the decrepitness, parasitic disease to end us\nOnly a female's vagina will ever determine when Playz is fucked\nMy mind desensitized by life and the burden, we live for wealth\nThat's why the devil looks in the mirror and sees Playz within himself\nIt's my rich quick seminar behind a mind with a devil heart\nIdoled eyes will rip you apart, stab in the back, a weaker man's target\nI seen about all of it, falling quick; no Pologrim\nIntravenous fiendish folks, swallowing dick for a partial hit\nSomething to kill the pain a bit, but I keep holding out\nProtect my family til the end, shotgun humping a zombie mouth\n\n[Verse 15: YDMC]\nAs I strive for success, I could give a fuck less\nAbout anybody trnna take me down regardless\nOf the governmental structures shutting down, it's bullshit\nBut the cops can keep on locking up my clowns, it's senseless\nSo prepare the masses for many cranium smashes\nUpon the skulls, I'll be laughing when apocalypse happens\nAnd the economy crashes and Earth's destructive habits\nWill establish a new world order, now can you imagine\nBody parts for currency, black stock marketing\nAnd every building burning off the sweet smell of kerosene\nWith big brother rolling in a bullet-proof limousine\nPeeping out the scene, holding military magazines\nIt's flattering amist all global blood splattering\nAnd flag tattering, the motherfuckers can mention me\nThe epitome of kings, YDMC and INT with Techa Nin\nThis is Real Timne, this is not a dream\n\n[Verse 16: Cloud9 NinjaLOC]\nYo I can't get it outta me, the sickness inside of me\nFuck your psychology, think I need a lobotomy\nI got voices, fucking demons taking over my mind\nTelling me that I'm fucked, I'm running out of time\nAnd I try and try, but there's no escape\nAnd all I really wanna do is leave this place\nNow the world is burning slow, in jet black haze\nWhile everyone is stuck in this illusionary maze\nWe keep it strange; though the times have changed\nAnd the industry decided to fill the game with lames\nThey're all the same, carbon copies put to shame\nClaiming they're hard? Well I bring the pain\nBurning all these bitches, while I'm spitting flames\nChopping up and sniffing the competition like cocaine\nMelt your mind like it's pouring acid rain\nNinjaLOC is the one who put the bullet in your brain\n\n[Verse 17: Chosen Few Crew]\nThis world is corrupt, interupt abruptly\nRun for the bucks, nunchucks I'm chucking\nSee the way that they looking, it's the way I'm cooking\nWe the bait got em hooking, everybodyt wanna hook em\nI cast these clowns out, my sound will drown out\nWe will run you down no runaround\nPound for pound, give em a run for their money\nThere's fire in my eyes, and hunger in my stomach\nBetter remember my name when you hear it: C-H-A-Z\nFrom a crew that is strange do not fear it\nRepping LV CFC on the tee in the cypher bringing heat\nTecca Nina in the ring so you know we killing beast\nEpic 1 from the East of the Veg\nPass me the mic, I'm a beast, let me stay\nLeaving bullet holes in those who oppose this\nThe last of our kind, we the illest poets\n\n[Verse 18: D.CrazE]\nD.CrazE on the cypher with Tech N9ne\nI wreck lines when I rhymes like Amanda Bynes\nLatino back on the track, don't slack, let the spic shine\nIntrinzik Real Time, it's a crime for me to ride pine\nGet in line and witness the rising of the pheonix\nImpregnate your brain like a semen from a penis\nThen throw it back up like dinners of bulimics\nBetter back up, I'm bad to the bone and you're squeemish\nNow everybody want to be around when I get it in\nNever listen to the lesson that I found when I lived in sin\nI guess I should sit down and hold my breath\nThis world needs a hero but there's no one left\nSo I'll lead by example, and take up arms\nFuck the man in charge, time to ring the alarm\nThis world is fucked but we can still make a difference\nFind a purpose for existance instead of living as a witness\n\n[Verse 19: Graphic Grim]\nAnd maybe they be noticing how I be floating things\nLike Pennywise's balloons, or \"Half-Baked\" buffoons\nChappelle & Bruer Excell but sooner, on shrooms\nAin't pulling no strings, for no bitches\nWhen they keep obsessing over it, they're pussies\nThat's harpoons\nThen when I meet em up The New Mexico chopper fresher flow, slaughters\nWhen I speed it up fucking with the weed\nI puff as Strange took us to the sanitarium\nNow we got a Metallica Monster that's scaring em\nToo many bodies to bury em\nTo the cemetary gates we carry em\nDezert Banditz, keep it gangster\nLike Snoop in his murder case with Philip Woldermarian\nThe threshold of reality and death is wearing thin\nBut it could never floor us\nRappers, I diss em and they get butt-hurt like The Jokerr\nGetting kicked off the tour bus\nFucking sick in the head, and they can't cure us\nAnd I got a juggalette fetish\nSo show me your tats, and your tits if you wanna get with us\nBut it's Graphic Grim & Tech N9ne, snap at your neck line\nLike vampires, staying up way past your bed time\nFucking 'Tales From The Crypt' sick\nDoing coke in a morgue, now that's what I fucking call a deadline\nDie\n\n[Verse 20: Yung Statz]\nSick of this fucking world boutta go and up the crime rate\nCause in my mind state, I'm always trnna find ways, and crime pays\nWhen you haven't eaten for 5 days\nAnd get a sucky ass check for nothing, I ain't gon' die today\nImma hustle until the death of me\nUntil there's nothing left in me, so just let me be\nI'll make you motherfuckers rest in peace\nWhen I grab the strap and go shoot at the police\nStarting some armageddon shit, you don't want it with BMD\nThen dump ya body in the swimming pool\nAfter I get what the fuck I need then I bounce like the shit was cool\nEven though the shit wasn't cool\nI gotta play it cool, that's what the fuck I gotta do\nI gotta mek these moves, tell me what do I got to lose?\nI had to go and get up on this track with Tech\nBefore the y figure out what I did and start asking questions\nWho the fuck wanna test this in Real Time\nCause Real Time's hectic\n\n[Verse 21: Mister Hyde]\nOn this mic I wreck shit, eating cinnamon toasted haters for breakfast\nThat's how I kepe a full health gauge, you don't wanna be thinking about a deathwish\nThe world ends, but then, who be welcome?\nWho in the kingdom of Heaven? Who down in Hell's pit?\nDo you live for the greater good or the devil shit?\nAre you a puppet not comprehending intelligence?\nAre you a slave to the system and how they selling it?\nIf free as the elephant, I'm Tony Jaa and avenging it\nProtecting it well, defending nice, I respect the shit\nMaking bangers with legendary motherfuckers is necessary\nI'm coming up out of the gutter with all of my brothers\nNo one's segregated, educate the uneducated\nDon't make em famous up in the matrix, look here across the nation\nMister Hyde and Yung Statz of Beast Mode Division\nAre gonna be making some changes, you getting shapeshifted; hater get it\n\n[Verse 22: Terror]\nPause, it's a new edition\nComing and wrecking the competition\nLeaving you bitches in submission\nIn my mind, you ain't submitting\nThis is just what I'm admitting\nGather around motherfuckers cause it ain't all mittens, yeah\nThis world's gone haywire\nEverybody is killing themsleves for their own motherfucking desire\nThis world's gone insane\nReady to blow up with the dust cause there's nothing left\nThe dead will rise again and there's nothing you can do\nThere's nothing left in this world\nEverybody's gonna die and that's the truth\nNothing left alive, no one's gonna survive\nIn the end, there is no life\nHeaven or Hell? Wait in line\nAnd wait patiently for the reaper to decide\n\n[Verse 23: Smoq]\nHeaven sent, I'm just hella bent\nOn how being benevolent is irrelevant, I'm telling you\nOnce they catch a scent of the medicine\nThe reference and I are peddling, these men will go nuts\nOver the irreverence given to me by these little grey men in the middle of the night\nBut that's just a bit of the Hell I'm in\nSitting in my counselor's office and I'm telling him of nightmares and bright flares\nI wake up, they're right there\nI'm out here running shit like I'm in a hamster wheel\nSo what's the point of chasing bread if I can't even eat my next meal?\nDo you know how that feels? When people have never paid me enough for my photo-shoots\nDirty politicans are acting like I don't know the scoop\nWith a whistle in my hand, I'd only blow the truth\nYou'll probably listen to this verse like I pulled a tooth\nNow it's time to break the mold rather than do that with which we are told\nNow I'm finally on a track with Tech thanks to Caviar Gold\n\n[Verse 24: Torchur]\nUnderground hustling, Real Time Cypher\nMouthpiece like Hot Rod Rowdy Piper\nAlways precise, target hit like Sniper\nLoyal to this, a hip-hop lifer\nVerbal artillery, kill this production\nFollow my lyrics, mass destruction\nMusic's changed, digital distribution\nCDs are dead, let's find this solution\nUnderground choppers, tracks still banging\nLet's move units, this project slanging\nWords are weapons, got your ears ranging\nRadio garbage, mainstream mics hanging\nStrange emcees, Torchor, Tech N9ne\nStop sleeping, Google me, check mine\nReady to sign, snap your neck line\nA massacre, this Richard Speck shine\n\n[Verse 25: The White Noize]\nWhite Noize, Intrinzik and Techa Nina\nUnderground hustling couldn't get any meaner\nD-Roc and B-Dubb here to fuck the world up\nRip the game a new asshole, we out fo' first blood\nWhen times get rough, I reminisce of what I love\nIt's all about freedom and you can never have enough\nSo elevate your mind, look at the depths of night\nLight up the kind, open your eyes and fly through time\nNothing's impossible, don't let an oppurtunity slip by\nUnstoppable motivation as we live our life\nThe government's corrupted, pull a nine mili busting\nFighting for our meals while the police be doing nothing\nWe underground hu-hu-hustling, White Noize and Techa Nina\nBetter believe I am not bluffing, fucking the worldwide, dawg\nYou'll see now I'm keeping it coming\nBetter in moment, speed\nWe independant finna be killing everybody in the industry\nIntrinzik's Real Time now you suckas gonna remember me\nD.R.O.C merking the beat, going beserk\nGonna hurt everyone of my enemies\n\n[Verse 26: Fury]\nI must be the weirdest motherfucker in the cypher\nMy mic hurts every time I rhyme with my words\nMy life's work, show these wack rappers what I'm worth\nTurn them back to fans, send em back, their spine hurts\nI fight worse than if you tried to take my life first\nQuench my thirst with your blood, it's light work\nUtilities off, your pipe bursts\nI put this little thing to your head, your mind squirts\nAnd I burst laughing, did I hurt you faggots?\nSending you packing to a hearse with maggots\nYou're a Matthew Shepard, I'm a herd of Iraq\nVets who hate fags, and got a thing for a snapped neck\nThat's how I look at all of you\nGrowing up, this is all I knew, now I am the boss of you\nAnd now it's impossible to stop this crew\nWeirdo Movement, now we on top of youEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1288642", "artist_names": "Grand Funk Railroad", "full_title": "Mean Mistreater

the time\n\n[Verse 2]\nAll day long I think of things\nBut nothing seems to satisfy\nThink I'll lose my mind\nIf I don't find something to pacify\n[Bridge]\nCan you help me\nOccupy my brain?\nOh yeah\n\n[Verse 3]\nI need someone to show me\nThe things in life that I can't find\nI can't see the things that make true happiness\nI must be blind\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Verse 4]\nMake a joke and I will sigh\nAnd you will laugh and I will cry\nHappiness, I cannot feel\nAnd love to me is so unreal\n\n[Verse 5]\nAnd so, as you hear these words\nTelling you now of my state\nI tell you to enjoy

IN LOVE\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To admit you to the 'little nucleus,' the 'little group,' the 'little clan' at the Verdurins', one condition sufficed, but that one was indispensable; you must give tacit adherence to a Creed one of whose articles was that the young pianist, whom Mme. Verdurin had taken under her patronage that year, and of whom she said \"Really, it oughtn't to be allowed, to play Wagner as well as that!\" left both Plant\u00e9 and Rubinstein 'sitting'; while Dr. Cottard was a more brilliant diagnostician than Potain. Each 'new recruit' whom the Verdurins failed to persuade that the evenings spent by other people, in other houses than theirs, were as dull as ditch-water, saw himself banished forthwith. Women being in this respect more rebellious than men, more reluctant to lay aside all worldly curiosity and the desire to find out for themselves whether other drawing-rooms might not sometimes be as entertaining, and the Verdurins feeling, moreover, that this critical spirit and this demon of frivolity might, by their contagion, prove fatal to the orthodoxy of the little church, they had been obliged to expel, one after another, all those of the 'faithful' who were of the female sex\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively that season (for all that Mme. Verdurin herself was a thoroughly 'good' woman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich and wholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own accord severed all connection) to a young woman almost of a 'certain class,' a Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy, whom Mme. Verdurin called by her Christian name, Odette, and pronounced a 'love,' and to the pianist's aunt, who looked as though she had, at one period, 'answered the bell': ladies quite ignorant of the world, who in their social simplicity were so easily led to believe that the Princesse de Sagan and the Duchesse de Guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor wretches, in order to have anyone at their dinner-parties, that if somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of either of those great dames, the old doorkeeper and the woman of 'easy virtue' would have contemptuously declined\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verdurins never invited you to dinner; you had your 'place laid' there. There was never any programme for the evening's entertainment. The young pianist would play, but only if he felt inclined, for no one was forced to do anything, and, as M. Verdurin used to say: \"We're all friends here. Liberty Hall, you know!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the pianist suggested playing the Ride of the Valkyries, or the Prelude to Tristan, Mme. Verdurin would protest, not that the music was displeasing to her, but, on the contrary, that it made too violent an impression. \"Then you want me to have one of my headaches? You know quite well, it's the same every time he plays that. I know what I'm in for. Tomorrow, when I want to get up\u2014nothing doing!\" If he was not going to play they talked, and one of the friends\u2014usually the painter who was in favour there that year\u2014would \"spin,\" as M. Verdurin put it, \"a damned funny yarn that made 'em all split with laughter,\" and especially Mme. Verdurin, for whom\u2014so strong was her habit of taking literally the figurative accounts of her emotions\u2014Dr. Cottard, who was then just starting in general practice, would \"really have to come one day and set her jaw, which she had dislocated with laughing too much.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Evening dress was barred, because you were all 'good pals,' and didn't want to look like the 'boring people' who were to be avoided like the plague, and only asked to the big evenings, which were given as seldom as possible, and then only if it would amuse the painter or make the musician better known. The rest of the time you were quite happy playing charades and having supper in fancy dress, and there was no need to mingle any strange element with the little 'clan.'\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But just as the 'good pals' came to take a more and more prominent place in Mme. Verdurin's life, so the 'bores,' the 'nuisances' grew to include everybody and everything that kept her friends away from her, that made them sometimes plead 'previous engagements,' the mother of one, the professional duties of another, the 'little place in the country' of a third. If Dr. Cottard felt bound to say good night as soon as they rose from table, so as to go back to some patient who was seriously ill; \"I don't know,\" Mme. Verdurin would say, \"I'm sure it will do him far more good if you don't go disturbing him again this evening; he will have a good night without you; to-morrow morning you can go round early and you will find him cured.\" From the beginning of December it would make her quite ill to think that the 'faithful' might fail her on Christmas and New Year's Days. The pianist's aunt insisted that he must accompany her, on the latter, to a family dinner at her mother's\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You don't suppose she'll die, your mother,\" exclaimed Mme. Verdurin bitterly, \"if you don't have dinner with her on New Year's Day, like people in the provinces!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Her uneasiness was kindled again in Holy Week: \"Now you, Doctor, you're a sensible, broad-minded man; you'll come, of course, on Good Friday, just like any other day?\" she said to Cottard in the first year of the little 'nucleus,' in a loud and confident voice, as though there could be no doubt of his answer. But she trembled as she waited for it, for if he did not come she might find herself condemned to dine alone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I shall come on Good Friday\u2014to say good-bye to you, for we are going to spend the holidays in Auvergne.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"In Auvergne? To be eaten by fleas and all sorts of creatures! A fine lot of good that will do you!\" And after a solemn pause: \"If you had only told us, we would have tried to get up a party, and all gone there together, comfortably.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, too, if one of the 'faithful' had a friend, or one of the ladies a young man, who was liable, now and then, to make them miss an evening, the Verdurins, who were not in the least afraid of a woman's having a lover, provided that she had him in their company, loved him in their company and did not prefer him to their company, would say: \"Very well, then, bring your friend along.\" And he would be put to the test, to see whether he was willing to have no secrets from Mme. Verdurin, whether he was susceptible of being enrolled in the 'little clan.' If he failed to pass, the faithful one who had introduced him would be taken on one side, and would be tactfully assisted to quarrel with the friend or mistress. But if the test proved satisfactory, the newcomer would in turn be numbered among the 'faithful.' And so when, in the course of this same year, the courtesan told M. Verdurin that she had made the acquaintance of such a charming gentleman, M. Swann, and hinted that he would very much like to be allowed to come, M. Verdurin carried the request at once to his wife. He never formed an opinion on any subject until she had formed hers, his special duty being to carry out her wishes and those of the 'faithful' generally, which he did with boundless ingenuity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear, Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy has something to say to you. She would like to bring one of her friends here, a M. Swann. What do you say?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of perfection like that. Be quiet; no one asked your opinion. I tell you that you are a piece of perfection.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just as you like,\" replied Odette, in an affected tone, and then went on: \"You know I'm not fishing for compliments.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very well; bring your friend, if he's nice.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now there was no connection whatsoever between the 'little nucleus' and the society which Swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would have thought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional a position in the world, to seek an introduction to the Verdurins. But Swann was so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the women of the aristocracy, once they had taught him all that there was to learn, he had ceased to regard those naturalisation papers, almost a patent of nobility, which the Faubourg Saint-Germain had bestowed upon him, save as a sort of negotiable bond, a letter of credit with no intrinsic value, which allowed him to improvise a status for himself in some little hole in the country, or in some obscure quarter of Paris, where the good-looking daughter of a local squire or solicitor had taken his fancy. For at such times desire, or love itself, would revive in him a feeling of vanity from which he was now quite free in his everyday life, although it was, no doubt, the same feeling which had originally prompted him towards that career as a man of fashion in which he had squandered his intellectual gifts upon frivolous amusements, and had made use of his erudition in matters of art only to advise society ladies what pictures to buy and how to decorate their houses; and this vanity it was which made him eager to shine, in the sight of any fair unknown who had captivated him for the moment, with a brilliance which the name of Swann by itself did not emit. And he was most eager when the fair unknown was in humble circumstances. Just as it is not by other men of intelligence that an intelligent man is afraid of being thought a fool, so it is not by the great gentleman but by boors and 'bounders' that a man of fashion is afraid of finding his social value underrated. Three-fourths of the mental ingenuity displayed, of the social falsehoods scattered broadcast ever since the world began by people whose importance they have served only to diminish, have been aimed at inferiors. And Swann, who behaved quite simply and was at his ease when with a duchess, would tremble^ for fear of being despised, and would instantly begin to pose, were he to meet her grace's maid\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike so many people, who, either from lack of energy or else from a resigned sense of the obligation laid upon them by their social grandeur to remain moored like houseboats to a certain point on the bank of the stream of life, abstain from the pleasures which are offered to them above and below that point, that degree in life in which they will remain fixed until the day of their death, and are content, in the end, to describe as pleasures, for want of any better, those mediocre distractions, that just not intolerable tedium which is enclosed there with them; Swann would endeavour not to find charm and beauty in the women with whom he must pass time, but to pass his time among women whom he had already found to be beautiful and charming. And these were, as often as not, women whose beauty was of a distinctly 'common' type, for the physical qualities which attracted him instinctively, and without reason, were the direct opposite of those that he admired in the women painted or sculptured by his favourite masters. Depth of character, or a melancholy expression on a woman's face would freeze his senses, which would, however, immediately melt at the sight of healthy, abundant, rosy human flesh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If on his travels he met a family whom it would have been more correct for him to make no attempt to know, but among whom a woman caught his eye, adorned with a special charm that was new to him, to remain on his 'high horse' and to cheat the desire that she had kindled in him, to substitute a pleasure different from that which he might have tasted in her company by writing to invite one of his former mistresses to come and join him, would have seemed to him as cowardly an abdication in the face of life, as stupid a renunciation of a new form of happiness as if, instead of visiting the country where he was, he had shut himself up in his own rooms and looked at 'views' of Paris. He did not immure himself in the solid structure of his social relations, but had made of them, so as to be able to set it up afresh upon new foundations wherever a woman might take his fancy, one of those collapsible tents which explorers carry about with them. Any part of it which was not portable or could not be adapted to some fresh pleasure he would discard as valueless, however enviable it might appear to others. How often had his credit with a duchess, built up of the yearly accumulation of her desire to do him some favour for which she had never found an opportunity, been squandered in a moment by his calling upon her, in an indiscreetly worded message, for a recommendation by telegraph which would put him in touch at once with one of her agents whose daughter he had noticed in the country, just as a starving man might barter a diamond for a crust of bread. Indeed, when it was too late, he would laugh at himself for it, for there was in his nature, redeemed by many rare refinements, an element of clownishness. Then he belonged to that class of intelligent men who have led a life of idleness, and who seek consolation and, perhaps, an excuse in the idea, which their idleness offers to their intelligence, of objects as worthy of their interest as any that could be attained by art or learning, the idea that 'Life' contains situations more interesting and more romantic than all the romances ever written. So, at least, he would assure and had no difficulty in persuading the more subtle among his friends in the fashionable world, notably the Baron de Charlus, whom he liked to amuse with stories of the startling adventures that had befallen him, such as when he had met a woman in the train, and had taken her home with him, before discovering that she was the sister of a reigning monarch, in whose hands were gathered, at that moment, all the threads of European politics, of which he found himself kept informed in the most delightful fashion, or when, in the complexity of circumstances, it depended upon the choice which the Conclave was about to make whether he might or might not become the lover of somebody's cook\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not only the brilliant phalanx of virtuous dowagers, generals and academicians, to whom he was bound by such close ties, that Swann compelled with so much cynicism to serve him as panders. All his friends were accustomed to receive, from time to time, letters which called on them for a word of recommendation or introduction, with a diplomatic adroitness which, persisting throughout all his successive 'affairs' and using different pretexts, revealed more glaringly than the clumsiest indiscretion, a permanent trait in his character and an unvarying quest. I used often to recall to myself when, many years later, I began to take an interest in his character because of the similarities which, in wholly different respects, it offered to my own, how, when he used to write to my grandfather (though not at the time we are now considering, for it was about the date of my own birth that Swann's great 'affair' began, and made a long interruption in his amatory practices) the latter, recognising his friend's handwriting on the envelope, would exclaim: \"Here is Swann asking for something; on guard!\" And, either from distrust or from the unconscious spirit of devilry which urges us to offer a thing only to those who do not want it, my grandparents would meet with an obstinate refusal the most easily satisfied of his prayers, as when he begged them for an introduction to a girl who dined with us every Sunday, and whom they were obliged, whenever Swann mentioned her, to pretend that they no longer saw, although they would be wondering, all through the week, whom they could invite to meet her, and often failed, in the end, to find anyone, sooner than make a sign to him who would so gladly have accepted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally a couple of my grandparents' acquaintance, who had been complaining for some time that they never saw Swann now, would announce with satisfaction, and perhaps with a slight inclination to make my grandparents envious of them, that he had suddenly become as charming as he could possibly be, and was never out of their house. My grandfather would not care to shatter their pleasant illusion, but would look at my grandmother, as he hummed the air of:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  What is this mystery?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  I cannot understand it;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or of:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Vision fugitive...;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  In matters such as this\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'Tis best to close one's eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few months later, if my grandfather asked Swann's new friend \"What about Swann? Do you still see as much of him as ever?\" the other's face would lengthen: \"Never mention his name to me again!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I thought that you were such friends...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had been intimate in this way for several months with some cousins of my grandmother, dining almost every evening at their house. Suddenly, and without any warning, he ceased to appear. They supposed him to be ill, and the lady of the house was going to send to inquire for him when, in her kitchen, she found a letter in his hand, which her cook had left by accident in the housekeeping book. In this he announced that he was leaving Paris and would not be able to come to the house again. The cook had been his mistress, and at the moment of breaking off relations she was the only one of the household whom he had thought it necessary to inform\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when his mistress for the time being was a woman in society, or at least one whose birth was not so lowly, nor her position so irregular that he was unable to arrange for her reception in 'society,' then for her sake he would return to it, but only to the particular orbit in which she moved or into which he had drawn her. \"No good depending on Swann for this evening,\" people would say; \"don't you remember, it's his American's night at the Opera?\" He would secure invitations for her to the most exclusive drawing-rooms, to those houses where he himself went regularly, for weekly dinners or for poker; every evening, after a slight 'wave' imparted to his stiffly brushed red locks had tempered with a certain softness the ardour of his bold green eyes, he would select a flower for his buttonhole and set out to meet his mistress at the house of one or other of the women of his circle; and then, thinking of the affection and admiration which the fashionable folk, whom he always treated exactly as he pleased, would, when he met them there, lavish upon him in the presence of the woman whom he loved, he would find a fresh charm in that worldly existence of which he had grown weary, but whose substance, pervaded and warmly coloured by the flickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him beautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been the realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of a face or a form which Swann had spontaneously, and without effort on his part, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at the theatre, he was introduced to Odette de Cr\u00e9cy by an old friend of his own, who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom he might very possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out to be harder of conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be conferring a special favour by the introduction. She had struck Swann not, certainly, as being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style of beauty which left him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire, which gave him, indeed, a sort of physical repulsion; as one of those women of whom every man can name some, and each will name different examples, who are the converse of the type which our senses demand. To give him any pleasure her profile was too sharp, her skin too delicate, her cheek-bones too prominent, her features too tightly drawn. Her eyes were fine, but so large that they seemed to be bending beneath their own weight, strained the rest of her face and always made her appear unwell or in an ill humour. Some time after this introduction at the theatre she had written to ask Swann whether she might see his collections, which would interest her so much, she, \"an ignorant woman with a taste for beautiful things,\" saying that she would know him better when once she had seen him in his 'home,' where she imagined him to be \"so comfortable with his tea and his books\"; although she had not concealed her surprise at his being in that part of the town, which must be so depressing, and was \"not nearly smart enough for such a very smart man.\" And when he allowed her to come she had said to him as she left how sorry she was to have stayed so short a time in a house into which she was so glad to have found her way at last, speaking of him as though he had meant something more to her than the rest of the people she knew, and appearing to unite their two selves with a kind of romantic bond which had made him smile. But at the time of life, tinged already with disenchantment, which Swann was approaching, when a man can content himself with being in love for the pleasure of loving without expecting too much in return, this linking of hearts, if it is no longer, as in early youth, the goal towards which love, of necessity, tends, still is bound to love by so strong an association of ideas that it may well become the cause of love if it presents itself first. In his younger days a man dreams of possessing the heart of the woman whom he loves; later, the feeling that he possesses the heart of a woman may be enough to make him fall in love with her. And 50, at an age when it would appear\u2014since one seeks in love before everything else a subjective pleasure\u2014that the taste for feminine beauty must play the larger part in its procreation, love may come into being, love of the most physical order, without any foundation in desire. At this time of life a man has already been wounded more than once by the darts of love; it no longer evolves by itself, obeying its own incomprehensible and fatal laws, before his passive and astonished heart. We come to its aid; we falsify it by memory and by suggestion; recognising one of its symptoms we recall and recreate the rest. Since we possess its hymn, engraved on our hearts in its entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the opening lines, potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for us to remember all that follows. And if she begin in the middle, where it sings of our existing, henceforward, for one another only, we are well enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow our partner, without hesitation, at the first pause in her voice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Odette de Cr\u00e9cy came again to see Swann; her visits grew more frequent, and doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he felt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in the interval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite of her youth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to him, that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he spontaneously admired. It must be remarked that Odette's face appeared thinner and more prominent than it actually was, because her forehead and the upper part of her cheeks, a single and almost plane surface, were covered by the masses of hair which women wore at that period, drawn forward in a fringe, raised in crimped waves and falling in stray locks over her ears; while as for her figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to make out its continuity (on account of the fashion then prevailing, and in spite of her being one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting forwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a sharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts, gave a woman, that year, the appearance of being composed of different sections badly fitted together; to such an extent did the frills, the flounces, the inner bodice follow, in complete independence, controlled only by the fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the line which led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of vertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere attached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her own, found herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely buried\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, after Odette had left him, Swann would think with a smile of her telling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again; he remembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him that it might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at him then, fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her a touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in the front of her round bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black velvet. \"And won't you,\" she had ventured, \"come just once and take tea with me?\" He had pleaded pressure of work, an essay\u2014which, in reality, he had abandoned years ago\u2014on Vermeer of Delft. \"I know that I am quite useless,\" she had replied, \"a little wild thing like me beside a learned great man like you. I should be like the frog in the fable! And yet I should so much like to learn, to know things, to be initiated. What fun it would be to become a regular bookworm, to bury my nose in a lot of old papers!\" she had gone on, with that self-satisfied air which a smart woman adopts when she insists that her one desire is to give herself up, without fear of soiling her fingers, to some unclean task, such as cooking the dinner, with her \"hands right in the dish itself.\" \"You will only laugh at me, but this painter who stops you from seeing me,\" she meant Vermeer, \"I have never even heard of him; is he alive still? Can I see any of his things in Paris, so as to have some idea of what is going on behind that great brow which works so hard, that head which I feel sure is always puzzling away about things; just to be able to say 'There, that's what he's thinking about!' What a dream it would be to be able to help you with your work.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had sought an excuse in his fear of forming new friendships, which he gallantly described as his fear of a hopeless passion. \"You are afraid of falling in love? How funny that is, when I go about seeking nothing else, and would give my soul just to find a little love somewhere!\" she had said, so naturally and with such an air of conviction that he had been genuinely touched. \"Some woman must have made you suffer. And you think that the rest are all like her. She can't have understood you: you are so utterly different from ordinary men. That's what I liked about you when I first saw you; I felt at once that you weren't like everybody else.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And then, besides, there's yourself\u2014\u2014\" he had continued, \"I know what women are; you must have a whole heap of things to do, and never any time to spare.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I? Why, I have never anything to do. I am always free, and I always will be free if you want me. At whatever hour of the day or night it may suit you to see me, just send for me, and I shall be only too delighted to come. Will you do that? Do you know what I should really like\u2014to introduce you to Mme. Verdurin, where I go every evening. Just fancy my finding you there, and thinking that it was a little for my sake that you had gone.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No doubt, in thus remembering their conversations, in thinking about her thus when he was alone, he did no more than call her image into being among those of countless other women in his romantic dreams; but if, thanks to some accidental circumstance (or even perhaps without that assistance, for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment when a mental state, hitherto latent, makes itself felt, may well have had no influence whatsoever upon that state), the image of Odette de Cr\u00e9cy came to absorb the whole of his dreams, if from those dreams the memory of her could no longer be eliminated, then her bodily imperfections would no longer be of the least importance, nor would the conformity of her body, more or less than any other, to the requirements of Swann's taste; since, having become the body of her whom he loved, it must henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It so happened that my grandfather had known\u2014which was more than could be said of any other actual acquaintance\u2014the family of these Verdurins. But he had entirely severed his connection with what he called \"young Verdurin,\" taking a general view of him as one who had fallen\u2014though without losing hold of his millions\u2014among the riff-raff of Bohemia. One day he received a letter from Swann asking whether my grandfather could put him in touch with the Verdurins. \"On guard! on guard!\" he exclaimed as he read it, \"I am not at all surprised; Swann was bound to finish up like this. A nice lot of people! I cannot do what he asks, because, in the first place, I no longer know the gentleman in question. Besides, there must be a woman in it somewhere, and I don't mix myself up in such matters. Ah, well, we shall see some fun if Swann begins running after the little Verdurins.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And on my grandfather's refusal to act as sponsor, it was Odette herself who had taken Swann to the house\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when Swann made his first appearance, Dr. and Mme. Cottard, the young pianist and his aunt, and the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course of the evening, by several more of the 'faithful.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to reply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or in earnest. And so in any event he would embellish all his facial expressions with the offer of a conditional, a provisional smile whose expectant subtlety would exonerate him from the charge of being a simpleton, if the remark addressed to him should turn out to have been facetious. But as he must also be prepared to face the alternative, he never dared to allow this smile a definite expression on his features, and you would see there a perpetually flickering uncertainty, in which you might decipher the question that he never dared to ask: \"Do you really mean that?\" He was no more confident of the manner in which he ought to conduct himself in the street, or indeed in life generally, than he was in a drawing-room; and he might be seen greeting passers-by, carriages, and anything that occurred with a malicious smile which absolved his subsequent behaviour of all impropriety, since it proved, if it should turn out unsuited to the occasion, that he was well aware of that, and that if he had assumed a smile, the jest was a secret of his own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On all those points, however, where a plain question appeared to him to be permissible, the Doctor was unsparing in his endeavours to cultivate the wilderness of his ignorance and uncertainty and so to complete his education\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So it was that, following the advice given him by a wise mother on his first coming up to the capital from his provincial home, he would never let pass either a figure of speech or a proper name that was new to him without an effort to secure the fullest information upon it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As regards figures of speech, he was insatiable in his thirst for knowledge, for often imagining them to have a more definite meaning than was actually the case, he would want to know what, exactly, was intended by those which he most frequently heard used: 'devilish pretty,' 'blue blood,' 'a cat and dog life,' 'a day of reckoning,' 'a queen of fashion, 'to give a free hand,' 'to be at a deadlock,' and so forth; and in what particular circumstances he himself might make use of them in conversation. Failing these, he would adorn it with puns and other 'plays upon words' which he had learned by rote. As for the names of strangers which were uttered in his hearing, he used merely to repeat them to himself in a questioning tone, which, he thought, would suffice to furnish him with explanations for which he would not ostensibly seek\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the critical faculty, on the universal application of which he prided himself, was, in reality, completely lacking, that refinement of good breeding which consists in assuring some one whom you are obliging in any way, without expecting to be believed, that it is really yourself that is obliged to him, was wasted on Cottard, who took everything that he heard in its literal sense. However blind she may have been to his faults, Mme. Verdurin was genuinely annoyed, though she still continued to regard him as brilliantly clever, when, after she had invited him to see and hear Sarah Bernhardt from a stage box, and had said politely: \"It is very good of you to have come, Doctor, especially as I'm sure you must often have heard Sarah Bernhardt; and besides, I'm afraid we're rather too near the stage,\" the Doctor, who had come into the box with a smile which waited before settling upon or vanishing from his face until some one in authority should enlighten him as to the merits of the spectacle, replied: \"To be sure, we are far too near the stage, and one is getting sick of Sarah Bernhardt. But you expressed a wish that I should come. For me, your wish is a command. I am only too glad to be able to do you this little service. What would one not do to please you, you are so good.\" And he went on, \"Sarah Bernhardt; that's what they call the Voice of God, ain't it? You see, often, too, that she 'sets the boards on fire.' That's an odd expression, ain't it?\" in the hope of an enlightening commentary, which, however, was not forthcoming\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you know,\" Mme. Verdurin had said to her husband, \"I believe we are going the wrong way to work when we depreciate anything we offer the Doctor. He is a scientist who lives quite apart from our everyday existence; he knows nothing himself of what things are worth, and he accepts everything that we say as gospel.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I never dared to mention it,\" M. Verdurin had answered, \"but I've noticed the same thing myself.\" And on the following New Year's Day, instead of sending Dr. Cottard a ruby that cost three thousand francs, and pretending that it was a mere trifle, M. Verdurin bought an artificial stone for three hundred, and let it be understood that it was something almost impossible to match\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Mme. Verdurin had announced that they were to see M. Swann that evening; \"Swann!\" the Doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal by his astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in readiness for anything. And seeing that no one answered him, \"Swann! Who on earth is Swann?\" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided as soon as Mme. Verdurin had explained, \"Why, Odette's friend, whom she told us about.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,\" answered the Doctor, at once mollified. As for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of Swann's appearing at the Verdurins', because he supposed him to be in love with Odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings. \"Nothing amuses me more than match-making,\" he confided to Cottard; \"I have been tremendously successful, even with women!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In telling the Verdurins that Swann was extremely 'smart,' Odette had alarmed them with the prospect of another 'bore.' When he arrived, however, he made an excellent impression, an indirect cause of which, though they did not know it, was his familiarity with the best society. He had, indeed, one of those advantages which men who have lived and moved in the world enjoy over others, even men of intelligence and refinement, who have never gone into society, namely that they no longer see it transfigured by the longing or repulsion with which it fills the imagination, but regard it as quite unimportant. Their good nature, freed from all taint of snobbishness and from the fear of seeming too friendly, grown independent, in fact, has the ease, the grace of movement of a trained gymnast each of whose supple limbs will carry out precisely the movement that is required without any clumsy participation by the rest of his body. The simple and elementary gestures used by a man of the world when he courteously holds out his hand to the unknown youth who is being introduced to him, and when he bows discreetly before the Ambassador to whom he is being introduced, had gradually pervaded, without his being conscious of it, the whole of Swann's social deportment, so that in the company of people of a lower grade than his own, such as the Verdurins and their friends, he instinctively shewed an assiduity, and made overtures with which, by their account, any of their 'bores' would have dispensed. He chilled, though for a moment only, on meeting Dr. Cottard; for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous smile, before they had yet spoken to one another (a grimace which Cottard styled \"letting 'em all come\"), Swann supposed that the Doctor recognised him from having met him already somewhere, probably in some house of 'ill-fame,' though these he himself very rarely visited, never having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love. Regarding such an allusion as in bad taste, especially before Odette, whose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse, Swann assumed his most icy manner. But when he learned that the lady next to the Doctor was Mme. Cottard, he decided that so young a husband would not deliberately, in his wife's hearing, have made any allusion to amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the Doctor's expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. The painter at once invited Swann to visit his studio with Odette, and Swann found him very pleasant. \"Perhaps you will be more highly favoured than I have been,\" Mme. Verdurin broke in, with mock resentment of the favour, \"perhaps you will be allowed to see Cottard's portrait\" (for which she had given the painter a commission). \"Take care, Master Biche,\" she reminded the painter, whom it was a time-honoured pleasantry to address as 'Master,' \"to catch that nice look in his eyes, that witty little twinkle. You know, what I want to have most of all is his smile; that's what I've asked you to paint\u2014the portrait of his smile.\" And since the phrase struck her as noteworthy, she repeated it very loud, so as to make sure that as many as possible of her guests should hear it, and even made use of some indefinite pretext to draw the circle closer before she uttered it again. Swann begged to be introduced to everyone, even to an old friend of the Verdurins, called Saniette, whose shyness, simplicity and good-nature had deprived him of all the consideration due to his skill in palaeography, his large fortune, and the distinguished family to which he belonged. When he spoke, his words came with a confusion which was delightful to hear because one felt that it indicated not so much a defect in his speech as a quality of his soul, as it were a survival from the age of innocence which he had never wholly outgrown. All the consonants which he did not manage to pronounce seemed like harsh utterances of which his gentle lips were incapable. By asking to be made known to M. Saniette, Swann made M. Verdurin reverse the usual form of introduction (saying, in fact, with emphasis on the distinction: \"M. Swann, pray let me present to you our friend Saniette\") but he aroused in Saniette himself a warmth of gratitude, which, however, the Verdurins never disclosed to Swann, since Saniette rather annoyed them, and they did not feel bound to provide him with friends. On the other hand the Verdurins were extremely touched by Swann's next request, for he felt that he must ask to be introduced to the pianist's aunt. She wore a black dress, as was her invariable custom, for she believed that a woman always looked well in black, and that nothing could be more distinguished; but her face was exceedingly red, as it always was for some time after a meal. She bowed to Swann with deference, but drew herself up again with great dignity. As she was entirely uneducated, and was afraid of making mistakes in grammar and pronunciation, she used purposely to speak in an indistinct and garbling manner, thinking that if she should make a slip it would be so buried in the surrounding confusion that no one could be certain whether she had actually made it or not; with the result that her talk was a sort of continuous, blurred expectoration, out of which would emerge, at rare intervals, those sounds and syllables of which she felt positive. Swann supposed himself entitled to poke a little mild fun at her in conversation with M. Verdurin, who, however, was not at all amused\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She is such an excellent woman!\" he rejoined. \"I grant you that she is not exactly brilliant; but I assure you that she can talk most charmingly when you are alone with her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am sure she can,\" Swann hastened to conciliate him. \"All I meant was that she hardly struck me as 'distinguished,'\" he went on, isolating the epithet in the inverted commas of his tone, \"and, after all, that is something of a compliment.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Wait a moment,\" said M. Verdurin, \"now, this will surprise you; she writes quite delightfully. You have never heard her nephew play? It is admirable; eh, Doctor? Would you like me to ask him to play something, M. Swann?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I should count myself most fortunate...\" Swann was beginning, a trifle pompously, when the Doctor broke in derisively. Having once heard it said, and never having forgotten that in general conversation emphasis and the use of formal expressions were out of date, whenever he heard a solemn word used seriously, as the word 'fortunate' had been used just now by Swann, he at once assumed that the speaker was being deliberately pedantic. And if, moreover, the same word happened to occur, also, in what he called an old 'tag' or 'saw,' however common it might still be in current usage, the Doctor jumped to the conclusion that the whole thing was a joke, and interrupted with the remaining words of the quotation, which he seemed to charge the speaker with having intended to introduce at that point, although in reality it had never entered his mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Most fortunate for France!\" he recited wickedly, shooting up both arms with great vigour. M. Verdurin could not help laughing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What are all those good people laughing at over there? There's no sign of brooding melancholy down in your corner,\" shouted Mme. Verdurin. \"You don't suppose I find it very amusing to be stuck up here by myself on the stool of repentance,\" she went on peevishly, like a spoiled child\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin was sitting upon a high Swedish chair of waxed pine-wood, which a violinist from that country had given her, and which she kept in her drawing-room, although in appearance it suggested a school 'form,' and 'swore,' as the saying is, at the really good antique furniture which she had besides; but she made a point of keeping on view the presents which her 'faithful' were in the habit of making her from time to time, so that the donors might have the pleasure of seeing them there when they came to the house. She tried to persuade them to confine their tributes to flowers and sweets, which had at least the merit of mortality; but she was never successful, and the house was gradually filled with a collection of foot-warmers, cushions, clocks, screens, barometers and vases, a constant repetition and a boundless incongruity of useless but indestructible objects\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From this lofty perch she would take her spirited part in the conversation of the 'faithful,' and would revel in all their fun; but, since the accident to her jaw, she had abandoned the effort involved in real hilarity, and had substituted a kind of symbolical dumb-show which signified, without endangering or even fatiguing her in any way, that she was 'laughing until she cried.' At the least witticism aimed by any of the circle against a 'bore,' or against a former member of the circle who was now relegated to the limbo of 'bores'\u2014and to the utter despair of M. Verdurin, who had always made out that he was just as easily amused as his wife, but who, since his laughter was the 'real thing,' was out of breath in a moment, and so was overtaken and vanquished by her device of a feigned but continuous hilarity\u2014she would utter a shrill cry, shut tight her little bird-like eyes, which were beginning to be clouded over by a cataract, and quickly, as though she had only just time to avoid some indecent sight or to parry a mortal blow, burying her face in her hands, which completely engulfed it, and prevented her from seeing anything at all, she would appear to be struggling to suppress, to eradicate a laugh which, were she to give way to it, must inevitably leave her inanimate. So, stupefied with the gaiety of the 'faithful,' drunken with comradeship, scandal and asseveration, Mme. Verdurin, perched on her high seat like a cage-bird whose biscuit has been steeped in mulled wine, would sit aloft and sob with fellow-feeling\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile M. Verdurin, after first asking Swann's permission to light his pipe (\"No ceremony here, you understand; we're all pals!\"), went and begged the young musician to sit down at the piano\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Leave him alone; don't bother him; he hasn't come here to be tormented,\" cried Mme. Verdurin. \"I won't have him tormented.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But why on earth should it bother him?\" rejoined M. Verdurin. \"I'm sure M. Swann has never heard the sonata in F sharp which we discovered; he is going to play us the pianoforte arrangement.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, no, no, not my sonata!\" she screamed, \"I don't want to be made to cry until I get a cold in the head, and neuralgia all down my face, like last time; thanks very much, I don't intend to repeat that performance; you are all very kind and considerate; it is easy to see that none of you will have to stay in bed, for a week.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This little scene, which was re-enacted as often as the young pianist sat down to play, never failed to delight the audience, as though each of them were witnessing it for the first time, as a proof of the seductive originality of the 'Mistress' as she was styled, and of the acute sensitiveness of her musical 'ear.' Those nearest to her would attract the attention of the rest, who were smoking or playing cards at the other end of the room, by their cries of 'Hear, hear!' which, as in Parliamentary debates, shewed that something worth listening to was being said. And next day they would commiserate with those who had been prevented from coming that evening, and would assure them that the 'little scene' had never been so amusingly done\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, all right, then,\" said M. Verdurin, \"he can play just the andante.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just the andante! How you do go on,\" cried his wife. \"As if it weren't 'just the andante' that breaks every bone in my body. The 'Master' is really too priceless! Just as though, 'in the Ninth,' he said 'we need only have the finale,' or 'just the overture' of the Meistersinger.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Doctor, however, urged Mme. Verdurin to let the pianist play, not because he supposed her to be malingering when she spoke of the distressing effects that music always had upon her, for he recognised the existence of certain neurasthenic states\u2014but from his habit, common to many doctors, of at once relaxing the strict letter of a prescription as soon as it appeared to jeopardise, what seemed to him far more important, the success of some social gathering at which he was present, and of which the patient whom he had urged for once to forget her dyspepsia or headache formed an essential factor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You won't be ill this time, you'll find,\" he told her, seeking at the same time to subdue her mind by the magnetism of his gaze. \"And, if you are ill, we will cure you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Will you, really?\" Mme. Verdurin spoke as though, with so great a favour in store for her, there was nothing for it but to capitulate. Perhaps, too, by dint of saying that she was going to be ill, she had worked herself into a state in which she forgot, occasionally, that it was all only a 'little scene,' and regarded things, quite sincerely, from an invalid's point of view. For it may often be remarked that invalids grow weary of having the frequency of their attacks depend always on their own prudence in avoiding them, and like to let themselves think that they are free to do everything that they most enjoy doing, although they are always ill after doing it, provided only that they place themselves in the hands of a higher authority which, without putting them to the least inconvenience, can and will, by uttering a word or by administering a tabloid, set them once again upon their feet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying to Mme. Verdurin, \"I have my own little corner, haven't I?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Mme. Verdurin, seeing Swann by himself upon a chair, made him get up. \"You're not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by Odette; you can make room for M. Swann there, can't you, Odette?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What charming Beauvais!\" said Swann, stopping to admire the sofa before he sat down on it, and wishing to be polite\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am glad you appreciate my sofa,\" replied Mme. Verdurin, \"and I warn you that if you expect ever to see another like it you may as well abandon the idea at once. They never made any more like it. And these little chairs, too, are perfect marvels. You can look at them in a moment. The emblems in each of the bronze mouldings correspond to the subject of the tapestry on the chair; you know, you combine amusement with instruction when you look at them;\u2014I can promise you a delightful time, I assure you. Just look at the little border around the edges; here, look, the little vine on a red background in this one, the Bear and the Grapes. Isn't it well drawn? What do you say? I think they knew a thing or two about design! Doesn't it make your mouth water, this vine? My husband makes out that I am not fond of fruit, because I eat less than he does. But not a bit of it, I am greedier than any of you, but I have no need to fill my mouth with them when I can feed on them with my eyes. What are you all laughing at now, pray? Ask the Doctor; he will tell you that those grapes act on me like a regular purge. Some people go to Fontainebleau for cures; I take my own little Beauvais cure here. But, M. Swann, you mustn't run away without feeling the little bronze mouldings on the backs. Isn't it an exquisite surface? No, no, not with your whole hand like that; feel them property!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If Mme. Verdurin is going to start playing about with her bronzes,\" said the painter, \"we shan't get any music to-night.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Be quiet, you wretch! And yet we poor women,\" she went on, \"are forbidden pleasures far less voluptuous than this. There is no flesh in the world as soft as these. None. When M. Verdurin did me the honour of being madly jealous... come, you might at least be polite. Don't say that you never have been jealous!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, my dear, I have said absolutely nothing. Look here, Doctor, I call you as a witness; did I utter a word?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann had begun, out of politeness, to finger the bronzes, and did not like to stop\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come along; you can caress them later; now it is you that are going to be caressed, caressed in the ear; you'll like that, I think. Here's the young gentleman who will take charge of that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the pianist had played, Swann felt and shewed more interest in him than in any of the other guests, for the following reason:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The year before, at an evening party, he had heard a piece of music played on the piano and violin. At first he had appreciated only the material quality of the sounds which those instruments secreted. And it had been a source of keen pleasure when, below the narrow ribbon of the violin-part, delicate, unyielding, substantial and governing the whole, he had suddenly perceived, where it was trying to surge upwards in a flowing tide of sound, the mass of the piano-part, multiform, coherent, level, and breaking everywhere in melody like the deep blue tumult of the sea, silvered and charmed into a minor key by the moonlight. But at a given moment, without being able to distinguish any clear outline, or to give a name to what was pleasing him, suddenly enraptured, he had tried to collect, to treasure in his memory the phrase or harmony\u2014he knew not which\u2014that had just been played, and had opened and expanded his soul, just as the fragrance of certain roses, wafted upon the moist air of evening, has the power of dilating our nostrils. Perhaps it was owing to his own ignorance of music that he had been able to receive so confused an impression, one of those that are, notwithstanding, our only purely musical impressions, limited in their extent, entirely original, and irreducible into any other kind. An impression of this order, vanishing in an instant, is, so to speak, an impression sine materia. Presumably the notes which we hear at such moments tend to spread out before our eyes, over surfaces greater or smaller according to their pitch and volume; to trace arabesque designs, to give us the sensation of breadth or tenuity, stability or caprice. But the notes themselves have vanished before these sensations have developed sufficiently to escape submersion under those which the following, or even simultaneous notes have already begun to awaken in us. And this indefinite perception would continue to smother in its molten liquidity the motifs which now and then emerge, barely discernible, to plunge again and disappear and drown; recognised only by the particular kind of pleasure which they instil, impossible to describe, to recollect, to name; ineffable;\u2014if our memory, like a labourer who toils at the laying down of firm foundations beneath the tumult of the waves, did not, by fashioning for us facsimiles of those fugitive phrases, enable us to compare and to contrast them with those that follow. And so, hardly had the delicious sensation, which Swann had experienced, died away, before his memory had furnished him with an immediate transcript, summary, it is true, and provisional, but one on which he had kept his eyes fixed while the playing continued, so effectively that, when the same impression suddenly returned, it was no longer uncapturable. He was able to picture to himself its extent, its symmetrical arrangement, its notation, the strength of its expression; he had before him that definite object which was no longer pure music, but rather design, architecture, thought, and which allowed the actual music to be recalled. This time he had distinguished, quite clearly, a phrase which emerged for a few moments from the waves of sound. It had at once held out to him an invitation to partake of intimate pleasures, of whose existence, before hearing it, he had never dreamed, into which he felt that nothing but this phrase could initiate him; and he had been filled with love for it, as with a new and strange desire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With a slow and rhythmical movement it led him here, there, everywhere, towards a state of happiness noble, unintelligible, yet clearly indicated. And then, suddenly having reached a certain point from which he was prepared to follow it, after pausing for a moment, abruptly it changed its direction, and in a fresh movement, more rapid, multiform, melancholy, incessant, sweet, it bore him off with it towards a vista of joys unknown. Then it vanished. He hoped, with a passionate longing, that he might find it again, a third time. And reappear it did, though without speaking to him more clearly, bringing him, indeed, a pleasure less profound. But when he was once more at home he needed it, he was like a man into whose life a woman, whom he has seen for a moment passing by, has brought a new form of beauty, which strengthens and enlarges his own power of perception, without his knowing even whether he is ever to see her again whom he loves already, although he knows nothing of her, not even her name\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed this passion for a phrase of music seemed, in the first few months, to be bringing into Swann's life the possibility of a sort of rejuvenation. He had so long since ceased to direct his course towards any ideal goal, and had confined himself to the pursuit of ephemeral satisfactions, that he had come to believe, though without ever formally stating his belief even to himself, that he would remain all his life in that condition, which death alone could alter. More than this, since his mind no longer entertained any lofty ideals, he had ceased to believe in (although he could not have expressly denied) their reality. He had grown also into the habit of taking refuge in trivial considerations, which allowed him to set on one side matters of fundamental importance. Just as he had never stopped to ask himself whether he would not have done better by not going into society, knowing very well that if he had accepted an invitation he must put in an appearance, and that afterwards, if he did not actually call, he must at least leave cards upon his hostess; so in his conversation he took care never to express with any warmth a personal opinion about a thing, but instead would supply facts and details which had a value of a sort in themselves, and excused him from shewing how much he really knew. He would be extremely precise about the recipe for a dish, the dates of a painter's birth and death, and the titles of his works. Sometimes, in spite of himself, he would let himself go so far as to utter a criticism of a work of art, or of some one's interpretation of life, but then he would cloak his words in a tone of irony, as though he did not altogether associate himself with what he was saying. But now, like a confirmed invalid whom, all of a sudden, a change of air and surroundings, or a new course of treatment, or, as sometimes happens, an organic change in himself, spontaneous and unaccountable, seems to have so far recovered from his malady that he begins to envisage the possibility, hitherto beyond all hope, of starting to lead\u2014and better late than never\u2014a wholly different life, Swann found in himself, in the memory of the phrase that he had heard, in certain other sonatas which he had made people play over to him, to see whether he might not, perhaps, discover his phrase among them, the presence of one of those invisible realities in which he had ceased to believe, but to which, as though the music had had upon the moral barrenness from which he was suffering a sort of recreative influence, he was conscious once again of a desire, almost, indeed, of the power to consecrate his life. But, never having managed to find out whose work it was that he had heard played that evening, he had been unable to procure a copy, and finally had forgotten the quest. He had indeed, in the course of the next few days, encountered several of the people who had been at the party with him, and had questioned them; but most of them had either arrived after or left before the piece was played; some had indeed been in the house, but had gone into another room to talk, and those who had stayed to listen had no clearer impression than the rest. As for his hosts, they knew that it was a recently published work which the musicians whom they had engaged for the evening had asked to be allowed to play; but, as these last were now on tour somewhere, Swann could learn nothing further. He had, of course, a number of musical friends, but, vividly as he could recall the exquisite and inexpressible pleasure which the little phrase had given him, and could see, still, before his eyes the forms that it had traced in outline, he was quite incapable of humming over to them the air. And so, at last, he ceased to think of it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But to-night, at Mme. Verdurin's, scarcely had the little pianist begun to play when, suddenly, after a high note held on through two whole bars, Swann saw it approaching, stealing forth from underneath that resonance, which was prolonged and stretched out over it, like a curtain of sound, to veil the mystery of its birth\u2014and recognised, secret, whispering, articulate, the airy and fragrant phrase that he had loved. And it was so peculiarly itself, it had so personal a charm, which nothing else could have replaced, that Swann felt as though he had met, in a friend's drawing-room, a woman whom he had seen and admired, once, in the street, and had despaired of ever seeing her again. Finally the phrase withdrew and vanished, pointing, directing, diligent among the wandering currents of its fragrance, leaving upon Swann's features a reflection of its smile. But now, at last, he could ask the name of his fair unknown (and was told that it was the andante movement of Vinteuil's sonata for the piano and violin), he held it safe, could have it again to himself, at home, as often as he would, could study its language and acquire its secret\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, when the pianist had finished, Swann crossed the room and thanked him with a vivacity which delighted Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Isn't he charming?\" she asked Swann, \"doesn't he just understand it, his sonata, the little wretch? You never dreamed, did you, that a piano could be made to express all that? Upon my word, there's everything in it except the piano! I'm caught out every time I hear it; I think I'm listening to an orchestra. Though it's better, really, than an orchestra, more complete.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining each of his words as though he were making an epigram: \"You are most generous to me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And while Mme. Verdurin was saying to her husband, \"Run and fetch him a glass of orangeade; it's well earned!\" Swann began to tell Odette how he had fallen in love with that little phrase. When their hostess, who was a little way off, called out, \"Well! It looks to me as though some one was saying nice things to you, Odette!\" she replied, \"Yes, very nice,\" and he found her simplicity delightful. Then he asked for some information about this Vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what period in his life he had composed the sonata;\u2014what meaning the little phrase could have had for him, that was what Swann wanted most to know\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But none of these people who professed to admire this musician (when Swann had said that the sonata was really charming Mme. Verdurin had exclaimed, \"I quite believe it! Charming, indeed! But you don't dare to confess that you don't know Vinteuil's sonata; you have no right not to know it!\"\u2014and the painter had gone on with, \"Ah, yes, it's a very fine bit of work, isn't it? Not, of course, if you want something 'obvious,' something 'popular,' but, I mean to say, it makes a very great impression on us artists.\"), none of them seemed ever to have asked himself these questions, for none of them was able to reply\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even to one or two particular remarks made by Swann on his favourite phrase, \"D'you know, that's a funny thing; I had never noticed it; I may as well tell you that I don't much care about peering at things through a microscope, and pricking myself on pin-points of difference; no; we don't waste time splitting hairs in this house; why not? well, it's not a habit of ours, that's all,\" Mme. Verdurin replied, while Dr. Cottard gazed at her with open-mouthed admiration, and yearned to be able to follow her as she skipped lightly from one stepping-stone to another of her stock of ready-made phrases. Both he, however, and Mme. Cottard, with a kind of common sense which is shared by many people of humble origin, would always take care not to express an opinion, or to pretend to admire a piece of music which they would confess to each other, once they were safely at home, that they no more understood than they could understand the art of 'Master' Biche. Inasmuch as the public cannot recognise the charm, the beauty, even the outlines of nature save in the stereotyped impressions of an art which they have gradually assimilated, while an original artist starts by rejecting those impressions, so M. and Mme. Cottard, typical, in this respect, of the public, were incapable of finding, either in Vinteuil's sonata or in Biche's portraits, what constituted harmony, for them, in music or beauty in painting. It appeared to them, when the pianist played his sonata, as though he were striking haphazard from the piano a medley of notes which bore no relation to the musical forms to which they themselves were accustomed, and that the painter simply flung the colours haphazard upon his canvas. When, on one of these, they were able to distinguish a human form, they always found it coarsened and vulgarised (that is to say lacking all the elegance of the school of painting through whose spectacles they themselves were in the habit of seeing the people\u2014real, living people, who passed them in the streets) and devoid of truth, as though M. Biche had not known how the human shoulder was constructed, or that a woman's hair was not, ordinarily, purple\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, when the 'faithful' were scattered out of earshot, the Doctor felt that the opportunity was too good to be missed, and so (while Mme. Verdurin was adding a final word of commendation of Vinteuil's sonata) like a would-be swimmer who jumps into the water, so as to learn, but chooses a moment when there are not too many people looking on: \"Yes, indeed; he's what they call a musiciandi primo cartello!\" he exclaimed, with a sudden determination\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann discovered no more than that the recent publication of Vinteuil's sonata had caused a great stir among the most advanced school of musicians, but that it was still unknown to the general public\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know some one, quite well, called Vinteuil,\" said Swann, thinking of the old music-master at Combray who had taught my grandmother's sisters\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Perhaps that's the man!\" cried Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, no!\" Swann burst out laughing. \"If you had ever seen him for a moment you wouldn't put the question.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Then to put the question is to solve the problem?\" the Doctor suggested\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But it may well be some relative,\" Swann went on. \"That would be bad enough; but, after all, there is no reason why a genius shouldn't have a cousin who is a silly old fool. And if that should be so, I swear there's no known or unknown form of torture I wouldn't undergo to get the old fool to introduce me to the man who composed the sonata; starting with the torture of the old fool's company, which would be ghastly.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The painter understood that Vinteuil was seriously ill at the moment, and that Dr. Potain despaired of his life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What!\" cried Mme. Verdurin, \"Do people still call in Potain?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! Mme. Verdurin,\" Cottard simpered, \"you forget that you are speaking of one of my colleagues\u2014I should say, one of my masters.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The painter had heard, somewhere, that Vinteuil was threatened with the loss of his reason. And he insisted that signs of this could be detected in certain passages in the sonata. This remark did not strike Swann as ridiculous; rather, it puzzled him. For, since a purely musical work contains none of those logical sequences, the interruption or confusion of which, in spoken or written language, is a proof of insanity, so insanity diagnosed in a sonata seemed to him as mysterious a thing as the insanity of a dog or a horse, although instances may be observed of these\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Don't speak to me about 'your masters'; you know ten times as much as he does!\" Mme. Verdurin answered Dr. Cottard, in the tone of a woman who has the courage of her convictions, and is quite ready to stand up to anyone who disagrees with her. \"Anyhow, you don't kill your patients!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, Madame, he is in the Academy.\" The Doctor smiled with bitter irony. \"If a sick person prefers to die at the hands of one of the Princes of Science... It is far more smart to be able to say, 'Yes, I have Potain.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, indeed! More smart, is it?\" said Mme. Verdurin. \"So there are fashions, nowadays, in illness, are there? I didn't know that.... Oh, you do make me laugh!\" she screamed, suddenly, burying her face in her hands. \"And here was I, poor thing, talking quite seriously, and never seeing that you were pulling my leg.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for M. Verdurin, finding it rather a strain to start laughing again over so small a matter, he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke from his pipe, while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope to keep pace with his wife in her Atalanta-flights across the field of mirth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you know; we like your friend so very much,\" said Mme. Verdurin, later, when Odette was bidding her good night. \"He is so unaffected, quite charming. If they're all like that, the friends you want to bring here, by all means bring them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin remarked that Swann had failed, all the same, to appreciate the pianist's aunt\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I dare say he felt a little strange, poor man,\" suggested Mme. Verdurin. \"You can't expect him to catch the tone of the house the first time he comes; like Cottard, who has been one of our little 'clan' now for years. The first time doesn't count; it's just for looking round and finding out things. Odette, he understands all right, he's to join us to-morrow at the Ch\u00e2telet. Perhaps you might call for him and bring him.\" \"No, he doesn't want that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, very well; just as you like. Provided he doesn't fail us at the last moment.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Greatly to Mme. Verdurin's surprise, he never failed them. He would go to meet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside Paris (not that they went there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and more frequently at the play, in which Mme. Verdurin delighted. One evening, when they were dining at home, he heard her complain that she had not one of those permits which would save her the trouble of waiting at doors and standing in crowds, and say how useful it would be to them at first-nights, and gala performances at the Opera, and what a nuisance it had been, not having one, on the day of Gambetta's funeral. Swann never spoke of his distinguished friends, but only of such as might be regarded as detrimental, whom, therefore, he thought it snobbish, and in not very good taste to conceal; while he frequented the Faubourg Saint-Germain he had come to include, in the latter class, all his friends in the official world of the Third Republic, and so broke in, without thinking: \"I'll see to that, all right. You shall have it in time for the Danicheff revival. I shall be lunching with the Prefect of Police to-morrow, as it happens, at the Elys\u00e9e.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's that? The Elys\u00e9e?\" Dr. Cottard roared in a voice of thunder\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, at M. Gr\u00e9vy's,\" replied Swann, feeling a little awkward at the effect which his announcement had produced\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Are you often taken like that?\" the painter asked Cottard, with mock-seriousness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule, once an explanation had been given, Cottard would say: \"Ah, good, good; that's all right, then,\" after which he would shew not the least trace of emotion. But this time Swann's last words, instead of the usual calming effect, had that of heating, instantly, to boiling-point his astonishment at the discovery that a man with whom he himself was actually sitting at table, a man who had no official position, no honours or distinction of any sort, was on visiting terms with the Head of the State\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What's that you say? M. Gr\u00e9vy? Do you know M. Gr\u00e9vy?\" he demanded of Swann, in the stupid and incredulous tone of a constable on duty at the palace, when a stranger has come up and asked to see the President of the Republic; until, guessing from his words and manner what, as the newspapers say, 'it is a case of,' he assures the poor lunatic that he will be admitted at once, and points the way to the reception ward of the police infirmary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know him slightly; we have some friends in common\" (Swann dared not add that one of these friends was the Prince of Wales). \"Anyhow, he is very free with his invitations, and, I assure you, his luncheon-parties are not the least bit amusing; they're very simple affairs, too, you know; never more than eight at table,\" he went on, trying desperately to cut out everything that seemed to shew off his relations with the President in a light too dazzling for the Doctor's eyes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whereupon Cottard, at once conforming in his mind to the literal interpretation of what Swann was saying, decided that invitations from M. Gr\u00e9vy were very little sought after, were sent out, in fact, into the highways and hedge-rows. And from that moment he never seemed at all surprised to hear that Swann, or anyone else, was 'always at the Elys\u00e9e'; he even felt a little sorry for a man who had to go to luncheon-parties which, he himself admitted, were a bore\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah, good, good; that's quite all right then,\" he said, in the tone of a customs official who has been suspicious up to now, but, after hearing your explanations, stamps your passport and lets you proceed on your journey without troubling to examine your luggage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can well believe you don't find them amusing, those parties; indeed, it's very good of you to go to them!\" said Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the President of the Republic only as a 'bore' to be especially dreaded, since he had at his disposal means of seduction, and even of compulsion, which, if employed to captivate her 'faithful,' might easily make them 'fail.' \"It seems, he's as deaf as a post; and eats with his fingers.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Upon my word! Then it can't be much fun for you, going there.\" A note of pity sounded in the Doctor's voice; and then struck by the number\u2014only eight at table\u2014\"Are these luncheons what you would describe as 'intimate'?\" he inquired briskly, not so much out of idle curiosity as in his linguistic zeal\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But so great and glorious a figure was the President of the French Republic in the eyes of Dr. Cottard that neither the modesty of Swann nor the spite of Mme. Verdurin could ever wholly efface that first impression, and he never sat down to dinner with the Verdurins without asking anxiously, \"D'you think we shall see M. Swann here this evening? He is a personal friend of M. Gr\u00e9vy's. I suppose that means he's what you'd call a 'gentleman'?\" He even went to the length of offering Swann a card of invitation to the Dental Exhibition\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"This will let you in, and anyone you take with you,\" he explained, \"but dogs are not admitted. I'm just warning you, you understand, because some friends of mine went there once, who hadn't been told, and there was the devil to pay.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for M. Verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect upon his wife of the discovery that Swann had influential friends of whom he had never spoken\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If no arrangement had been made to 'go anywhere,' it was at the Verdurins' that Swann would find the 'little nucleus' assembled, but he never appeared there except in the evenings, and would hardly ever accept their invitations to dinner, in spite of Odette's entreaties\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I could dine with you alone somewhere, if you'd rather,\" she suggested\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But what about Mme. Verdurin?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that's quite simple. I need only say that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How charming of you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Swann said to himself that, if he could make Odette feel (by consenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other pleasures which he preferred to that of her company, then the desire that she felt for his would be all the longer in reaching the point of satiety. Besides, as he infinitely preferred to Odette's style of beauty that of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom he happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the first part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see Odette later on. For the same reason, he would never allow Odette to call for him at his house, to take him on to the Verdurins'. The little girl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; R\u00e9mi, his coachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him in her arms until the carriage drew up at the Verdurins'. He would enter the drawing-room; and there, while Mme. Verdurin, pointing to the roses which he had sent her that morning, said: \"I am furious with you!\" and sent him to the place kept for him, by the side of Odette, the pianist would play to them\u2014for their two selves, and for no one else\u2014that little phrase by Vinteuil which was, so to speak, the national anthem of their love. He began, always, with a sustained tremolo from the violin part, which, for several bars, was unaccompanied, and filled all the foreground; until suddenly it seemed to be drawn aside, and\u2014just as in those interiors by Pieter de Hooch, where the subject is set back a long way through the narrow framework of a half-opened door\u2014infinitely remote, in colour quite different, velvety with the radiance of some intervening light, the little phrase appeared, dancing, pastoral, interpolated, episodic, belonging to another world. It passed, with simple and immortal movements, scattering on every side the bounties of its grace, smiling ineffably still; but Swann thought that he could now discern in it some disenchantment. It seemed to be aware how vain, how hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. In its airy grace there was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in itself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an outburst of vain regret. But little did that matter to him; he looked upon the sonata less in its own light\u2014as what it might express, had, in fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any Swann or Odette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries to come\u2014than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the Verdurins and their little pianist think of Odette and, at the same time, of himself\u2014which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that point he had (whimsically entreated by Odette) abandoned the idea of getting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata, of which he still knew no more than this one passage. \"Why do you want the rest?\" she had asked him. \"Our little bit; that's all we need.\" He went farther; agonised by the reflection, at the moment when it passed by him, so near and yet so infinitely remote, that, while it was addressed to their ears, it knew them not, he would regret, almost, that it had a meaning of its own, an intrinsic and unalterable beauty, foreign to themselves, just as in the jewels given to us, or even in the letters written to us by a woman with whom we are in love, we find fault with the 'water' of a stone, or with the words of a sentence because they are not fashioned exclusively from the spirit of a fleeting intimacy and of a 'lass unparalleled.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside, with his little girl, before going to the Verdurins' that, as soon as the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist, Swann would discover that it was almost time for Odette to go home. He used to take her back as far as the door of her little house in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, behind the Arc de Triomphe. And it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to demand the monopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not so essential to his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening, of arriving with her at the Verdurins', to the exercise of this other privilege, for which she was grateful, of their leaving together; a privilege which he valued all the more because, thanks to it, he had the feeling that no one else would see her, no one would thrust himself between them, no one could prevent him from remaining with her in spirit, after he had left her for the night\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, night after night, she would be taken home in Swann's carriage; and one night, after she had got down, and while he stood at the gate and murmured \"Till to-morrow, then!\" she turned impulsively from him, plucked a last lingering chrysanthemum in the tiny garden which flanked the pathway from the street to her house, and as he went back to his carriage thrust it into his hand. He held it pressed to his lips during the drive home, and when, in due course, the flower withered, locked it away, like something very precious, in a secret drawer of his desk\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He would escort her to her gate, but no farther. Twice only had he gone inside to take part in the ceremony\u2014of such vital importance in her life\u2014of 'afternoon tea.' The loneliness and emptiness of those short streets (consisting, almost entirely, of low-roofed houses, self-contained but not detached, their monotony interrupted here and there by the dark intrusion of some sinister little shop, at once an historical document and a sordid survival from the days when the district was still one of ill repute), the snow which had lain on the garden-beds or clung to the branches of the trees, the careless disarray of the season, the assertion, in this man-made city, of a state of nature, had all combined to add an element of mystery to the warmth, the flowers, the luxury which he had found inside\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Passing by (on his left-hand side, and on what, although raised some way above the street, was the ground floor of the house) Odette's bedroom, which looked out to the back over another little street running parallel with her own, he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between dark painted walls, from which hung Oriental draperies, strings of Turkish beads, and a huge Japanese lantern, suspended by a silken cord from the ceiling (which last, however, so that her visitors should not have to complain of the want of any of the latest comforts of Western civilisation, was lighted by a gas-jet inside), to the two drawing-rooms, large and small. These were entered through a narrow lobby, the wall of which, chequered with the lozenges of a wooden trellis such as you see on garden walls, only gilded, was lined from end to end by a long rectangular box in which bloomed, as though in a hothouse, a row of large chrysanthemums, at that time still uncommon, though by no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which horticulturists have since succeeded in making grow. Swann was irritated, as a rule, by the sight of these flowers, which had then been 'the rage' in Paris for about a year, but it had pleased him, on this occasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars, which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter afternoons. Odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink silk, which left her neck and arms bare. She had made him sit down beside her in one of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the various recesses of the room, sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing out of pots of Chinese porcelain, or by screens upon which were fastened photographs and fans and bows of ribbon. She had said at once, \"You're not comfortable there; wait a minute, I'll arrange things for you,\" and with a titter of laughter, the complacency of which implied that some little invention of her own was being brought into play, she had installed behind his head and beneath his feet great cushions of Japanese silk, which she pummelled and buffeted as though determined to lavish on him all her riches, and regardless of their value. But when her footman began to come into the room, bringing, one after another, the innumerable lamps which (contained, mostly, in porcelain vases) burned singly or in pairs upon the different pieces of furniture as upon so many altars, rekindling in the twilight, already almost nocturnal, of this winter afternoon, the glow of a sunset more lasting, more roseate, more human\u2014filling, perhaps, with romantic wonder the thoughts of some solitary lover, wandering in the street below and brought to a standstill before the mystery of the human presence which those lighted windows at once revealed and screened from sight\u2014she had kept an eye sharply fixed on the servant, to see whether he set each of the lamps down in the place appointed it. She felt that, if he were to put even one of them where it ought not to be, the general effect of her drawing-room would be destroyed, and that her portrait, which rested upon a sloping easel draped with plush, would not catch the light. And so, with feverish impatience, she followed the man's clumsy movements, scolding him severely when he passed too close to a pair of beaupots, which she made a point of always tidying herself, in case the plants should be knocked over\u2014and went across to them now to make sure that he had not broken off any of the flowers. She found something 'quaint' in the shape of each of her Chinese ornaments, and also in her orchids, the cattleyas especially (these being, with chrysanthemums, her favourite flowers), because they had the supreme merit of not looking in the least like other flowers, but of being made, apparently, out of scraps of silk or satin. \"It looks just as though it had been cut out of the lining of my cloak,\" she said to Swann, pointing to an orchid, with a shade of respect in her voice for so 'smart' a flower, for this distinguished, unexpected sister whom nature had suddenly bestowed upon her, so far removed from her in the scale of existence, and yet so delicate, so refined, so much more worthy than many real women of admission to her drawing-room. As she drew his attention, now to the fiery-tongued dragons painted upon a bowl or stitched upon a fire-screen, now to a fleshy cluster of orchids, now to a dromedary of inlaid silver-work with ruby eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved in jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the monsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency of the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them 'darlings.' And these affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her attitudes, notably her devotion to Our Lady of the Laghetto who had once, when Odette was living at Nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and whose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing to it unlimited powers. She poured out Swann's tea, inquired \"Lemon or cream?\" and, on his answering \"Cream, please,\" went on, smiling, \"A cloud!\" And as he pronounced it excellent, \"You see, I know just how you like it.\" This tea had indeed seemed to Swann, just as it seemed to her, something precious, and love is so far obliged to find some justification for itself, some guarantee of its duration in pleasures which, on the contrary, would have no existence apart from love and must cease with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o'clock, to go and dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in his brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon's adventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to himself: \"What fun it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could always be certain of finding, what one never can be certain of finding, a really good cup of tea.\" An hour or so later he received a note from Odette, and at once recognised that florid handwriting, in which an affectation of British stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its shapeless characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of sincerity and decision. Swann had left his cigarette-case at her house. \"Why,\" she wrote, \"did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More important, perhaps, was a second visit which he paid her, a little later. On his way to the house, as always when he knew that they were to meet, he formed a picture of her in his mind; and the necessity, if he was to find any beauty in her face, of fixing his eyes on the fresh and rosy protuberance of her cheekbones, and of shutting out all the rest of those cheeks which were so often languorous and sallow, except when they were punctuated with little fiery spots, plunged him in acute depression, as proving that one's ideal is always unattainable, and one's actual happiness mediocre. He was taking her an engraving which she had asked to see. She was not very well; she received him, wearing a wrapper of mauve cr\u00eape de Chine, which draped her bosom, like a mantle, with a richly embroidered web. As she stood there beside him, brushing his cheek with the loosened tresses of her hair, bending one knee in what was almost a dancer's pose, so that she could lean without tiring herself over the picture, at which she was gazing, with bended head, out of those great eyes, which seemed so weary and so sullen when there was nothing to animate her, Swann was struck by her resemblance to the figure of Zipporah, Jethro's Daughter, which is to be seen in one of the Sistine frescoes. He had always found a peculiar fascination in tracing in the paintings of the Old Masters, not merely the general characteristics of the people whom he encountered in his daily life, but rather what seems least susceptible of generalisation, the individual features of men and women whom he knew, as, for instance, in a bust of the Doge Loredan by Antonio Rizzo, the prominent cheekbones, the slanting eyebrows, in short, a speaking likeness to his own coachman R\u00e9mi; in the colouring of a Ghirlandaio, the nose of M. de Palancy; in a portrait by Tintoretto, the invasion of the plumpness of the cheek by an outcrop of whisker, the broken nose, the penetrating stare, the swollen eyelids of Dr. du Boulbon. Perhaps because he had always regretted, in his heart, that he had confined his attention to the social side of life, had talked, always, rather than acted, he felt that he might find a sort of indulgence bestowed upon him by those great artists, in his perception of the fact that they also had regarded with pleasure and had admitted into the canon of their works such types of physiognomy as give those works the strongest possible certificate of reality and trueness to life; a modern, almost a topical savour; perhaps, also, he had so far succumbed to the prevailing frivolity of the world of fashion that he felt the necessity of finding in an old masterpiece some such obvious and refreshing allusion to a person about whom jokes could be made and repeated and enjoyed to-day. Perhaps, on the other hand, he had retained enough of the artistic temperament to be able to find a genuine satisfaction in watching these individual features take on a more general significance when he saw them, uprooted and disembodied, in the abstract idea of similarity between an historic portrait and a modern original, whom it was not intended to represent. However that might be, and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he, for some time past, had been receiving\u2014though, indeed, they had come to him rather through the channel of his appreciation of music\u2014had enriched his appetite for painting as well, it was with an unusual intensity of pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his character and conduct, that Swann remarked Odette's resemblance to the Zipporah of that Alessandro de Mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving his more popular surname, now that 'Botticelli' suggests not so much the actual work of the Master as that false and banal conception of it which has of late obtained common currency. He no longer based his estimate of the merit of Odette's face on the more or less good quality of her cheeks, and the softness and sweetness\u2014as of carnation-petals\u2014which, he supposed, would greet his lips there, should he ever hazard an embrace, but regarded it rather as a skein of subtle and lovely silken threads, which his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following the curving line from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her eyelids, as though from a portrait of herself, in which her type was made clearly intelligible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in her face and limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to recapture, both when he was with Odette, and when he was only thinking of her in her absence; and, albeit his admiration for the Florentine masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been reproduced in her, the similarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered her more precious in his sight. Swann reproached himself with his failure, hitherto, to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the great Sandro would have adored, and counted himself fortunate that his pleasure in the contemplation of Odette found a justification in his own system of aesthetic. He told himself that, in choosing the thought of Odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness, he was not, as he had until then supposed, falling back, merely, upon an expedient of doubtful and certainly inadequate value, since she contained in herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art. He failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring Odette into the category of women whom he found desirable, simply because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste. The words 'Florentine painting' were invaluable to Swann. They enabled him (gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the image of Odette into a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she had been debarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler form. And whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually reviving his misgivings as to the quality of her face, her figure, the whole of her beauty, used to cool the ardour of his love, those misgivings were swept away and that love confirmed now that he could re-erect his estimate of her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while the kiss, the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately attractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered flesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as exquisite as they would be supernatural\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And when he was tempted to regret that, for months past, he had done nothing but visit Odette, he would assure himself that he was not unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an inestimably precious work of art, cast for once in a new, a different, an especially charming metal, in an unmatched exemplar which he would contemplate at one moment with the humble, spiritual, disinterested mind of an artist, at another with the pride, the selfishness, the sensual thrill of a collector\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On his study table, at which he worked, he had placed, as it were a photograph of Odette, a reproduction of Jethro's Daughter. He would gaze in admiration at the large eyes, the delicate features in which the imperfection of her skin might be surmised, the marvellous locks of hair that fell along her tired cheeks; and, adapting what he had already felt to be beautiful, on aesthetic grounds, to the idea of a living woman, he converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated himself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might, ultimately, possess. The vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a spectator to a work of art, now that he knew the type, in warm flesh and blood, of Jethro's Daughter, became a desire which more than compensated, thenceforward, for that with which Odette's physical charms had at first failed to inspire him. When he had sat for a long time gazing at the Botticelli, he would think of his own living Botticelli, who seemed all the lovelier in contrast, and as he drew towards him the photograph of Zipporah he would imagine that he was holding Odette against his heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was not only Odette's indifference, however, that he must take pains to circumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own; feeling that, since Odette had had every facility for seeing him, she seemed no longer to have very much to say to him when they did meet, he was afraid lest the manner\u2014at once trivial, monotonous, and seemingly unalterable\u2014which she now adopted when they were together should ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope, that a day might come when she would make avowal of her passion, by which hope alone he had become and would remain her lover. And so to alter, to give a fresh moral aspect to that Odette, of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing weary, he wrote, suddenly, a letter full of hinted discoveries and feigned indignation, which he sent off so that it should reach her before dinner-time. He knew that she would be frightened, and that she would reply, and he hoped that, when the fear of losing him clutched at her heart, it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard her utter: and he was right\u2014by repeating this device he had won from her the most affectionate letters that she had, so far, written him, one of them (which she had sent to him at midday by a special messenger from the Maison Dor\u00e9e\u2014it was the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate given for the victims of the recent floods in Murcia) beginning \"My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write\u2014\u2014\"; and these letters he had kept in the same drawer as the withered chrysanthemum. Or else, if she had not had time to write, when he arrived at the Verdurins' she would come running up to him with an \"I've something to say to you!\" and he would gaze curiously at the revelation in her face and speech of what she had hitherto kept concealed from him of her heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even as he drew near to the Verdurins' door, and caught sight of the great lamp-lit spaces of the drawing-room windows, whose shutters were never closed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming creature whom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that golden light. Here and there the figures of the guests stood out, sharp and black, between lamp and window, shutting off the light, like those little pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a glass screen, whose other panes are mere transparencies. He would try to make out Odette. And then, when he was once inside, without thinking, his eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that M. Verdurin said to the painter: \"H'm. Seems to be getting warm.\" Indeed, her presence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited seemed to possess: a sort of tactual sense, a nervous system which ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism, namely the 'little clan,' were transformed for Swann into a series of daily encounters with Odette, and enabled him to feign indifference to the prospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing which he incurred no very great risk since, even although he had written to her during the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and accompany her home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark drive together, he had taken his other 'little girl' all the way to the Bois, so as to delay as long as possible the moment of his appearance at the Verdurins', he was so late in reaching them that Odette, supposing that he did not intend to come, had already left. Seeing the room bare of her, Swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began then for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that certainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of all our pleasures) reduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its dimensions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that she wasn't here?\" M. Verdurin asked his wife. \"I think we may say that he's hooked.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The face he pulled?\" exploded Dr. Cottard who, having left the house for a moment to visit a patient, had just returned to fetch his wife and did not know whom they were discussing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you mean to say you didn't meet him on the doorstep\u2014the loveliest of Swanns?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No. M. Swann has been here?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just for a moment. We had a glimpse of a Swann tremendously agitated. In a state of nerves. You see, Odette had left.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You mean to say that she has gone the 'whole hog' with him; that she has 'burned her boats'?\" inquired the Doctor cautiously, testing the meaning of his phrases\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, of course not; there's absolutely nothing in it; in fact, between you and me, I think she's making a great mistake, and behaving like a silly little fool, which she is, incidentally.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Come, come, come!\" said M. Verdurin, \"How on earth do you know that there's 'nothing in it'? We haven't been there to see, have we now?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She would have told me,\" answered Mme. Verdurin with dignity. \"I may say that she tells me everything. As she has no one else at present, I told her that she ought to live with him. She makes out that she can't; she admits, she was immensely attracted by him, at first; but he's always shy with her, and that makes her shy with him. Besides, she doesn't care for him in that way, she says; it's an ideal love, 'Platonic,' you know; she's afraid of rubbing the bloom off\u2014oh, I don't know half the things she says, how should I? And yet he's exactly the sort of man she wants.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I beg to differ from you,\" M. Verdurin courteously interrupted. \"I am only half satisfied with the gentleman. I feel that he 'poses.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin's whole body stiffened, her eyes stared blankly as though she had suddenly been turned into a statue; a device by means of which she might be supposed not to have caught the sound of that unutterable word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to 'pose' in her house, and, therefore, that there were people in the world who 'mattered more' than herself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Anyhow, if there is nothing in it, I don't suppose it's because our friend believes in her virtue. And yet, you never know; he seems to believe in her intelligence. I don't know whether you heard the way he lectured her the other evening about Vinteuil's sonata. I am devoted to Odette, but really\u2014to expound theories of aesthetic to her\u2014the man must be a prize idiot.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Look here, I won't have you saying nasty things about Odette,\" broke in Mme. Verdurin in her 'spoiled child' manner. \"She is charming.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There's no reason why she shouldn't be charming; we are not saying anything nasty about her, only that she is not the embodiment of either virtue or intellect. After all,\" he turned to the painter, \"does it matter so very much whether she is virtuous or not? You can't tell; she might be a great deal less charming if she were.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the landing Swann had run into the Verdurins' butler, who had been somewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked by Odette to tell Swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at Pr\u00e9vost's on her way home. Swann set off at once for Pr\u00e9vost's, but every few yards his carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street, loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath his wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note-book would delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian. He counted the minutes feverishly, adding a few seconds to each so as to be quite certain that he had not given himself short measure, and so, possibly, exaggerated whatever chance there might actually be of his arriving at Pr\u00e9vost's in time, and of finding her still there. And then, in a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself and them, Swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard at the Verdurins' that Odette had left, how novel the heartache from which he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as though he had just woken up. What! all this disturbance simply because he would not see Odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been hoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward Mme. Verdurin's. He was obliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and drove to Pr\u00e9vost's, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone even\u2014but that a new personality was there beside him, adhering to him, amalgamated with him, a creature from whom he might, perhaps, be unable to liberate himself, towards whom he might have to adopt some such stratagem as one uses to outwit a master or a malady. And yet, during this last moment in which he had felt that another, a fresh personality was thus conjoined with his own, life had seemed, somehow, more interesting\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at Pr\u00e9vost's (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea, not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take shelter and repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be much the same as all their meetings, of no great importance. As on every other evening, once he was in Odette's company, once he had begun to cast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of desire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to be able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to assure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her again, next evening, at the Verdurins'; pretexts, that is to say, which would enable him to prolong for the time being, and to renew for one day more the disappointment, the torturing deception that must always come to him with the vain presence of this woman, whom he might approach, yet never dared embrace\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was not at Prevost's; he must search for her, then, in every restaurant upon the boulevards. To save time, while he went in one direction, he sent in the other his coachman R\u00e9mi (Rizzo's Doge Loredan) for whom he presently\u2014after a fruitless search\u2014found himself waiting at the spot where the carriage was to meet him. It did not appear, and Swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching moment, as one in which R\u00e9mi would say to him: \"Sir, the lady is there,\" or as one in which R\u00e9mi would say to him: \"Sir, the lady was not in any of the caf\u00e9s.\" And so he saw himself faced by the close of his evening\u2014a thing uniform, and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident which would either put an end to his agony by discovering Odette, or would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night, to accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, Swann asked, not \"Did you find the lady?\" but \"Remind me, to-morrow, to order in some more firewood. I am sure we must be running short.\" Perhaps he had persuaded himself that, if R\u00e9mi had at last found Odette in some caf\u00e9, where she was waiting for him still, then his night of misery was already obliterated by the realisation, begun already in his mind, of a night of joy, and that there was no need for him to hasten towards the attainment of a happiness already captured and held in a safe place, which would not escape his grasp again. But it was also by the force of inertia; there was in his soul that want of adaptability which can be seen in the bodies of certain people who, when the moment comes to avoid a collision, to snatch their clothes out of reach of a flame, or to perform any other such necessary movement, take their time (as the saying is), begin by remaining for a moment in their original position, as though seeking to find in it a starting-point, a source of strength and motion. And probably, if the coachman had interrupted him with, \"I have found the lady,\" he would have answered, \"Oh, yes, of course; that's what I told you to do. I had quite forgotten,\" and would have continued to discuss his supply of firewood, so as to hide from his servant the emotion that he had felt, and to give himself time to break away from the thraldom of his anxieties and abandon himself to pleasure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The coachman came back, however, with the report that he could not find her anywhere, and added the advice, as an old and privileged servant, \"I think, sir, that all we can do now is to go home.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the air of indifference which Swann could so lightly assume when R\u00e9mi uttered his final, unalterable response, fell from him like a cast-off cloak when he saw R\u00e9mi attempt to make him abandon hope and retire from the quest\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Certainly not!\" he exclaimed. \"We must find the lady. It is most important. She would be extremely put out\u2014it's a business matter\u2014and vexed with me if she didn't see me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I do not see how the lady can be vexed, sir,\" answered R\u00e9mi, \"since it was she that went away without waiting for you, sir, and said she was going to Pr\u00e9vost's, and then wasn't there.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the restaurants were closing, and their lights began to go out. Under the trees of the boulevards there were still a few people strolling to and fro, barely distinguishable in the gathering darkness. Now and then the ghost of a woman glided up to Swann, murmured a few words in his ear, asked him to take her home, and left him shuddering. Anxiously he explored every one of these vaguely seen shapes, as though among the phantoms of the dead, in the realms of darkness, he had been searching for a lost Eurydice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Among all the methods by which love is brought into being, among all the agents which disseminate that blessed bane, there are few so efficacious as the great gust of agitation which, now and then, sweeps over the human spirit. For then the creature in whose company we are seeking amusement at the moment, her lot is cast, her fate and ours decided, that is the creature whom we shall henceforward love. It is not necessary that she should have pleased us, up till then, any more, or even as much as others. All that is necessary is that our taste for her should become exclusive. And that condition is fulfilled so soon as\u2014in the moment when she has failed to meet us\u2014for the pleasure which we were on the point of enjoying in her charming company is abruptly substituted an anxious torturing desire, whose object is the creature herself, an irrational, absurd desire, which the laws of civilised society make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage\u2014the insensate, agonising desire to possess her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann made R\u00e9mi drive him to such restaurants as were still open; it was the sole hypothesis, now, of that happiness which he had contemplated so calmly; he no longer concealed his agitation, the price he set upon their meeting, and promised, in case of success, to reward his coachman, as though, by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce his own, he could bring it to pass, by a miracle, that Odette\u2014assuming that she had long since gone home to bed,\u2014might yet be found seated in some restaurant on the boulevards. He pursued the quest as far as the Maison Dor\u00e9e, burst twice into Tortoni's and, still without catching sight of her, was emerging from the Caf\u00e9 Anglais, striding with haggard gaze towards his carriage, which was waiting for him at the corner of the Boulevard des Italiens, when he collided with a person coming in the opposite direction; it was Odette; she explained, later, that there had been no room at Pr\u00e9vost's, that she had gone, instead, to sup at the Maison Dor\u00e9e, and had been sitting there in an alcove where he must have overlooked her, and that she was now looking for her carriage\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had so little expected to see him that she started back in alarm. As for him, he had ransacked the streets of Paris, not that he supposed it possible that he should find her, but because he would have suffered even more cruelly by abandoning the attempt. But now the joy (which, his reason had never ceased to assure him, was not, that evening at least, to be realised) was suddenly apparent, and more real than ever before; for he himself had contributed nothing to it by anticipating probabilities,\u2014it remained integral and external to himself; there was no need for him to draw on his own resources to endow it with truth\u2014'twas from itself that there emanated, 'twas itself that projected towards him that truth whose glorious rays melted and scattered like the cloud of a dream the sense of loneliness which had lowered over him, that truth upon which he had supported, nay founded, albeit unconsciously, his vision of bliss. So will a traveller, who has come down, on a day of glorious weather, to the Mediterranean shore, and is doubtful whether they still exist, those lands which he has left, let his eyes be dazzled, rather than cast a backward glance, by the radiance streaming towards him from the luminous and unfading azure at his feet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He climbed after her into the carriage which she had kept waiting, and ordered his own to follow\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had in her hand a bunch of cattleyas, and Swann could see, beneath the film of lace that covered her head, more of the same flowers fastened to a swansdown plume. She was wearing, under her cloak, a flowing gown of black velvet, caught up on one side so as to reveal a large triangular patch of her white silk skirt, with an 'insertion,' also of white silk, in the cleft of her low-necked bodice, in which were fastened a few more cattleyas. She had scarcely recovered from the shock which the sight of Swann had given her, when some obstacle made the horse start to one side. They were thrown forward from their seats; she uttered a cry, and fell back quivering and breathless\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's all right,\" he assured her, \"don't be frightened.\" And he slipped his arm round her shoulder, supporting her body against his own; then went on: \"Whatever you do, don't utter a word; just make a sign, yes or no, or you'll be out of breath again. You won't mind if I put the flowers straight on your bodice; the jolt has loosened them. I'm afraid of their dropping out; I'm just going to fasten them a little more securely.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was not used to being treated with so much formality by men, and smiled as she answered: \"No, not at all; I don't mind in the least.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he, chilled a little by her answer, perhaps, also, to bear out the pretence that he had been sincere in adopting the stratagem, or even because he was already beginning to believe that he had been, exclaimed: \"No, no; you mustn't speak. You will be out of breath again. You can easily answer in signs; I shall understand. Really and truly now, you don't mind my doing this? Look, there is a little\u2014I think it must be pollen, spilt over your dress,\u2014may I brush it off with my hand? That's not too hard; I'm not hurting you, am I? I'm tickling you, perhaps, a little; but I don't want to touch the velvet in case I rub it the wrong way. But, don't you see, I really had to fasten the flowers; they would have fallen out if I hadn't. Like that, now; if I just push them a little farther down.... Seriously, I'm not annoying you, am I? And if I just sniff them to see whether they've really lost all their scent? I don't believe I ever smelt any before; may I? Tell the truth, now.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still smiling, she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly, as who should say, \"You're quite mad; you know very well that I like it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He slipped his other hand upwards along Odette's cheek; she fixed her eyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women of the old Florentine's paintings, in whose faces he had found the type of hers; swimming at the brink of her fringed lids, her brilliant eyes, large and finely drawn as theirs, seemed on the verge of breaking from her face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears. She bent her neck, as all their necks may be seen to bend, in the pagan scenes as well as in the scriptural. And although her attitude was, doubtless, habitual and instinctive, one which she knew to be appropriate to such moments, and was careful not to forget to assume, she seemed to need all her strength to hold her face back, as though some invisible force were drawing it down towards Swann's. And Swann it was who, before she allowed her face, as though despite her efforts, to fall upon his lips, held it back for a moment longer, at a little distance between his hands. He had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her body's movements, to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to assist at its realisation, like a mother invited as a spectator when a prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves. Perhaps, moreover, Swann himself was fixing upon these features of an Odette not yet possessed, not even kissed by him, on whom he was looking now for the last time, that comprehensive gaze with which, on the day of his departure, a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view of a country to which he may never return\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he was so shy in approaching her that, after this evening which had begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete surrender, whether from fear of chilling her, or from reluctance to appear, even retrospectively, to have lied, or perhaps because he lacked the audacity to formulate a more urgent requirement than this (which could always be repeated, since it had not annoyed her on the first occasion), he resorted to the same pretext on the following days. If she had any cattleyas pinned to her bodice, he would say: \"It is most unfortunate; the cattleyas don't need tucking in this evening; they've not been disturbed as they were the other night; I think, though, that this one isn't quite straight. May I see if they have more scent than the others?\" Or else, if she had none: \"Oh! no cattleyas this evening; then there's nothing for me to arrange.\" So that for some time there was no change from the procedure which he had followed on that first evening, when he had started by touching her throat, with his fingers first and then with his lips, but their caresses began invariably with this modest exploration. And long afterwards, when the arrangement (or, rather, the ritual pretence of an arrangement) of her cattleyas had quite fallen into desuetude, the metaphor \"Do a cattleya,\" transmuted into a simple verb which they would employ without a thought of its original meaning when they wished to refer to the act of physical possession (in which, paradoxically, the possessor possesses nothing), survived to commemorate in their vocabulary the long forgotten custom from which it sprang. And yet possibly this particular manner of saying \"to make love\" had not the precise significance of its synonyms. However disillusioned we may be about women, however we may regard the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable and monotonous experience, every detail of which is known and can be described in advance, it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure if the women concerned be\u2014or be thought to be\u2014so difficult as to oblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our relations with them, as was originally for Swann the arrangement of the cattleyas. He trembled as he hoped, that evening, (but Odette, he told himself, if she were deceived by his stratagem, could not guess his intention) that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge for him from their large and richly coloured petals; and the pleasure which he already felt, and which Odette tolerated, he thought, perhaps only because she was not yet aware of it herself, seemed to him for that reason\u2014as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid the flowers of the earthly paradise\u2014a pleasure which had never before existed, which he was striving now to create, a pleasure\u2014and the special name which he was to give to it preserved its identity\u2014entirely individual and new\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must follow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her dressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before the eyes of his coachman, saying: \"What on earth does it matter what people see?\" And on evenings when he did not go to the Verdurins' (which happened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting Odette elsewhere), when\u2014more and more rarely\u2014he went into society, she would beg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. The season was spring, the nights clear and frosty. He would come away from an evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees, tell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on his going home with them, that he could not, that he was not going in their direction; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot without further orders, knowing quite well where he had to go. His friends would be left marvelling, and, as a matter of fact, Swann was no longer the same man. No one ever received a letter from him now demanding an introduction to a woman. He had ceased to pay any attention to women, and kept away from the places in which they were ordinarily to be met. In a restaurant, or in the country, his manner was deliberately and directly the opposite of that by which, only a few days earlier, his friends would have recognised him, that manner which had seemed permanently and unalterably his own. To such an extent does passion manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character, which not only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible. On the other hand, there was one thing that was, now, invariable, namely that wherever Swann might be spending the evening, he never failed to go on afterwards to Odette. The interval of space separating her from him was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend, by an irresistible gravitation, the steep slope of life itself. To be frank, as often as not, when he had stayed late at a party, he would have preferred to return home at once, without going so far out of his way, and to postpone their meeting until the morrow; but the very fact of his putting himself to such inconvenience at an abnormal hour in order to visit her, while he guessed that his friends, as he left them, were saying to one another: \"He is tied hand and foot; there must certainly be a woman somewhere who insists on his going to her at all hours,\" made him feel that he was leading the life of the class of men whose existence is coloured by a love-affair, and in whom the perpetual sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical interests has engendered a spiritual charm. Then, though he may not consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she was waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that he would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish, forgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which he had felt on the evening when Odette had left the Verdurins' before his arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable that it might even be called a state of happiness. Perhaps it was to that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which Odette had since assumed in his life. Other people are, as a rule, so immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the power to cause so much suffering or happiness to ourselves, that person seems at once to belong to a different universe, is surrounded with poetry, makes of our lives a vast expanse, quick with sensation, on which that person and ourselves are ever more or less in contact. Swann could not without anxiety ask himself what Odette would mean to him in the years that were to come. Sometimes, as he looked up from his victoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring, and saw the dazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets, he would think of that other face, gleaming and faintly roseate like the moon's, which had, one day, risen on the horizon of his mind and since then had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it bathed. If he arrived after the hour at which Odette sent her servants to bed, before ringing the bell at the gate of her little garden, he would go round first into the other street, over which, at the ground-level, among the windows (all exactly alike, but darkened) of the adjoining houses, shone the solitary lighted window of her room. He would rap upon the pane, and she would hear the signal, and answer, before running to meet him at the gate. He would find, lying open on the piano, some of her favourite music, the Valse des Roses, the Pauvre Fou of Tagliafico (which, according to the instructions embodied in her will, was to be played at her funeral); but he would ask her, instead, to give him the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. It was true that Odette played vilely, but often the fairest impression that remains in our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble of wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano. The little phrase was associated still, in Swann's mind, with his love for Odette. He felt clearly that this love was something to which there were no corresponding external signs, whose meaning could not be proved by any but himself; he realised, too, that Odette's qualities were not such as to justify his setting so high a value on the hours he spent in her company. And often, when the cold government of reason stood unchallenged, he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure. But the little phrase, as soon as it struck his ear, had the power to liberate in him the room that was needed to contain it; the proportions of Swann's soul were altered; a margin was left for a form of enjoyment which corresponded no more than his love for Odette to any external object, and yet was not, like his enjoyment of that love, purely individual, but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that of other concrete things. This thirst for an untasted charm, the little phrase would stimulate it anew in him, but without bringing him any definite gratification to assuage it. With the result that those parts of Swann's soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care for material interests, those human considerations which affect all men alike, were left bare by it, blank pages on which he was at liberty to inscribe the name of Odette. Moreover, where Odette's affection might seem ever so little abrupt and disappointing, the little phrase would come to supplement it, to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence. Watching Swann's face while he listened to the phrase, one would have said that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe more deeply. And the pleasure which the music gave him, which was shortly to create in him a real longing, was in fact closely akin, at such moments, to the pleasure which he would have derived from experimenting with perfumes, from entering into contract with a world for which we men were not created, which appears to lack form because our eyes cannot perceive it, to lack significance because it escapes our intelligence, to which we may attain by way of one sense only. Deep repose, mysterious refreshment for Swann,\u2014for him whose eyes, although delicate interpreters of painting, whose mind, although an acute observer of manners, must bear for ever the indelible imprint of the barrenness of his life,\u2014to feel himself transformed into a creature foreign to humanity, blinded, deprived of his logical faculty, almost a fantastic unicorn, a chimaera-like creature conscious of the world through his two ears alone. And as, notwithstanding, he sought in the little phrase for a meaning to which his intelligence could not descend, with what a strange frenzy of intoxication must he strip bare his innermost soul of the whole armour of reason, and make it pass, unattended, through the straining vessel, down into the dark filter of sound. He began to reckon up how much that was painful, perhaps even how much secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase; and yet to him it brought no suffering. What matter though the phrase repeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so strong! He played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt it stealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened his sense of his own happiness. He would make Odette play him the phrase again, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she must never cease to kiss him. Every kiss provokes another. Ah, in those earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. How closely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour, as to count the flowers in a meadow in May. Then she would pretend to stop, saying: \"How do you expect me to play when you keep on holding me? I can't do everything at once. Make up your mind what you want; am I to play the phrase or do you want to play with me?\" Then he would become annoyed, and she would burst out with a laugh which, was transformed, as it left her lips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. Or else she would look at him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy to figure in Botticelli's 'Life of Moses,' he would place it there, giving to Odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had finished her portrait in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the wall of the Sixtine, the idea that she was, none the less, in the room with him still, by the piano, at that very moment, ready to be kissed and won, the idea of her material existence, of her being alive, would sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that, with eyes starting from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her, he would fling himself upon this Botticelli maiden and kiss and bite her cheeks. And then, as soon as he had left the house, not without returning to kiss her once again, because he had forgotten to take away with him, in memory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove home in his victoria, blessing the name of Odette who allowed him to pay her these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring any great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever of jealousy\u2014by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak of the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening, when he had failed to find her at the Verdurins'\u2014might help him to arrive, without any recurrence of those crises, of which the first had been so distressing that it must also be the last, at the termination of this strange series of hours in his life, hours almost enchanted, in the same manner as these other, following hours, in which he drove through a deserted Paris by the light of the moon: noticing as he drove home that the satellite had now changed its position, relatively to his own, and was almost touching the horizon; feeling that his love, also, was obedient to these immutable laws of nature, he asked himself whether this period, upon which he had entered, was to last much longer, whether presently his mind's eye would cease to behold that dear countenance, save as occupying a distant and diminished position, and on the verge of ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm. For Swann was finding in things once more, since he had fallen in love, the charm that he had found when, in his adolescence, he had fancied himself an artist; with this difference, that what charm lay in them now was conferred by Odette alone. He could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his boyhood, which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later life, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the stamp of a particular being; and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure in spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit, he became gradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He went to her only in the evenings, and knew nothing of how she spent her time during the day, any more than he knew of her past; so little, indeed, that he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing us to imagine what we do not know, stimulates a desire foreknowledge. And so he never asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life had been. Only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years earlier, when he still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been Odette, as of a 'tart,' a 'kept' woman, one of those women to whom he still attributed (having lived but little in their company) the entire set of characteristics, fundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for many years, endowed by the imagination of certain novelists. He would say to himself that one has, as often as not, only to take the exact counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a person fairly, when with such a character he contrasted that of Odette, so good, so simple, so enthusiastic in the pursuit of ideals, so nearly incapable of not telling the truth that, when he had once begged her, so that they might dine together alone, to write to Mme. Verdurin, saying that she was unwell, the next day he had seen her, face to face with Mme. Verdurin, who asked whether she had recovered, blushing, stammering, and, in spite of herself, revealing in every feature how painful, what a torture it was to her to act a lie; and, while in her answer she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness, seeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and her stricken accents, for the obvious falsehood of her words\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon him in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on Ver-meer to which he had latterly returned. His servant would come in to say that Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy was in the small drawing-room. He would go in search of her, and, when he opened the door, on Odette's blushing countenance, as soon as she caught sight of Swann, would appear\u2014changing the curve of her lips, the look in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks\u2014an all-absorbing smile. Once he was left alone he would see again that smile, and her smile of the day before, another with which she had greeted him sometime else, the smile which had been her answer, in the carriage that night, when he had asked her whether she objected to his rearranging her cattleyas; and the life of Odette at all other times, since he knew nothing of it, appeared to him upon a neutral and colourless background, like those sheets of sketches by Watteau upon which one sees, here and there, in every corner and in all directions, traced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable smiles. But, once in a while, illuminating a chink of that existence which Swann still saw as a complete blank, even if his mind assured him that it was not so, because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it, some friend who knew them both, and suspecting that they were in love, had not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least importance, would describe Odette's figure, as he had seen her, that very morning, going on foot up the Rue Abbattucci, in a cape trimmed with skunks, wearing a Rembrandt hat, and a bunch of violets in her bosom. This simple outline reduced Swann to utter confusion by enabling him suddenly to perceive that Odette had an existence which was not wholly subordinated to his own; he burned to know whom she had been seeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her; he registered a vow to insist upon her telling him where she had been going at that intercepted moment, as though, in all the colourless life\u2014a life almost nonexistent, since she was then invisible to him\u2014of his mistress, there had been but a single incident apart from all those smiles directed towards himself; namely, her walking abroad beneath a Rembrandt hat, with a bunch of violets in her bosom\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except when he asked her for Vinteuil's little phrase instead of the Valse des Roses, Swann made no effort to induce her to play the things that he himself preferred, nor, in literature any more than in music, to correct the manifold errors of her taste. He fully realised that she was not intelligent. When she said how much she would like him to tell her about the great poets, she had imagined that she would suddenly get to know whole pages of romantic and heroic verse, in the style of the Vicomte de Borelli, only even more moving. As for Vermeer of Delft, she asked whether he had been made to suffer by a woman, if it was a woman that had inspired him, and once Swann had told her that no one knew, she had lost all interest in that painter. She would often say: \"I'm sure, poetry; well, of course, there'd be nothing like it if it was all true, if the poets really believed the things they said. But as often as not you'll find there's no one so mean and calculating as those fellows. I know something about poetry. I had a friend, once, who was in love with a poet of sorts. In his verses he never spoke of anything but love, and heaven, and the stars. Oh! she was properly taken in! He had more than three hundred thousand francs out of her before he'd finished.\" If, then, Swann tried to shew her in what artistic beauty consisted, how one ought to appreciate poetry or painting, after a minute or two she would cease to listen, saying: \"Yes... I never thought it would be like that.\" And he felt that her disappointment was so great that he preferred to lie to her, assuring her that what he had said was nothing, that he had only touched the surface, that he had not time to go into it all properly, that there was more in it than that. Then she would interrupt with a brisk, \"More in it? What?... Do tell me!\", but he did not tell her, for he realised how petty it would appear to her, and how different from what she had expected, less sensational and less touching; he was afraid, too, lest, disillusioned in the matter of art, she might at the same time be disillusioned in the greater matter of love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the result that she found Swann inferior, intellectually, to what she had supposed. \"You're always so reserved; I can't make you out.\" She marvelled increasingly at his indifference to money, at his courtesy to everyone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. And indeed it happens, often enough, to a greater man than Swann ever was, to a scientist or artist, when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom he lives, that the feeling in them which proves that they have been convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any admiration for his ideas\u2014for those are entirely beyond them\u2014but by their respect for what they term his good qualities. There was also the respect with which Odette was inspired by the thought of Swann's social position, although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure invitations for herself. Perhaps she felt that such attempts would be bound to fail; perhaps, indeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of her to his friends, he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind. The fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never to mention her name. Her reason for not wishing to go into society was, she had told him, a quarrel which she had had, long ago, with another girl, who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her. \"But,\" Swann objected, \"surely, people don't all know your friend.\" \"Yes, don't you see, it's like a spot of oil; people are so horrid.\" Swann was unable, frankly, to appreciate this point; on the other hand, he knew that such generalisations as \"People are so horrid,\" and \"A word of scandal spreads like a spot of oil,\" were generally accepted as true; there must, therefore, be cases to which they were literally applicable. Could Odette's case be one of these? He teased himself with the question, though not for long, for he too was subject to that mental oppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he was faced by a difficult problem. In any event, that world of society which concealed such terrors for Odette inspired her, probably, with no very great longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the world which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception of it. At the same time, while in certain respects she had retained a genuine simplicity (she had, for instance, kept up a friendship with a little dressmaker, now retired from business, up whose steep and dark and fetid staircase she clambered almost every day), she still thirsted to be in the fashion, though her idea of it was not altogether that held by fashionable people. For the latter, fashion is a thing that emanates from a comparatively small number of leaders, who project it to a considerable distance\u2014with more or less strength according as one is nearer to or farther from their intimate centre\u2014over the widening circle of their friends and the friends of their friends, whose names form a sort of tabulated index. People 'in society' know this index by heart, they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they have extracted a sort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation that Swann, for example, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of the world, if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had been guests at a dinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner had been, just as a man of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can estimate exactly the literary merit of its author. But Odette was one of those persons (an extremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable world may think, and to be found in every section of society) who do not share this knowledge, but imagine fashion to be something of quite another kind, which assumes different aspects according to the circle to which they themselves belong, but has the special characteristic\u2014common alike to the fashion of which Odette used to dream and to that before which Mme. Cottard bowed\u2014of being directly accessible to all. The other kind, the fashion of 'fashionable people,' is, it must be admitted, accessible also; but there are inevitable delays. Odette would say of some one: \"He never goes to any place that isn't really smart.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if Swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer, with a touch of contempt, \"Smart places! Why, good heavens, just fancy, at your age, having to be told what the smart places are in Paris! What do you expect me to say? Well, on Sunday mornings there's the Avenue de l'Imp\u00e9ratrice, and round the lake at five o'clock, and on Thursdays the Eden-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre, and the Hippodrome on Fridays; then there are the balls...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What balls?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, silly, the balls people give in Paris; the smart ones, I mean. Wait now, Herbinger, you know who I mean, the fellow who's in one of the jobbers' offices; yes, of course, you must know him, he's one of the best-known men in Paris, that great big fair-haired boy who wears such swagger clothes; he always has a flower in his buttonhole and a light-coloured overcoat with a fold down the back; he goes about with that old image, takes her to all the first-nights. Very well! He gave a ball the other night, and all the smart people in Paris were there. I should have loved to go! but you had to shew your invitation at the door, and I couldn't get one anywhere. After all, I'm just as glad, now, that I didn't go; I should have been killed in the crush, and seen nothing. Still, just to be able to say one had been to Herbinger's ball. You know how vain I am! However, you may be quite certain that half the people who tell you they were there are telling stories.... But I am surprised that you weren't there, a regular 'tip-topper' like you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann made no attempt, however, to modify this conception of fashion; feeling that his own came no nearer to the truth, was just as fatuous, devoid of all importance, he saw no advantage to be gained by imparting it to his mistress, with the result that, after a few months, she ceased to take any interest in the people to whose houses he went, except when they were the means of his obtaining tickets for the paddock at race-meetings or first-nights at the theatre. She hoped that he would continue to cultivate such profitable acquaintances, but she had come to regard them as less smart since the day when she had passed the Marquise de Villeparisis in the street, wearing a black serge dress and a bonnet with strings\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But she looks like a pew-opener, like an old charwoman, darling! That a marquise! Goodness knows I'm not a marquise, but you'd have to pay me a lot of money before you'd get me to go about Paris rigged out like that!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor could she understand Swann's continuing to live in his house on the Quai d'Orl\u00e9ans, which, though she dared not tell him so, she considered unworthy of him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was true that she claimed to be fond of 'antiques,' and used to assume a rapturous and knowing air when she confessed how she loved to spend the whole day 'rummaging' in second-hand shops, hunting for 'bric-\u00e0-brac,' and things of the 'right date.' Although it was a point of honour, to which she obstinately clung, as though obeying some old family custom, that she should never answer any questions, never give any account of what she did during the daytime, she spoke to Swann once about a friend to whose house she had been invited, and had found that everything in it was 'of the period.' Swann could not get her to tell him what 'period' it was. Only after thinking the matter over she replied that it was 'mediaeval'; by which she meant that the walls were panelled. Some time later she spoke to him again of her friend, and added, in the hesitating but confident tone in which one refers to a person whom one has met somewhere, at dinner, the night before, of whom one had never heard until then, but whom one's hosts seemed to regard as some one so celebrated and important that one hopes that one's listener will know quite well who is meant, and will be duly impressed: \"Her dining-room... is... eighteenth century!\" Incidentally, she had thought it hideous, all bare, as though the house were still unfinished; women looked frightful in it, and it would never become the fashion. She mentioned it again, a third time, when she shewed Swann a card with the name and address of the man who had designed the dining-room, and whom she wanted to send for, when she had enough money, to see whether he could not do one for her too; not one like that, of course, but one of the sort she used to dream of, one which, unfortunately, her little house would not be large enough to contain, with tall sideboards, Renaissance furniture and fireplaces like the Ch\u00e2teau at Blois. It was on this occasion that she let out to Swann what she really thought of his abode on the Quai d'Orl\u00e9ans; he having ventured the criticism that her friend had indulged, not in the Louis XVI style, for, he went on, although that was not, of course, done, still it might be made charming, but in the 'Sham-Antique.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You wouldn't have her live, like you, among a lot of broken-down chairs and threadbare carpets!\" she exclaimed, the innate respectability of the middle-class housewife rising impulsively to the surface through the acquired dilettantism of the 'light woman.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0People who enjoyed 'picking-up' things, who admired poetry, despised sordid calculations of profit and loss, and nourished ideals of honour and love, she placed in a class by themselves, superior to the rest of humanity. There was no need actually to have those tastes, provided one talked enough about them; when a man had told her at dinner that he loved to wander about and get his hands all covered with dust in the old furniture shops, that he would never be really appreciated in this commercial age, since he was not concerned about the things that interested it, and that he belonged to another generation altogether, she would come home saying: \"Why, he's an adorable creature; so sensitive! I had no idea,\" and she would conceive for him a strong and sudden friendship. But, on the other hand, men who, like Swann, had these tastes but did not speak of them, left her cold. She was obliged, of course, to admit that Swann was most generous with his money, but she would add, pouting: \"It's not the same thing, you see, with him,\" and, as a matter of fact, what appealed to her imagination was not the practice of disinterestedness, but its vocabulary\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Feeling that, often, he could not give her in reality the pleasures of which she dreamed, he tried at least to ensure that she should be happy in his company, tried not to contradict those vulgar ideas, that bad taste which she displayed on every possible occasion, which all the same he loved, as he could not help loving everything that came from her, which even fascinated him, for were they not so many more of those characteristic features, by virtue of which the essential qualities of the woman emerged, and were made visible? And so, when she was in a happy mood because she was going to see the Reine Topaze, or when her eyes grew serious, troubled, petulant, if she was afraid of missing the flower-show, or merely of not being in time for tea, with muffins and toast, at the Rue Royale tea-rooms, where she believed that regular attendance was indispensable, and set the seal upon a woman's certificate of 'smartness,' Swann, enraptured, as all of us are, at times, by the natural behaviour of a child, or by the likeness of a portrait, which appears to be on the point of speaking, would feel so distinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her face that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it with his lips. \"Oh, then, so little Odette wants us to take her to the flower-show, does she? she wants to be admired, does she? very well, we will take her there, we can but obey her wishes.\" As Swann's sight was beginning to fail, he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles, which he wore at home, when working, while to face the world he adopted a single eyeglass, as being less disfiguring. The first time that she saw it in his eye, she could not contain herself for joy: \"I really do think\u2014for a man, that is to say\u2014it is tremendously smart! How nice you look with it! Every inch a gentleman. All you want now is a title!\" she concluded, with a tinge of regret in her voice. He liked Odette to say these things, just as, if he had been in love with a Breton girl, he would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she believed in ghosts. Always until then, as is common among men whose taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality, a grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would accord to either taste simultaneously; yielding to the seduction of works of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose company he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common, he would take a little servant-girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some decadent piece which he had wished to see performed, or to an exhibition of impressionist painting, with the conviction, moreover, that an educated, 'society' woman would have understood them no better, but would not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily. But, now that he was in love with Odette, all this was changed; to share her sympathies, to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so attractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she liked, and did find a pleasure, not only in copying her habits but in adopting her opinions, which was all the deeper because, as those habits and opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence, they suggested to him nothing except that love, for the sake of which he had preferred them to his own. If he went again to Serge Panine, if he looked out for opportunities of going to watch Olivier M\u00e9tra conducting, it was for the pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in Odette's mind, of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes. This charm of drawing him closer to her, which her favourite plays and pictures and places possessed, struck him as being more mysterious than the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places, which appealed to him by their beauty, but without recalling her. Besides, having allowed the intellectual beliefs of his youth to grow faint, until his scepticism, as a finished 'man of the world,' had gradually penetrated them unawares, he held (or at least he had held for so long that he had fallen into the habit of saying) that the objects which we admire have no absolute value in themselves, that the whole thing is a matter of dates and castes, and consists in a series of fashions, the most vulgar of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most refined. And as he had decided that the importance which Odette attached to receiving cards tot a private view was not in itself any more ridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in going to luncheon with the Prince of Wales, so he did not think that the admiration which she professed for Monte-Carlo or for the Righi was any more unreasonable than his own liking for Holland (which she imagined as ugly) and for Versailles (which bored her to tears). And so he denied himself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself with the reflection that it was for her sake that he wished to feel, to like nothing that was not equally felt and liked by her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like everything else that formed part of Odette's environment, and was no more, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her more often, he enjoyed the society of the Verdurins. With them, since, at the heart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings, games, suppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre parties, even the infrequent 'big evenings' when they entertained 'bores,' there were the presence of Odette, the sight of Odette, conversation with Odette, an inestimable boon which the Verdurins, by inviting him to their house, bestowed on Swann, he was happier in the little 'nucleus' than anywhere else, and tried to find some genuine merit in each of its members, imagining that his tastes would lead him to frequent their society for the rest of his life. Never daring to whisper to himself, lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion, that he would always be in love with Odette, at least when he tried to suppose that he would always go to the Verdurins' (a proposition which, a priori, raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his intelligence), he saw himself for the future continuing to meet Odette every evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite to the same thing as his being permanently in love with her, but for the moment while he was in love with her, to feel that he would not, one day, cease to see her was all that he could ask. \"What a charming atmosphere!\" he said to himself. \"How entirely genuine life is to these people! They are far more intelligent, far more artistic, surely, than the people one knows. Mme. Verdurin, in spite of a few trifling exaggerations which are rather absurd, has a sincere love of painting and music! What a passion for works of art, what anxiety to give pleasure to artists! Her ideas about some of the people one knows are not quite right, but then their ideas about artistic circles are altogether wrong! Possibly I make no great intellectual demands upon conversation, but I am perfectly happy talking to Cottard, although he does trot out those idiotic puns. And as for the painter, if he is rather unpleasantly affected when he tries to be paradoxical, still he has one of the finest brains that I have ever come across. Besides, what is most important, one feels quite free there, one does what one likes without constraint or fuss. What a flow of humour there is every day in that drawing-room! Certainly, with a few rare exceptions, I never want to go anywhere else again. It will become more and more of a habit, and I shall spend the rest of my life among them.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of the Verdurin character were no more, really, than their superficial reflection of the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by his love for Odette, those qualities became more serious, more profound, more vital, as that pleasure increased. Since Mme. Verdurin gave Swann, now and then, what alone could constitute his happiness; since, on an evening when he felt anxious because Odette had talked rather more to one of the party than to another, and, in a spasm of irritation, would not take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home, Mme. Verdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous exclamation: \"Odette! You'll see M. Swann home, won't you?\"; since, when the summer holidays came, and after he had asked himself uneasily whether Odette might not leave Paris without him, whether he would still be able to see her every day, Mme. Verdurin was going to invite them both to spend the summer with her in the country; Swann, unconsciously allowing gratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and to influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that Mme. Verdurin was \"a great and noble soul.\" Should any of his old fellow-pupils in the Louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist, \"I'd a hundred times rather,\" he would reply, \"have the Verdurins.\" And, with a solemnity of diction which was new in him: \"They are magnanimous creatures, and magnanimity is, after all, the one thing that matters, the one thing that gives us distinction here on earth. Look you, there are only two classes of men, the magnanimous, and the rest; and I have reached an age when one has to take sides, to decide once and for all whom one is going to like and dislike, to stick to the people one likes, and, to make up for the time one has wasted with the others, never to leave them again as long as one lives. Very well!\" he went on, with the slight emotion which a man feels when, even without being fully aware of what he is doing, he says something, not because it is true but because he enjoys saying it, and listens to his own voice uttering the words as though they came from some one else, \"The die is now cast; I have elected to love none but magnanimous souls, and to live only in an atmosphere of magnanimity. You ask me whether Mme. Verdurin is really intelligent. I can assure you that she has given me proofs of a nobility of heart, of a loftiness of soul, to which no one could possibly attain\u2014how could they?\u2014without a corresponding loftiness of mind. Without question, she has a profound understanding of art. But it is not, perhaps, in that that she is most admirable; every little action, ingeniously, exquisitely kind, which she has performed for my sake, every friendly attention, simple little things, quite domestic and yet quite sublime, reveal a more profound comprehension of existence than all your textbooks of philosophy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* * *\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He might have reminded himself, all the same, that there were various old friends of his family who were just as simple as the Verdurins, companions of his early days who were just as fond of art, that he knew other 'great-hearted creatures,' and that, nevertheless, since he had cast his vote in favour of simplicity, the arts, and magnanimity, he had entirely ceased to see them. But these people did not know Odette, and, if they had known her, would never have thought of introducing her to him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so there was probably not, in the whole of the Verdurin circle, a single one of the 'faithful' who loved them, or believed that he loved them, as dearly as did Swann. And yet, when M. Verdurin said that he was not satisfied with Swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments, he had unwittingly discovered his wife's. Doubtless Swann had too particular an affection for Odette, as to which he had failed to take Mme. Verdurin daily into his confidence; doubtless the very discretion with which he availed himself of the Verdurins' hospitality, refraining, often, from coming to dine with them for a reason which they never suspected, and in place of which they saw only an anxiety on his part not to have to decline an invitation to the house of some 'bore' or other; doubtless, also, and despite all the precautions which he had taken to keep it from them, the gradual discovery which they were making of his brilliant position in society\u2014doubtless all these things contributed to their general annoyance with Swann. But the real, the fundamental reason was quite different. What had happened was that they had at once discovered in him a locked door, a reserved, impenetrable chamber in which he still professed silently to himself that the Princesse de Sagan was not grotesque, and that Cottard's jokes were not amusing; in a word (and for all that he never once abandoned his friendly attitude towards them all, or revolted from their dogmas), they had discovered an impossibility of imposing those dogmas upon him, of entirely converting him to their faith, the like of which they had never come across in anyone before. They would have forgiven his going to the houses of 'bores' (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he infinitely preferred the Verdurins and all their little 'nucleus') had he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores' in the presence of the 'faithful.' But that was an abjuration which, as they well knew, they were powerless to extort\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What a difference was there in a 'newcomer' whom Odette had asked them to invite, although she herself had met him only a few times, and on whom they were building great hopes\u2014the Comte de Forcheville! (It turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-law of Saniette, a discovery which filled all the 'faithful' with amazement: the manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always supposed him to be of a class inferior, socially, to their own, and had never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively aristocratic family.) Of course, Forcheville was enormously the 'swell,' which Swann was not or had quite ceased to be; of course, he would never dream of placing, as Swann now placed, the Verdurin circle above any other. But he lacked that natural refinement which prevented Swann from associating himself with the criticisms (too obviously false to be worth his notice) that Mme. Verdurin levelled at people whom he knew. As for the vulgar and affected tirades in which the painter sometimes indulged, the bag-man's pleasantries which Cottard used to hazard,\u2014whereas Swann, who liked both men sincerely, could easily find excuses for these without having either the courage or the hypocrisy to applaud them, Forcheville, on the other hand, was on an intellectual level which permitted him to be stupified, amazed by the invective (without in the least understanding what it all was about), and to be frankly delighted by the wit. And the very first dinner at the Verdurins' at which Forcheville was present threw a glaring light upon all the differences between them, made his qualities start into prominence and precipitated the disgrace of Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There was, at this dinner, besides the usual party, a professor from the Sorbonne, one Brichot, who had met M. and Mme. Verdurin at a watering-place somewhere, and, if his duties at the university and his other works of scholarship had not left him with very little time to spare, would gladly have come to them more often. For he had that curiosity, that superstitious outlook on life, which, combined with a certain amount of scepticism with regard to the object of their studies, earn for men of intelligence, whatever their profession, for doctors who do not believe in medicine, for schoolmasters who do not believe in Latin exercises, the reputation of having broad, brilliant, and indeed superior minds. He affected, when at Mme. Verdurin's, to choose his illustrations from among the most topical subjects of the day, when he spoke of philosophy or history, principally because he regarded those sciences as no more, really, than a preparation for life itself, and imagined that he was seeing put into practice by the 'little clan' what hitherto he had known only from books; and also, perhaps, because, having had drilled into him as a boy, and having unconsciously preserved, a feeling of reverence for certain subjects, he thought that he was casting aside the scholar's gown when he ventured to treat those subjects with a conversational licence, which seemed so to him only because the folds of the gown still clung\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Early in the course of the dinner, when M. de Forcheville, seated on the right of Mme. Verdurin, who, in the 'newcomer's' honour, had taken great pains with her toilet, observed to her: \"Quite original, that white dress,\" the Doctor, who had never taken his eyes off him, so curious was he to learn the nature and attributes of what he called a \"de,\" and was on the look-out for an opportunity of attracting his attention, so as to come into closer contact with him, caught in its flight the adjective 'blanche' and, his eyes still glued to his plate, snapped out, \"Blanche? Blanche of Castile?\" then, without moving his head, shot a furtive glance to right and left of him, doubtful, but happy on the whole. While Swann, by the painful and futile effort which he made to smile, testified that he thought the pun absurd, Forcheville had shewn at once that he could appreciate its subtlety, and that he was a man of the world, by keeping within its proper limits a mirth the spontaneity of which had charmed Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What are you to say of a scientist like that?\" she asked Forcheville. \"You can't talk seriously to him for two minutes on end. Is that the sort of thing you tell them at your hospital?\" she went on, turning to the Doctor. \"They must have some pretty lively times there, if that's the case. I can see that I shall have to get taken in as a patient!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I think I heard the Doctor speak of that wicked old humbug, Blanche of Castile, if I may so express myself. Am I not right, Madame?\" Brichot appealed to Mme. Verdurin, who, swooning with merriment, her eyes tightly closed, had buried her face in her two hands, from between which, now and then, escaped a muffled scream\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good gracious, Madame, I would not dream of shocking the reverent-minded, if there are any such around this table, sub rosa... I recognise, moreover, that our ineffable and Athenian\u2014oh, how infinitely Athenian\u2014Republic is capable of honouring, in the person of that obscurantist old she-Capet, the first of our chiefs of police. Yes, indeed, my dear host, yes, indeed!\" he repeated in his ringing voice, which sounded a separate note for each syllable, in reply to a protest by M. Verdurin. \"The Chronicle of Saint Denis, and the authenticity of its information is beyond question, leaves us no room for doubt on that point. No one could be more fitly chosen as Patron by a secularising proletariat than that mother of a Saint, who let him see some pretty fishy saints besides, as Suger says, and other great St. Bernards of the sort; for with her it was a case of taking just what you pleased.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who is that gentleman?\" Forcheville asked Mme. Verdurin. \"He seems to speak with great authority.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! Do you mean to say you don't know the famous Brichot? Why, he's celebrated all over Europe.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that's Br\u00e9chot, is it?\" exclaimed Forcheville, who had not quite caught the name. \"You must tell me all about him\"; he went on, fastening a pair of goggle eyes on the celebrity. \"It's always interesting to meet well-known people at dinner. But, I say, you ask us to very select parties here. No dull evenings in this house, I'm sure.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Well, you know what it is really,\" said Mme. Verdurin modestly. \"They feel safe here. They can talk about whatever they like, and the conversation goes off like fireworks. Now Brichot, this evening, is nothing. I've seen him, don't you know, when he's been with me, simply dazzling; you'd want to go on your knees to him. Well, with anyone else he's not the same man, he's not in the least witty, you have to drag the words out of him, he's even boring.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's strange,\" remarked Forcheville with fitting astonishment\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sort of wit like Brichot's would have been regarded as out-and-out stupidity by the people among whom Swann had spent his early life, for all that it is quite compatible with real intelligence. And the intelligence of the Professor's vigorous and well-nourished brain might easily have been envied by many of the people in society who seemed witty enough to Swann. But these last had so thoroughly inculcated into him their likes and dislikes, at least in everything that pertained to their ordinary social existence, including that annex to social existence which belongs, strictly speaking, to the domain of intelligence, namely, conversation, that Swann could not see anything in Brichot's pleasantries; to him they were merely pedantic, vulgar, and disgustingly coarse. He was shocked, too, being accustomed to good manners, by the rude, almost barrack-room tone which this student-in-arms adopted, no matter to whom he was speaking. Finally, perhaps, he had lost all patience that evening as he watched Mme. Verdurin welcoming, with such unnecessary warmth, this Forcheville fellow, whom it had been Odette's unaccountable idea to bring to the house. Feeling a little awkward, with Swann there also, she had asked him on her arrival: \"What do you think of my guest?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he, suddenly realising for the first time that Forcheville, whom he had known for years, could actually attract a woman, and was quite a good specimen of a man, had retorted: \"Beastly!\" He had, certainly, no idea of being jealous of Odette, but did not feel quite so happy as usual, and when Brichot, having begun to tell them the story of Blanche of Castile's mother, who, according to him, \"had been with Henry Plantagenet for years before they were married,\" tried to prompt Swann to beg him to continue the story, by interjecting \"Isn't that so, M. Swann?\" in the martial accents which one uses in order to get down to the level of an unintelligent rustic or to put the 'fear of God' into a trooper, Swann cut his story short, to the intense fury of their hostess, by begging to be excused for taking so little interest in Blanche of Castile, as he had something that he wished to ask the painter. He, it appeared, had been that afternoon to an exhibition of the work of another artist, also a friend of Mme. Verdurin, who had recently died, and Swann wished to find out from him (for he valued his discrimination) whether there had really been anything more in this later work than the virtuosity which had struck people so forcibly in his earlier exhibitions\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"From that point of view it was extraordinary, but it did not seem to me to be a form of art which you could call 'elevated,'\" said Swann with a smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Elevated... to the height of an Institute!\" interrupted Cottard, raising his arms with mock solemnity. The whole table burst out laughing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What did I tell you?\" said Mme. Verdurin to Forcheville. \"It's simply impossible to be serious with him. When you least expect it, out he comes with a joke.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she observed that Swann, and Swann alone, had not unbent. For one thing he was none too well pleased with Cottard for having secured a laugh at his expense in front of Forcheville. But the painter, instead of replying in a way that might have interested Swann, as he would probably have done had they been alone together, preferred to win the easy admiration of the rest by exercising his wit upon the talent of their dead friend\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I went up to one of them,\" he began, \"just to see how it was done; I stuck my nose into it. Yes, I don't think! Impossible to say whether it was done with glue, with soap, with sealing-wax, with sunshine, with leaven, with excrem...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"And one make twelve!\" shouted the Doctor, wittily, but just too late, for no one saw the point of his interruption\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It looks as though it were done with nothing at all,\" resumed the painter. \"No more chance of discovering the trick than there is in the 'Night Watch,' or the 'Regents,' and it's even bigger work than either Rembrandt or Hals ever did. It's all there,\u2014and yet, no, I'll take my oath it isn't.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, just as singers who have reached the highest note in their compass, proceed to hum the rest of the air in falsetto, he had to be satisfied with murmuring, smiling the while, as if, after all, there had been something irresistibly amusing in the sheer beauty of the painting: \"It smells all right; it makes your head go round; it catches your breath; you feel ticklish all over\u2014and not the faintest clue to how it's done. The man's a sorcerer; the thing's a conjuring-trick, it's a miracle,\" bursting outright into laughter, \"it's dishonest!\" Then stopping, solemnly raising his head, pitching his voice on a double-bass note which he struggled to bring into harmony, he concluded, \"And it's so loyal!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Except at the moment when he had called it \"bigger than the 'Night Watch,'\" a blasphemy which had called forth an instant protest from Mme. Verdurin, who regarded the 'Night Watch' as the supreme masterpiece of the universe (conjointly with the 'Ninth' and the 'Samothrace'), and at the word \"excrement,\" which had made Forcheville throw a sweeping glance round the table to see whether it was 'all right,' before he allowed his lips to curve in a prudish and conciliatory smile, all the party (save Swann) had kept their fascinated and adoring eyes fixed upon the painter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I do so love him when he goes up in the air like that!\" cried Mme. Verdurin, the moment that he had finished, enraptured that the table-talk should have proved so entertaining on the very night that Forcheville was dining with them for the first time. \"Hallo, you!\" she turned to her husband, \"what's the matter with you, sitting there gaping like a great animal? You know, though, don't you,\" she apologised for him to the painter, \"that he can talk quite well when he chooses; anybody would think it was the first time he had ever listened to you. If you had only seen him while you were speaking; he was just drinking it all in. And to-morrow he will tell us everything you said, without missing a word.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, really, I'm not joking!\" protested the painter, enchanted by the success of his speech. \"You all look as if you thought I was pulling your legs, that it was just a trick. I'll take you to see the show, and then you can say whether I've been exaggerating; I'll bet you anything you like, you'll come away more 'up in the air' than I am!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But we don't suppose for a moment that you're exaggerating; we only want you to go on with your dinner, and my husband too. Give M. Biche some more sole, can't you see his has got cold? We're not in any hurry; you're dashing round as if the house was on fire. Wait a little; don't serve the salad just yet.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Cottard, who was a shy woman and spoke but seldom, was not lacking, for all that, in self-assurance when a happy inspiration put the right word in her mouth. She felt that it would be well received; the thought gave her confidence, and what she was doing was done with the object not so much of shining herself, as of helping her husband on in his career. And so she did not allow the word 'salad,' which Mme. Verdurin had just uttered, to pass unchallenged\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's not a Japanese salad, is it?\" she whispered, turning towards Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness and daring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so unmistakable an allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by Dumas, she broke down in a charming, girlish laugh, not very loud, but so irresistible that it was some time before she could control it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who is that lady? She seems devilish clever,\" said Forcheville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, it is not. But we will have one for you if you will all come to dinner on Friday.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You will think me dreadfully provincial, sir,\" said Mme. Cottard to Swann, \"but, do you know, I haven't been yet to this famous Francillon that everybody's talking about. The Doctor has been (I remember now, he told me what a very great pleasure it had been to him to spend the evening with you there) and I must confess, I don't see much sense in spending money on seats for him to take me, when he's seen the play already. Of course an evening at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais is never wasted, really; the acting's so good there always; but we have some very nice friends,\" (Mme. Cottard would hardly ever utter a proper name, but restricted herself to \"some friends of ours\" or \"one of my friends,\" as being more 'distinguished,' speaking in an affected tone and with all the importance of a person who need give names only when she chooses) \"who often have a box, and are kind enough to take us to all the new pieces that are worth going to, and so I'm certain to see this Francillon sooner or later, and then I shall know what to think. But I do feel such a fool about it, I must confess, for, whenever I pay a call anywhere, I find everybody talking\u2014it's only natural\u2014about that wretched Japanese salad. Really and truly, one's beginning to get just a little tired of hearing about it,\" she went on, seeing that Swann seemed less interested than she had hoped in so burning a topic. \"I must admit, though, that it's sometimes quite amusing, the way they joke about it: I've got a friend, now, who is most original, though she's really a beautiful woman, most popular in society, goes everywhere, and she tells me that she got her cook to make one of these Japanese salads, putting in everything that young M. Dumas says you're to put in, in the play. Then she asked just a few friends to come and taste it. I was not among the favoured few, I'm sorry to say. But she told us all about it on her next 'day'; it seems it was quite horrible, she made us all laugh till we cried. I don't know; perhaps it was the way she told it,\" Mme. Cottard added doubtfully, seeing that Swann still looked grave\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And, imagining that it was, perhaps, because he had not been amused by Francillon: \"Well, I daresay I shall be disappointed with it, after all. I don't suppose it's as good as the piece Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy worships, Serge Panine. There's a play, if you like; so deep, makes you think! But just fancy giving a receipt for a salad on the stage of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Fran\u00e7ais! Now, Serge Panine\u2014! But then, it's like everything that comes from the pen of M. Georges Ohnet, it's so well written. I wonder if you know the Ma\u00eetre des Forges, which I like even better than Serge Panine.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Pardon me,\" said Swann with polite irony, \"but I can assure you that my want of admiration is almost equally divided between those masterpieces.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Really, now; that's very interesting. And what don't you like about them? Won't you ever change your mind? Perhaps you think he's a little too sad. Well, well, what I always say is, one should never argue about plays or novels. Everyone has his own way of looking at things, and what may be horrible to you is, perhaps, just what I like best.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She was interrupted by Forcheville's addressing Swann. What had happened was that, while Mme. Cottard was discussing Francillon, Forcheville had been expressing to Mme. Verdurin his admiration for what he called the \"little speech\" of the painter. \"Your friend has such a flow of language, such a memory!\" he had said to her when the painter had come to a standstill, \"I've seldom seen anything like it. He'd make a first-rate preacher. By Jove, I wish I was like that. What with him and M. Br\u00e9chot you've drawn two lucky numbers to-night; though I'm not so sure that, simply as a speaker, this one doesn't knock spots off the Professor. It comes more naturally with him, less like reading from a book. Of course, the way he goes on, he does use some words that are a bit realistic, and all that; but that's quite the thing nowadays; anyhow, it's not often I've seen a man hold the floor as cleverly as that, 'hold the spittoon,' as we used to say in the regiment, where, by the way, we had a man he rather reminds me of. You could take anything you liked\u2014I don't know what\u2014this glass, say; and he'd talk away about it for hours; no, not this glass; that's a silly thing to say, I'm sorry; but something a little bigger, like the battle of Waterloo, or anything of that sort, he'd tell you things you simply wouldn't believe. Why, Swann was in the regiment then; he must have known him.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you see much of M. Swann?\" asked Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, no!\" he answered, and then, thinking that if he made himself pleasant to Swann he might find favour with Odette, he decided to take this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable friends, but speaking as a man of the world himself, in a tone of good-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating Swann upon some undeserved good fortune: \"Isn't that so, Swann? I never see anything of you, do I?\u2014But then, where on earth is one to see him? The creature spends all his time shut up with the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles, with the Laumes and all that lot!\" The imputation would have been false at any time, and was all the more so, now that for at least a year Swann had given up going to almost any house but the Verdurins'. But the mere names of families whom the Verdurins did not know were received by them in a reproachful silence. M. Verdurin, dreading the painful impression which the mention of these 'bores,' especially when flung at her in this tactless fashion, and in front of all the 'faithful,' was bound to make on his wife, cast a covert glance at her, instinct with anxious solicitude. He saw then that in her fixed resolution to take no notice, to have escaped contact, altogether, with the news which had just been addressed to her, not merely to remain dumb but to have been deaf as well, as we pretend to be when a friend who has been in the wrong attempts to slip into his conversation some excuse which we should appear to be accepting, should we appear to have heard it without protesting, or when some one utters the name of an enemy, the very mention of whom in our presence is forbidden; Mme. Verdurin, so that her silence should have the appearance, not of consent but of the unconscious silence which inanimate objects preserve, had suddenly emptied her face of all life, of all mobility; her rounded forehead was nothing, now, but an exquisite study in high relief, which the name of those La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles, with whom Swann was always 'shut up,' had failed to penetrate; her nose, just perceptibly wrinkled in a frown, exposed to view two dark cavities that were, surely, modelled from life. You would have said that her half-opened lips were just about to speak. It was all no more, however, than a wax cast, a mask in plaster, the sculptor's design for a monument, a bust to be exhibited in the Palace of Industry, where the public would most certainly gather in front of it and marvel to see how the sculptor, in expressing the unchallengeable dignity of the Verdurins, as opposed to that of the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles or Laumes, whose equals (if not, indeed, their betters) they were, and the equals and betters of all other 'bores' upon the face of the earth, had managed to invest with a majesty that was almost Papal the whiteness and rigidity of his stone. But the marble at last grew animated and let it be understood that it didn't do to be at all squeamish if one went to that house, since the woman was always tipsy and the husband so uneducated that he called a corridor a 'collidor'!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You'd need to pay me a lot of money before I'd let any of that lot set foot inside my house,\" Mme. Verdurin concluded, gazing imperially down on Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She could scarcely have expected him to capitulate so completely as to echo the holy simplicity of the pianist's aunt, who at once exclaimed: \"To think of that, now! What surprises me is that they can get anybody to go near them; I'm sure I should be afraid; one can't be too careful. How can people be so common as to go running after them?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But he might, at least, have replied, like Forcheville: \"Gad, she's a duchess; there are still plenty of people who are impressed by that sort of thing,\" which would at least have permitted Mme. Verdurin the final retort, \"And a lot of good may it do them!\" Instead of which, Swann merely smiled, in a manner which shewed, quite clearly, that he could not, of course, take such an absurd suggestion seriously. M. Verdurin, who was still casting furtive and intermittent glances at his wife, could see with regret, and could understand only too well that she was now inflamed with the passion of a Grand Inquisitor who cannot succeed in stamping out a heresy; and so, in the hope of bringing Swann round to a retractation (for the courage of one's opinions is always a form of calculating cowardice in the eyes of the 'other side'), he broke in:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tell us frankly, now, what you think of them yourself. We shan't repeat it to them, you may be sure.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To which Swann answered: \"Why, I'm not in the least afraid of the Duchess (if it is of the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles that you're speaking). I can assure you that everyone likes going to see her. I don't go so far as to say that she's at all 'deep'\u2014\" he pronounced the word as if it meant something ridiculous, for his speech kept the traces of certain mental habits which the recent change in his life, a rejuvenation illustrated by his passion for music, had inclined him temporarily to discard, so that at times he would actually state his views with considerable warmth\u2014\"but I am quite sincere when I say that she is intelligent, while her husband is positively a bookworm. They are charming people.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His explanation was terribly effective; Mme. Verdurin now realised that this one state of unbelief would prevent her 'little nucleus' from ever attaining to complete unanimity, and was unable to restrain herself, in her fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish his words were causing her, but cried aloud, from the depths of her tortured heart, \"You may think so if you wish, but at least you need not say so to us.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It all depends upon what you call intelligence.\" Forcheville felt that it was his turn to be brilliant. \"Come now, Swann, tell us what you mean by intelligence.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There,\" cried Odette, \"that's one of the big things I beg him to tell me about, and he never will.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but...\" protested Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but nonsense!\" said Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"A water-butt?\" asked the Doctor\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To you,\" pursued Forcheville, \"does intelligence mean what they call clever talk; you know, the sort of people who worm their way into society?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Finish your sweet, so that they can take your plate away!\" said Mme. Verdurin sourly to Saniette, who was lost in thought and had stopped eating. And then, perhaps a little ashamed of her rudeness, \"It doesn't matter; take your time about it; there's no hurry; I only reminded you because of the others, you know; it keeps the servants back.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"There is,\" began Brichot, with a resonant smack upon every syllable, \"a rather curious definition of intelligence by that pleasing old anarchist F\u00e9nelon...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Just listen to this!\" Mme. Verdurin rallied Forcheville and the Doctor. \"He's going to give us F\u00e9nelon's definition of intelligence. That's interesting. It's not often you get a chance of hearing that!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Brichot was keeping F\u00e9nelon's definition until Swann should have given his own. Swann remained silent, and, by this fresh act of recreancy, spoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which Mme. Verdurin was rejoicing at being able to offer to Forcheville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You see, it's just the same as with me!\" Odette was peevish. \"I'm not at all sorry to see that I'm not the only one he doesn't find quite up to his level.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"These de La Tr\u00e9mouailles whom Mme. Verdurin has exhibited to us as so little to be desired,\" inquired Brichot, articulating vigorously, \"are they, by any chance, descended from the couple whom that worthy old snob, S\u00e9vign\u00e9, said she was delighted to know, because it was so good for her peasants? True, the Marquise had another reason, which in her case probably came first, for she was a thorough journalist at heart, and always on the look-out for 'copy.' And, in the journal which she used to send regularly to her daughter, it was Mme. de La Tr\u00e9mouaille, kept well-informed through all her grand connections, who supplied the foreign politics.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, no. I'm quite sure they aren't the same family,\" said Mme. Verdurin desperately\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Saniette who, ever since he had surrendered his untouched plate to the butler, had been plunged once more in silent meditation, emerged finally to tell them, with a nervous laugh, a story of how he had once dined with the Duc de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, the point of which was that the Duke did not know that George Sand was the pseudonym of a woman. Swann, who really liked Saniette, felt bound to supply him with a few facts illustrative of the Duke's culture, which would prove that such ignorance on his part was literally impossible; but suddenly he stopped short; he had realised, as he was speaking, that Saniette needed no proof, but knew already that the story was untrue for the simple reason that he had at that moment invented it. The worthy man suffered acutely from the Verdurins' always finding him so dull; and as he was conscious of having been more than ordinarily morose this evening, he had made up his mind that he would succeed in being amusing, at least once, before the end of dinner. He surrendered so quickly, looked so wretched at the sight of his castle in ruins, and replied in so craven a tone to Swann, appealing to him not to persist in a refutation which was already superfluous, \"All right; all right; anyhow, even if I have made a mistake that's not a crime, I hope,\" that Swann longed to be able to console him by insisting that the story was indubitably true and exquisitely funny. The Doctor, who had been listening, had an idea that it was the right moment to interject \"Se non \u00e8 vero,\" but he was not quite certain of the words, and was afraid of being caught out\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After dinner, Forcheville went up to the Doctor. \"She can't have been at all bad looking, Mme. Verdurin; anyhow, she's a woman you can really talk to; that's all I want. Of course she's getting a bit broad in the beam. But Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy! There's a little woman who knows what's what, all right. Upon my word and soul, you can see at a glance she's got the American eye, that girl has. We are speaking of Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy,\" he explained, as M. Verdurin joined them, his pipe in his mouth. \"I should say that, as a specimen of the female form\u2014\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'd rather have it in my bed than a clap of thunder!\" the words came tumbling from Cottard, who had for some time been waiting in vain until Forcheville should pause for breath, so that he might get in his hoary old joke, a chance for which might not, he feared, come again, if the conversation should take a different turn; and he produced it now with that excessive spontaneity and confidence which may often be noticed attempting to cover up the coldness, and the slight flutter of emotion, inseparable from a prepared recitation. Forcheville knew and saw the joke, and was thoroughly amused. As for M. Verdurin, he was unsparing of his merriment, having recently discovered a way of expressing it by a symbol, different from his wife's, but equally simple and obvious. Scarcely had he begun the movement of head and shoulders of a man who was 'shaking with laughter' than he would begin also to cough, as though, in laughing too violently, he had swallowed a mouthful of smoke from his pipe. And by keeping the pipe firmly in his mouth he could prolong indefinitely the dumb-show of suffocation and hilarity. So he and Mme. Verdurin (who, at the other side of the room, where the painter was telling her a story, was shutting her eyes preparatory to flinging her face into her hands) resembled two masks in a theatre, each representing Comedy, but in a different way\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin had been wiser than he knew in not taking his pipe out of his mouth, for Cottard, having occasion to leave the room for a moment, murmured a witty euphemism which he had recently acquired and repeated now whenever he had to go to the place in question: \"I must just go and see the Duc d'Aumale for a minute,\" so drolly, that M. Verdurin's cough began all over again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Now, then, take your pipe out of your mouth; can't you see, you'll choke if you try to bottle up your laughter like that,\" counselled Mme. Verdurin, as she came round with a tray of liqueurs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What a delightful man your husband is; he has the wit of a dozen!\" declared Forcheville to Mme. Cottard. \"Thank you, thank you, an old soldier like me can never say 'No' to a drink.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"M. de Forcheville thinks Odette charming,\" M. Verdurin told his wife\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, do you know, she wants so much to meet you again some day at luncheon. We must arrange it, but don't on any account let Swann hear about it. He spoils everything, don't you know. I don't mean to say that you're not to come to dinner too, of course; we hope to see you very often. Now that the warm weather's coming, we're going to have dinner out of doors whenever we can. That won't bore you, will it, a quiet little dinner, now and then, in the Bois? Splendid, splendid, that will be quite delightful....\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Aren't you going to do any work this evening, I say?\" she screamed suddenly to the little pianist, seeing an opportunity for displaying, before a 'newcomer' of Forcheville's importance, at once her unfailing wit and her despotic power over the 'faithful.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"M. de Forcheville was just going to say something dreadful about you,\" Mme. Cottard warned her husband as he reappeared in the room. And he, still following up the idea of Forcheville's noble birth, which had obsessed him all through dinner, began again with: \"I am treating a Baroness just now, Baroness Putbus; weren't there some Putbuses in the Crusades? Anyhow they've got a lake in Pomerania that's ten times the size of the Place de la Concorde. I am treating her for dry arthritis; she's a charming woman. Mme. Verdurin knows her too, I believe.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which enabled Forcheville, a moment later, finding himself alone with Mme. Cottard, to complete his favourable verdict on her husband with: \"He's an interesting man, too; you can see that he knows some good people. Gad! but they get to know a lot of things, those doctors.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"D'you want me to play the phrase from the sonata for M. Swann?\" asked the pianist\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What the devil's that? Not the sonata-snake, I hope!\" shouted M. de Forcheville, hoping to create an effect. But Dr. Cottard, who had never heard this pun, missed the point of it, and imagined that M. de Forcheville had made a mistake. He dashed in boldly to correct it: \"No, no. The word isn't serpent-\u00e0-sonates, it's serpent-\u00e0-sonnettes!\" he explained in a tone at once zealous, impatient, and triumphant\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forcheville explained the joke to him. The Doctor blushed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You'll admit it's not bad, eh, Doctor?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! I've known it for ages.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then they were silenced; heralded by the waving tremolo of the violin-part, which formed a bristling bodyguard of sound two octaves above it\u2014and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming immobility of a vertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two hundred feet below, the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley\u2014the little phrase had just appeared, distant but graceful, protected by the long, gradual unfurling of its transparent, incessant and sonorous curtain. And Swann, in his heart of hearts, turned to it, spoke to it as to a confidant in the secret of his love, as to a friend of Odette who would assure him that he need pay no attention to this Forcheville\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! you've come too late!\" Mme. Verdurin greeted one of the 'faithful,' whose invitation had been only 'to look in after dinner,' \"we've been having a simply incomparable Brichot! You never heard such eloquence! But he's gone. Isn't that so, M. Swann? I believe it's the first time you've met him,\" she went on, to emphasize the fact that it was to her that Swann owed the introduction. \"Isn't that so; wasn't he delicious, our Brichot?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann bowed politely\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No? You weren't interested?\" she asked dryly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but I assure you, I was quite enthralled. He is perhaps a little too peremptory, a little too jovial for my taste. I should like to see him a little less confident at times, a little more tolerant, but one feels that he knows a great deal, and on the whole he seems a very sound fellow.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The party broke up very late. Cottard's first words to his wife were: \"I have rarely seen Mme. Verdurin in such form as she was to-night.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What exactly is your Mme. Verdurin? A bit of a bad hat, eh?\" said Forcheville to the painter, to whom he had offered a 'lift.' Odette watched his departure with regret; she dared not refuse to let Swann take her home, but she was moody and irritable in the carriage, and, when he asked whether he might come in, replied, \"I suppose so,\" with an impatient shrug of her shoulders. When they had all gone, Mme. Verdurin said to her husband: \"Did you notice the way Swann laughed, such an idiotic laugh, when we spoke about Mme. La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She had remarked, more than once, how Swann and Forcheville suppressed the particle 'de' before that lady's name. Never doubting that it was done on purpose, to shew that they were not afraid of a title, she had made up her mind to imitate their arrogance, but had not quite grasped what grammatical form it ought to take. Moreover, the natural corruptness of her speech overcoming her implacable republicanism, she still said instinctively \"the de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles,\" or, rather (by an abbreviation sanctified by the usage of music-hall singers and the writers of the 'captions' beneath caricatures, who elide the 'de'), \"the d'La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflles,\" but she corrected herself at once to \"Madame La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle.\u2014The Duchess, as Swann calls her,\" she added ironically, with a smile which proved that she was merely quoting, and would not, herself, accept the least responsibility for a classification so puerile and absurd\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I don't mind saying that I thought him extremely stupid.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0M. Verdurin took it up. \"He's not sincere. He's a crafty customer, always hovering between one side and the other. He's always trying to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. What a difference between him and Forcheville. There, at least, you have a man who tells you straight out what he thinks. Either you agree with him or you don't. Not like the other fellow, who's never definitely fish or fowl. Did you notice, by the way, that Odette seemed all out for Forcheville, and I don't blame her, either. And then, after all, if Swann tries to come the man of fashion over us, the champion of distressed Duchesses, at any rate the other man has got a title; he's always Comte de Forcheville!\" he let the words slip delicately from his lips, as though, familiar with every page of the history of that dignity, he were making a scrupulously exact estimate of its value, in relation to others of the sort\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't mind saying,\" Mme. Verdurin went on, \"that he saw fit to utter some most venomous, and quite absurd insinuations against Brichot. Naturally, once he saw that Brichot was popular in this house, it was a way of hitting back at us, of spoiling our party. I know his sort, the dear, good friend of the family, who pulls you all to pieces on the stairs as he's going away.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Didn't I say so?\" retorted her husband. \"He's simply a failure; a poor little wretch who goes through life mad with jealousy of anything that's at all big.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had the truth been known, there was not one of the 'faithful' who was not infinitely more malicious than Swann; but the others would all take the precaution of tempering their malice with obvious pleasantries, with little sparks of emotion and cordiality; while the least indication of reserve on Swann's part, undraped in any such conventional formula as \"Of course, I don't want to say anything\u2014\" to which he would have scorned to descend, appeared to them a deliberate act of treachery. There are certain original and distinguished authors in whom the least 'freedom of speech' is thought revolting because they have not begun by flattering the public taste, and serving up to it the commonplace expressions to which it is used; it was by the same process that Swann infuriated M. Verdurin. In his case as in theirs it was the novelty of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his designs\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the Verdurins', and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most rosy light, through the admiring eyes of love\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a rule he made no appointments with Odette except for the evenings; he was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the day as well; at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit, even for an hour, the place that he held in her thoughts, and so was constantly looking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention, in any way that would not be displeasing to her. If, in a florist's or a jeweller's window, a plant or an ornament caught his eye, he would at once think of sending them to Odette, imagining that the pleasure which the casual sight of them had given him would instinctively be felt, also, by her, and would increase her affection for himself; and he would order them to be taken at once to the Rue La p\u00e9rouse, so as to accelerate the moment in which, as she received an offering from him, he might feel himself, in a sense, transported into her presence. He was particularly anxious, always, that she should receive these presents before she went out for the evening, so that her sense of gratitude towards him might give additional tenderness to her welcome when he arrived at the Verdurins', might even\u2014for all he knew\u2014if the shopkeeper made haste, bring him a letter from her before dinner, or herself, in person, upon his doorstep, come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks. As in an earlier phase, when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt upon her character, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit from her fresh particles of her intimate feelings, which she had never yet revealed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Often she was embarrassed by lack of money, and under pressure from a creditor would come to him for assistance. He enjoyed this, as he enjoyed everything which could impress Odette with his love for herself, or merely with his influence, with the extent of the use that she might make of him. Probably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, \"It's your position that attracts her,\" or at this stage, \"It's your money that she's really in love with,\" he would not have believed the suggestion, nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought that people supposed her to be attached to him, that people felt them, to be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbishness or wealth. But even if he had accepted the possibility, it might not have caused him any suffering to discover that Odette's love for him was based on a foundation more lasting than mere affection, or any attractive qualities which she might have found in him; on a sound, commercial interest; an interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might be tempted to bring their relations to an end. For the moment, while he lavished presents upon her, and performed all manner of services, he could rely on advantages not contained in his person, or in his intellect, could forego the endless, killing effort to make himself attractive. And this delight in being a lover, in living by love alone, of the reality of which he was inclined to be doubtful, the price which, in the long run, he must pay for it, as a dilettante in immaterial sensations, enhanced its value in his eyes\u2014as one sees people who are doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are really enjoyable, become convinced that they are, as also of the rare quality and absolute detachment of their own taste, when they have agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel, from which that sight and that sound may be enjoyed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day, when reflections of this order had brought him once again to the memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of Odette as of a 'kept' woman, and when, once again, he had amused himself with contrasting that strange personification, the 'kept' woman\u2014an iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered, as in some fantasy of Gustave Moreau, with poison-dripping flowers, interwoven with precious jewels\u2014with that Odette upon whose face he had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer, resentment of an act of injustice, gratitude for an act of kindness, which he had seen, in earlier days, on his own mother's face, and on the faces of friends; that Odette, whose conversation had so frequently turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone, his collections, his room, his old servant, his banker, who kept all his title-deeds and bonds;\u2014the thought of the banker reminded him that he must call on him shortly, to draw some money. And indeed, if, during the current month, he were to come less liberally to the aid of Odette in her financial difficulties than in the month before, when he had given her five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering her a diamond necklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her admiration for his generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made him so happy, and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love for her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself diminished. And then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not precisely what was implied by 'keeping' a woman (as if, in fact, that idea of 'keeping' could be derived from elements not at all mysterious nor perverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life, such as that thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn in places and mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying the household accounts and the rent, had locked up hi a drawer in the old writing-desk whence he had extracted it to send it, with four others, to Odette) and whether it was not possible to apply to Odette, since he had known her (for he never imagined for a moment that she could ever have taken a penny from anyone else, before), that title, which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her, of 'kept' woman. He could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential, happened, at that moment, to extinguish every particle of light in his brain, as instantaneously as, at a later period, when electric lighting had been everywhere installed, it became possible, merely by fingering a switch, to cut off all the supply of light from a house. His mind fumbled, for a moment, in the darkness, he took off his spectacles, wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea, the realisation that he must endeavour, in the coming month, to send Odette six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise for her and to give her pleasure\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the evening, when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet Odette at the Verdurins', or rather at one of the open-air restaurants which they liked to frequent in the Bois and especially at Saint-Cloud, he would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which, at one time, he had been a constant guest. He did not wish to lose touch with people who, for all that he knew, might be of use, some day, to Odette, and thanks to whom he was often, in the meantime, able to procure for her some privilege or pleasure. Besides, he had been used for so long to the refinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his contempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the result that, when he had reached the point after which the humblest lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely mansions, his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he could not enter the former without a feeling of acute discomfort. He had the same regard\u2014to a degree of identity which they would never have suspected\u2014for the little families with small incomes who asked him to dances in their flats (\"straight upstairs to the fifth floor, and the door on the left\") as for the Princesse de Parme, who gave the most splendid parties in Paris; but he had not the feeling of being actually 'at the ball' when he found himself herded with the fathers of families in the bedroom of the lady of the house, while the spectacle of wash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of beds converted into cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and great-coats sprawling over their counterpanes, gave him the same stifling sensation that, nowadays, people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed. If he were dining out, he would order his carriage for half-past seven; while he changed his clothes, he would be wondering, all the time, about Odette, and in this way was never alone, for the constant thought of Odette gave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar charm as to those in which she was at his side. He would get into his carriage and drive off, but he knew that this thought had jumped in after him and had settled down upon his knee, like a pet animal which he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the dinner-table, unobserved by his fellow-guests. He would stroke and fondle it, warm himself with it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him, would give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat and nostrils\u2014a new experience, this,\u2014as he fastened the bunch of columbines in his buttonhole. He had for some time been feeling neither well nor happy, especially since Odette had brought Forcheville to the Verdurins', and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in the country. But he could never summon up courage to leave Paris, even for a day, while Odette was there. The weather was warm; it was the finest part of the spring. And for all that he was driving through a city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near Combray, where, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed, thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from M\u00e9s\u00e9glise, he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an arbour of hornbeams in the garden as by the bank of the pond, fringed with forget-me-not and iris; and where, when he sat down to dinner, trained and twined by the gardener's skilful hand, there ran all about his table currant-bush and rose\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After dinner, if he had an early appointment in the Bois or at Saint-Cloud, he would rise from table and leave the house so abruptly\u2014especially if it threatened to rain, and so to scatter the 'faithful' before their normal time\u2014that on one occasion the Princesse des Laumes (at whose house dinner had been so late that Swann had left before the coffee came in, to join the Verdurins on the Island in the Bois) observed:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Really, if Swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might be some excuse for his running away like that. He seems to look upon us all as a joke.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go down to Combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the He des Cygnes or at Saint-Cloud. But as he could think only of Odette, he would return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young leaves, or if the moon had been shining. He would be welcomed by the little phrase from the sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant piano. If there was none in the garden, the Verdurins would have taken immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room or from the restaurant itself; not because Swann was now restored to favour; far from it. But the idea of arranging an ingenious form of entertainment for some one, even for some one whom they disliked, would stimulate them, during the time spent in its preparation, to a momentary sense of cordiality and affection. Now and then he would remind himself that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close, and would force himself to notice the trees and the sky. But the state of excitement into which Odette's presence never failed to throw him, added to a feverish ailment which, for some time now, had scarcely left him, robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable background to the impressions that we derive from nature\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One evening, when Swann had consented to dine with the Verdurins, and had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual banquet of an old comrades' association, Odette had at once exclaimed across the table, in front of everyone, in front of Forcheville, who was now one of the 'faithful,' in front of the painter, in front of Cottard:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I know, you have your banquet to-morrow; I sha'n't see you, then, till I get home; don't be too late.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And although Swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously, at Odette's demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the 'faithful,' he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow, before them all, with that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each other regularly every evening, his privileged position in her house, and her own preference for him which it implied. It was true that Swann had often reflected that Odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to himself there was nothing that especially flattered him when he heard it proclaimed to all the 'faithful'; but since he had observed that, to several other men than himself, Odette seemed a fascinating and desirable woman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest particles of her heart. And he had begun to attach an incalculable value to those moments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her upon his knee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that, and counted over that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly possessions, he still clung. And so, after this dinner, drawing her aside, he took care to thank her effusively, seeking to indicate to her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him, the supreme pleasure being to guarantee him immunity, for as long as his love should last and he remain vulnerable, from the assaults of jealousy\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he came away from his banquet, the next evening, it was pouring rain, and he had nothing but his victoria. A friend offered to take him home in a closed carriage, and as Odette, by the fact of her having invited him to come, had given him an assurance that she was expecting no one else, he could, with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart, rather than set off thus in the rain, have gone home and to bed. But perhaps, if she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every evening, without exception, in her company, she might grow careless, and fail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly desired it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was after eleven when he reached her door, and as he made his apology for having been unable to come away earlier, she complained that it was indeed very late; the storm had made her unwell, her head ached, and she warned him that she would not let him stay longer than half an hour, that at midnight she would send him away; a little while later she felt tired and wished to sleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No cattleya, then, to-night?\" he asked, \"and I've been looking forward so to a nice little cattleya.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she was irresponsive; saying nervously: \"No, dear, no cattleya tonight. Can't you see, I'm not well?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It might have done you good, but I won't bother you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains close round her bed and left her. But, when he was in his own house again, the idea suddenly struck him that, perhaps, Odette was expecting some one else that evening, that she had merely pretended to be tired, that she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should suppose that she was going to sleep, that the moment he had left the house she had lighted it again, and had reopened her door to the stranger who was to be her guest for the night. He looked at his watch. It was about an hour and a half since he had left her; he went out, took a cab, and stopped it close to her house, in a little street running at right angles to that other street, which lay at the back of her house, and along which he used to go, sometimes, to tap upon her bedroom window, for her to let him in. He left his cab; the streets were all deserted and dark; he walked a few yards and came out almost opposite her house. Amid the glimmering blackness of all the row of windows, the lights in which had long since been put out, he saw one, and only one, from which overflowed, between the slats of its shutters, dosed like a wine-press over its mysterious golden juice, the light that filled the room within, a light which on so many evenings, as soon as he saw it, far off, as he turned into the street, had rejoiced his heart with its message: \"She is there\u2014expecting you,\" and now tortured him with: \"She is there with the man she was expecting.\" He must know who; he tiptoed along by the wall until he reached the window, but between the slanting bars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only, in the silence of the night, the murmur of conversation. What agony he suffered as he watched that light, in whose golden atmosphere were moving, behind the closed sash, the unseen and detested pair, as he listened to that murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his own departure, the perfidy of Odette, and the pleasures which she was at that moment tasting with the stranger\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its uncertainty, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, at that first moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost within his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light, caught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which, when he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or rather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had come there very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn that he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while he himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him, as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been tricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in their error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they believed to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a plan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to tap upon the shutter. And, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable feeling) at that moment was something more than relief at the solution of a doubt, at the soothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure. If, since he had fallen in love, things had recovered a little of the delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago\u2014though only when a light was shed upon them by a thought, a memory of Odette\u2014now it was another of the faculties, prominent in the studious days of his youth, that Odette had quickened with new life, the passion for truth, but for a truth which, too, was interposed between himself and his mistress, receiving its light from her alone, a private and personal truth the sole object of which (an infinitely precious object, and one almost impersonal in its absolute beauty) was Odette\u2014Odette in her activities, her environment, her projects, and her past. At every other period in his life, the little everyday words and actions of another person had always seemed wholly valueless to Swann; if gossip about such things were repeated to him, he would dismiss it as insignificant, and while he listened it was only the lowest, the most commonplace part of his mind that was interested; at such moments he felt utterly dull and uninspired. But in this strange phase of love the personality of another person becomes so enlarged, so deepened, that the curiosity which he could now feel aroused in himself, to know the least details of a woman's daily occupation, was the same thirst for knowledge with which he had once studied history. And all manner of actions, from which, until now, he would have recoiled in shame, such as spying, to-night, outside a window, to-morrow, for all he knew, putting adroitly provocative questions to casual witnesses, bribing servants, listening at doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with the deciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the interpretation of old monuments, that was to say, so many different methods of scientific investigation, each one having a definite intellectual value and being legitimately employable in the search for truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at the thought that Odette would now know that he had suspected her, that he had returned, that he had posted himself outside her window. She had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who spied. What he was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would detest him for ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as he refrained from knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she loved him still. How often is not the prospect of future happiness thus sacrificed to one's impatient insistence upon an immediate gratification. But his desire to know the truth was stronger, and seemed to him nobler than his desire for her. He knew that the true story of certain events, which he would have given his life to be able to reconstruct accurately and in full, was to be read within that window, streaked with bars of light, as within the illuminated, golden boards of one of those precious manuscripts, by whose wealth of artistic treasures the scholar who consults them cannot remain unmoved. He yearned for the satisfaction of knowing the truth which so impassioned him in that brief, fleeting, precious transcript, on that translucent page, so warm, so beautiful. And besides, the advantage which he felt\u2014which he so desperately wanted to feel\u2014that he had over them, lay perhaps not so much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew. He drew himself up on tiptoe. He knocked. They had not heard; he knocked again; louder; their conversation ceased. A man's voice\u2014he strained his ears to distinguish whose, among such of Odette's friends as he knew, the voice could be\u2014asked:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Who's that?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could not be certain of the voice. He knocked once again. The window first, then the shutters were thrown open. It was too late, now, to retire, and since she must know all, so as not to seem too contemptible, too jealous and inquisitive, he called out in a careless, hearty, welcoming tone:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Please don't bother; I just happened to be passing, and saw the light. I wanted to know if you were feeling better.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He looked up. Two old gentlemen stood facing him, in the window, one of them with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into the room, a room that he had never seen before. Having fallen into the habit, When he came late to Odette, of identifying her window by the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows otherwise all alike, he had been misled, this time, by the light, and had knocked at the window beyond hers, in the adjoining house. He made what apology he could and hurried home, overjoyed that the satisfaction of his curiosity had preserved their love intact, and that, having feigned for so long, when in Odette's company, a sort of indifference, he had not now, by a demonstration of jealousy, given her that proof of the excess of his own passion which, in a pair of lovers, fully and finally dispenses the recipient from the obligation to love the other enough. He never spoke to her of this misadventure, he ceased even to think of it himself. But now and then his thoughts in their wandering course would come upon this memory where it lay unobserved, would startle it into life, thrust it more deeply down into his consciousness, and leave him aching with a sharp, far-rooted pain. As though this had been a bodily pain, Swann's mind was powerless to alleviate it; in the case of bodily pain, however, since it is independent of the mind, the mind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished, that it has momentarily ceased. But with this mental pain, the mind, merely by recalling it, created it afresh. To determine not to think of it was but to think of it still, to suffer from it still. And when, in conversation with his friends, he forgot his sufferings, suddenly a word casually uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a clumsy hand has touched his aching limb. When he came away from Odette, he was happy, he felt calm, he recalled the smile with which, in gentle mockery, she had spoken to him of this man or of that, a smile which was all tenderness for himself; he recalled the gravity of her head which she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall, as though against her will, upon his lips, as she had done on that first evening in the carriage; her languishing gaze at him while she lay nestling in his arms, her bended head seeming to recede between her shoulders, as though shrinking from the cold\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But then, at once, his jealousy, as it had been the shadow of his love, presented him with the complement, with the converse of that new smile with which she had greeted him that very evening,\u2014with which, now, perversely, she was mocking Swann while she tendered her love to another\u2014of that lowering of her head, but lowered now to fall on other lips, and (but bestowed upon a stranger) of all the marks of affection that she had shewn to him. And all these voluptuous memories which he bore away from her house were, as one might say, but so many sketches, rough plans, like the schemes of decoration which a designer submits to one in outline, enabling Swann to form an idea of the various attitudes, aflame or faint with passion, which she was capable of adopting for others. With the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he tasted in her company, every new caress that he invented (and had been so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret torture-chamber\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A fresh turn was given to the screw when Swann recalled a sudden expression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the first time, in Odette's eyes. It was after dinner at the Verdurins'. Whether it was because Forcheville, aware that Saniette, his brother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt of him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed by some awkward remark which Saniette had made to him, although it had passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever tactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for some time looking out for an opportunity of securing the expulsion from the house of a fellow-guest who knew rather too much about him, and whom he knew to be so nice-minded that he himself could not help feeling embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room, Forcheville replied to Saniette's tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse, going out of his way to insult him, emboldened, the louder he shouted, by the fear, the pain, the entreaties of his victim, that the poor creature, after asking Mme. Verdurin whether he should stay and receiving no answer, had left the house in stammering confusion and with tears in his eyes. Odette had looked on, impassive, at this scene; but when the door had closed behind Saniette, she had forced the normal expression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs, so as to bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as Forcheville; her eyes had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity, of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim; she had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly implied: \"That's finished him off, or I'm very much mistaken. Did you see what a fool he looked? He was actually crying,\" that Forcheville, when his eyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended anger with which he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: \"He need only have made himself pleasant and he'd have been here still; a good scolding does a man no harm, at any time.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day when Swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call, and had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see, it occurred to him to go, instead, to Odette, at an hour when, although he never went to her house then as a rule, he knew that she was always at home, resting or writing letters until tea-time, and would enjoy seeing her for a moment, if it did not disturb her. The porter told him that he believed Odette to be in; Swann rang the bell, thought that he heard a sound, that he heard footsteps, but no one came to the door. Anxious and annoyed, he went round to the other little street, at the back of her house, and stood beneath her bedroom window; the curtains were drawn and he could see nothing; he knocked loudly upon the pane, he shouted; still no one came. He could see that the neighbours were staring at him. He turned away, thinking that, after all, he had perhaps been mistaken in believing that he heard footsteps; but he remained so preoccupied with the suspicion that he could turn his mind to nothing else. After waiting for an hour, he returned. He found her at home; she told him that she had been in the house when he rang, but had been asleep; the bell had awakened her; she had guessed that it must be Swann, and had run out to meet him, but he had already gone. She had, of course, heard him knocking at the window. Swann could at once detect in this story one of those fragments of literal truth which liars, when taken by surprise, console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely incorporated, and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude. It was true that, when Odette had just done something which she did not wish to disclose, she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her heart. But as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to whom she was obliged to lie, she became uneasy, all her ideas melted like wax before a flame, her inventive and her reasoning faculties were paralysed, she might ransack her brain but would find only a void; still, she must say something, and there lay within her reach precisely the fact which she had wished to conceal, which, being the truth, was the one thing that had remained. She broke off from it a tiny fragment, of no importance in itself, assuring herself that, after all, it was the best thing to do, since it was a detail of the truth, and less dangerous, therefore, than a falsehood. \"At any rate, this is true,\" she said to herself; \"that's always something to the good; he may make inquiries; he will see that this is true; it won't be this, anyhow, that will give me away.\" But she was wrong; it was what gave her away; she had not taken into account that this fragmentary detail of the truth had sharp edges which could not: be made to fit in, except to those contiguous fragments of the truth from which she had arbitrarily detached it, edges which, whatever the fictitious details in which she might embed it, would continue to shew, by their overlapping angles and by the gaps which she had forgotten to fill, that its proper place was elsewhere\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She admits that she heard me ring, and then knock, that she knew it was myself, that she wanted to see me,\" Swann thought to himself. \"But that doesn't correspond with the fact that she did not let me in.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he thought that, if left to herself, Odette might perhaps produce some falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she spoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and sorrowful piety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly feeling, since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that, like the veil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a faint outline of that infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable truth;\u2014what she had been doing, that afternoon, at three o'clock, when he had called,\u2014a truth of which he would never possess any more than these falsifications, illegible and divine traces, a truth which would exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature, who would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never yield it up to him. It was true that he had, now and then, a strong suspicion that Odette's daily activities were not hi themselves passionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have with other men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or for every rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with fever or of inciting to suicide. He realised, at such moments, that that interest, that gloom, existed in him only as a malady might exist, and that, once he was cured of the malady, the actions of Odette, the kisses that she might have bestowed, would become once again as innocuous as those of countless other women. But the consciousness that the painful curiosity with which Swann now studied them had its origin only in himself was not enough to make him decide that it was unreasonable to regard that curiosity as important, and to take every possible step to satisfy it. Swann had, in fact, reached an age the philosophy of which\u2014supported, in his case, by the current philosophy of the day, as well as by that of the circle in which he had spent most of his life, the group that surrounded the Princesse des Laumes, in which one's intelligence was understood to increase with the strength of one's disbelief in everything, and nothing real and incontestable was to be discovered, except the individual tastes of each of its members\u2014is no longer that of youth, but a positive, almost a medical philosophy, the philosophy of men who, instead of fixing their aspirations upon external objects, endeavour to separate from the accumulation of the years already spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they can regard as characteristic and permanent, and with which they will deliberately arrange, before anything else, that the kind of existence which they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious. Swann deemed it wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived from not knowing what Odette had done, just as he made allowance for the impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to anticipate in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring, with regard to the daily occupations of Odette, information the lack of which would make him unhappy, just as he reserved a margin for the gratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be expected (at least, before he had fallen in love) such as his taste for collecting things, or for good cooking\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he proposed to take leave of Odette, and to return home, she begged him to stay a little longer, and even detained him forcibly, seizing him by the arm as he was opening the door to go. But he gave no thought to that, for, among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little incidents which go to make up a conversation, it is inevitable that we should pass (without noticing anything that arouses our interest) by those that hide a truth for which our suspicions are blindly searching, whereas we stop to examine others beneath which nothing lies concealed. She kept on saying: \"What a dreadful pity; you never by any chance come in the afternoon, and the one time you do come then I miss you.\" He knew very well that she was not sufficiently in love with him to be so keenly distressed merely at having missed his visit, but as she was a good-natured woman, anxious to give him pleasure, and often sorry when she had done anything that annoyed him, he found it quite natural that she should be sorry, on this occasion, that she had deprived him of that pleasure of spending an hour in her company, which was so very great a pleasure, if not to herself, at any rate to him. All the same, it was a matter of so little importance that her air of unrelieved sorrow began at length to bewilder him. She reminded him, even more than was usual, of the faces of some of the women created by the painter of the Primavera.' She had, at that moment, their downcast, heartbroken expression, which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief too heavy to be borne, when they are merely allowing the Infant Jesus to play with a pomegranate, or watching Moses pour water into a trough. He had seen the same sorrow once before on her face, but when, he could no longer say. Then, suddenly, he remembered it; it was when Odette had lied, in apologising to Mme. Verdurin on the evening after the dinner from which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness, but really so that she might be alone with Swann. Surely, even had she been the most scrupulous of women, she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent a lie. But the lies which Odette ordinarily told were less innocent, and served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends. And so, when she lied, smitten with fear, feeling herself to be but feebly armed for her defence, unconfident of success, she was inclined to weep from sheer exhaustion, as children weep sometimes when they have not slept. She knew, also, that her lie, as a rule, was doing a serious injury to the man to whom she was telling it, and that she might find herself at his mercy if she told it badly. Therefore she felt at once humble and culpable in his presence. And when she had to tell an insignificant, social lie its hazardous associations, and the memories which it recalled, would leave her weak with a sense of exhaustion and penitent with a consciousness of wrongdoing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What depressing lie was she now concocting for Swann's benefit, to give her that pained expression, that plaintive voice, which seemed to falter beneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make, and to plead for pardon? He had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what had occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him, but something more immediate, something, possibly, which had not yet happened, but might happen now at any time, and, when it did, would throw a light upon that earlier event. At that moment, he heard the front-door bell ring. Odette never stopped speaking, but her words dwindled into an inarticulate moan. Her regret at not having seen Swann that afternoon, at not having opened the door to him, had melted into a universal despair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could hear the gate being closed, and the sound of a carriage, as though some one were going away\u2014probably the person whom Swann must on no account meet\u2014after being told that Odette was not at home. And then, when he reflected that, merely by coming at an hour when he was not in the habit of coming, he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of which she did not wish him to know, he had a feeling of discouragement that amounted, almost, to distress. But since he was in love with Odette, since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards her, the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt for her only, and murmured: \"Poor darling!\" When finally he left her, she took up several letters which were lying on the table, and asked him if he would be so good as to post them for her. He walked along to the post-office, took the letters from his pocket, and, before dropping each of them into the box, scanned its address. They were all to tradesmen, except the last, which was to Forcheville. He kept it in his hand. \"If I saw what was in this,\" he argued, \"I should know what she calls him, what she says to him, whether there really is anything between them. Perhaps, if I don't look inside, I shall be lacking in delicacy towards Odette, since in this way alone I can rid myself of a suspicion which is, perhaps, a calumny on her, which must, in any case, cause her suffering, and which can never possibly be set at rest, once the letter is posted.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He left the post-office and went home, but he had kept the last letter in his pocket. He lighted a candle, and held up close to its flame the envelope which he had not dared to open. At first he could distinguish nothing, but the envelope was thin, and by pressing it down on to the stiff card which it enclosed he was able, through the transparent paper, to read the concluding words. They were a coldly formal signature. If, instead of its being himself who was looking at a letter addressed to Forcheville, it had been Forcheville who had read a letter addressed to Swann, he might have found words in it of another, a far more tender kind! He took a firm hold of the card, which was sliding to and fro, the envelope being too large for it and then, by moving it with his finger and thumb, brought one line after another beneath the part of the envelope where the paper was not doubled, through which alone it was possible to read\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly. Not that it mattered, for he had seen enough to assure himself that the letter was about some trifling incident of no importance, and had nothing at all to do with love; it was something to do with Odette's uncle. Swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line \"I was right,\" but did not understand what Odette had been right in doing, until suddenly a word which he had not been able, at first, to decipher, came to light and made the whole sentence intelligible: \"I was right to open the door; it was my uncle.\" To open the door! Then Forcheville had been there when Swann rang the bell, and she had sent him away; hence the sound that Swann had heard\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After that he read the whole letter; at the end she apologised for having treated Forcheville with so little ceremony, and reminded him that he had left his cigarette-case at her house, precisely what she had written to Swann after one of his first visits. But to Swann she had added: \"Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back.\" To Forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion that could suggest any intrigue between them. And, really, he was obliged to admit that in all this business Forcheville had been worse treated than himself, since Odette was writing to him to make him believe that her visitor had been an uncle. From which it followed that he, Swann, was the man to whom she attached importance, and for whose sake she had sent the other away. And yet, if there had been nothing between Odette and Forcheville, why not have opened the door at once, why have said, \"I was right to open the door; it was my uncle.\" Right? if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could Forcheville possibly have accounted for her not opening the door? For a time Swann stood still there, heartbroken, bewildered, and yet happy; gazing at this envelope which Odette had handed to him without a scruple, so absolute was her trust in his honour; through its transparent window there had been disclosed to him, with the secret history of an incident which he had despaired of ever being able to learn, a fragment of the life of Odette, seen as through a narrow, luminous incision, cut into its surface without her knowledge. Then his jealousy rejoiced at the discovery, as though that jealousy had had an independent existence, fiercely egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed its vitality, even at the expense of Swann himself. Now it had food in store, and Swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening, over the visits that Odette had received about five o'clock, and could seek to discover where Forcheville had been at that hour. For Swann's affection for Odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on it, from the beginning, by his ignorance of the occupations in which she passed her days, as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him from supplementing that ignorance by imagination. He was not jealous, at first, of the whole of Odette's life, but of those moments only in which an incident, which he had perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose that Odette might have played him false. His jealousy, like an octopus which throws out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle, fastened itself irremovably first to that moment, five o'clock in the afternoon, then to another, then to another again. But Swann was incapable of inventing his sufferings. They were only the memory, the perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From without, however, everything brought him fresh suffering. He decided to separate Odette from Forcheville, by taking her away for a few days to the south. But he imagined that she was coveted by every male person in the hotel, and that she coveted them in return. And so he, who, in old days, when he travelled, used always to seek out new people and crowded places, might now be seen fleeing savagely from human society as if it had cruelly injured him. And how could he not have turned misanthrope, when in every man he saw a potential lover for Odette? Thus his jealousy did even more than the happy, passionate desire which he had originally felt for Odette had done to alter Swann's character, completely changing, in the eyes of the world, even the outward signs by which that character had been intelligible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read Odette's letter to Forcheville, Swann went to a dinner which the Verdurins were giving in the Bois. As the party was breaking up he noticed a series of whispered discussions between Mme. Verdurin and several of her guests, and thought that he heard the pianist being reminded to come next day to a party at Chatou; now he, Swann, had not been invited to any party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Verdurins had spoken only in whispers, and in vague terms, but the painter, perhaps without thinking, shouted out: \"There must be no lights of any sort, and he must play the Moonlight Sonata in the dark, for us to see by.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. Verdurin, seeing that Swann was within earshot, assumed that expression in which the two-fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and to preserve, oneself, an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the listener, is neutralised in an intense vacuity; in which the unflinching signs of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence, an expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder, the enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who have made it, at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have been made. Odette seemed suddenly to be in despair, as though she had decided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of life, and Swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated him from the point at which, after leaving the restaurant, while he drove her home, he would be able to ask for an explanation, to make her promise, either that she would not go to Chatou next day, or that she would procure an invitation for him also, and to lull to rest in her arms the anguish that still tormented him. At last the carriages were ordered. Mme. Verdurin said to Swann:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good-bye, then. We shall see you soon, I hope,\" trying, by the friendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile, to prevent him from noticing that she Was not saying, as she would always have until then:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To-morrow, then, at Chatou, and at my house the day after.\" M. and Mme. Verdurin made Forcheville get into their carriage; Swann's was drawn up behind it, and he waited for theirs to start before helping Odette into his own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Odette, we'll take you,\" said Mme. Verdurin, \"we've kept a little corner specially for you, beside M. de Forcheville.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, Mme. Verdurin,\" said Odette meekly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! I thought I was to take you home,\" cried Swann, flinging discretion to the winds, for the carriage-door hung open, time was precious, and he could not, in his present state, go home without her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But Mme. Verdurin has asked me...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"That's all right, you can quite well go home alone; we've left you like this dozens of times,\" said Mme. Verdurin\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I had something important to tell Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Very well, you can write it to her instead.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Good-bye,\" said Odette, holding out her hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He tried hard to smile, but could only succeed in looking utterly dejected\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What do you think of the airs that Swann is pleased to put on with us?\" Mme. Verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home. \"I was afraid he was going to eat me, simply because we offered to take Odette back. It really is too bad, that sort of thing. Why doesn't he say, straight out, that we keep a disorderly house? I can't conceive how Odette can stand such manners. He positively seems to be saying, all the time, 'You belong to me!' I shall tell Odette exactly what I think about it all, and I hope she will have the sense to understand me.\" A moment later she added, inarticulate with rage: \"No, but, don't you see, the filthy creature...\" using unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of the same obscure need to justify herself\u2014like Fran\u00e7oise at Combray when the chicken refused to die\u2014the very words which the last convulsions of an inoffensive animal in its death agony wring from the peasant who is engaged in taking its life. And when Mme. Verdurin's carriage had moved on, and Swann's took its place, his coachman, catching sight of his face, asked whether he was unwell, or had heard bad news\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through the Bois, that he came home. He talked to himself, aloud, and in the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt when describing the charms of the 'little nucleus' and extolling the magnanimity of the Verdurins. But just as the conversation, the smiles, the kisses of Odette became as odious to him as he had once found them charming, if they were diverted to others than himself, so the Verdurins' drawing-room, which, not an hour before, had still seemed to him amusing, inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with a sort of moral aristocracy, now that it was another than himself whom Odette was going to meet there, to love there without restraint, laid bare to him all its absurdities, its stupidity, its shame\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He drew a fanciful picture, at which he shuddered in disgust, of the party next evening at Chatou. \"Imagine going to Chatou, of all places! Like a lot of drapers after closing time! Upon my word, these people are sublime in their smugness; they can't really exist; they must all have come out of one of Labiche's plays!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Cottards would be there; possibly Brichot. \"Could anything be more grotesque than the lives of these little creatures, hanging on to one another like that. They'd imagine they were utterly lost, upon my soul they would, if they didn't all meet again to-morrow at Chatou!\" Alas! there would be the painter there also, the painter who enjoyed match-making, who would invite Forcheville to come with Odette to his studio. He could see Odette, in a dress far too smart for the country, \"for she is so vulgar in that way, and, poor little thing, she is such a fool!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could hear the jokes that Mme. Verdurin would make after dinner, jokes which, whoever the 'bore' might be at whom they were aimed, had always amused him because he could watch Odette laughing at them, laughing with him, her laughter almost a part of his. Now he felt that it was possibly at him that they would make Odette laugh. \"What a fetid form of humour!\" he exclaimed, twisting his mouth into an expression of disgust so violent that he could feel the muscles of his throat stiffen against his collar. \"How, in God's name, can a creature made in His image find anything to laugh at in those nauseating witticisms? The least sensitive nose must be driven away in horror from such stale exhalations. It is really impossible to believe that any human being is incapable of understanding that, in allowing herself merely to smile at the expense of a fellow-creature who has loyally held out his hand to her, she is casting herself into a mire from which it will be impossible, with the best will in the world, ever to rescue her. I dwell so many miles above the puddles in which these filthy little vermin sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities, that I cannot possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a Verdurin!\" he cried, tossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body. \"God knows that I have honestly attempted to pull Odette out of that sewer, and to teach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air. But human patience has its limits, and mine is at an end,\" he concluded, as though this sacred mission to tear Odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from longer than a few minutes ago, as though he had not undertaken it only since it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might, perchance, be directed at himself, and might have the effect of detaching Odette from him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He could see the pianist sitting down to play the Moonlight Sonata, and the grimaces of Mme. Verdurin, in terrified anticipation of the wrecking of her nerves by Beethoven's music. \"Idiot, liar!\" he shouted, \"and a creature like that imagines that she's fond of Art!\" She would say to Odette, after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for Forcheville, as she had so often done for himself: \"You can make room for M. de Forcheville there, can't you, Odette?\"... '\"In the dark!' Codfish! Pander!\"... 'Pander' was the name he applied also to the music which would invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each other's eyes, to feel for each other's hands. He felt that there was much to be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards the arts, such as Plato adopted, and Bossuet, and the old school of education in France\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a word, the life which they led at the Verdurins', which he had so often described as 'genuine,' seemed to him now the worst possible form of life, and their 'little nucleus' the most degraded class of society. \"It really is,\" he repeated, \"beneath the lowest rung of the social ladder, the nethermost circle of Dante. Beyond a doubt, the august words of the Florentine refer to the Verdurins! When one comes to think of it, surely people 'in society' (and, though one may find fault with them now and then, still, after all they are a very different matter from that gang of blackmailers) shew a profound sagacity in refusing to know them, or even to dirty the tips of their fingers with them. What a sound intuition there is in that 'Noli me tangere' motto of the Faubourg Saint-Germain.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had long since emerged from the paths and avenues of the Bois, he had almost reached his own house, and still, for he had not yet thrown off the intoxication of grief, or his whim of insincerity, but was ever more and more exhilarated by the false intonation, the artificial sonority of his own voice, he continued to perorate aloud in the silence of the night: \"People 'in society' have their failings, as no one knows better than I; but, after all, they are people to whom some things, at least, are impossible. So-and-so\" (a fashionable woman whom he had known) \"was far from being perfect, but, after all, one did find in her a fundamental delicacy, a loyalty in her conduct which made her, whatever happened, incapable of a felony, which fixes a vast gulf between her and an old hag like Verdurin. Verdurin! What a name! Oh, there's something complete about them, something almost fine in their trueness to type; they're the most perfect specimens of their disgusting class! Thank God, it was high time that I stopped condescending to promiscuous intercourse with such infamy, such dung.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so earlier, to the Verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the Verdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured and protected his love, to excite Swann to that state of intoxication in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which, even when disseminated through the medium of other persons, could have come to him from Odette alone;\u2014so the immorality (had it really existed) which he now found in the Verdurins would have been powerless, if they had not invited Odette with Forcheville and without him, to unstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their 'infamy.' Doubtless Swann's voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it refused to utter those words full of disgust at the Verdurins and their circle, and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it, save in an artificial and rhetorical tone, and as though his words had been chosen rather to appease his anger than to express his thoughts. The latter, in fact, while he abandoned himself to invective, were probably, though he did not know it, occupied with a wholly different matter, for once he had reached his house, no sooner had he closed the front-door behind him than he suddenly struck his forehead, and, making his servant open the door again, dashed out into the street shouting, in a voice which, this time, was quite natural; \"I believe I have found a way of getting invited to the dinner at Chatou to-morrow!\" But it must have been a bad way, for M. Swann was not invited; Dr. Cottard, who, having been summoned to attend a serious case in the country, had not seen the Verdurins for some days, and had been prevented from appearing at Chatou, said, on the evening after this dinner, as he sat down to table at their house:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, aren't we going to see M. Swann this evening? He is quite what you might call a personal friend...\" \"I sincerely trust that we sha'n't!\" cried Mme. Verdurin. \"Heaven preserve us from him; he's too deadly for words, a stupid, ill-bred boor.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On hearing these words Cottard exhibited an intense astonishment blended with entire submission, as though in the face of a scientific truth which contradicted everything that he had previously believed, but was supported by an irresistible weight of evidence; with timorous emotion he bowed his head over his plate, and merely replied: \"Oh\u2014oh\u2014oh\u2014oh\u2014oh!\" traversing, in an orderly retirement of his forces, into the depths of his being, along a descending scale, the whole compass of his voice. After which there was no more talk of Swann at the Verdurins'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0_______________________________\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so that drawing-room which had brought Swann and Odette together became an obstacle in the way of their meeting. She no longer said to him, as she had said in the early days of their love: \"We shall meet, anyhow, to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins',\" but \"We sha'n't be able to meet to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the Verdurins'.\" Or else the Verdurins were taking her to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, to see Une Nuit de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre, and Swann could read in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go, which, but a little time before, he could not have refrained from greeting with a kiss as it flitted across the face of his mistress, but which now exasperated him. \"Yet I'm not really angry,\" he assured himself, \"when I see how she longs to run away and scratch from maggots in that dunghill of cacophony. I'm disappointed; not for myself, but for her; disappointed to find that, after living for more than six months in daily contact with myself, she has not been capable of improving her mind even to the point of spontaneously eradicating from it a taste for Victor Mass\u00e9! More than that, to find that she has not arrived at the stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego an amusement when she is asked to do so. She ought to have the sense to say: 'I shall not go,' if it were only from policy, since it is by what she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and for all.\" And having persuaded himself that it was solely, after all, in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of Odette's spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening instead of going to the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, he adopted the same line of reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had used with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I swear to you,\" he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the theatre, \"that, in asking you not to go, I should hope, were I a selfish man, for nothing so much as that you should refuse, for I have a thousand other things to do this evening, and I shall feel that I have been tricked and trapped myself, and shall be thoroughly annoyed, if, after all, you tell me that you are not going. But my occupations, my pleasures are not everything; I must think of you also. A day may come when, seeing me irrevocably sundered from you, you will be entitled to reproach me with not having warned you at the decisive hour in which I felt that I was going to pass judgment on you, one of those stern judgments which love cannot long resist. You see, your Nuit de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (what a title!) has no bearing on the point. What I must know is whether you are indeed one of those creatures in the lowest grade of mentality and even of charm, one of those contemptible creatures who are incapable of foregoing a pleasure. For if you are such, how could anyone love you, for you are not even a person, a definite, imperfect, but at least perceptible entity. You are a formless water that will trickle down any slope that it may come upon, a fish devoid of memory, incapable of thought, which all its life long in its aquarium will continue to dash itself, a hundred times a day, against a wall of glass, always mistaking it for water. Do you realise that your answer will have the effect\u2014I do not say of making me cease from that moment to love you, that goes without saying, but of making you less attractive to my eyes when I realise that you are not a person, that you are beneath everything in the world and have not the intelligence to raise yourself one inch higher? Obviously, I should have preferred to ask you, as though it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your Nuit de Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject a name), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. But, since I had resolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue depend upon your answer, I considered it more honourable to give you due warning.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, Odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty. Although the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it was to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes which her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying any heed to the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not make unless they were in love; that, from the moment when they were in love, it was superfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in love later on. And so, she would have heard Swann out with the utmost tranquillity had she not noticed that it was growing late, and that if he went on speaking for any length of time she would \"never\" as she told him with a fond smile, obstinate but slightly abashed, \"get there in time for the Overture.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On other occasions he had assured himself that the one thing which, more than anything else, would make him cease to love her, would be her refusal to abandon the habit of lying. \"Even from the point of view of coquetry, pure and simple,\" he had told her, \"can't you see how much of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? By a frank admission\u2014how many faults you might redeem! Really, you are far less intelligent than I supposed!\" In vain, however, did Swann expound to her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but Odette had no such system; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished Swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done, with not telling him of it. So that a lie was, to her, something to be used only as a special expedient; and the one thing that could make her decide whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which, too, was of a special and contingent order, namely the risk of Swann's discovering that she had not told him the truth\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Physically, she was passing through an unfortunate phase; she was growing stouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised, wistful expressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished with her first youth, with the result that she became most precious to Swann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking. He would gaze at her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm which he had once seen in her and could not find again. And yet the knowledge that, within this new and strange chrysalis, it was still Odette that lurked, still the same volatile temperament, artful and evasive, was enough to keep Swann seeking, with as much passion as ever, to captivate her. Then he would look at photographs of her, taken two years before, and would remember how exquisite she had been. And that would console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily endured on her account\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the Verdurins took her off to Saint-Germain, or to Chatou, or to Meulan, as often as not, if the weather was fine, they would propose to remain there for the night, and not go home until next day. Mme. Verdurin would endeavour to set at rest the scruples of the pianist, whose aunt had remained in Paris: \"She will be only too glad to be rid of you for a day. How on earth could she be anxious, when she knows you're with us? Anyhow, I'll take you all under my wing; she can put the blame on me.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If this attempt failed, M. Verdurin would set off across country until he came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after first finding out which of the 'faithful' had anyone whom they must warn. But Odette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message for anyone, for she had told Swann, once and for all, that she could not possibly send messages to him, before all those people, without compromising herself. Sometimes she would be absent for several days on end, when the Verdurins took her to see the tombs at Dreux, or to Compi\u00e8gne, on the painter's advice, to watch the sun setting through the forest\u2014after which they went on to the Ch\u00e2teau of Pierrefonds\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"To think that she could visit really historic buildings with me, who have spent ten years in the study of architecture, who am constantly bombarded, by people who really count, to take them over Beauvais or Saint-Loup-de-Naud, and refuse to take anyone but her; and instead of that she trundles off with the lowest, the most brutally degraded of creatures, to go into ecstasies over the petrified excretions of Louis-Philippe and Viollet-le-Duc! One hardly needs much knowledge of art, I should say, to do that; though, surely, even without any particularly refined sense of smell, one would not deliberately choose to spend a holiday in the latrines, so as to be within range of their fragrant exhalations.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when she had set off for Dreux or Pierrefonds\u2014alas, without allowing him to appear there, as though by accident, at her side, for, as she said, that would \"create a dreadful impression,\"\u2014he would plunge into the most intoxicating romance in the lover's library, the railway timetable, from which he learned the ways of joining her there in the afternoon, in the evening, even in the morning. The ways? More than that, the authority, the right to join her. For, after all, the time-table, and the trains themselves, were not meant for dogs. If the public were carefully informed, by means of printed advertisements, that at eight o'clock in the morning a train started for Pierrefonds which arrived there at ten, that could only be because going to Pierrefonds was a lawful act, for which permission from Odette would be superfluous; an act, moreover, which might be performed from a motive altogether different from the desire to see Odette, since persons who had never even heard of her performed it daily, and in such numbers as justified the labour and expense of stoking the engines\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to Pierrefonds if he chose to do so. Now that was precisely what he found that he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he, like the travelling public, not acquainted with Odette. For a long time past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of Viollet-le-Duc's work as a restorer. And the weather being what it was, he felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access to the one spot that tempted him to-day. To-day! Why, if he went down there, in defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that very day! But then, whereas, if she had met, at Pierrefonds, some one who did not matter, she would have hailed him with obvious pleasure: \"What, you here?\" and would have invited him to come and see her at the hotel where she was staying with the Verdurins, if, on the other hand, it was himself, Swann, that she encountered there, she would be annoyed, would complain that she was being followed, would love him less in consequence, might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him. \"So, then, I am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere!\" she would reproach him on her return, whereas in fact it was he himself who was not allowed to go\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit Compi\u00e8gne and Pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet Odette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the Marquis de Forestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. This friend, to whom Swann suggested the plan without disclosing its ulterior purpose, was beside himself with joy; he did not conceal his astonishment at Swann's consenting at last, after fifteen years, to come down and visit his property, and since he did not (he told him) wish to stay there, promised to spend some days, at least, in taking him for walks and excursions in the district. Swann imagined himself down there already with M. de Forestelle. Even before he saw Odette, even if he did not succeed in seeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on that soil where, not knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she was to be found, he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility of her suddenly appearing: in the courtyard of the Ch\u00e2teau, now beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to visit it; in all the streets of the town, which struck him as romantic; down every ride of the forest, roseate with the deep and tender glow of sunset;\u2014innumerable and alternative hiding-places, to which would fly simultaneously for refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his happy, vagabond and divided heart. \"We mustn't, on any account,\" he would warn M. de Forestelle, \"run across Odette and the Verdurins. I have just heard that they are at Pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. One has plenty of time to see them in Paris; it would hardly be worth while coming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them.\" And his host would fail to understand why, once they had reached the place, Swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour, inspect the dining-rooms of all the hotels in Compi\u00e8gne without being able to make up his mind to settle down in any of them, although he had found no trace anywhere of the Verdurins, seeming to be in search of what he had claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in fact avoid, the moment he found it, for if he had come upon the little 'group,' he would have hastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had seen Odette and she him, especially that she had seen him when he was not, apparently, thinking about her. But no; she would guess at once that it was for her sake that he had come there. And when M. de Forestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he excused himself: \"No, I'm afraid not; I can't go to Pierrefonds to-day. You see, Odette is there.\" And Swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling that if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to Pierrefonds that day, it was because he was in fact, for Odette, some one who differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that restriction which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely where one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery, that love which was so dear to him. Decidedly, it was better not to risk a quarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. He spent his days in poring over a map of the forest of Compi\u00e8gne, as though it had been that of the 'Pays du Tendre'; he surrounded himself with photographs of the Ch\u00e2teau of Pierrefonds. When the day dawned on which it was possible that she might return, he opened the time-table again, calculated what train she must have taken, and, should she have postponed her departure, what trains were still left for her to take. He did not leave the house, for fear of missing a telegram, he did not go to bed, in case, having come by the last train, she decided to surprise him with a midnight visit. Yes! The front-door bell rang. There seemed some delay in opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he leaned out of the window to shout to Odette, if it was Odette, for in spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to deliver in person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was not at home. It was only a servant coming in. He noticed the incessant rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any attention. He could hear them, one after another, a long way off, coming nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away into the distance a message which was not for him. He waited all night, to no purpose, for the Verdurins had returned unexpectedly, and Odette had been in Paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. And such moments as these, in which she forgot Swann's very existence, were of more value to Odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities. For in this way Swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on the night when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins' and had hunted for her all evening. And he did not have (as I had, afterwards, at Combray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings that would return with the night. For his days, Swann must pass them without Odette; and as he told himself, now and then, to allow so pretty a woman to go out by herself in Paris was just as rash as to leave a case filled with jewels in the middle of the street. In this mood he would scowl furiously at the passers-by, as though they were so many pickpockets. But their faces\u2014a collective and formless mass\u2014escaped the grasp of his imagination, and so failed to feed the flame of his jealousy. The effort exhausted Swann's brain, until, passing his hand over his eyes, he cried out: \"Heaven help me!\" as people, after lashing themselves into an intellectual frenzy in their endeavours to master the problem of the reality of the external world, or that of the immortality of the soul, afford relief to their weary brains by an unreasoning act of faith. But the thought of his absent mistress was incessantly, indissolubly blended with all the simplest actions of Swann's daily life\u2014when he took his meals, opened his letters, went for a walk or to bed\u2014by the fact of his regret at having to perform those actions without her; like those initials of Philibert the Fair which, in the church of Brou, because of her grief, her longing for him, Margaret of Austria intertwined everywhere with her own. On some days, instead of staying at home, he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off, to which he had been attracted, some time before, by the excellence of its cookery, but to which he now went only for one of those reasons, at once mystical and absurd, which people call 'romantic'; because this restaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore the same name as the street in which Odette lived: the Lap\u00e9rouse. Sometimes, when she had been away on a short visit somewhere, several days would elapse before she thought of letting him know that she had returned to Paris. And then she would say quite simply, without taking (as she would once have taken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs, with a little fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that very moment, arrived by the morning train. What she said was a falsehood; at least for Odette it was a falsehood, inconsistent, lacking (what it would have had, if true) the support of her memory of her actual arrival at the station; she was even prevented from forming a mental picture of what she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in her mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at the moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. In Swann's mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled and hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so indubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had come by the same train and had not seen Odette, Swann would have been convinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or hour, since his version did not agree with the words uttered by Odette. These words had never appeared to him false except when, before hearing them, he had suspected that they were going to be. For him to believe that she was lying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. It was also, however, sufficient. Given that, everything that Odette might say appeared to him suspect. Did she mention a name: it was obviously that of one of her lovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would spend weeks in tormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a firm of 'inquiry agents' to find out the address and the occupation of the unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved to have gone abroad, and who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of Odette, and had been dead for twenty years\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public gatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally that, at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited\u2014at Forcheville's, at the painter's, or at a charity ball given in one of the Ministries\u2014he found himself in the same room with her. He could see her, but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be spying upon the pleasures which she tasted in other company, pleasures which\u2014while he drove home in utter loneliness, and went to bed, as anxiously as I myself was to go to bed, some years later, on the evenings when he came to dine with us at Combray\u2014seemed illimitable to him since he had not been able to see their end. And, once or twice, he derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be inclined (did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety abruptly terminated) to call peaceful, since it consists in a pacifying of the mind: he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painter's studio, and was getting ready to go home; he was leaving behind him Odette, transformed into a brilliant stranger, surrounded by men to whom her glances and her gaiety, which were not for him, seemed to hint at some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere (possibly at the Bal des Incoh\u00e9rents, to which he trembled to think that she might be going on afterwards) which made Swann more jealous than the thought of their actual physical union, since it was more difficult to imagine; he was opening the door to go, when he heard himself called back in these words (which, by cutting off from the party that possible ending which had so appalled him, made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect, made Odette's return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible, but tender and familiar, a thing that kept close to his side, like a part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a thing that stripped Odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance, shewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment, for his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures, a disguise of which she had already wearied)\u2014in these words, which Odette flung out after him as he was crossing the threshold: \"Can't you wait a minute for me? I'm just going; we'll drive back together and you can drop me.\" It was true that on one occasion Forcheville had asked to be driven home at the same time, but when, on reaching Odette's gate, he had begged to be allowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger pointed at Swann: \"Ah! That depends on this gentleman. You must ask him. Very well, you may come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you mustn't stay long, for, I warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with me, and he's not at all pleased if I have visitors when he's here. Oh, if you only knew the creature as I know him; isn't that so, my love, there's no one that really knows you, is there, except me?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Swann was, perhaps, even more touched by the spectacle of her addressing him thus, in front of Forcheville, not only in these tender words of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: \"I feel sure you haven't written yet to your friends, about dining with them on Sunday. You needn't go if you don't want to, but you might at least be polite,\" or \"Now, have you left your essay on Vermeer here, so that you can do a little more to it to-morrow? What a lazy-bones! I'm going to make you work, I can tell you,\" which proved that Odette kept herself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work, that they had indeed a life in common. And as she spoke she bestowed on him a smile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as when the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting all round an object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows which, in time, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object itself, all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of Odette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there before his eyes. He had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in Odette's house, in the lamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an artificial hour, invented for his special use (with the object of concealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly in his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory impression of it, an hour of Odette's real life, of her life when he was not there, looking on) with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits, but was perhaps a genuine hour of Odette's life; that, if he himself had not been there, she would have pulled forward the same armchair for Forcheville, would have poured out for him, not any unknown brew, but precisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both; that the world inhabited by Odette was not that other world, fearful and supernatural, in which he spent his time in placing her\u2014and which existed, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the real universe, exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that table at which he might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink which he was being permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he contemplated with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if, in absorbing his dreams, they had delivered him from an obsession, they themselves were, in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the palpable realisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they took shape and grew solid before-his eyes, and at the same time they soothed his troubled heart. Ah! had fate but allowed him to share a single dwelling with Odette, so that in her house he should be in his own; if, when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been Odette's bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when Odette wished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the Avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he had no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she was too warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at home, and not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to do what she asked; then how completely would all the trivial details of Swann's life, which seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they would, at the same time, have formed part of the life of Odette, have taken on\u2014like that lamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had absorbed so much of his dreams, which materialised so much of his longing,\u2014a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much longed was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere favourable to his love. When Odette ceased to be for him a creature always absent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her was no longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by the phrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when those normal relations were established between them which would put an end to his melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of Odette's daily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic interest\u2014as he had several times, already, felt that they might be, on the day, for instance, when he had read, through its envelope, her letter to Forcheville. Examining his complaint with as much scientific detachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study its effects, he told himself that, when he was cured of it, what Odette might or might not do would be indifferent to him. But in his morbid state, to tell the truth, he feared death itself no more than such a recovery, which would, in fact, amount to the death of all that he then was\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After these quiet evenings, Swann's suspicions would be temporarily lulled; he would bless the name of Odette, and next day, in the morning, would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the desire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had need of some such outlet\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine that Odette was Forcheville's mistress, and that, when they had both sat watching him from the depths of the Verdurins' landau, in the Bois, on the evening before the party at Chatou to which he had not been invited, while he implored her in vain, with that look of despair on his face which even his coachman had noticed, to come home with him, and then turned away, solitary, crushed,\u2014she must have employed, to draw Forcheville's attention to him, while she murmured: \"Do look at him, storming!\" the same glance, brilliant, malicious, sidelong, cunning, as on the evening when Forcheville had driven Saniette from the Verdurins'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At such times Swann detested her. \"But I've been a fool, too,\" he would argue. \"I'm paying for other men's pleasures with my money. All the same, she'd better take care, and not pull the string too often, for I might very well stop giving her anything at all. At any rate, we'd better knock off supplementary favours for the time being. To think that, only yesterday, when she said she would like to go to Bayreuth for the season, I was such an ass as to offer to take one of those jolly little places the King of Bavaria has there, for the two of us. However she didn't seem particularly keen; she hasn't said yes or no yet. Let's hope that she'll refuse. Good God! Think of listening to Wagner for a fortnight on end with her, who takes about as much interest in music as a fish does in little apples; it will be fun!\" And his hatred, like his love, needing to manifest itself in action, he amused himself with urging his evil imaginings further and further, because, thanks to the perfidies with which he charged Odette, he detested her still more, and would be able, if it turned out\u2014as he tried to convince himself\u2014that she was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her, emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. In this way, he went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from her, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at Bayreuth, but with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had promised Forcheville and the Verdurins to invite them. Oh, how he would have loved it, had it been conceivable that she would have that audacity. What joy he would have in refusing, in drawing up that vindictive reply, the terms of which he amused himself by selecting and declaiming aloud, as though he had actually received her letter\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The very next day, her letter came. She wrote that the Verdurins and their friends had expressed a desire to be present at these performances of Wagner, and that, if he would be so good as to send her the money, she would be able at last, after going so often to their house, to have the pleasure of entertaining the Verdurins in hers. Of him she said not a word; it was to be taken for granted that their presence at Bayreuth would be a bar to his\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then that annihilating answer, every word of which he had carefully rehearsed overnight, without venturing to hope that it could ever be used, he had the satisfaction of having it conveyed to her. Alas! he felt only too certain that with the money which she had, or could easily procure, she would be able, all the same, to take a house at Bayreuth, since she wished to do so, she who was incapable of distinguishing between Bach and Clapisson. Let her take it, then; she would have to live in it more frugally, that was all. No means (as there would have been if he had replied by sending her several thousand-franc notes) of organising, each evening, in her hired castle, those exquisite little suppers, after which she might perhaps be seized by the whim (which, it was possible, had never yet seized her) of falling into the arms of Forcheville. At any rate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be Swann who had to pay for it. Ah! if he could only manage to prevent it, if she could sprain her ankle before starting, if the driver of the carriage which was to take her to the station would consent (no matter how great the bribe) to smuggle her to some place where she could be kept for a time in seclusion, that perfidious woman, her eyes tinselled with a smile of complicity for Forcheville, which was what Odette had become for Swann in the last forty-eight hours\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining, crafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of an execrable Odette saying to Forcheville: \"Look at him storming!\" began to grow pale and to dissolve. Then gradually reappeared and rose before him, softly radiant, the face of the other Odette, of that Odette who al^o turned with a smile to Forcheville, but with a smile in which there was nothing but affection for Swann, when she said: \"You mustn't stay long, for this gentleman doesn't much like my having visitors when he's here. Oh! if you only knew the creature as I know him!\" that same smile with which she used to thank Swann for some instance of his courtesy which she prized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him in one of those grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him alone\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Then, to this other Odette, he would ask himself what could have induced him to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then, she had never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him from the high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his loyalty, he had won for himself in her esteem. He would become less dear to her, since it was for those qualities, which she found neither in Forcheville nor in any other, that she loved him. It was for them that Odette so often shewed him a reciprocal kindness, which counted for less than nothing in his moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of reciprocal desire, was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love, but the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the distraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation of a friend, rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now that, after this swing of the pendulum, Odette had naturally returned to the place from which Swann's jealousy had for the moment driven her, in the angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her to himself as full of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes, and so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards her, as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss; and he preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly glance, as strong as though she had really looked thus at him, and it had not been merely his imagination that had portrayed it in order to satisfy his desire\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What distress he must have caused her! Certainly he found adequate reasons for his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to make him feel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her. Had he not nourished grievances, just as serious, against other women, to whom he would, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling no anger towards them because he no longer loved them? If the day ever came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with regard to Odette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy alone which had led him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in this desire (after all, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be able, in her turn, when an occasion offered, to repay the Verdurins for their hospitality, and to play the hostess in a house of her own\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He returned to the other point of view\u2014opposite to that of his love and of his jealousy, to which he resorted at times by a sort of mental equity, and in order to make allowance for different eventualities\u2014from which he tried to form a fresh judgment of Odette, based on the supposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him just a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he himself was not present) different, a texture woven in secret apart from him, and warped against him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with Forcheville or with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with him, and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements? At Bayreuth, as in Paris, if it should happen that Forcheville thought of him at all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great deal in the life of Odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make way, when they met in her house. If Forcheville and she scored a triumph by being down there together in spite of him, it was he who had engineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going there, whereas if he had approved of her plan, which for that matter was quite defensible, she would have had the appearance of being there by his counsel, she would have felt herself sent there, housed there by him, and for the pleasure which she derived from entertaining those people who had so often entertained her, it was to him that she would have had to acknowledge her indebtedness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if\u2014instead of letting her go off thus, at cross-purposes with him, without having seen him again\u2014he were to send her this money, if he were to encourage her to take this journey, and to go out of his way to make it comfortable and pleasant for her, she would come running to him, happy, grateful, and he would have the joy\u2014the sight of her face\u2014which he had not known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could replace. For the moment that Swann was able to form a picture of her without revulsion, that he could see once again the friendliness in her smile, and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was no longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love, that love once again became, more than anything, a taste for the sensations which Odette's person gave him, for the pleasure which he found in admiring, as one might a spectacle, or in questioning, as one might a phenomenon, the birth of one of her glances, the formation of one of her smiles, the utterance of an intonation of her voice. And this pleasure, different from every other, had in the end created in him a need of her, which she alone, by her presence or by her letters, could assuage, almost as disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as another need which characterised this new period in Swann's life, when the sereness, the depression of the preceding years had been followed by a sort of spiritual superabundance, without his knowing to what he owed this unlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate health who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and seems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:\u2014this other need, which, too, developed in him independently of the visible, material world, was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created jealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity for Odette. She had become once more the old Odette, charming and kind. He was full of remorse for having treated her harshly. He wished her to come to him, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured for her some pleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her face and moulding her smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So, too, Odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days, as tender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a reconciliation, became inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing him, or even of making him angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her, the favours by which he set most store\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during their quarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any money, but would do what he could to hurt her. Perhaps she did not realise, either, how sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate with himself, on other occasions when, for the sake of their future relations, to shew Odette that he was capable of doing without her, that a rupture was still possible between them, he decided to wait some time before going to see her again\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no fresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her, he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more probably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in which he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy, and would not be able to see her on any of the days that he had suggested. Meanwhile, a letter from her, crossing his, asked him to postpone one of those very meetings. He asked himself, why; his suspicions, his grief, again took hold of him. He could no longer abide, in the new state of agitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which he had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run to find her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following days. And even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged his letter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing her. For, upsetting all Swann's calculations, Odette's acceptance had entirely changed his attitude. Like everyone who possesses something precious, so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to possess it, he had detached the precious object from his mind, leaving, as he thought, everything else in the same state as when it was there. But the absence of one part from a whole is not only that, it is not simply a partial omission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But at other times\u2014when Odette was on the point of going away for a holiday\u2014it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the pretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until her return, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of a serious rupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a separation, the greater part of which was inevitable, since she was going away, which, in fact, he was merely allowing to start a little sooner than it must. At once he could imagine Odette, puzzled, anxious, distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this picture of her, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break himself of the habit of seeing her. At odd moments, no doubt, in the furthest recesses of his brain, where his determination had thrust it away, and thanks to the length of the interval, the three weeks' separation to which he had agreed, it was with pleasure that he would consider the idea that he would see Odette again on her return; but it was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an abstinence. It had lasted, so far, but three days, a much shorter time than he had often, before, passed without seeing Odette, and without having, as on this occasion he had, premeditated a separation. And yet, there and then, some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind, or of weakness in his body,\u2014by inciting him to regard the present as an exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the rules, one in which prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time should come when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday\u2014suspended the action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or, without that even, the thought of some information for which he had forgotten to ask Odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she would have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment, whether they were 'ordinary' or 'preference' shares that she wished him to buy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without seeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over again, if the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would have done),\u2014and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is let go, or the air in a pneumatic machine which is ripped open, the idea of seeing her again, from the remote point in time to which it had been attached, sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate possibilities\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so irresistible, in fact, that Swann had been far less unhappy in watching the end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he must spend apart from Odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to her, minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in which he recaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the wealth of his affection, that idea of his meeting with Odette, which, by so abrupt a repercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness. The fact was that this idea no longer found, as an obstacle in its course, the desire to contrive without further delay to resist its coming, which had ceased to have any place in Swann's mind since, having proved to himself\u2014or so, at least, he believed\u2014that he was so easily capable of resisting it, he no longer saw any inconvenience in postponing a plan of separation which he was now certain of being able to put into operation whenever he would. Furthermore, this idea of seeing her again came back to him adorned with a novelty, a seductiveness, armed with a virulence, all of which long habit had enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour during this privation, not of three days but of a fortnight (for a period of abstinence may be calculated, by anticipation, as having lasted already until the final date assigned to it), and had converted what had been, until then, a pleasure in store, which could easily be sacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness which he was powerless to resist. Finally, the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by his own ignorance of what Odette might have thought, might, perhaps, have done on finding that he shewed no sign of life, with the result that he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an Odette almost unknown\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was only a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came, now, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase of stock. For she could not reconstruct the several phases of these crises through which he passed, and in the general idea which she formed of them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only to what she knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always identical termination. An imperfect idea (though possibly all the more profound in consequence), if one were to judge it from the point of view of Swann, who would doubtless have considered that Odette failed to understand him, just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each persuaded that he has been thrown back, one by some outside event, at the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his inveterate habit, the other by an accidental indisposition at the moment when he was just going to be finally cured, feels himself to be misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance to these pretended contingencies, mere disguises, according to him, assumed, so as to be perceptible by his patients, by the vice of one and the morbid state of the other, which in reality have never ceased to weigh heavily and incurably upon them while they were nursing their dreams of normality and health. And, as a matter of fact, Swann's love had reached that stage at which the physician and (in the case of certain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still reasonable, or indeed possible\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certainly, of the extent of this love Swann had no direct knowledge. When he sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it diminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate liking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was in love with Odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded complexion, returned on certain days. \"Really, I am making distinct headway,\" he would tell himself on the morrow, \"when I come to think it over carefully, I find out that I got hardly any pleasure, last night, out of being in bed with her; it's an odd thing, but I actually thought her ugly.\" And certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long way beyond the province of physical desire. Odette's person, indeed, no longer held any great place in it. When his eyes fell upon the photograph of Odette on his table, or when she came to see him, he had difficulty in identifying her face, either in the flesh or on the pasteboard, with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his mind. He would say to himself, almost with astonishment, \"It is she!\" as when suddenly some one shews us in a detached, externalised form one of our own maladies, and we find in it no resemblance to what we are suffering. \"She?\"\u2014he tried to ask himself what that meant; for it is something like love, like death (rather than like those vague conceptions of maladies), a thing which one repeatedly calls in question, in order to make oneself probe further into it, in the fear that the question will find no answer, that the substance will escape our grasp\u2014the mystery of personality. And this malady, which was Swann's love, had so far multiplied, was so closely interwoven with all his habits, with all his actions, with his thoughts, his health, his sleep, his life, even with what he hoped for after his death, was so entirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it away without almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case was past operation\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this love Swann had been so far detached from all other interests that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding himself that his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting (although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate of its worth), might, still, add a little to his own value in Odette's eyes (as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his love itself, which for Odette depreciated everything that it touched by seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would feel there, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and among people that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were depicted the amusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used to enjoy the thought of the smooth efficiency of his household, the smartness of his own wardrobe and of his servants' liveries, the soundness of his investments, with the same relish as when he read in Saint-Simon, who was one of his favourite authors, of the machinery of daily life at Versailles, what Mme. de Maintenon ate and drank, or the shrewd avarice and great pomp of Lulli. And in the small extent to which this detachment was not absolute, the reason for this new pleasure which Swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his love and to his pain. In this respect the personality, with which my great-aunt endowed him, of 'young Swann,' as distinct from the more individual personality of Charles Swann, was that in which he now most delighted. Once when, because it was the birthday of the Princesse de Parme (and because she could often be of use, indirectly, to Odette, by letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of thing), he had decided to send her a basket of fruit, and was not quite sure where or how to order it, he had entrusted the task to a cousin of his mother who, delighted to be doing a commission for him, had written to him, laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit at the same place, but the grapes from Crapote, whose speciality they were, the straw berries from Jauret, the pears from Chevet, who always had the best, am soon, \"every fruit visited and examined, one by one, by myself.\" And ii the sequel, by the cordiality with which the Princess thanked him, hi had been able to judge of the flavour of the strawberries and of the ripe ness of the pears. But, most of all, that \"every fruit visited and examinee one by one, by myself\" had brought balm to his sufferings by carrying hi mind off to a region which he rarely visited, although it was his by right, as the heir of a rich and respectable middle-class family in which had been handed down from generation to generation the knowledge of the 'right places' and the art of ordering things from shops\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of a truth, he had too long forgotten that he was 'young Swann' not to feel, when he assumed that part again for a moment, a keener pleasure than he was capable of feeling at other times\u2014when, indeed, he was grown sick of pleasure; and if the friendliness of the middle-class people, for whom he had never been anything else than 'young Swann,' was less animated than that of the aristocrats (though more flattering, for all that, since in the middle-class mind friendship is inseparable from respect), no letter from a Royal Personage, offering him some princely entertainment, could ever be so attractive to Swann as the letter which asked him to be a witness, or merely to be present at a wedding in the family of some old friends of his parents; some of whom had 'kept up' with him, like my grandfather, who, the year before these events, had invited him to my mother's wedding, while others barely knew him by sight, but were, they thought, in duty bound to shew civility to the son, to the worthy successor of the late M. Swann\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, by virtue of his intimacy, already time-honoured, with so many of them, the people of fashion, in a certain sense, were also a part of his house, his service, and his family. He felt, when his mind dwelt upon his brilliant connections, the same external support, the same solid comfort as when he looked at the fine estate, the fine silver, the fine table-linen which had come down to him from his forebears. And the thought that, if he were seized by a sudden illness and confined to the house, the people whom his valet would instinctively run to find would be the Duc de Chartres, the Prince de Reuss, the Duc de Luxembourg and the Baron de Charlus, brought him the same consolation as our old Fran\u00e7oise derived from the knowledge that she would, one day, be buried in her own fine clothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one's idea of the skill and patience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which in her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually of wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. But most of all,\u2014since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference to Odette, Swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome to her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the Verdurins' 'faithful,'\u2014when he betook himself to a world in which he was the paramount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract, whom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to believe in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite for it, as an invalid may feel who has been in bed for months and on a strict diet, when he picks up a newspaper and reads the account of an official banquet or the advertisement of a cruise round Sicily\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not paying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her that he sought to excuse himself to Odette. He still paid them (asking himself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps exhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her, it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each visit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some information which she required, M. de Charlus, whom he had met actually going to her house, and who had insisted upon Swann's accompanying him. And, failing any excuse, he would beg M. de Charlus to go to her at once, and to tell her, as though spontaneously, in the course of conversation, that he had just remembered something that he had to say to Swann, and would she please send a message to Swann's house asking him to come to her then and there; but as a rule Swann waited at home in vain, and M. de Charlus informed him, later in the evening, that his device had not proved successful. With the result that, if she was now frequently away from Paris, even when she was there he scarcely saw her; that she who, when she was in love with him, used to say, \"I am always free\" and \"What can it matter to me, what other people think?\" now, whenever he wanted to see her, appealed to the proprieties or pleaded some engagement. When he spoke of going to a charity entertainment, or a private view, or a first-night at which she was to be present, she would expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that he was treating her like a woman off the streets. Things came to such a pitch that, in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden to meet her anywhere, Swann, remembering that she knew and was deeply attached to my great-uncle Adolphe, whose friend he himself also had been, went one day to see him in his little flat in the Rue de Bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence with Odette. As it happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to Swann about my uncle, a poetical tone, saying: \"Ah, he! He is not in the least like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his friendship for me. He's not the sort of man who would have so little consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in public.\" This was embarrassing for Swann, who did not know quite to what rhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of Odette to my uncle. He began by alluding to her excellence, a priori, the axiom of her seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible virtues, no conception of which could possibly be formed. \"I should like to speak to you about her,\" he went on, \"you, who know what a woman supreme above all women, what an adorable being, what an angel Odette is. But you know, also, what life is in Paris. Everyone doesn't see Odette in the light in which you and I have been Privileged to see her. And so there are people who think that I am behaving rather foolishly; she won't even allow me to meet her out of doors, at the theatre. Now you, in whom she has such enormous confidence, couldn't you say a few words for me to her, just to assure her that she exaggerate the harm which my bowing to her in the street might do her?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My uncle advised Swann not to see Odette for some days, after which she would love him all the more; he advised Odette to let Swann meet her everywhere, and as often as he pleased. A few days later Odette told Swann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that my uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault. She calmed Swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my uncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met again. He regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if he had met my uncle Adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk things over with him in strict confidence, to be able to get him to throw a light on certain rumours with regard to the life that Odette had led, in the old days, at Nice. For my uncle Adolphe used to spend the winter there, and Swann thought that it might indeed have been there, perhaps, that he had first known Odette. The few words which some one had let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been Odette's lover, had left Swann dumbfounded. But the very things which he would, before knowing them, have regarded as the most terrible to learn and the most impossible to believe, were, once he knew them, incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow; he admitted them, he could no longer have understood their not existing. Only, each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line, altering the picture that he had formed of his mistress. At one time indeed he felt that he could understand that this moral 'lightness,' of which he would never have suspected Odette, was perfectly well known, and that at Baden or Nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several months in one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety. He attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch again with certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew Odette, and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their heads, of setting them once more upon her track. But he, to whom, up till then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that pertained to the cosmopolitan life of Baden or of Nice, now that he learned that Odette had, perhaps, led a 'gay' life once in those pleasure-cities, although he could never find out whether it had been solely to satisfy a want of money which, thanks to himself, she no longer felt, or from some capricious instinct which might, at any moment, revive in her, he would lean, in impotent anguish, blinded and dizzy, over the bottomless abyss into which had passed, in which had been engulfed those years of his own, early in MacMahon's Septennat, in which one spent the winter on the Promenade des Anglais, the summer beneath the limes of Baden, and would find in those years a sad but splendid profundity, such as a poet might have lent to them; and he would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant details that made up the daily round on the C\u00f4te d'Azur in those days, if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled him in the smile or in the eyes of Odette, more enthusiasm than does the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth-century Florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the Primavera, the fair Vanna or the Venus of Botticelli. He would sit, often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming; and she would comment: \"You do look sad!\" It was not very long since, from the idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best women that he had known, he had passed to that of her being 'kept'; and yet already, by an inverse process, he had returned from the Odette de Cr\u00e9cy, perhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the 'ladies' men' of Nice and Baden, to this face, the expression on which was so often gentle, to this nature so eminently human. He would ask himself: \"What does it mean, after all, to say that everyone at Nice knows who Odette de Cr\u00e9cy is? Reputations of that sort, even when they're true, are always based upon other people's ideas\"; he would reflect that this legend\u2014even if it were authentic\u2014was something external to Odette, was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality; that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank eyes, a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others, a docile body which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers, a woman of whom he might one day come into absolute possession if he succeeded in making himself indispensable to her. There she was, often tired, her face left blank for the nonce by that eager, feverish preoccupation with the unknown things which made Swann suffer; she would push back her hair with both hands; her forehead, her whole face would seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when, in a moment of rest or meditation, they are free to express themselves, would flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. And immediately the whole of her face would light up like a grey landscape, swathed in clouds which, suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene transfigured, at the moment of the sun's setting. The life which occupied Odette at such times, even the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding, Swann could have shared with her. No evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on them. Rare as they became, those moments did not occur in vain. By the process of memory, Swann joined the fragments together, abolished the intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold, the image of an Odette compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he was to make, later on (as we shall see in the second part of this story) sacrifices which the other Odette would never have won from him. But how rare those moments were, and how seldom he now saw her! Even in regard to their evening meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute whether she would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always free, she wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her. She would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made Swann come to her house, any of her friends asked her, half-way through the evening, to join them at some theatre, or at supper afterwards, she would jump for joy and dress herself with all speed. As her toilet progressed, every movement that she made brought Swann nearer to the moment when he would have to part from her, when she would fly off with irresistible force; and when at length she was ready, and, Plunging into her mirror a last glance strained and brightened by her anxiety to look well, smeared a little salve on her lips, fixed a stray loci of hair over her brow, and called for her cloak of sky-blue silk with golden tassels, Swann would be looking so wretched that she would be unable to restrain a gesture of impatience as she flung at him: \"So that is how you thank me for keeping you here till the last minute! And I thought I was being so nice to you. Well, I shall know better another time!\" Sometime... at the risk of annoying her, he made up his mind that he would find out where she had gone, and even dreamed of a defensive alliance with Forcheville, who might perhaps have been able to tell him. But anyhow, when he knew with whom she was spending the evening, it was very seldom that he could not discover, among all his innumerable acquaintance, some one who knew\u2014if only indirectly\u2014the man with whom she had gone out, and could easily obtain this or that piece of information about him. And while he was writing to one of his friends, asking him to try to get a little light thrown upon some point or other, he would feel a sense of relief on ceasing to vex himself with questions to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the strain of interrogation. It is true that Swann was little the wiser for such information as he did receive. To know a thing does not enable us, always, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of power to control them. He was quite happy whenever M. de Charlus was with Odette. He knew that between M. de Charlus and her nothing untoward could ever happen, that when M. de Charlus went anywhere with her, it was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no difficulty about telling him everything that she had done. Sometimes she had declared so emphatically to Swann that it was impossible for him to see her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so keenly to some outing, that Swann attached a very real importance to the fact that M. de Charlus was free to accompany her. Next day, without daring to put many questions to M. de Charlus, he would force him, by appearing not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more, after each of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he very soon learned that Odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of dissipations\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But what do you mean, my dear M\u00e9m\u00e9, I don't quite understand.... You didn't go straight from her house to the Mus\u00e9e Gr\u00e9vin? Surely you went somewhere else first? No? That is very odd! You don't know how amusing you are, my dear M\u00e9m\u00e9. But what an odd idea of hers to go on to the Chat Noir afterwards; it was her idea, I suppose? No? Yours? That's strange. After all, it wasn't a bad idea; she must have known dozens of people there? No? She never spoke to a soul? How extraordinary! Then you sat there like that, just you and she, all by yourselves? I can picture you, sitting there! You are a worthy fellow, my dear M\u00e9m\u00e9; I'm exceedingly fond of you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was now quite at ease. To him, who had so often happened, when talking to friends who knew nothing of his love, friends to whom he hardly listened, to hear certain detached sentences (as, for instance, \"I saw Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy yesterday; she was with a man I didn't know.\"), sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid state, grew hard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay there irremovable,\u2014how charming, by way of contrast, were the words: \"She didn't know a soul; she never spoke to a soul.\" How freely they coursed through him, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to breathe! And yet, a moment later, he was telling himself that Odette must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred to his company. And their very insignificance, though it reassured him, pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which Odette's presence, the charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific which in the long run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the disease, but at least brought temporary relief to his sufferings), it would have sufficed, had Odette only permitted him to remain in her house while she was out, to wait there until that hour of her return, into whose stillness and peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there, all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed spell had made him imagine as, somehow, different from the rest. But she would not; he must return home; he forced himself, on the way, to form various plans, ceased to think of Odette; he even reached the stage, while he undressed, of turning over all sorts of happy ideas in his mind: it was with a light heart, buoyed with the anticipation of going to see some favourite work of art on the morrow, that he jumped into bed and turned out the light; but no sooner had he made himself ready to sleep, relaxing a self-control of which he was not even conscious, so habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he burst into sobs. He did not wish to know why, but dried his eyes, saying with a smile: \"This is delightful; I'm becoming neurasthenic.\" After which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what Odette had been doing, must use all his influence to contrive to see her. This compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without result, was so cruel a scourge that one day, noticing a swelling over his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had, perhaps, a tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not concern himself with anything further, that it was his malady which was going to govern his life, to make a plaything of him, until the not-distant end. If indeed, at this period, it often happened that, though without admitting it even to himself, he longed for death, it was in order to escape not so much from the keenness of his sufferings as from the monotony of his struggle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet he would have wished to live until the time came when he no longer loved her, when she would have no reason for lying to him, when at length he might learn from her whether, on the day when he had gone to see her in the afternoon, she had or had not been in the arms of Forcheville. Often for several days on end the suspicion that she was in love with some one else would distract his mind from the question of Forcheville, making it almost immaterial to him, like those new developments of a continuous state of ill-health which seem for a little time to have delivered us from their predecessors. There were even days when he was not tormented by any suspicion. He fancied that he was cured. But next morning, when he awoke, he felt in the same place the same pain, a sensation which, the day before, he had, as it were, diluted in the torrent of different impressions. But it had not stirred from its place. Indeed, it was the sharpness of this pain that had awakened him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important matters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived long enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything else than pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the effort to imagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would pass a finger over his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have wiped his eyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. There emerged, however, from this unexplored tract, certain occupations which reappeared from time to time, vaguely connected by Odette with some obligation towards distant relatives or old friends who, inasmuch as they were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning as preventing her from seeing him, seemed to Swann to compose the necessary, unalterable setting of her life. Because of the tone in which she referred, from time to time, to \"the day when I go with my friend to the Hippodrome,\" if, when he felt unwell and had thought, \"Perhaps Odette would be kind and come to see me,\" he remembered, suddenly, that it was one of those very days, he would correct himself with an \"Oh, no! It's not worth while asking her to come; I should have thought of it before, this is the day when she goes with her friend to the Hippodrome. We must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use wasting our time in proposing things that can't be accepted and are declined in advance.\" And this duty that was incumbent upon Odette, of going to the Hippodrome, to which Swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be not merely ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely connected with it. If, when Odette, in the street, had acknowledged the salute of a passer-by, which had aroused Swann's jealousy, she replied to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to him; if, for instance, she said: \"That's a gentleman who was in my friend's box the other day; the one I go to the Hippodrome with,\" that explanation would set Swann's suspicions at rest; it was, after all, inevitable that this friend should have other guests than Odette in her box at the Hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any coherent impression of them. Oh! how he would have loved to know her, that friend who went to the Hippodrome, how he would have loved her to invite him there with Odette. How readily he would have sacrificed all his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of seeing Odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. He would have taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them than for queens. Would they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in their knowledge of the life of Odette, with the one potent anodyne for his pain? With what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with one or other of those humble folk with whom Odette kept up friendly relations, either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity of nature. How willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the attics of some sordid but enviable house, where Odette went but never took him, and where, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker, whose lover he would readily have pretended to be, he would have been visited by Odette almost daily. In those regions, that were almost slums, what a modest existence, abject, if you please, but delightful, nourished by tranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead indefinitely\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It sometimes happened, again, that, when, after meeting Swann, she saw some man approaching whom he did not know, he could distinguish upon Odette's face that look of sorrow which she had worn on the day when he had come to her while Forcheville was there. But this was rare; for, on the days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread of what people would think, she did actually manage to see Swann, the predominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction from the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship, she had felt in his presence, and even in his absence, when she began a letter to him with the words: \"My dear, my hand trembles so that I can scarcely write.\" (So, at least, she pretended, and a little of that emotion must have been sincere, or she would not have been anxious to enlarge and emphasise it.) So Swann had been pleasing to her then. Our hands do not tremble except for ourselves, or for those whom we love. When they have ceased to control our happiness how peaceful, how easy, how bold do we become in their presence! In speaking to him, in writing to him now, she no longer employed those words by which she had sought to give herself the illusion that he belonged to her, creating opportunities for saying \"my\" and \"mine\" when she referred to him: \"You are all that I have in the world; it is the perfume of our friendship, I shall keep it,\" nor spoke to him of the future, of death itself, as of a single adventure which they would have to share. In those early days, whatever he might say to her, she would answer admiringly: \"You know, you will never be like other people!\"\u2014she would gaze at his long, slightly bald head, of which people who know only of his successes used to think: \"He's not regularly good-looking, if you like, but he is smart; that tuft, that eyeglass, that smile!\" and, with more curiosity perhaps to know him as he really was than desire to become his mistress, she would sigh:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I do wish I could find out what there is in that head of yours!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, now, whatever he might say, she would answer, in a tone sometimes of irritation, sometimes indulgent: \"Ah! so you never will be like other people!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She would gaze at his head, which was hardly aged at all by his recent anxieties (though people now thought of it, by the same mental process which enables one to discover the meaning of a piece of symphonic music of which one has read the programme, or the 'likenesses' in a child whose family one has known: \"He's not positively ugly, if you like, but he is really rather absurd; that eyeglass, that tuft, that smile!\" realising in their imagination, fed by suggestion, the invisible boundary which divides, at a few months' interval, the head of an ardent lover from a cuckold's), and would say:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I do wish I could change you; put some sense into that head of yours.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only Odette's way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling himself greedily upon her words: \"You can if you like,\" he would tell her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to make him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women asked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though it is only fair to add that in those other women's hands the noble task would have seemed to Swann nothing more than an indiscreet and intolerable usurpation of his freedom of action. \"If she didn't love me, just a little,\" he told himself, \"she would not wish to have me altered. To alter me, she will have to see me more often.\" And so he was able to trace, in these faults which she found in him, a proof at least of her interest, perhaps even of her love; and, in fact, she gave him so little, now, of the last, that he was obliged to regard as proofs of her interest in him the various things which, every now and then, she forbade him to do. One day she announced that she did not care for his coachman, who, she thought, was perhaps setting Swann against her, and, anyhow, did not shew that promptness and deference to Swann's orders which she would have liked to see. She felt that he wanted to hear her say: \"Don't have him again when you come to me,\" just as he might have wanted her to kiss him. So, being in a good temper, she said it; and he was deeply moved. That evening, when talking to M. de Charlus, with whom he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly (for the most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never heard of her, had always some sort of reference to Odette), he said to him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now, and she certainly takes an interest in what I do.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way, his friend said: \"Hullo! that isn't Loredan on the box?\" with what melancholy joy would Swann answer him:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! Good heavens, no! I can tell you, I daren't take Loredan when I go to the Rue La P\u00e9rouse; Odette doesn't like me to have Loredan, she thinks he doesn't suit me. What on earth is one to do? Women, you know, women. My dear fellow, she would be furious. Oh, lord, yes; I've only to take R\u00e9mi there; I should never hear the last of it!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which Odette now adopted with Swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise how much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day after day, that Odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly contrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he could have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. Now this change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and night, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it, he would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made to suffer too keenly. He might say to himself in a vague way: \"There was a time when Odette loved me more,\" but he never formed any definite picture of that time. Just as he had in his study a cupboard at which he contrived never to look, which he turned aside to avoid passing whenever he entered or left the room, because in one of its drawers he had locked away the chrysanthemum which she had given him on one of those first evenings when he had taken her home in his carriage, and the letters in which she said: \"Why did you not forget your heart also? I should never have let you have that back,\" and \"At whatever hour of the day or night you may need me, just send me a word, and dispose of me as you please,\" so there was a place in his heart to which he would never allow his thoughts to trespass too near, forcing them, if need be, to evade it by a long course of reasoning so that they should not have to pass within reach of it; the place in which lingered his memories of happy days\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But his so meticulous prudence was defeated one evening when he had gone out to a party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was at the Marquise de Saint-Euverte's, on the last, for that season, of the evenings on which she invited people to listen to the musicians who would serve, later on, for her charity concerts. Swann, who had intended to go to each of the previous evenings in turn, but had never been able to make up his mind, received, while he was dressing for this party, a visit from the Baron de Charlus, who came with an offer to go with him to the Marquise's, if his company could be of any use in helping Swann not to feel quite so bored when he got there, to be a little less unhappy. But Swann had thanked him with:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You can't conceive how glad I should be of your company. But the greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead to see Odette. You know what a splendid influence you have over her. I don't suppose she'll be going anywhere this evening, unless she goes to see her old dressmaker, and I'm sure she would be delighted if you went with her there. In any case, you'll find her at home before then. Try to keep her amused, and also to give her a little sound advice. If you could arrange something for to-morrow which would please her, something that we could all three do together. Try to put out a feeler, too, for the summer; see if there's anything she wants to do, a cruise that we might all three take; anything you can think of. I don't count upon seeing her to-night, myself; still if she would like me to come, or if you find a loophole, you've only to send me a line at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's up till midnight; after that I shall be here. Ever so many thanks for all you are doing for me\u2014you know what I feel about you!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His friend promised to go and do as Swann wished as soon as he had deposited him at the door of the Saint-Euverte house, where he arrived soothed by the thought that M. de Charlus would be spending the evening in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to everything that did not involve Odette, and in particular to the details of fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire, appears to us in its own guise. On alighting from his carriage, in the foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions, and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and setting, Swann was amused to discover the heirs and successors of Balzac's 'tigers'\u2014now 'grooms'\u2014. who normally followed their mistress when she walked abroad, but now, hatted and booted, were posted out of doors, in front of the house on the gravelled drive, or outside the stables, as gardeners might be drawn up for inspection at the ends of their several flower-beds. The peculiar tendency which he had always had to look for analogies between living people and the portraits in galleries reasserted itself here, but in a more positive and more general form; it was society as a whole, now that he was detached from it, which presented itself to him in a series of pictures. In the cloak-room, into which, in the old days, when he was still a man of fashion, he would have gone in his overcoat, to emerge from it in evening dress, but without any impression of what had occurred there, his mind having been, during the minute or two that he had spent in it, either still at the party which he had just left, or already at the party into which he was just about to be ushered, he now noticed, for the first time, roused by the unexpected arrival of so belated a guest, the scattered pack of splendid effortless animals, the enormous footmen who were drowsing here and there upon benches and chests, until, pointing their noble greyhound profiles, they towered upon their feet and gathered in a circle round about him\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of them, of a particularly ferocious aspect, and not unlike the headsman in certain Renaissance pictures which represent executions, tortures, and the like, advanced upon him with an implacable air to take his 'things.' But the harshness of his steely glare was compensated by the softness of his cotton gloves, so effectively that, as he approached Swann, he seemed to be exhibiting at once an utter contempt for his person and the most tender regard for his hat. He took it with a care to which the precision of his movements imparted something that was almost over-fastidious, and with a delicacy that was rendered almost touching by the evidence of his splendid strength. Then he passed it to one of his satellites, a novice and timid, who was expressing the panic that overpowered him by casting furious glances in every direction, and displayed all the dumb agitation of a wild animal in the first hours of its captivity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A few feet away, a strapping great lad in livery stood musing, motionless, statuesque, useless, like that purely decorative warrior whom one sees in the most tumultuous of Mantegna's paintings, lost in dreams, leaning upon his shield, while all around him are fighting and bloodshed and death; detached from the group of his companions who were thronging about Swann, he seemed as determined to remain unconcerned in the scene, which he followed vaguely with his cruel, greenish eyes, as if it had been the Massacre of the Innocents or the Martyrdom of Saint James. He seemed precisely to have sprung from that vanished race\u2014if, indeed, it ever existed, save in the reredos of San Zeno and the frescoes of the Eremitani, where Swann had come in contact with it, and where it still dreams\u2014fruit of the impregnation of a classical statue by some one of the Master's Paduan models, or of Albert Duerer's Saxons. And the locks of his reddish hair, crinkled by nature, but glued to his head by brilliantine, were treated broadly as they are in that Greek sculpture which the Mantuan painter never ceased to study, and which, if in its creator's purpose it represents but man, manages at least to extract from man's simple outlines such a variety of richness, borrowed, as it were, from the whole of animated nature, that a head of hair, by the glossy undulation and beak-like points of its curls, or in the overlaying of the florid triple diadem of its brushed tresses, can suggest at once a bunch of seaweed, a brood of fledgling doves, a bed of hyacinths and a serpent's writhing back. Others again, no less colossal, were disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which, by their decorative presence and marmorean immobility, was made worthy to be named, like that god-crowned ascent in the Palace of the Doges, the 'Staircase of the Giants,' and on which Swann now set foot, saddened by the thought that Odette had never climbed it. Ah, with what joy would he, on the other hand, have raced up the dark, evil-smelling, breakneck flights to the little dressmaker's, in whose attic he would so gladly have paid the price of a weekly stage-box at the Opera for the right to spend the evening there when Odette came, and other days too, for the privilege of talking about her, of living among people whom she was in the habit of seeing when he was not there, and who, on that account, seemed to keep secret among themselves some part of the life of his mistress more real, more inaccessible and more mysterious than anything that he knew. Whereas upon that pestilential, enviable staircase to the old dressmaker's, since there was no other, no service stair in the building, one saw in the evening outside every door an empty, unwashed milk-can set out, in readiness for the morning round, upon the door-mat; on the despicable, enormous staircase which Swann was at that moment climbing, on either side of him, at different levels, before each anfractuosity made in its walls by the window of the porter's lodge or the entrance to a set of rooms, representing the departments of indoor service which they controlled, and doing homage for them to the guests, a gate-keeper, a major-domo, a steward (worthy men who spent the rest of the week in semi-independence in their own domains, dined there by themselves like small shopkeepers, and might to-morrow lapse to the plebeian service of some successful doctor or industrial magnate), scrupulous in carrying out to the letter all the instructions that had been heaped upon them before they were allowed to don the brilliant livery which they wore only at long intervals, and in which they did not feel altogether at their ease, stood each in the arcade of his doorway, their splendid pomp tempered by a democratic good-fellowship, like saints in their niches, and a gigantic usher, dressed Swiss Guard fashion, like the beadle in a church, struck the pavement with his staff as each fresh arrival passed him. Coming to the top of the staircase, up which he had been followed by a servant with a pallid countenance and a small pigtail clubbed at the back of his head, like one of Goya's sacristans or a tabellion in an old play, Swann passed by an office in which the lackeys, seated like notaries before their massive registers, rose solemnly to their feet and inscribed his name. He next crossed a little hall which\u2014just as certain rooms are arranged by their owners to serve as the setting for a single work of art (from which they take their name), and, in their studied bareness, contain nothing else besides\u2014displayed to him as he entered it, like some priceless effigy by Benvenuto Cellini of an armed watchman, a young footman, his body slightly bent forward, rearing above his crimson gorget an even more crimson face, from which seemed to burst forth torrents of fire, timidity and zeal, who, as he pierced the Aubusson tapestries that screened the door of the room in which the music was being given with his impetuous, vigilant, desperate gaze, appeared, with a soldierly impassibility or a supernatural faith\u2014an allegory of alarums, incarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot\u2014to be looking out, angel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the approach of the enemy or for the hour of Judgment. Swann had now only to enter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an usher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering to him the keys of a conquered city. But he thought of the house in which at that very moment he might have been, if Odette had but permitted, and the remembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a door-mat wrung his heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of the servants gave place to that of the guests. But even this ugliness of faces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new and uncanny, now that their features,\u2014instead of being to him symbols of practical utility in the identification of this or that man, who until then had represented merely so many pleasures to be sought after, boredoms to be avoided, or courtesies to be acknowledged\u2014were at rest, measurable by aesthetic co-ordinates alone, in the autonomy of their curves and angles. And in these men, in the thick of whom Swann now found himself packed, there was nothing (even to the monocle which many of them wore, and which, previously, would, at the most, have enabled Swann to say that so-and-so wore a monocle) which, no longer restricted to the general connotation of a habit, the same in all of them, did not now strike him with a sense of individuality in each. Perhaps because he did not regard General de Froberville and the Marquis de Br\u00e9aute, who were talking together just inside the door, as anything more than two figures in a picture, whereas they were the old and useful friends who had put him up for the Jockey Club and had supported him in duels, the General's monocle, stuck like a shell-splinter in his common, scarred, victorious, overbearing face, in the middle of a forehead which it left half-blinded, like the single-eyed flashing front of the Cyclops, appeared to Swann as a monstrous wound which it might have been glorious to receive but which it was certainly not decent to expose, while that which M. de Br\u00e9aute wore, as a festive badge, with his pearl-grey gloves, his crush hat and white tie, substituting it for the familiar pair of glasses (as Swann himself did) when he went out to places, bore, glued to its other side, like a specimen prepared on a slide for the microscope, an infinitesimal gaze that swarmed with friendly feeling and never ceased to twinkle at the loftiness of ceilings, the delightfulness of parties, the interestingness of programmes and the excellence of refreshments\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Hallo! you here! why, it's ages since I've seen you,\" the General greeted Swann and, noticing the look of strain on his face and concluding that it was perhaps a serious illness that had kept him away, went on, \"You're looking well, old man!\" while M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 turned with, \"My dear fellow, what on earth are you doing here?\" to a 'society novelist' who had just fitted into the angle of eyebrow and cheek his own monocle, the sole instrument that he used in his psychological investigations and remorseless analyses of character, and who now replied, with an air of mystery and importance, rolling the 'r':\u2014\"I am observing!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Marquis de Forestelle's monocle was minute and rimless, and, by enforcing an incessant and painful contraction of the eye over which it was incrusted like a superfluous cartilage, the presence of which there was inexplicable and its substance unimaginable, it gave to his face a melancholy refinement, and led women to suppose him capable of suffering terribly when in love. But that of M. de Saint-Cand\u00e9, girdled, like Saturn, with an enormous ring, was the centre of gravity of a face which composed itself afresh every moment in relation to the glass, while his thrusting red nose and swollen sarcastic lips endeavoured by their grimaces to rise to the level of the steady flame of wit that sparkled in the polished disk, and saw itself preferred to the most ravishing eyes in the world by the smart, depraved young women whom it set dreaming of artificial charms and a refinement of sensual bliss; and then, behind him, M. de Palancy, who with his huge carp's head and goggling eyes moved slowly up and down the stream of festive gatherings, unlocking his great mandibles at every moment as though in search of his orientation, had the air of carrying about upon his person only an accidental and perhaps purely symbolical fragment of the glass wall of his aquarium, a part intended to suggest the whole which recalled to Swann, a fervent admirer of Giotto's Vices and Virtues at Padua, that Injustice by whose side a leafy bough evokes the idea of the forests that enshroud his secret lair\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann had gone forward into the room, under pressure from Mme. de Saint-Euverte and in order to listen to an aria from Orfeo which was being rendered on the flute, and had taken up a position in a corner from which, unfortunately, his horizon was bounded by two ladies of 'uncertain' age, seated side by side, the Marquise de Cambremer and the Vicomtesse de Franquetot, who, because they were cousins, used to spend their time at parties in wandering through the rooms, each clutching her bag and followed by her daughter, hunting for one another like people at a railway station, and could never be at rest until they had reserved, by marking them with their fans or handkerchiefs, two adjacent chairs; Mme. de Cambremer, since she knew scarcely anyone, being all the more glad of a companion, while Mme. de Franquetot, who, on the contrary, was extremely popular, thought it effective and original to shew all her fine friends that she preferred to their company that of an obscure country cousin with whom she had childish memories in common. Filled with ironical melancholy, Swann watched them as they listened to the pianoforte intermezzo (Liszt's 'Saint Francis preaching to the birds') which came after the flute, and followed the virtuoso in his dizzy flight; Mme. de Franquetot anxiously, her eyes starting from her head, as though the keys over which his fingers skipped with such agility were a series of trapezes, from any one of which he might come crashing, a hundred feet, to the ground, stealing now and then a glance of astonishment and unbelief at her companion, as who should say: \"It isn't possible, I would never have believed that a human being could do all that!\"; Mme. de Cambremer, as a woman who had received a sound musical education, beating time with her head\u2014transformed for the nonce into the pendulum of a metronome, the sweep and rapidity of whose movements from one shoulder to the other (performed with that look of wild abandonment in her eye which a sufferer shews who is no longer able to analyse his pain, nor anxious to master it, and says merely \"I can't help it\") so increased that at every moment her diamond earrings caught in the trimming of her bodice, and she was obliged to put straight the bunch of black grapes which she had in her hair, though without any interruption of her constantly accelerated motion. On the other side (and a little way in front) of Mme. de Franquetot, was the Marquise de Gallardon, absorbed in her favourite meditation, namely upon her own kinship with the Guermantes family, from which she derived both publicly and in private a good deal of glory not unmingled with shame, the most brilliant ornaments of that house remaining somewhat aloof from her, perhaps because she was just a tiresome old woman, or because she was a scandalous old woman, or because she came of an inferior branch of the family, or very possibly for no reason at all. When she found herself seated next to some one whom she did not know, as she was at this moment next to Mme. de Franquetot, she suffered acutely from the feeling that her own consciousness of her Guermantes connection could not be made externally manifest in visible character like those which, in the mosaics in Byzantine churches, placed one beneath another, inscribe in a vertical column by the side of some Sacred Personage the words which he is supposed to be uttering. At this moment she was pondering the fact that she had never received an invitation, or even call, from her young cousin the Princesse des Laumes, during the six years that had already elapsed since the latter's marriage. The thought filled her with anger\u2014and with pride; for, by virtue of having told everyone who expressed surprise at never seeing her at Mme. des Laumes's, that it was because of the risk of meeting the Princesse Mathilde there\u2014a degradation which her own family, the truest and bluest of Legitimists, would never have forgiven her, she had come gradually to believe that this actually was the reason for her not visiting her young cousin. She remembered, it is true, that she had several times inquired of Mme. des Laumes how they might contrive to meet, but she remembered it only in a confused way, and besides did more than neutralise this slightly humiliating reminiscence by murmuring, \"After all, it isn't for me to take the first step; I am at least twenty years older than she is.\" And fortified by these unspoken words she flung her shoulders proudly back until they seemed to part company with her bust, while her head, which lay almost horizontally upon them, made one think of the 'stuck-on' head of a pheasant which is brought to the table regally adorned with its feathers. Not that she in the least degree resembled a pheasant, having been endowed by nature with a short and squat and masculine figure; but successive mortifications had given her a backward tilt, such as one may observe in trees which have taken root on the very edge of a precipice and are forced to grow backwards to preserve their balance. Since she was obliged, in order to console herself for not being quite on a level with the rest of the Guermantes, to repeat to herself incessantly that it was owing to the uncompromising rigidity of her principles and pride that she saw so little of them, the constant iteration had gradually remoulded her body, and had given her a sort of 'bearing' which was accepted by the plebeian as a sign of breeding, and even kindled, at times, a momentary spark in the jaded eyes of old gentlemen in clubs. Had anyone subjected Mme. de Gallardon's conversation to that form of analysis which by noting the relative frequency of its several terms would furnish him with the key to a ciphered message, he would at once have remarked that no expression, not even the commonest forms of speech, occurred in it nearly so often as \"at my cousins the Guermantes's,\" \"at my aunt Guermantes's,\" \"Elz\u00e9ar de Guermantes's health,\" \"my cousin Guermantes's box.\" If anyone spoke to her of a distinguished personage, she would reply that, although she was not personally acquainted with him, she had seen him hundreds of times at her aunt Guermantes's, but she would utter this reply in so icy a tone, with such a hollow sound, that it was at once quite clear that if she did not know the celebrity personally that was because of all the obstinate, ineradicable principles against which her arching shoulders were stretched back to rest, as on one of those ladders on which gymnastic instructors make us 'extend' so as to develop the expansion of our chests\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At this moment the Princesse des Laumes, who had not been expected to appear at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, did in fact arrive. To shew that she did not wish any special attention, in a house to which she had come by an act of condescension, to be paid to her superior rank, she had entered the room with her arms pressed close to her sides, even when there was no crowd to be squeezed through, no one attempting to get past her; staying purposely at the back, with the air of being in her proper place, like a king who stands in the waiting procession at the doors of a theatre where the management have not been warned of his coming; and strictly limiting her field of vision\u2014so as not to seem to be advertising her presence and claiming the consideration that was her due\u2014to the study of a pattern in the carpet or of her own skirt, she stood there on the spot which had struck her as the most modest (and from which, as she very well knew, a cry of rapture from Mme. de Saint-Euverte would extricate her as soon as her presence there was noticed), next to Mme. de Cambremer, whom, however, she did not know. She observed the dumb-show by which her neighbour was expressing her passion for music, but she refrained from copying it. This was not to say that, for once that she had consented to spend a few minutes in Mme. de Saint-Euverte's house, the Princesse des Laumes would not have wished (so that the act of politeness to her hostess which she had performed by coming might, so to speak, 'count double') to shew herself as friendly and obliging as possible. But she had a natural horror of what she called 'exaggerating,' and always made a point of letting people see that she 'simply must not' indulge in any display of emotion that was not in keeping with the tone of the circle in which she moved, although such displays never failed to make an impression upon her, by virtue of that spirit of imitation, akin to timidity, which is developed in the most self-confident persons, by contact with an unfamiliar environment, even though it be inferior to their own. She began to ask herself whether these gesticulations might not, perhaps, be a necessary concomitant of the piece of music that was being played, a piece which, it might be, was in a different category from all the music that she had ever heard before; and whether to abstain from them was not a sign of her own inability to understand the music, and of discourtesy towards the lady of the house; with the result that, in order to express by a compromise both of her contradictory inclinations in turn, at one moment she would merely straighten her shoulder-straps or feel in her golden hair for the little balls of coral or of pink enamel, frosted with tiny diamonds, which formed its simple but effective ornament, studying, with a cold interest, her impassioned neighbour, while at another she would beat time for a few bars with her fan, but, so as not to forfeit her independence, she would beat a different time from the pianist's. When he had finished the Liszt Intermezzo and had begun a Prelude by Chopin, Mme. de Cambremer turned to Mme. de Franquetot with a tender smile, full of intimate reminiscence, as well as of satisfaction (that of a competent judge) with the performance. She had been taught in her girlhood to fondle and cherish those long-necked, sinuous creatures, the phrases of Chopin, so free, so flexible, so tactile, which begin by seeking their ultimate resting-place somewhere beyond and far wide of the direction in which they started, the point which one might have expected them to reach, phrases which divert themselves in those fantastic bypaths only to return more deliberately\u2014with a more premeditated reaction, with more precision, as on a crystal bowl which, if you strike it, will ring and throb until you cry aloud in anguish\u2014to clutch at one's heart\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Brought up in a provincial household with few friends or visitors, hardly ever invited to a ball, she had fuddled her mind, in the solitude of her old manor-house, over setting the pace, now crawling-slow, now passionate, whirling, breathless, for all those imaginary waltzing couples, gathering them like flowers, leaving the ball-room for a moment to listen, where the wind sighed among the pine-trees, on the shore of the lake, and seeing of a sudden advancing towards her, more different from anything one had ever dreamed of than earthly lovers are, a slender young man, whose voice was resonant and strange and false, in white gloves. But nowadays the old-fashioned beauty of this music seemed to have become a trifle stale. Having forfeited, some years back, the esteem of 'really musical' people, it had lost its distinction and its charm, and even those whose taste was frankly bad had ceased to find in it more than a moderate pleasure to which they hardly liked to confess. Mme. de Cambremer cast a furtive glance behind her. She knew that her young daughter-in-law (full of respect for her new and noble family, except in such matters as related to the intellect, upon which, having 'got as far' as Harmony and the Greek alphabet, she was specially enlightened) despised Chopin, and fell quite ill when she heard him played. But finding herself free from the scrutiny of this Wagnerian, who was sitting, at some distance, in a group of her own contemporaries, Mme. de Cambremer let herself drift upon a stream of exquisite memories and sensations. The Princesse des Laumes was touched also. Though without any natural gift for music, she had received, some fifteen years earlier, the instruction which a music-mistress of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, a woman of genius who had been, towards the end of her life, reduced to penury, had started, at seventy, to give to the daughters and granddaughters of her old pupils. This lady was now dead. But her method, an echo of her charming touch, came to life now and then in the fingers of her pupils, even of those who had been in other respects quite mediocre, had given up music, and hardly ever opened a piano. And so Mme. des Laumes could let her head sway to and fro, fully aware of the cause, with a perfect appreciation of the manner in which the pianist was rendering this Prelude, since she knew it by heart. The closing notes of the phrase that he had begun sounded already on her lips. And she murmured \"How charming it is!\" with a stress on the opening consonants of the adjective, a token of her refinement by which she felt her lips so romantically compressed, like the petals of a beautiful, budding flower, that she instinctively brought her eyes into harmony, illuminating them for a moment with a vague and sentimental gaze. Meanwhile Mme. de Gallardon had arrived at the point of saying to herself how annoying it was that she had so few opportunities of meeting the Princesse des Laumes, for she meant to teach her a lesson by not acknowledging her bow. She did not know that her cousin was in the room. A movement of Mme. Franquetot's head disclosed the Princess. At once Mme. de Gallardon dashed towards her, upsetting all her neighbours; although determined to preserve a distant and glacial manner which should remind everyone present that she had no desire to remain on friendly terms with a person in whose house one might find oneself, any day, cheek by jowl with the Princesse Mathilde, and to whom it was not her duty to make advances since she was not 'of her generation,' she felt bound to modify this air of dignity and reserve by some non-committal remark which would justify her overture and would force the Princess to engage in conversation; and so, when she reached her cousin, Mme. de Gallardon, with a stern countenance and one hand thrust out as though she were trying to 'force' a card, began with: \"How is your husband?\" in the same anxious tone that she would have used if the Prince had been seriously ill. The Princess, breaking into a laugh which was one of her characteristics, and was intended at once to shew the rest of an assembly that she was making fun of some one and also to enhance her own beauty by concentrating her features around her animated lips and sparkling eyes, answered: \"Why; he's never been better in his life!\" And she went on laughing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Gallardon then drew herself up and, chilling her expression still further, perhaps because she was still uneasy about the Prince's health, said to her cousin:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oriane,\" (at once Mme. des Laumes looked with amused astonishment towards an invisible third, whom she seemed to call to witness that she had never authorised Mme. de Gallardon to use her Christian name) \"I should be so pleased if you would look in, just for a minute, to-morrow evening, to hear a quintet, with the clarinet, by Mozart. I should like to have your opinion of it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She seemed not so much to be issuing an invitation as to be asking favour, and to want the Princess's opinion of the Mozart quintet just though it had been a dish invented by a new cook, whose talent it was most important that an epicure should come to judge\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I know that quintet quite well. I can tell you now\u2014that I adore it.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You know, my husband isn't at all well; it's his liver. He would like so much to see you,\" Mme. de Gallardon resumed, making it now a corporal work of charity for the Princess to appear at her party\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Princess never liked to tell people that she would not go to their houses. Every day she would write to express her regret at having been kept away\u2014by the sudden arrival of her husband's mother, by an invitation from his brother, by the Opera, by some excursion to the country\u2014from some party to which she had never for a moment dreamed of going. In this way she gave many people the satisfaction of feeling that she was on intimate terms with them, that she would gladly have come to their houses, and that she had been prevented from doing so only by some princely occurrence which they were flattered to find competing with their own humble entertainment. And then, as she belonged to that witty 'Guermantes set'\u2014in which there survived something of the alert mentality, stripped of all commonplace phrases and conventional sentiments, which dated from M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, and found its final expression in the plays of Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy\u2014she adapted its formula so as to suit even her social engagements, transposed it into the courtesy which was always struggling to be positive and precise, to approximate itself to the plain truth. She would never develop at any length to a hostess the expression of her anxiety to be present at her party; she found it more pleasant to disclose to her all the various little incidents on which it would depend whether it was or was not possible for her to come\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Listen, and I'll explain,\" she began to Mme. de Gallardon. \"To-morrow evening I must go to a friend of mine, who has been pestering me to fix a day for ages. If she takes us to the theatre afterwards, then I can't possibly come to you, much as I should love to; but if we just stay in the house, I know there won't be anyone else there, so I can slip away.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Tell me, have you seen your friend M. Swann?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No! my precious Charles! I never knew he was here. Where is he? I must catch his eye.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's a funny thing that he should come to old Saint-Euverte's,\" Mme. de Gallardon went on. \"Oh, I know he's very clever,\" meaning by that 'very cunning,' \"but that makes no difference; fancy a Jew here, and she the sister and sister-in-law of two Archbishops.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I am ashamed to confess that I am not in the least shocked,\" said the Princesse des Laumes\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know he's a converted Jew, and all that, and his parents and grandparents before him. But they do say that the converted ones are worse about their religion than the practising ones, that it's all just a pretence; is that true, d'you think?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I can throw no light at all on the matter.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The pianist, who was 'down' to play two pieces by Chopin, after finishing the Prelude had at once attacked a Polonaise. But once Mme. de Gallardon had informed her cousin that Swann was in the room, Chopin himself might have risen from the grave and played all his works in turn without Mme. des Laumes's paying him the slightest attention. She belonged to that one of the two divisions of the human race in which the untiring curiosity which the other half feels about the people whom it does not know is replaced by an unfailing interest in the people whom it does. As with many women of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, the presence, in any room in which she might find herself, of another member of her set, even although she had nothing in particular to say to him, would occupy her mind to the exclusion of every other consideration. From that moment, in the hope that Swann would catch sight of her, the Princess could do nothing but (like a tame white mouse when a lump of sugar is put down before its nose and then taken away) turn her face, in which were crowded a thousand signs of intimate connivance, none of them with the least relevance to the sentiment underlying Chopin's music, in the direction where Swann was, and, if he moved, divert accordingly the course of her magnetic smile\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oriane, don't be angry with me,\" resumed Mme. de Gallardon, who could never restrain herself from sacrificing her highest social ambitions, and the hope that she might one day emerge into a light that would dazzle the world, to the immediate and secret satisfaction of saying something disagreeable, \"people do say about your M. Swann that he's the sort of man one can't have in the house; is that true?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Why, you, of all people, ought to know that it's true,\" replied the Princesse des Laumes, \"for you must have asked him a hundred times, and he's never been to your house once.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And leaving her cousin mortified afresh, she broke out again into a laugh which scandalised everyone who was trying to listen to the music, but attracted the attention of Mme. de Saint-Euverte, who had stayed, out of politeness, near the piano, and caught sight of the Princess now for the first time. Mme. de Saint-Euverte was all the more delighted to see Mme. des Laumes, as she imagined her to be still at Guermantes, looking after her father-in-law, who was ill\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear Princess, you here?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I tucked myself away in a corner, and I've been hearing such lovely things.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What, you've been in the room quite a time?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, quite a long time, which seemed very short; it was only long because I couldn't see you.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Saint-Euverte offered her own chair to the Princess, who declined it with:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, please, no! Why should you? It doesn't matter in the least where I sit.\" And deliberately picking out, so as the better to display the simplicity of a really great lady, a low seat without a back: \"There now, that hassock, that's all I want. It will make me keep my back straight. Oh! Good heavens, I'm making a noise again; they'll be telling you to have me 'chucked out'.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, the pianist having doubled his speed, the emotion of the music-lovers was reaching its climax, a servant was handing refreshments about on a salver, and was making the spoons rattle, and, as on every other 'party-night', Mme. de Saint-Euverte was making signs to him, which he never saw, to leave the room. A recent bride, who had been told that a young woman ought never to appear bored, was smiling vigorously, trying to catch her hostess's eye so as to flash a token of her gratitude for the other's having 'thought of her' in connection with so delightful an entertainment. And yet, although she remained more calm than Mme. de Franquetot, it was not without some uneasiness that she followed the flying fingers; what alarmed her being not the pianist's fate but the piano's, on which a lighted candle, jumping at each fortissimo, threatened, if not to set its shade on fire, at least to spill wax upon the ebony. At last she could contain herself no longer, and, running up the two steps of the platform on which the piano stood, flung herself on the candle to adjust its sconce. But scarcely had her hand come within reach of it when, on a final chord, the piece finished, and the pianist rose to his feet. Nevertheless the bold initiative shewn by this young woman and the moment of blushing confusion between her and the pianist which resulted from it, produced an impression that was favourable on the whole\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you see what that girl did just now, Princess?\" asked General de Froberville, who had come up to Mme. des Laumes as her hostess left her for a moment. \"Odd, wasn't it? Is she one of the performers?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, she's a little Mme. de Cambremer,\" replied the Princess carelessly, and then, with more animation: \"I am only repeating what I heard just now, myself; I haven't the faintest notion who said it, it was some one behind me who said that they were neighbours of Mme. de Saint-Euverte in the country, but I don't believe anyone knows them, really. They must be 'country cousins'! By the way, I don't know whether you're particularly 'well-up' in the brilliant society which we see before us, because I've no idea who all these astonishing people can be. What do you suppose they do with themselves when they're not at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's parties? She must have ordered them in with the musicians and the chairs and the food. 'Universal providers,' you know. You must admit, they're rather splendid, General. But can she really have the courage to hire the same 'supers' every week? It isn't possible!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, but Cambremer is quite a good name; old, too,\" protested the General\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I see no objection to its being old,\" the Princess answered dryly, \"but whatever else it is it's not euphonious,\" she went on, isolating the word euphonious as though between inverted commas, a little affectation to which the Guermantes set were addicted\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You think not, eh! She's a regular little peach, though,\" said the General, whose eyes never strayed from Mme. de Cambremer. \"Don't you agree with me, Princess?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"She thrusts herself forward too much; I think, in so young a woman, that's not very nice\u2014for I don't suppose she's my generation,\" replied Mme. des Laumes (the last word being common, it appeared, to Gallardon and Guermantes). And then, seeing that M. de Froberville was still gazing at Mme. de Cambremer, she added, half out of malice towards the lady, half wishing to oblige the General: \"Not very nice... for her husband! I am sorry that I do not know her, since she seems to attract you so much; I might have introduced you to her,\" said the Princess, who, if she had known the young woman, would most probably have done nothing of the sort. \"And now I must say good night, because one of my friends is having a birthday party, and I must go and wish her many happy returns,\" she explained, modestly and with truth, reducing the fashionable gathering to which she was going to the simple proportions of a ceremony which would be boring in the extreme, but at which she was obliged to be present, and there would be something touching about her appearance. \"Besides, I must pick up Basin. While I've been here, he's gone to see those friends of his\u2014you know them too, I'm sure,\u2014who are called after a bridge\u2014oh, yes, the I\u00e9nas.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It was a battle before it was a bridge, Princess; it was a victory!\" said the General. \"I mean to say, to an old soldier like me,\" he went on, wiping his monocle and replacing it, as though he were laying a fresh dressing on the raw wound underneath, while the Princess instinctively looked away, \"that Empire nobility, well, of course, it's not the same thing, but, after all, taking it as it is, it's very fine of its kind; they were people who really did fight like heroes.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I have the deepest respect for heroes,\" the Princess assented, though with a faint trace of irony. \"If I don't go with Basin to see this Princesse d'I\u00e9na, it isn't for that, at all; it's simply because I don't know them. Basin knows them; he worships them. Oh, no, it's not what you think; he's not in love with her. I've nothing to set my face against! Besides, what good has it ever done when I have set my face against them?\" she queried sadly, for the whole world knew that, ever since the day upon which the Prince des Laumes had married his fascinating cousin, he had been consistently unfaithful to her. \"Anyhow, it isn't that at all. They're people he has known for ever so long, they do him very well, and that suits me down to the ground. But I must tell you what he's told me about their house; it's quite enough. Can you imagine it, all their furniture is 'Empire'!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But, my dear Princess, that's only natural; it belonged to their grandparents.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't quite say it didn't, but that doesn't make it any less ugly. I quite understand that people can't always have nice things, but at least they needn't have things that are merely grotesque. What do you say? I can think of nothing more devastating, more utterly smug than that hideous style\u2014cabinets covered all over with swans' heads, like bath-taps!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I believe, all the same, that they've got some lovely things; why, they must have that famous mosaic table on which the Treaty of...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, I don't deny, they may have things that are interesting enough from the historic point of view. But things like that can't, ever, be beautiful ... because they're simply horrible! I've got things like that myself, that came to Basin from the Montesquious. Only, they're up in the attics at Guermantes, where nobody ever sees them. But, after all, that's not the point, I would fly to see them, with Basin; I would even go to see them among all their sphinxes and brasses, if I knew them, but\u2014I don't know them! D'you know, I was always taught, when I was a little girl, that it was not polite to call on people one didn't know.\" She assumed a tone of childish gravity. \"And so I am just doing what I was taught to do. Can't you see those good people, with a totally strange woman bursting into their house? Why, I might get a most hostile reception.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And she coquettishly enhanced the charm of the smile which the idea had brought to her lips, by giving to her blue eyes, which were fixed on the General, a gentle, dreamy expression\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My dear Princess, you know that they'd be simply wild with joy.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, why?\" she inquired, with the utmost vivacity, either so as to seem unaware that it would be because she was one of the first ladies in France, or so as to have the pleasure of hearing the General tell her so. \"Why? How can you tell? Perhaps they would think it the most unpleasant thing that could possibly happen. I know nothing about them, but if they're anything like me, I find it quite boring enough to see the people I do know; I'm sure if I had to see people I didn't know as well, even if they had 'fought like heroes,' I should go stark mad. Besides, except when it's an old friend like you, whom one knows quite apart from that, I'm not sure that 'heroism' takes one very far in society. It's often quite boring enough to have to give a dinner-party, but if one had to offer one's arm to Spartacus, to let him take one down...! Really, no; it would never be Vercingetorix I should send for, to make a fourteenth. I feel sure, I should keep him for really big 'crushes.' And as I never give any...\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah! Princess, it's easy to see you're not a Guermantes for nothing. You have your share of it, all right, the 'wit of the Guermantes'!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But people always talk about the wit of the Guermantes; I never could make out why. Do you really know any others who have it?\" she rallied him, with a rippling flow of laughter, her features concentrated, yoked to the service of her animation, her eyes sparkling, blazing with a radiant sunshine of gaiety which could be kindled only by such speeches\u2014even if the Princess had to make them herself\u2014as were in praise of h wit or of her beauty. \"Look, there's Swann talking to your Cambremer woman; over there, beside old Saint-Euverte, don't you see him? Ask him to introduce you. But hurry up, he seems to be just going!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Did you notice how dreadfully ill he's looking?\" asked the General\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My precious Charles? Ah, he's coming at last; I was beginning to think he didn't want to see me!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was extremely fond of the Princesse des Laumes, and the sight of her recalled to him Guermantes, a property close to Combray, and all that country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not to be separated from Odette. Slipping into the manner, half-artistic, half-amorous\u2014with which he could always manage to amuse the Princess\u2014a manner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment into the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words, for his own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Ah!\" he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at once to Mme. de Saint-Euverte, to whom he spoke, and to Mme. des Laumes, for whom he was speaking, \"Behold our charming Princess! See, she has come up on purpose from Guermantes to hear Saint Francis preach to the birds, and has only just had time, like a dear little tit-mouse, to go and pick a few little hips and haws and put them in her hair; there are even some drops of dew upon them still, a little of the hoar-frost which must be making the Duchess, down there, shiver. It is very pretty indeed, my dear Princess.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"What! The Princess came up on purpose from Guermantes? But that's too wonderful! I never knew; I'm quite bewildered,\" Mme. de Saint-Euverte protested with quaint simplicity, being but little accustomed to Swann's way of speaking. And then, examining the Princess's headdress, \"Why, you're quite right; it is copied from... what shall I say, not chestnuts, no,\u2014oh, it's a delightful idea, but how can the Princess have known what was going to be on my programme? The musicians didn't tell me, even.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann, who was accustomed, when he was with a woman whom he had kept up the habit of addressing in terms of gallantry, to pay her delicate compliments which most other people would not and need not understand, did not condescend to explain to Mme. de Saint-Euverte that he had been speaking metaphorically. As for the Princess, she was in fits of laughter, both because Swann's wit was highly appreciated by her set, and because she could never hear a compliment addressed to herself without finding it exquisitely subtle and irresistibly amusing\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Indeed! I'm delighted, Charles, if my little hips and haws meet with your approval. But tell me, why did you bow to that Cambremer person, are you also her neighbour in the country?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mme. de Saint-Euverte, seeing that the Princess seemed quite happy talking to Swann, had drifted away\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But you are, yourself, Princess!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I! Why, they must have 'countries' everywhere, those creatures! Don't I wish I had!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, not the Cambremers; her own people. She was a Legrandin, and used to come to Combray. I don't know whether you are aware that you are Comtesse de Combray, and that the Chapter owes you a due.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I don't know what the Chapter owes me, but I do know that I'm 'touched' for a hundred francs, every year, by the Cur\u00e9, which is a due that I could very well do without. But surely these Cambremers have rather a startling name. It ends just in time, but it ends badly!\" she said with a laugh\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It begins no better.\" Swann took the point\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes; that double abbreviation!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Some one very angry and very proper who didn't dare to finish the first word.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But since he couldn't stop himself beginning the second, he'd have done better to finish the first and be done with it. We are indulging in the most refined form of humour, my dear Charles, in the very best of taste\u2014but how tiresome it is that I never see you now,\" she went on in a coaxing tone, \"I do so love talking to you. Just imagine, I could not make that idiot Froberville see that there was anything funny about the name Cambremer. Do agree that life is a dreadful business. It's only when I see you that I stop feeling bored.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Which was probably not true. But Swann and the Princess had the same way of looking at the little things of life\u2014the effect, if not the cause of which was a close analogy between their modes of expression and even of pronunciation. This similarity was not striking because no two things could have been more unlike than their voices. But if one took the trouble to imagine Swann's utterances divested of the sonority that enwrapped them, of the moustache from under which they emerged, one found that they were the same phrases, the same inflexions, that they had the 'tone' of the Guermantes set. On important matters, Swann and the Princess had not an idea in common. But since Swann had become so melancholy, and was always in that trembling condition which precedes a flood of tears, he had the same need to speak about his grief that a murderer has to tell some one about his crime. And when he heard the Princess say that life was a dreadful business, he felt as much comforted as if she had spoken to him of Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, life is a dreadful business! We must meet more often, my dear friend. What is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful. We could spend a most pleasant evening together.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I'm sure we could; why not come down to Guermantes? My mother-in-law would be wild with joy. It's supposed to be very ugly down there, but I must say, I find the neighborhood not at all unattractive; I have a horror of 'picturesque spots'.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I know it well, it's delightful!\" replied Swann. \"It's almost too beautiful, too much alive for me just at present; it's a country to be happy in. It's perhaps because I have lived there, but things there speak to me so. As soon as a breath of wind gets up, and the cornfields begin to stir, I feel that some one is going to appear suddenly, that I am going to hear some news; and those little houses by the water's edge... I should be quite wretched!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh! my dearest Charles, do take care; there's that appalling Rampillon woman; she's seen me; hide me somewhere, do tell me again, quickly, what it was that happened to her; I get so mixed up; she's just married off her daughter, or her lover (I never can remember),\u2014perhaps both\u2014to each other! Oh, no, I remember now, she's been dropped by her Prince... Pretend to be talking, so that the poor old Berenice sha'n't come and invite me to dinner. Anyhow, I'm going. Listen, my dearest Charles, now that I have seen you, once in a blue moon, won't you let me carry you off and take you to the Princesse de Parme's, who would be so pleased to see you (you know), and Basin too, for that matter; he's meeting me there. If one didn't get news of you, sometimes, from M\u00e9m\u00e9... Remember, I never see you at all now!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann declined. Having told M. de Charlus that, on leaving Mme. de Saint-Euverte's, he would go straight home, he did not care to run the risk, by going on now to the Princesse de Parme's, of missing a message which he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one of the footmen, during the party, and which he was perhaps going to find left with his own porter, at home\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Poor Swann,\" said Mme. des Laumes that night to her husband; \"he is always charming, but he does look so dreadfully unhappy. You will see for yourself, for he has promised to dine with us one of these days. I do feel that it's really absurd that a man of his intelligence should let himself be made to suffer by a creature of that kind, who isn't even interesting, for they tell me, she's an absolute idiot!\" she concluded with the wisdom invariably shewn by people who, not being in love themselves, feel that a clever man ought to be unhappy only about such persons as are worth his while; which is rather like being astonished that anyone should condescend to die of cholera at the bidding of so insignificant a creature as the common bacillus\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann now wished to go home, but, just as he was making his escape, General de Froberville caught him and asked for an introduction to Mme. de Cambremer, and he was obliged to go back into the room to look for her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I say, Swann, I'd rather be married to that little woman than killed by savages, what do you say?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The words 'killed by savages' pierced Swann's aching heart; and at once he felt the need of continuing the conversation. \"Ah!\" he began, \"some fine lives have been lost in that way... There was, you remember, that explorer whose remains Dumont d'Urville brought back, La P\u00e9rouse...\" (and he was at once happy again, as though he had named Odette). \"He was a fine character, and interests me very much, does La P\u00e9rouse,\" he ended sadly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, yes, of course, La P\u00e9rouse,\" said the General. \"It's quite a well-known name. There's a street called that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Do you know anyone in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse?\" asked Swann excitedly\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Only Mme. de Chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow Chaussepierre. She gave a most amusing theatre-party the other evening. That's a house that will be really smart some day, you'll see!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, so she lives in the Rue La P\u00e9rouse. It's attractive; I like that street; it's so sombre.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Indeed it isn't. You can't have been in it for a long time; it's not at all sombre now; they're beginning to build all round there.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Swann did finally introduce M. de Froberville to the young Mme. de Cambremer, since it was the first time that she had heard the General's name, she hastily outlined upon her lips the smile of joy and surprise with which she would have greeted him if she had never, in the whole of her life, heard anything else; for, as she did not yet know all the friends of her new family, whenever anyone was presented to her, she assumed that he must be one of them, and thinking that she would shew her tact by appearing to have heard 'such a lot about him' since her marriage, she would hold out her hand with an air of hesitation which was meant as a proof at once of the inculcated reserve which she had to overcome and of the spontaneous friendliness which successfully overcame it. And so her parents-in-law, whom she still regarded as the most eminent pair in France, declared that she was an angel; all the more that they preferred to appear, in marrying her to their son, to have yielded to the attraction rather of her natural charm than of her considerable fortune\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"It's easy to see that you're a musician heart and soul, Madame,\" said the General, alluding to the incident of the candle\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile the concert had begun again, and Swann saw that he could not now go before the end of the new number. He suffered greatly from being shut up among all these people whose stupidity and absurdities wounded him all the more cruelly since, being ignorant of his love, incapable, had they known of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than smile at it as at some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of insanity, they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective state which existed for himself alone, whose reality there was nothing external to confirm; he suffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry, from having to prolong his exile in this place to which Odette would never come, in which no one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was entirely absent\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. What had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes, on which it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation with which it already saw the expected object approaching, and with a desperate effort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before itself expired, to keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its remaining strength, that the stranger might enter in, as one holds a door open that would otherwise automatically close. And before Swann had had time to understand what was happening, to think: \"It is the little phrase from Vinteuil's sonata. I mustn't listen!\", all his memories of the days when Odette had been in love with him, which he had succeeded, up till that evening, in keeping invisible in the depths of his being, deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they supposed, had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for his present desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In place of the abstract expressions \"the time when I was happy,\" \"the time when I was loved,\" which he had often used until then, and without much suffering, for his intelligence had not embodied in them anything of the past save fictitious extracts which preserved none of the reality, he now recovered everything that had fixed unalterably the peculiar, volatile essence of that lost happiness; he could see it all; the snowy, curled petals of the chrysanthemum which she had tossed after him into his carriage, which he had kept pressed to his lips, the address 'Maison Dor\u00e9e,' embossed on the note-paper on which he had read \"My hand trembles so as I write to you,\" the frowning contraction of her eyebrows when she said pleadingly: \"You won't let it be very long before you send for me?\"; he could smell the heated iron of the barber whom he used to have in to singe his hair while Loredan went to fetch the little working girl; could feel the torrents of rain which fell so often that spring, the ice-cold homeward drive in his victoria, by moonlight; all the network of mental habits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory reactions, which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes, by which his body now found itself inextricably held. At that time he had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures of those people who lived for love alone. He had supposed that he could stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also; how small a thing the actual charm of Odette was now in comparison with that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around her, that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and night what she had been doing, of not possessing her wholly, at all times and in all places! Alas, he recalled the accents in which she had exclaimed: \"But I can see you at any time; I am always free!\"\u2014she, who was never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in his life, her passionate desire that he should do her the favour\u2014of which it was he who, then, had felt suspicious, as of a possibly tedious waste of his time and disturbance of his arrangements\u2014of granting her access to his study; how she had been obliged to beg that he would let her take him to the Verdurins'; and, when he did allow her to come to him once a month, how she had first, before he would let himself be swayed, had to repeat what a joy it would be to her, that custom of their seeing each other daily, for which she had longed at a time when to him it had seemed only a tiresome distraction, for which, since that time, she had conceived a distaste and had definitely broken herself of it, while it had become for him so insatiable, so dolorous a need. Little had he suspected how truly he spoke when, on their third meeting, as she repeated: \"But why don't you let me come to you oftener?\" he had told her, laughing, and in a vein of gallantry, that it was for fear of forming a hopeless passion. Now, alas, it still happened at times that she wrote to him from a restaurant or hotel, on paper which bore a printed address, but printed in letters of fire that seared his heart. \"Written from the H\u00f4tel Vouillemont. What on earth can she have gone there for? With whom? What happened there?\" He remembered the gas-jets that were being extinguished along the Boulevard des Italiens when he had met her, when all hope was gone among the errant shades upon that night which had seemed to him almost supernatural and which now (that night of a period when he had not even to ask himself whether he would be annoying her by looking for her and by finding her, so certain was he that she knew no greater happiness than to see him and to let him take her home) belonged indeed to a mysterious world to which one never may return again once its doors are closed. And Swann could distinguish, standing, motionless, before that scene of happiness in which it lived again, a wretched figure which filled him with such pity, because he did not at first recognise who it was, that he must lower his head, lest anyone should observe that his eyes were filled with tears. It was himself\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he had realised this, his pity ceased; he was jealous, now, of that other self whom she had loved, he was jealous of those men of whom he had so often said, without much suffering: \"Perhaps she's in love with them,\" now that he had exchanged the vague idea of loving, in which there is no love, for the petals of the chrysanthemum and the 'letter-heading' of the Maison d'Or; for they were full of love. And then, his anguish becoming too keen, he passed his hand over his forehead, let the monocle drop from his eye, and wiped its glass. And doubtless, if he had caught sight of himself at that moment, he would have added to the collection of the monocles which he had already identified, this one which he removed, like an importunate, worrying thought, from his head, while from its misty surface, with his handkerchief, he sought to obliterate his cares\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are in the music of the violin\u2014if one does not see the instrument itself, and so cannot relate what one hears to its form, which modifies the fullness of the sound\u2014accents which are so closely akin to those of certain contralto voices, that one has the illusion that a singer has taken her place amid the orchestra. One raises one's eyes; one sees only the wooden case, magical as a Chinese box; but, at moments, one is still tricked by the deceiving appeal of the Siren; at times, too, one believes that one is listening to a captive spirit, struggling in the darkness of its masterful box, a box quivering with enchantment, like a devil immersed in a stoup of holy water; sometimes, again, it is in the air, at large, like a pure and supernatural creature that reveals to the ear, as it passes, its invisible message\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As though the musicians were not nearly so much playing the little phrase as performing the rites on which it insisted before it would consent to appear, as proceeding to utter the incantations necessary to procure, and to prolong for a few moments, the miracle of its apparition, Swann, who was no more able now to see it than if it had belonged to a world of ultra-violet light, who experienced something like the refreshing sense of a metamorphosis in the momentary blindness with which he had been struck as he approached it, Swann felt that it was present, like a protective goddess, a confidant of his love, who, so as to be able to come to him through the crowd, and to draw him aside to speak to him, had disguised herself in this sweeping cloak of sound. And as she passed him, light, soothing, as softly murmured as the perfume of a flower, telling him what she had to say, every word of which he closely scanned, sorry to see them fly away so fast, he made involuntarily with his lips the motion of kissing, as it went by him, the harmonious, fleeting form\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who addressed herself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of Odette. For he had no longer, as of old, the impression that Odette and he were not known to the little phrase. Had it not often been the witness of their joys? True that, as often, it had warned him of their frailty. And indeed, whereas, in that distant time, he had divined an element of suffering in its smile, in its limpid and disillusioned intonation, to-night he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was almost gay. Of those sorrows, of which the little phrase had spoken to him then, which he had seen it\u2014without his being touched by them himself\u2014carry past him, smiling, on its sinuous and rapid course, of those sorrows which were now become his own, without his having any hope of being, ever, delivered from them, it seemed to say to him, as once it had said of his happiness: \"What does all that matter; it is all nothing.\" And Swann's thoughts were borne for the first time on a wave of pity and tenderness towards that Vinteuil, towards that unknown, exalted brother who also must have suffered so greatly; what could his life have been? From the depths of what well of sorrow could he have drawn that god-like strength, that unlimited power of creation?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it was the little phrase that spoke to him of the vanity of his sufferings, Swann found a sweetness in that very wisdom which, but a little while back, had seemed to him intolerable when he thought that he could read it on the faces of indifferent strangers, who would regard his love as a digression that was without importance. 'Twas because the little phrase, unlike them, whatever opinion it might hold on the short duration of these states of the soul, saw in them something not, as everyone else saw, less serious than the events of everyday life, but, on the contrary, so far superior to everyday life as to be alone worthy of the trouble of expressing it. Those graces of an intimate sorrow, 'twas them that the phrase endeavoured to imitate, to create anew; and even their essence, for all that it consists in being incommunicable and in appearing trivial to everyone save him who has experience of them, the little phrase had captured, had rendered visible. So much so that it made their value be confessed, their divine sweetness be tasted by all those same onlookers\u2014provided only that they were in any sense musical\u2014who, the next moment, would ignore, would disown them in real life, in every individual love that came into being beneath their eyes. Doubtless the form in which it had codified those graces could not be analysed into any logical elements. But ever since, more than a year before, discovering to him many of the riches of his own soul, the love of music had been born, and for a time at least had dwelt in him, Swann had regarded musical motifs as actual ideas, of another world, of another order, ideas veiled in shadows, unknown, impenetrable by the human mind, which none the less were perfectly distinct one from another, unequal among themselves in value and in significance. When, after that first evening at the Verdurins', he had had the little phrase played over to him again, and had sought to disentangle from his confused impressions how it was that, like a perfume or a caress, it swept over and enveloped him, he had observed that it was to the closeness of the intervals between the five notes which composed it and to the constant repetition of two of them that was due that impression of a frigid, a contracted sweetness; but in reality he knew that he was basing this conclusion not upon the phrase itself, but merely upon certain equivalents, substituted (for his mind's convenience) for the mysterious entity of which he had become aware, before ever he knew the Verdurins, at that earlier party, when for the first time he had heard the sonata played. He knew that his memory of the piano falsified still further the perspective in which he saw the music, that the field open to the musician is not a miserable stave of seven notes, but an immeasurable keyboard (still, almost all of it, unknown), on which, here and there only, separated by the gross darkness of its unexplored tracts, some few among the millions of keys, keys of tenderness, of passion, of courage, of serenity, which compose it, each one differing from all the rest as one universe differs from another, have been discovered by certain great artists who do us the service, when they awaken in us the emotion corresponding to the theme which they have found, of shewing us what richness, what variety lies hidden, unknown to us, in that great black impenetrable night, discouraging exploration, of our soul, which we have been content to regard as valueless and waste and void. Vinteuil had been one of those musicians. In his little phrase, albeit it presented to the mind's eye a clouded surface, there was contained, one felt, a matter so consistent, so explicit, to which the phrase gave so new, so original a force, that those who had once heard it preserved the memory of it in the treasure-chamber of their minds. Swann would repair to it as to a conception of love and happiness, of which at once he knew as well in what respects it was peculiar as he would know of the Princesse de Cl\u00e8ves, or of Ren\u00e9, should either of those titles occur to him. Even when he was not thinking of the little phrase, it existed, latent, in his mind, in the same way as certain other conceptions without material equivalent, such as our notions of light, of sound, of perspective, of bodily desire, the rich possessions wherewith our inner temple is diversified and adorned. Perhaps we shall lose them, perhaps they will be obliterated, if we return to nothing in the dust. But so long as we are alive, we can no more bring ourselves to a state in which we shall not have known them than we can with regard to any material object, than we can, for example, doubt the luminosity of a lamp that has just been lighted, in view of the changed aspect of everything in the room, from which has vanished even the memory of the darkness. In that way Vinteuil's phrase, like some theme, say, in Tristan, which represents to us also a certain acquisition of sentiment, has espoused our mortal state, had endued a vesture of humanity that was affecting enough. Its destiny was linked, for the future, with that of the human soul, of which it was one of the special, the most distinctive ornaments. Perhaps it is not-being that is the true state, and all our dream of life is without existence; but, if so, we feel that it must be that these phrases of music, these conceptions which exist in relation to our dream, are nothing either. We shall perish, but we have for our hostages these divine captives who shall follow and share our fate. And death in their company is something less bitter, less inglorious, perhaps even less certain\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So Swann was not mistaken in believing that the phrase of the sonata did, really, exist. Human as it was from this point of view, it belonged, none the less, to an order of supernatural creatures whom we have never seen, but whom, in spite of that, we recognise and acclaim with rapture when some explorer of the unseen contrives to coax one forth, to bring it down from that divine world to which he has access to shine for a brief moment in the firmament of ours. This was what Vinteuil had done for the little phrase. Swann felt that the composer had been content (with the musical instruments at his disposal) to draw aside its veil, to make it visible, following and respecting its outlines with a hand so loving, so prudent, so delicate and so sure, that the sound altered at every moment, blunting itself to indicate a shadow, springing back into life when it must follow the curve of some more bold projection. And one proof that Swann was not mistaken when he believed in the real existence of this phrase, was that anyone with an ear at all delicate for music would at once have detected the imposture had Vinteuil, endowed with less power to see and to render its forms, sought to dissemble (by adding a line, here and there, of his own invention) the dimness of his vision or the feebleness of his hand\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The phrase had disappeared. Swann knew that it would come again at the end of the last movement, after a long passage which Mme. Verdurin's pianist always 'skipped.' There were in this passage some admirable ideas which Swann had not distinguished on first hearing the sonata, and which he now perceived, as if they had, in the cloakroom of his memory, divested themselves of their uniform disguise of novelty. Swann listened to all the scattered themes which entered into the composition of the phrase, as its premises enter into the inevitable conclusion of a syllogism; he was assisting at the mystery of its birth. \"Audacity,\" he exclaimed to himself, \"as inspired, perhaps, as a Lavoisier's or an Ampere's, the audacity of a Vinteuil making experiment, discovering the secret laws that govern an unknown force, driving across a region unexplored towards the one possible goal the invisible team in which he has placed his trust and which he never may discern!\" How charming the dialogue which Swann now heard between piano and violin, at the beginning of the last passage. The suppression of human speech, so far from letting fancy reign there uncontrolled (as one might have thought), had eliminated it altogether. Never was spoken language of such inflexible necessity, never had it known questions so pertinent, such obvious replies. At first the piano complained alone, like a bird deserted by its mate; the violin heard and answered it, as from a neighbouring tree. It was as at the first beginning of the world, as if there were not yet but these twain upon the earth, or rather in this world closed against all the rest, so fashioned by the logic of its creator that in it there should never be any but themselves; the world of this sonata. Was it a bird, was it the soul, not yet made perfect, of the little phrase, was it a fairy, invisibly somewhere lamenting, whose plaint the piano heard and tenderly repeated? Its cries were so sudden that the violinist must snatch up his bow and race to catch them as they came. Marvellous bird! The violinist seemed to wish to charm, to tame, to woo, to win it. Already it had passed into his soul, already the little phrase which it evoked shook like a medium's the body of the violinist, 'possessed' indeed. Swann knew that the phrase was going to speak to him once again. And his personality was now so divided that the strain of waiting for the imminent moment when he would find himself face to face, once more, with the phrase, convulsed him in one of those sobs which a fine line of poetry or a piece of alarming news will wring from us, not when we are alone, but when we repeat one or the other to a friend, in whom we see ourselves reflected, like a third person, whose probable emotion softens him. It reappeared, but this time to remain poised in the air, and to sport there for a moment only, as though immobile, and shortly to expire. And so Swann lost nothing of the precious time for which it lingered. It was still there, like an iridescent bubble that floats for a while unbroken. As a rainbow, when its brightness fades, seems to subside, then soars again and, before it is extinguished, is glorified with greater splendour than it has ever shewn; so to the two colours which the phrase had hitherto allowed to appear it added others now, chords shot with every hue in the prism, and made them sing. Swann dared not move, and would have liked to compel all the other people in the room to remain still also, as if the slightest movement might embarrass the magic presence, supernatural, delicious, frail, that would so easily vanish. But no one, as it happened, dreamed of speaking. The ineffable utterance of one solitary man, absent, perhaps dead (Swann did not know whether Vinteuil were still alive), breathed out above the rites of those two hierophants, sufficed to arrest the attention of three hundred minds, and made of that stage on which a soul was thus called into being one of the noblest altars on which a supernatural ceremony could be performed. It followed that, when the phrase at last was finished, and only its fragmentary echoes floated among the subsequent themes which had already taken its place, if Swann at first was annoyed to see the Comtesse de Monteriender, famed for her imbecilities, lean over towards him to confide in him her impressions, before even the sonata had come to an end; he could not refrain from smiling, and perhaps also found an underlying sense, which she was incapable of perceiving, in the words that she used. Dazzled by the virtuosity of the performers, the Comtesse exclaimed to Swann: \"It's astonishing! I have never seen anything to beat it...\" But a scrupulous regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she added the reservation: \"anything to beat it... since the table-turning!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From that evening, Swann understood that the feeling which Odette had once had for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would not be realised now. And the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had once more shewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him any attention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of a slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and sceptical solicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when they are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady, relate, as significant facts of infinite value: \"Yesterday he went through his accounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we had made in adding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to enjoy it, if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet to-morrow,\"\u2014although they themselves know that these things are meaningless on the eve of an inevitable death. No doubt Swann was assured that if he had now been living at a distance from Odette he would gradually have lost all interest in her, so that he would have been glad to learn that she was leaving Paris for ever; he would have had the courage to remain there; but he had not the courage to go\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He had often thought of going. Now that he was once again at work upon his essay on Vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to The Hague, to Dresden, to Brunswick. He was certain that a 'Toilet of Diana' which had been acquired by the Mauritshuis at the Goldschmidt sale as a Nicholas Maes was in reality a Vermeer. And he would have liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen his conviction. But to leave Paris while Odette was there, and even when she was not there\u2014for in strange places where our sensations have not been numbed by habit, we refresh, we revive an old pain\u2014was for him so cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in his determination never to put it into effect. But it would happen that, while he was asleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him (without his remembering that this particular tour was impossible) and would be realised. One night he dreamed that he was going away for a year; leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the platform who wept as he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade this young man to come away also. The train began to move; he awoke in alarm, and remembered that he was not going away, that he would see Odette that evening, and next day and almost every day. And then, being still deeply moved by his dream, he would thank heaven for those special circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could remain in Odette's vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow him to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages: his social position\u2014his fortune, from which she stood too often in need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture (having even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry her)\u2014his friendship with M. de Charlus, which, it must be confessed, had never won him any very great favour from Odette, but which gave him the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an esteem\u2014and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in weaving, every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not agreeable, at any rate necessary to Odette\u2014he thought of what might have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking, he thought that, if he had been, like so many other men, poor and humble, without resources, forced to undertake any task that might be offered to him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might have been obliged to part from Odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so recent, might well have been true; and he said to himself: \"People don't know when they are happy. They're never so unhappy as they think they are.\" But he reflected that this existence had lasted already for several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it should last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his friends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a meeting which, when it occurred, would bring him no happiness; and he asked himself whether he was not mistaken, whether the circumstances that had favoured their relations and had prevented a final rupture had not done a disservice to his career, whether the outcome to be desired was not that as to which he rejoiced that it happened only in dreams\u2014his own departure; and he said to himself that people did not know when they were unhappy, that they were never so happy as they supposed\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes he hoped that she would die, painlessly, in some accident, she who was out of doors in the streets, crossing busy thoroughfares, from morning to night. And as she always returned safe and sound, he marvelled at the strength, at the suppleness of the human body, which was able continually to hold in check, to outwit all the perils that environed it (which to Swann seemed innumerable, since his own secret desire had strewn them in her path), and so allowed its occupant, the soul, to abandon itself, day after day, and almost with impunity, to its career of mendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. And Swann felt a very cordial sympathy with that Mahomet II whose portrait by Bellini he admired, who, on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of his wives, stabbed her, in order, as his Venetian biographer artlessly relates, to recover his spiritual freedom. Then he would be ashamed of thinking thus only of himself, and his own sufferings would seem to deserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of Odette's very life\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent return, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations his grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would, perhaps, have died. And from the moment when she did not wish to leave Paris for ever he had hoped that she would never go. As he knew that her one prolonged absence, every year, was in August and September, he had abundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissociate from it the grim picture of her absence throughout Eternity which was lodged in him by anticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the days through which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency in his mind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him any intolerable pain. But that conception of the future, that flowing stream, colourless and unconfined, a single word from Odette sufficed to penetrate through all Swann's defences, and like a block of ice immobilised it, congealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and Swann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass which pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain to burst asunder; for Odette had said casually, watching him with a malicious smile: \"Forcheville is going for a fine trip at Whitsuntide. He's going to Egypt!\" and Swann had at once understood that this meant: \"I am going to Egypt at Whitsuntide with Forcheville.\" And, in fact, if, a few days later, Swann began: \"About that trip that you told me you were going to take with Forcheville,\" she would answer carelessly: \"Yes, my dear boy, we're starting on the 19th; we'll send you a 'view' of the Pyramids.\" Then he was determined to know whether she was Forcheville's mistress, to ask her point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. He knew that there were some perjuries which, being so superstitious, she would not commit, and besides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained his curiosity, of making Odette angry if he questioned her, of making himself odious, had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of ever being loved by her\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One day he received an anonymous letter which told him that Odette had been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among them Forcheville, M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9 and the painter) and women, and that she frequented houses of ill-fame. He was tormented by the discovery that there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of sending him such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a familiarity with his private life). He wondered who it could be. But he had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other people, those which had no visible connection with what they said. And when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent character of M. de Charlus, or of M. des Laumes, or of M. d'Orsan that he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might have had its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation with Swann, suggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly disapproved, he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with the character of any one of them more than with the rest. M. de Charlus was somewhat inclined to eccentricity, but he was fundamentally good and kind; M. des Laumes was a trifle dry, but wholesome and straight. As for M. d'Orsan, Swann had never met anyone who, even in the most depressing circumstances, would come to him with a more heartfelt utterance, would act more properly or with more discretion. So much so that he was unable to understand the rather indelicate part commonly attributed to M. d'Orsan in his relations with a certain wealthy woman, and that whenever he thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one side, as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine sincerity and refinement. For a moment Swann felt that his mind was becoming clouded, and he thought of something else so as to recover a little light; until he had the courage to return to those other reflections. But then, after not having been able to suspect anyone, he was forced to suspect everyone that he knew. After all, M. de Charlus might be most fond of him, might be most good-natured; but he was a neuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on hearing that Swann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or carried away by some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury. Really, that kind of man was the worst of all. The Prince des Laumes was, certainly, far less devoted to Swann than was M. de Charlus. But for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to him; and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it was cold, was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. Swann regretted that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people. Then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their neighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort, answer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was, so far as the heart went, that of M. de Charlus. The mere thought of causing Swann so much distress would have been revolting to him. But with a man who was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the Prince des Laumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might be led by the promptings of a different nature? To have a good heart was everything, and M. de Charlus had one. But M. d'Orsan was not lacking in that either, and his relations with Swann\u2014cordial, but scarcely intimate, arising from the pleasure which, as they held the same views about everything, they found in talking together\u2014were more quiescent than the enthusiastic affection of M. de Charlus, who was apt to be led into passionate activity, good or evil. If there was anyone by whom Swann felt that he had always been understood, and (with delicacy) loved, it was M. d'Orsan. Yes, but the life he led; it could hardly be called honourable. Swann regretted that he had never taken any notice of those rumours, that he himself had admitted, jestingly, that he had never felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of respect, as when he was in thoroughly 'detrimental' society. \"It is not for nothing,\" he now assured himself, \"that when people pass judgment upon their neighbour, their finding is based upon his actions. It is those alone that are significant, and not at all what we say or what we think. Charlus and des Laumes may have this or that fault, but they are men of honour. Orsan, perhaps, has not the same faults, but he is not a man of honour. He may have acted dishonourably once again.\" Then he suspected R\u00e9mi, who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now felt himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. To begin with, Loredan had his own reasons for wishing harm to Odette. And then, how were we not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our own, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and vices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own class? He also suspected my grandfather. On every occasion when Swann had asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined? Besides, with his ideas of middle-class respectability, he might have thought that he was acting for Swann's good. He suspected, in turn, Bergotte, the painter, the Verdurins; paused for a moment to admire once again the wisdom of people in society, who refused to mix in the artistic circles in which such things were possible, were, perhaps, even openly avowed, as excellent jokes; but then he recalled the marks of honesty that were to be observed in those Bohemians, and contrasted them with the life of expedients, often bordering on fraudulence, to which the want of money, the craving for luxury, the corrupting influence of their pleasures often drove members of the aristocracy. In a word, this anonymous letter proved that he himself knew a human being capable of the most infamous conduct, but he could see no reason why that infamy should lurk in the depths\u2014which no strange eye might explore\u2014of the warm heart rather than the cold, the artist's rather than the business-man's, the noble's rather than the flunkey's. What criterion ought one to adopt, in order to judge one's fellows? After all, there was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not, in certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful action. Must he then cease to see them all? His mind grew clouded; he passed his hands two or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses with his handkerchief, and remembering that, after all, men who were as good as himself frequented the society of M. de Charlus, the Prince des Laumes and the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that they were incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. And he continued to shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely formal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to drive him to despair. As for the actual contents of the letter, they did not disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated against Odette could he see the least vestige of fact. Like many other men, Swann had a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. He knew quite well as a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the part with which he was. He imagined what was kept secret from him in the light of what was revealed. At such times as he spent with Odette, if their conversation turned upon an indelicate act committed, or an indelicate sentiment expressed by some third person, she would ruthlessly condemn the culprit by virtue of the same moral principles which Swann had always heard expressed by his own parents, and to which he himself had remained loyal; and then, she would arrange her flowers, would sip her tea, would shew an interest in his work. So Swann extended those habits to fill the rest of her life, he reconstructed those actions when he wished to form a picture of the moments in which he and she were apart. If anyone had portrayed her to him as she was, or rather as she had been for so long with himself, but had substituted some other man, he would have been distressed, for such a portrait would have struck him as lifelike. But to suppose that she went to bad houses, that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that she led the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible of mortals\u2014would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation of which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the daily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor place. Only, now and again, he gave Odette to understand that people maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did; and making opportune use of some detail\u2014insignificant but true\u2014which he had accidentally learned, as though it were the sole fragment which he would allow, in spite of himself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which he carried secretly in his mind, he led her to suppose that he was perfectly informed upon matters, which, in reality, he neither knew nor suspected, for if he often adjured Odette never to swerve from or make alteration of the truth, that was only, whether he realised it or no, in order that Odette should tell him everything that she did. No doubt, as he used to assure Odette, he loved sincerity, but only as he might love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his mistress. Moreover, his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had not improved his character. The truth which he cherished was that which Odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to extract that truth from her, was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood, that very falsehood which he never ceased to depict to Odette as leading every human creature down to utter degradation. In a word, he lied as much as did Odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was no less egotistical. And she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the things that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust and, at all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be humiliated, and to be blushing for her actions. One day, after the longest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist without being overtaken by an attack of jealousy, he had accepted an invitation to spend the evening at the theatre with the Princesse des Laumes. Having opened his newspaper to find out what was being played, the sight of the title\u2014Les Filles de Marbre, by Th\u00e9odore Barri\u00e8re,\u2014struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively from it and turned his head away. Illuminated, as though by a row of footlights, in the new surroundings in which it now appeared, that word 'marble,' which he had lost the power to distinguish, so often had it passed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become visible once again, and had at once brought back to his mind the story which Odette had told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the Salon at the Palais d'Industrie with Mme. Verdurin, who had said to her, \"Take care, now! I know how to melt you, all right. You're not made of marble.\" Odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had not attached any importance to it at the time. But he had had more confidence in her then than he had now. And the anonymous letter referred explicitly to relations of that sort. Without daring to lift his eyes to the newspaper, he opened it, turned the page so as not to see again the words, Filles de Marbre, and began to read mechanically the news from the provinces. There had been a storm in the Channel, and damage was reported from Dieppe, Cabourg, Beuzeval.... Suddenly he recoiled again in horror\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The name of Beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the same district, Beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen, a second name, to wit Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, which he had often seen on maps, but without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that borne by his friend M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, whom the anonymous letter accused of having been Odette's lover. After all, when it came to M. de Br\u00e9aut\u00e9, there was nothing improbable in the charge; but so far as Mme. Verdurin was concerned, it was a sheer impossibility. From the fact that Odette did occasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never, by any chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations with Mme. Verdurin which she herself had repeated to Swann, he could recognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their inexperience of life and ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby certifying their own innocence), who\u2014as, for instance, Odette,\u2014would be the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one another. Whereas, on the other hand, the indignation with which she had scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into being, for a moment, in his mind by her story, fitted in with everything that he knew of the tastes, the temperament of his mistress. But at that moment, by an inspiration of jealousy, analogous to the inspiration which reveals to a poet or a philosopher, who has nothing, so far, but an odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation, the idea or the natural law which will give power, mastery to his work, Swann recalled for the first time a remark which Odette had made to him, at least two years before: \"Oh, Mme. Verdurin, she won't hear of anything just now but me. I'm a 'love,' if you please, and she kisses me, and wants me to go with her everywhere, and call her by her Christian name.\" So far from seeing in these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations, intended to create an atmosphere of vice, which Odette had since repeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of Mme. Verdurin's warm-hearted and generous friendship. But now this old memory of her affection for Odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory of her unseemly conversation. He could no longer separate them in his mind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection imparting a certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which, in return, spoiled the affection of its innocence. He went to see Odette. He sat down, keeping at a distance from her. He did not dare to embrace her, not knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or anger that a kiss would provoke. He sat there silent, watching their love expire. Suddenly he made up his mind\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Odette, my darling,\" he began, \"I know, I am being simply odious, but I must ask you a few questions. You remember what I once thought about you and Mme. Verdurin? Tell me, was it true? Have you, with her or anyone else, ever?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She shook her head, pursing her lips together; a sign which people commonly employ to signify that they are not going, because it would bore them to go, when some one has asked, \"Are you coming to watch the procession go by?\", or \"Will you be at the review?\". But this shake of the head, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in an event that has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of uncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past. Furthermore, it suggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than any definite repudiation, any moral impossibility. When he saw Odette thus make him a sign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it was quite possibly true\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I have told you, I never did; you know quite well,\" she added, seeming angry and uncomfortable\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Yes, I know all that; but are you quite sure? Don't say to me, 'You know quite well'; say, 'I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.'\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she hoped, thereby, to be rid of him: \"I have never done anything of that sort with any woman.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Can you swear it to me on your Laghetto medal?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann knew that Odette would never perjure herself on that\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, you do make me so miserable,\" she cried, with a jerk of her body as though to shake herself free of the constraint of his question. \"Have you nearly done? What is the matter with you to-day? You seem to have made up your mind that I am to be forced to hate you, to curse you! Look, I was anxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice time together, like the old days; and this is all the thanks I get!\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0However, he would not let her go, but sat there like a surgeon who waits for a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not make him abandon it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You are quite wrong in supposing that I bear you the least ill-will in the world, Odette,\" he began with a persuasive and deceitful gentleness. \"I never speak to you except of what I already know, and I always know a great deal more than I say. But you alone can mollify by your confession what makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by other people. My anger with you is never due to your actions\u2014I can and do forgive you everything because I love you\u2014but to your untruthfulness, the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in denying things which I know to be true. How can you expect that I shall continue to love you, when I see you maintain, when I hear you swear to me a thing which I know to be false? Odette, do not prolong this moment which is torturing us both. If you are willing to end it at once, you shall be free of it for ever. Tell me, upon your medal, yes or no, whether you have ever done those things.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"How on earth can I tell?\" she was furious. \"Perhaps I have, ever so long ago, when I didn't know what I was doing, perhaps two or three times.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann had prepared himself for all possibilities. Reality must, therefore, be something which bears no relation to possibilities, any more than the stab of a knife in one's body bears to the gradual movement of the clouds overhead, since those words \"two or three times\" carved, as it were, a cross upon the living tissues of his heart. A strange thing, indeed, that those words, \"two or three times,\" nothing more than a few words, words uttered in the air, at a distance, could so lacerate a man's heart, as if they had actually pierced it, could sicken a man, like a poison that he had drunk. Instinctively Swann thought of the remark that he had heard at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's: \"I have never seen anything to beat it since the table-turning.\" The agony that he now suffered in no way resembled what he had supposed. Not only because, in the hours when he most entirely mistrusted her, he had rarely imagined such a culmination of evil, but because, even when he did imagine that offence, it remained vague, uncertain, was not clothed in the particular horror which had escaped with the words \"perhaps two or three times,\" was not armed with that specific cruelty, as different from anything that he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first time. And yet this Odette, from whom all this evil sprang, was no less dear to him, was, on the contrary, more precious, as if, in proportion as his sufferings increased, there increased at the same time the price of the sedative, of the antidote which this woman alone possessed. He wished to pay her more attention, as one attends to a disease which one discovers, suddenly, to have grown more serious. He wished that the horrible thing which, she had told him, she had done \"two or three times\" might be prevented from occurring again. To ensure that, he must watch over Odette. People often say that, by pointing out to a man the faults of his mistress, you succeed only in strengthening his attachment to her, because he does not believe you; yet how much more so if he does! But, Swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? He might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how insane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when he had failed to find Odette at the Verdurins') to desire the possession\u2014as if that were ever possible\u2014of another person. Happily for Swann, beneath the mass of suffering which had invaded his soul like a conquering horde of barbarians, there lay a natural foundation, older, more placid, and silently laborious, like the cells of an injured organ which at once set to work to repair the damaged tissues, or the muscles of a paralysed limb which tend to recover their former movements. These older, these autochthonous in-dwellers in his soul absorbed all Swann's strength, for a while, in that obscure task of reparation which gives one an illusory sense of repose during convalescence, or after an operation. This time it was not so much\u2014as it ordinarily was\u2014in Swann's brain that the slackening of tension due to exhaustion took effect, it was rather in his heart. But all the things in life that have once existed tend to recur, and, like a dying animal that is once more stirred by the throes of a convulsion which was, apparently, ended, upon Swann's heart, spared for a moment only, the same agony returned of its own accord to trace the same cross again. He remembered those moonlit evenings, when, leaning back in the victoria that was taking him to the Rue La P\u00e9rouse, he would cultivate with voluptuous enjoyment the emotions of a man in love, ignorant of the poisoned fruit that such emotions must inevitably bear. But all those thoughts lasted for no more than a second, the time that it took him to raise his hand to his heart, to draw breath again and to contrive to smile, so as to dissemble his torment. Already he had begun to put further questions. For his jealousy, which had taken an amount of trouble, such as no enemy would have incurred, to strike him this mortal blow, to make him forcibly acquainted with the most cruel pain that he had ever known, his jealousy was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to expose his bosom to an even deeper wound. Like an evil deity, his jealousy was inspiring Swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. It was not his fault, but Odette's alone, if at first his punishment was not more severe\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My darling,\" he began again, \"it's all over now; was it with anyone I know?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I swear it wasn't; besides, I think I exaggerated, I never really went as far as that.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He smiled, and resumed with: \"Just as you like. It doesn't really matter, but it's unfortunate that you can't give me any name. If I were able to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking of her again. I say it for your own sake, because then I shouldn't bother you any more about it. It's so soothing to be able to form a clear picture of things in one's mind. What is really terrible is what one cannot imagine. But you've been so sweet to me; I don't want to tire you. I do thank you, with all my heart, for all the good that you have done me. I've quite finished now. Only one word more: how many times?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, Charles! can't you see, you're killing me? It's all ever so long ago. I've never given it a thought. Anyone would say that you were positively trying to put those ideas into my head again. And then you'd be a lot better off!\" she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with intentional malice\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I only wished to know whether it had been since I knew you. It's only natural. Did it happen here, ever? You can't give me any particular evening, so that I can remind myself what I was doing at the time? You understand, surely, that it's not possible that you don't remember with whom, Odette, my love.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"But I don't know; really, I don't. I think it was in the Bois, one evening when you came to meet us on the Island. You had been dining with the Princesse des Laumes,\" she added, happy to be able to furnish him with an exact detail, which testified to her veracity. \"At the next table there was a woman whom I hadn't seen for ever so long. She said to me, 'Come along round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight on the water!' At first I just yawned, and said, 'No, I'm too tired, and I'm quite happy where I am, thank you.' She swore there'd never been anything like it in the way of moonlight. 'I've heard that tale before,' I said to her; you see, I knew quite well what she was after.\" Odette narrated this episode almost as if it were a joke, either because it appeared to her to be quite natural, or because she thought that she was thereby minimising its importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed. But, catching sight of Swann's face, she changed her tone, and:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You are a fiend!\" she flung at him, \"you enjoy tormenting me, making me tell you lies, just so that you'll leave me in peace.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This second blow struck at Swann was even more excruciating than the first. Never had he supposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden from his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past which he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered, which he had lived through with Odette, of which he had supposed himself to have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now assumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty. In the midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on the Island in the Bois de Boulogne. Without being intelligent, Odette had the charm of being natural. She had recounted, she had acted the little scene with so much simplicity that Swann, as he gasped for breath, could vividly see it: Odette yawning, the \"rock there,\"... He could hear her answer\u2014alas, how lightheartedly\u2014\"I've heard that tale before!\" He felt that she would tell him nothing more that evening, that no further revelation was to be expected for the present. He was silent for a time, then said to her:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"My poor darling, you must forgive me; I know, I am hurting you dreadfully, but it's all over now; I shall never think of it again.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But she saw that his eyes remained fixed upon the things that he did not know, and on that past era of their love, monotonous and soothing in his memory because it was vague, and now rent, as with a sword-wound, by the news of that minute on the Island in the Bois, by moonlight, while he was dining with the Princesse des Laumes. But he had so far acquired the habit of finding life interesting\u2014of marvelling at the strange discoveries that there were to be made in it\u2014that even while he was suffering so acutely that he did not believe it possible to endure such agony for any length of time, he was saying to himself: \"Life is indeed astonishing, and holds some fine surprises; it appears that vice is far more common than one has been led to believe. Here is a woman in whom I had absolute confidence, who looks so simple, so honest, who, in any case, even allowing that her morals are not strict, seemed quite normal and healthy in her tastes and inclinations. I receive a most improbable accusation, I question her, and the little that she admits reveals far more than I could ever have suspected.\" But he could not confine himself to these detached observations. He sought to form an exact estimate of the importance of what she had just told him, so as to know whether he might conclude that she had done these things often, and was likely to do them again. He repeated her words to himself: \"I knew quite well what she was after.\" \"Two or three times.\" \"I've heard that tale before.\" But they did not reappear in his memory unarmed; each of them held a knife with which it stabbed him afresh. For a long time, like a sick man who cannot restrain himself from attempting, every minute, to make the movement that, he knows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself: \"I'm quite happy where I am, thank you,\" \"I've heard that tale before,\" but the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop. He was amazed to find that actions which he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly, had dismissed, indeed, with a laugh, should have become as serious to him as a disease which might easily prove fatal. He knew any number of women whom he could ask to keep an eye on Odette, but how was he to expect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view, and not to remain at that which for so long had been his own, which had always guided him in his voluptuous existence; not to say to him with a smile: \"You jealous monster, wanting to rob other people of their pleasure!\" By what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he (who had never found, in the old days, in his love for Odette, any but the most refined of pleasures) been precipitated into this new circle of hell from which he could not see how he was ever to escape. Poor Odette! He wished her no harm. She was but half to blame. Had he not been told that it was her own mother who had sold her, when she was still little more than a child, at Nice, to a wealthy Englishman? But what an agonising truth was now contained for him in those lines of Alfred de Vigny's Journal d'un Po\u00e8te which he had previously read without emotion: \"When one feels oneself smitten by love for a woman, one ought to say to oneself, 'What are 'her surroundings? What has been her life?' All one's future happiness lies in the answer.\" Swann was astonished that such simple phrases, spelt over in his mind as, \"I've heard that tale before,\" or \"I knew quite well what she was after,\" could cause him so much pain. But he realised that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt while Odette was telling her story. For it was the same anguish that he now was feeling afresh. It was no good, his knowing now,\u2014indeed, it was no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten and altogether forgiven the offence\u2014whenever he repeated her words his old anguish refashioned him as he had been before Odette began to speak: ignorant, trustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that he might be effectively wounded by Odette's admission, in the position of a man who does not yet know the truth; and after several months this old story would still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. He marvelled at the terrible recreative power of his memory. It was only by the weakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age creeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments. But, as soon as the power that any one of Odette's sentences had to make Swann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, lo and behold another, one of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a new sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him with undiminished force. The memory of the evening on which he had dined with the Princesse des Laumes was painful to him, but it was no more than the centre, the core of his pain. That radiated vaguely round about it, overflowing into all the preceding and following days. And on whatever point in it he might intend his memory to rest, it was the whole of that season, during which the Verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the Island in the Bois, that sprang back to hurt him. So violently, that by slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it. He recognised that all the period of Odette's life which had elapsed before she first met him, a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind, was not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see, but had consisted of so many definite, dated years, each crowded with concrete incidents. But were he to learn more of them, he feared lest her past, now colourless, fluid and supportable, might assume a tangible, an obscene form, with individual and diabolical features. And he continued to refrain from seeking a conception of it, not any longer now from laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. He hoped that, some day, he might be able to hear the Island in the Bois, or the Princesse des Laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain; meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke Odette into furnishing him with fresh sentences, with the names of more places and people and of different events, which, when his malady was still scarcely healed, would make it break out again in another form\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded, now, to learn, it was Odette herself who, spontaneously and without thought of what she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life which Swann had believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead, was far wider than she knew. A vicious person, always affecting the same air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any suspicion of his vices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which he may ascertain how far those vices (their continuous growth being imperceptible by himself) have gradually segregated him from the normal ways of life. In the course of their cohabitation, in Odette's mind, with the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from Swann, her other, her innocuous actions were gradually coloured, infected by these, without her being able to detect anything strange in them, without their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself in which she made them live, but when she related them to Swann, he was overwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed. One day, he was trying\u2014without hurting Odette\u2014to discover from her whether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses. He was, as a matter of fact, convinced that she had not; the anonymous letter had put the idea into his mind, but in a purely mechanical way; it had been received there with no credulity, but it had, for all that, remained there, and Swann, wishing to be rid of the burden\u2014a dead weight, but none the less disturbing\u2014of this suspicion, hoped that Odette would now extirpate it for ever\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh dear, no! Not that they don't simply persecute me to go to them,\" her smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it was impossible should appear legitimate to Swann. \"There was one of them waited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any money I asked. It seems, there's an Ambassador who said to her, 'I'll kill myself if you don't bring her to me'\u2014meaning me! They told her I'd gone out, but she waited and waited, and in the end I had to go myself and speak to her, before she'd go away. I do wish you could have seen the way I tackled her; my maid was in the next room, listening, and told me I shouted fit to bring the house down:\u2014'But when you hear me say that I don't want to! The idea of such a thing, I don't like it at all! I should hope I'm still free to do as I please and when I please and where I please! If I needed the money, I could understand...' The porter has orders not to let her in again; he will tell her that I am out of town. Oh, I do wish I could have had you hidden somewhere in the room while I was talking to her. I know, you'd have been pleased, my dear. There's some good in your little Odette, you see, after all, though people do say such dreadful things about her.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Besides, her very admissions\u2014when she made any\u2014of faults which she supposed him to have discovered, rather served Swann as a starting-point for fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. For her admissions never exactly coincided with his doubts. In vain might Odette expurgate her confession of all its essential part, there would remain in the accessories something which Swann had never yet imagined, which crushed him anew, and was to enable him to alter the terms of the problem of his jealousy. And these admissions he could never forget. His spirit carried them along, cast them aside, then cradled them again in its bosom, like corpses in a river. And they poisoned it\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0She spoke to him once of a visit that Forcheville had paid her on the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate. \"What! you knew him as long ago as that? Oh, yes, of course you did,\" he corrected himself, so as not to shew that he had been ignorant of the fact. And suddenly he began to tremble at the thought that, on the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate, when he had received that letter which he had so carefully preserved, she had been having luncheon, perhaps, with Forcheville at the Maison d'Or. She swore that she had not. \"Still, the Maison d'Or reminds me of something or other which, I knew at the time, wasn't true,\" he pursued, hoping to frighten her. \"Yes that I hadn't been there at all that evening when I told you I had just come from there, and you had been looking for me at Pr\u00e9vost's,\" she replied (judging by his manner that he knew) with a firmness that was based not so much upon cynicism as upon timidity, a fear of crossing Swann, which her own self-respect made her anxious to conceal, and a desire to shew him that she could be perfectly frank if she chose. And so she struck him with all the sharpness and force of a headsman wielding his axe, and yet could not be charged with cruelty, since she was quite unconscious of hurting him; she even began to laugh, though this may perhaps, it is true, have been chiefly to keep him from thinking that she was ashamed, at all, or confused. \"It's quite true, I hadn't been to the Maison Dor\u00e9e. I was coming away from Forcheville's. I had, really, been to Pr\u00e9vost's\u2014that wasn't a story\u2014and he met me there and asked me to come in and look at his prints. But some one else came to see him. I told you that I was coming from the Maison d'Or because I was afraid you might be angry with me. It was rather nice of me, really, don't you see? I admit, I did wrong, but at least I'm telling you all about it now, a'n't I? What have I to gain by not telling you, straight, that I lunched with him on the day of the Paris-Murcie F\u00eate, if it were true? Especially as at that time we didn't know one another quite so well as we do now, did we, dear?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He smiled back at her with the sudden, craven weakness of the utterly spiritless creature which these crushing words had made of him. And so, even in the months of which he had never dared to think again, because they had been too happy, in those months when she had loved him, she was already lying to him! Besides that moment (that first evening on which they had \"done a cattleya\") when she had told him that she was coming from the Maison Dor\u00e9e, how many others must there have been, each of them covering a falsehood of which Swann had had no suspicion. He recalled how she had said to him once: \"I need only tell Mme. Verdurin that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.\" From himself too, probably, many times when she had glibly uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the hour fixed for a meeting, those moments must have hidden, without his having the least inkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had had with some other man, some man to whom she had said: \"I need only tell Swann that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. There is always some excuse.\" And beneath all his most pleasant memories, beneath the simplest words that Odette had ever spoken to him in those old days, words which he had believed as though they were the words of a Gospel, beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him, beneath the most ordinary places, her dressmaker's flat, the Avenue du Bois, the Hippodrome, he could feel (dissembled there, by virtue of that temporal superfluity which, after the most detailed account of how a day has been spent, always leaves something over, that may serve as a hiding place for certain unconfessed actions), he could feel the insinuation of a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that had remained most precious, his happiest evenings, the Rue La P\u00e9rouse itself, which Odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours than those of which she told him; extending the power of the dark horror that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to the Maison Dor\u00e9e, and, like the obscene creatures in the 'Desolation of Nineveh,' shattering, stone by stone, the whole edifice of his past.... If, now, he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of the Maison Dor\u00e9e it was because that name recalled to him, no longer, as, such a little time since, at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's party, the good fortune which he long had lost, but a misfortune of which he was now first aware. Then it befell the Maison Dor\u00e9e, as it had befallen the Island in the Bois, that gradually its name ceased to trouble him. For what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy are, neither of them, single, continuous and individual passions. They are composed of an infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each of which is ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. The life of Swann's love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of infidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which had Odette for their object. If he had remained for any length of time without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by others. But the presence of Odette continued to sow in Swann's heart alternate seeds of love and suspicion\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of which she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage, under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must instantly accompany her home, to \"do a cattleya,\" and the desire which she pretended to have for him was so sudden, so inexplicable, so imperious, the kisses which she lavished on him were so demonstrative and so unfamiliar, that this brutal and unnatural fondness made Swann just as unhappy as any lie or unkind action. One evening when he had thus, in obedience to her command, gone home with her, and while she was interspersing her kisses with passionate words, in strange contrast to her habitual coldness, he thought suddenly that he heard a sound; he rose, searched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage to return to his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering rage, broke a vase, with \"I never can do anything right with you, you impossible person!\" And he was left uncertain whether she had not actually had some man concealed in the room, whose jealousy she had wished to wound, or else to inflame his senses\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes he repaired to 'gay' houses, hoping to learn something about Odette, although he dared not mention her name. \"I have a little thing here, you're sure to like,\" the 'manageress' would greet him, and he would stay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who sat there astonished that he went no further. One of them, who was still quite young and attractive, said to him once, \"Of course, what I should like would be to find a real friend, then he might be quite certain, I should never go with any other men again.\" \"Indeed, do you think it possible for a woman really to be touched by a man's being in love with her, and never to be unfaithful to him?\" asked Swann anxiously. \"Why, surely! It all depends on their characters!\" Swann could not help making the same remarks to these girls as would have delighted the Princesse des Laumes. To the one who was in search of a friend he said, with a smile: \"But how nice of you, you've put on blue eyes, to go with your sash.\" \"And you too, you've got blue cuffs on.\" \"What a charming conversation we are having, for a place of this sort! I'm not boring you, am I; or keeping you?\" \"No, I've nothing to do, thank you. If you bored me I should say so. But I love hearing you talk.\" \"I am highly flattered.... Aren't we behaving prettily?\" he asked the 'manageress,' who had just looked in. \"Why, yes, that's just what I was saying to myself, how sensibly they're behaving! But that's how it is! People come to my house now, just to talk. The Prince was telling me, only the other day, that he's far more comfortable here than with his wife. It seems that, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect scandal, I call it. But I'll leave you in peace now, I know when I'm not wanted,\" she ended discreetly, and left Swann with the girl who had the blue eyes. But presently he rose and said good-bye to her. She had ceased to interest him. She did not know Odette\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The painter having been ill, Dr. Cottard recommended a sea-voyage; several of the 'faithful' spoke of accompanying him; the Verdurins could not face the prospect of being left alone in Paris, so first of all hired, and finally purchased a yacht; thus Odette was constantly going on a cruise. Whenever she had been away for any length of time, Swann would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance between them, whenever he heard that Odette had returned to Paris, he could not rest without seeing her. Once, when they had gone away, as everyone thought, for a month only, either they succumbed to a series of temptations, or else M. Verdurin had cunningly arranged everything beforehand, to please his wife, and disclosed his plans to the 'faithful' only as time went on; anyhow, from Algiers they flitted to Tunis; then to Italy, Greece, Constantinople, Asia Minor. They had been absent for nearly a year, and Swann felt perfectly at ease and almost happy. Albeit M. Verdurin had endeavoured to persuade the pianist and Dr. Cottard that their respective aunt and patients had no need of them, and that, in any event, it was most rash to allow Mme. Cottard to return to Paris, where, Mme. Verdurin assured him, a revolution had just broken out, he was obliged to grant them their liberty at Constantinople. And the painter came home with them. One day, shortly after the return of these four travellers, Swann, seeing an omnibus approach him, labelled 'Luxembourg,' and having some business there, had jumped on to it and had found himself sitting opposite Mme. Cottard, who was paying a round of visits to people whose 'day' it was, in full review order, with a plume in her hat, a silk dress, a muff, an umbrella (which do for a parasol if the rain kept off), a card-case, and a pair of white gloves fresh from the cleaners. Wearing these badges of rank, she would, in fine weather, go on foot from one house to another in the same neighbourhood, but when she had to proceed to another district, would make use of a transfer-ticket on the omnibus. For the first minute or two, until the natural courtesy of the woman broke through the starched surface of the doctor's-wife, not being certain, either, whether she ought to mention the Verdurins before Swann, she produced, quite naturally, in her slow and awkward, but not unattractive voice, which, every now and then, was completely drowned by the rattling of the omnibus, topics selected from those which she had picked up and would repeat in each of the score of houses up the stairs of which she clambered in the course of an afternoon\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I needn't ask you, M. Swann, whether a man so much in the movement as yourself has been to the Mirlitons, to see the portrait by Machard that the whole of Paris is running after. Well, and what do you think of it? Whose camp are you in, those who bless or those who curse? It's the same in every house in Paris now, no one will speak of anything else but Machard's portrait; you aren't smart, you aren't really cultured, you aren't up-to-date unless you give an opinion on Machard's portrait.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann having replied that he had not seen this portrait, Mme. Cottard was afraid that she might have hurt his feelings by obliging him to confess the omission\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Oh, that's quite all right! At least you have the courage to be quite frank about it. You don't consider yourself disgraced because you haven't seen Machard's portrait. I do think that so nice of you. Well now, I have seen it; opinion is divided, you know, there are some people who find it rather laboured, like whipped cream, they say; but I think it's just ideal. Of course, she's not a bit like the blue and yellow ladies that our friend Biche paints. That's quite clear. But I must tell you, perfectly frankly (you'll think me dreadfully old-fashioned, but I always say just what I think), that I don't understand his work. I can quite see the good points there are in his portrait of my husband; oh, dear me, yes; and it's certainly less odd than most of what he does, but even then he had to give the poor man a blue moustache! But Machard! Just listen to this now, the husband of my friend, I am on my way to see at this very moment (which has given me the very great pleasure of your company), has promised her that, if he is elected to the Academy (he is one of the Doctor's colleagues), he will get Machard to paint her portrait. So she's got something to look forward to! I have another friend who insists that she'd rather have Leloir. I'm only a wretched Philistine, and I've no doubt Leloir has perhaps more knowledge of painting even than Machard. But I do think that the most important thing about a portrait, especially when it's going to cost ten thousand francs, is that it should be like, and a pleasant likeness, if you know what I mean.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having exhausted this topic, to which she had been inspired by the loftiness of her plume, the monogram on her card-case, the little number inked inside each of her gloves by the cleaner, and the difficulty of speaking to Swann about the Verdurins, Mme. Cottard, seeing that they had still a long way to go before they would reach the corner of the Rue Bonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the promptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Your ears must have been burning,\" she ventured, \"while we were on the yacht with Mme. Verdurin. We were talking about you all the time.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Swann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never uttered in the Verdurins' presence\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"You see,\" Mme. Cottard went on, \"Mme. de Cr\u00e9cy was there; need I say more? When Odette is anywhere it's never long before she begins talking about you. And you know quite well, it isn't nasty things she says. What! you don't believe me!\" she went on, noticing that Svrann looked sceptical. And, carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, without putting any evil meaning into the word, which she used purely in the sense in which one employs it to speak of the affection that unites a pair of friends: \"Why, she adores you! No, indeed; I'm sure it would never do to say anything against you when she was about; one would soon be taught one's place! Whatever we might be doing, if we were looking at a picture, for instance, she would say, 'If only we had him here, he's the man who could tell us whether it's genuine or not. There's no one like him for that.' And all day long she would be saying, 'What can he be doing just now? I do hope, he's doing a little work! It's too dreadful that a fellow with such gifts as he has should be so lazy.' (Forgive me, won't you.) 'I can see him this very moment; he's thinking of us, he's wondering where we are.' Indeed, she used an expression which I thought very pretty at the time. M. Verdurin asked her, 'How in the world can you see what he's doing, when he's a thousand miles away?' And Odette answered, 'Nothing is impossible to the eye of a friend.'\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"No, I assure you, I'm not saying it just to flatter you; you have a true friend in her, such as one doesn't often find. I can tell you, besides, in case you don't know it, that you're the only one. Mme. Verdurin told me as much herself on our last day with them (one talks more freely, don't you know, before a parting), 'I don't say that Odette isn't fond of us, but anything that we may say to her counts for very little beside what Swann might say.' Oh, mercy, there's the conductor stopping for me; here have I been chatting away to you, and would have gone right past the Rue Bonaparte, and never noticed... Will you be so very kind as to tell me whether my plume is straight?\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And Mme. Cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to Swann, a white-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transier-ticket, an atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. And Swann felt himself overflowing with gratitude to her, as well as to Mme. Verdurin (and almost to Odette, for the feeling that he now entertained for her was no longer tinged with pain, was scarcely even to be described, now, as love), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with loving eyes, as she gallantly threaded her way along the Rue Bonaparte, her plume erect, her skirt held up in one hand, while in the other she clasped her umbrella and her card-case, so that its monogram could be seen, her muff dancing in the air before her as she went\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To compete with and so to stimulate the moribund feelings that Swann had for Odette, Mme. Cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever her husband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal, feelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in Swann's mind were to make Odette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women could inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final transformation back into that Odette, loved with an undisturbed affection, who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the painter's, to drink orangeade with Forcheville, that Odette with whom Swann had calculated that he might live in happiness\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come when he would cease to be in love with Odette, he had determined to keep a sharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to escape him, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. But now, to the faintness of his love there corresponded a simultaneous faintness in his desire to remain her lover. For a man cannot change, that is to say become another person, while he continues to obey the dictates of the self which he has ceased to be. Occasionally the name, if it caught his eye in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been Odette's lovers, reawakened his jealousy. But it was very slight, and, inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from that period in which he had so keenly suffered\u2014though in it he had also known a way of feeling so intensely happy\u2014and that the accidents of his course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily and at a distance, of its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything, an agreeable thrill, as to the sad Parisian, when he has left Venice behind him and must return to France, a last mosquito proves that Italy and summer are still not too remote. But, as a rule, with this particular period of his life from which he was emerging, when he made an effort, if not to remain in it, at least to obtain, while still he might, an uninterrupted view of it, he discovered that already it was too late; he would have looked back to distinguish, as it might be a landscape that was about to disappear, that love from which he had departed, but it is so difficult to enter into a state of complete duality and to present to oneself the lifelike spectacle of a feeling which one has ceased to possess, that very soon, the clouds gathering in his brain, he could see nothing, he would abandon the attempt, would take the glasses from his nose and wipe them; and he told himself that he would do better to rest for a little, that there would be time enough later on, and settled back into his corner with as little curiosity, with as much torpor as the drowsy traveller who pulls his cap down over his eyes so as to get some sleep in the railway-carriage that is drawing him, he feels, faster and faster, out of the country in which he has lived for so long, and which he vowed that he would not allow to slip away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. Indeed, like the same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the frontier and is again in France, when Swann happened to alight, close at hand, upon something which proved that Forcheville had been Odette's lover, he discovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now utterly remote, and he regretted that he had had no warning of the moment in which he had emerged from it for ever. And just as, before kissing Odette for the first time, he had sought to imprint upon his memory the face that for so long had been familiar, before it was altered by the additional memory of their kiss, so he could have wished\u2014in thought at least\u2014to have been in a position to bid farewell, while she still existed, to that Odette who had inspired love in him and jealousy, to that Odette who had caused him so to suffer, and whom now he would never see again. He was mistaken. He was destined to see her once again, a few weeks later. It was while he was asleep, in the twilight of a dream. He was walking with Mme. Verdurin, Dr. Cottard, a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter, Odette, Napoleon III and my grandfather, along a path which followed the line of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a few feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of the party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was failing, and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them. Now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and Swann could feel on his cheek a shower of freezing spray. Odette told him to wipe this off, but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as well as because he was in his nightshirt. He hoped that, in the darkness, this might pass unnoticed; Mme. Verdurin, however, fixed her astonished gaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change its shape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy moustache. He turned away to examine Odette; her cheeks were pale, with little fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she looked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach themselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him at once. Suddenly Odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch, and said: \"I must go.\" She took leave of everyone, in the same formal manner, without taking Swann aside, without telling him where they were to meet that evening, or next day. He dared not ask, he would have liked to follow her, he was obliged, without turning back in her direction, to answer with a smile some question by Mme. Verdurin; but his heart was frantically beating, he felt that he now hated Odette, he would gladly have crushed those eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly, have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks. He continued to climb with Mme. Verdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from Odette, who was going downhill, and in the other direction. A second passed and it was many hours since she had left him. The painter remarked to Swann that Napoleon III had eclipsed himself immediately after Odette. \"They had obviously arranged it between them,\" he added; \"they must have agreed to meet at the foot of the cliff, but they wouldn't say good-bye together; it might have looked odd. She is his mistress.\" The strange young man burst into tears. Swann endeavoured to console him. \"After all, she is quite right,\" he said to the young man, drying his eyes for him and taking off the fez to make him feel more at ease. \"I've advised her to do that, myself, a dozen times. Why be so distressed? He was obviously the man to understand her.\" So Swann reasoned with himself, for the young man whom he had failed, at first, to identify, was himself also; like certain novelists, he had distributed his own personality between two characters, him who was the 'first person' in the dream, and another whom he saw before him, capped with a fez\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for Napoleon III, it was to Forcheville that some vague association of ideas, then a certain modification of the Baron's usual physiognomy, and lastly the broad ribbon of the Legion of Honour across his breast, had made Swann give that name; but actually, and in everything that the person who appeared in his dream represented and recalled to him, it was indeed Forcheville. For, from an incomplete and changing set of images, Swann in his sleep drew false deductions, enjoying, at the same time, such creative power that he was able to reproduce himself by a simple act of division, like certain lower organisms; with the warmth that he felt in his own palm he modelled the hollow of a strange hand which he thought that he was clasping, and out of feelings and impressions of which he was not yet conscious, he brought about sudden vicissitudes which, by a chain of logical sequences, would produce, at definite points in his dream, the person required to receive his love or to startle him awake. In an instant night grew black about him; an alarum rang, the inhabitants ran past him, escaping from their blazing houses; he could hear the thunder of the surging waves, and also of his own heart, which, with equal violence, was anxiously beating in his breast. Suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled, he felt a pain, a nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant, dreadfully burned, flung at him as he passed: \"Come and ask Charlus where Odette spent the night with her friend. He used to go about with her, and she tells him everything. It was they that started the fire.\" It was his valet, come to awaken him, and saying:\u2014\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Sir, it is eight o'clock, and the barber is here. I have told him to call again in an hour.\"\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which Swann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing that refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of water, into another sun; just as, a moment earlier, the sound of the door-bell, swelling in the depths of his abyss of sleep into the clangour of an alarum, had engendered the episode of the fire. Meanwhile the scenery of his dream-stage scattered in dust, he opened his eyes, heard for the last time the boom of a wave in the sea, grown very distant. He touched his cheek. It was dry. And yet he could feel the sting of the cold spray, and the taste of salt on his lips. He rose, and dressed himself. He had made the barber come early because he had written, the day before, to my grandfather, to say that he was going, that afternoon, to Combray, having learned that Mme. de Cambremer\u2014Mlle. Legrandin that had been\u2014was spending a few days there. The association in his memory of her young and charming face with a place in the country which he had not visited for so long, offered him a combined attraction which had made him decide at last to leave Paris for a while. As the different changes and chances that bring us into the company of certain other people in this life do not coincide with the periods in which we are in love with those people, but, overlapping them, may occur before love has begun, and may be repeated after love is ended, the earliest appearances, in our life, of a creature who is destined to afford us pleasure later on, assume retrospectively in our eyes a certain value as an indication, a warning, a presage. It was in this fashion that Swann had often carried back his mind to the image of Odette, encountered in the theatre, on that first evening when he had no thought of ever seeing her again\u2014and that he now recalled the party at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's, at which he had introduced General de Frober-ville to Mme. de Cambremer. So manifold are our interests in life that it is not uncommon that, on a single occasion, the foundations of a happiness which does not yet exist are laid down simultaneously with aggravations of a grief from which we are still suffering. And, no doubt, that might have occurred to Swann elsewhere than at Mme. de Saint-Euverte's. Who, indeed, can say whether, in the event of his having gone, that evening, somewhere else, other happinesses, other griefs would not have come to him, which, later, would have appeared to have been inevitable? But what did seem to him to have been inevitable was what had indeed taken place, and he was not far short of seeing something providential in the fact that he had at last decided to go to Mme. de Saint-Euverte's that evening, because his mind, anxious to admire the richness of invention that life shews, and incapable of facing a difficult problem for any length of time, such as to discover what, actually, had been most to be wished for, came to the conclusion that the sufferings through which he had passed that evening, and the pleasures, at that time unsuspected, which were already being brought to birth,\u2014the exact balance between which was too difficult to establish\u2014were linked by a sort of concatenation of necessity\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions to the barber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become disarranged on the journey, he thought once again of his dream; he saw once again, as he had felt them close beside him, Odette's pallid complexion, her too thin cheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all the things which\u2014in the course of those successive bursts of affection which had made of his enduring love for Odette a long oblivion of the first impression that he had formed of her\u2014he had ceased to observe after the first few days of their intimacy, days to which, doubtless, while he slept, his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of those things. And with that old, intermittent fatuity, which reappeared in him now that he was no longer unhappy, and lowered, at the same time, the average level of his morality, he cried out in his heart: \"To think that I have wasted years of my life, that I have longed for death, that the greatest love that I have ever known has been for a woman who did not please me, who was not in my style!\"1Embed"},

went straight to another woman\nThat I thought wanted me\nBut when she had found out I had lost you\nShe got cold as she could be\nShe said as much, she was concerned\nThat uh, we were through\nAnd I might as well turn around, and go back to you\n[Chorus]\nSo I'm standin\u2019 here knockin', baby\n(Standin' here knockin') (Standin' here knockin')\nPlease, let me in\n(Standin' here knockin')

fought for my daily dollar like a man\nThen you came into my life\nAnd nothing else seemed real\nI found the answer right here in my hands\nNow I've got everything a man could ever need\nI've got dreams to dream and songs to sing\nIn the morning\nI've got hands to hold my baby-child\nAnd eyes to watch my woman smile\nI've got everything a man could ever need\n\nNow my working days seem shorter\nThan they ever did before\nAnd the evening breeze gets cooler day by day\nAnd the morning sun is always shining\nDown on my backdoor\nAnd your laughter washes all my tears away\n\nAnd there's not a day goes by\nWhen I don't look up to the sky\nAnd humbly thank the good Lord up above\nFor bringing you to me in time\nTo make me realize\nThat all a poor man really needs is love\n\nNow I've got everything a man could ever need\nI've got dreams to dream and songs to sing\nIn the morning\nI've got hands to hold my baby-child\nAnd eyes to watch my woman smile\nI've got everything a man

used to be\n\nHow's your new love?\nAre you happy?\nHope your doin' fine\nJust to know it\nMeans so much to me\nWhat's that, Darlin'?\nHow am I doin'?\nI'm doin' alright\nExcept I can't sleep\nI cry all night 'til dawn\n\nWhat I'm trying to say\nIs I love you and I miss you\nAnd I'm so sorry\nThat I did you wrong\n\nLook up, Darlin'\nLet me kiss you\nJust for old time sake\nLet me hold you\nIn my arms one more time\n\nThank you Darlin'\nMay God bless you\nAnd each step you take\nBring you closer\nTo the things you seek to find\n\nGoodbye Darlin'\nI gotta go now\nGotta try to find a way\nTo lose these memories\nOf a love so warm and true\nYou might also likeAnd if you should ever find it\nIn your heart to forgive me\nCome back, Darlin'\nI'll be waitin' for you4Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

afternoon\nAnd the Autumn leaves reminded him another summer's come and gone\nHe had a long, lonely night ahead waitin' for June\nThen among the leaves near an orphan's home a piece of paper caught his eye\nAnd he stooped to pick it up with trembling hands\nAnd as he read the childish writing, the old man began to cry\n'Cause the words burned inside him like a flame\n\n\"Whoever finds this, I love you!\"\n\"Whoever finds this, I need you!\"\n\"I ain't even got no one to talk to!\"\n\"So, Whoever finds this, I love you!\"\nThe old man's eyes searched the orphan's home\nAnd cam to rest upon a child with her nose pressed up against the window pane\nAnd the old man knew he'd found a friend, at last\nSo he waved at her and smiled\nAnd they both knew they'd spend the winter laughing at the rain\n\n(Spoken)\nAnd they did spend the summer laughing at the rain, talking through the fence, exchanging little gifts they'd made for each other. The old man would carve toys for the little girl, and she would draw pictures for him of beautiful ladies surrounded by green trees and sunshine, and they laughed alot. But then on the first day of June, the little girl ran to the fence to show the man a picture she had drawn, BUT HE WASN'T THERE! And somehow, the little girl knew he wasn't coming back. So she went back to her little room, took out a crayola and a piece of paper, and wrote:\n\n\"Whoever finds this, I love you!\"\n\"Whoever finds this, I need you!\"\n\"I don't even have no one to talk to.\"\n\"So, whoever finds this, I love you!\"You might also like1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1595963", "artist_names": "The Fortunes (UK Group)",

Blackfish\n\nAired November 2, 2013 - 21:00   ET\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She actually have a trainer in the water with one of our whales, the whale that -- they're not suppose to be in the water with?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OK. We'll get somebody enroute and ...\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Enter gate number 3, the Shamu stadium.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Gate 3.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: (inaudible) are you sure about this?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We need SOA (ph) to respond for a death (inaudible) in the SeaWorld. There's a whale who ate one of the trainers.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A whale ate one of the trainers?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's correct.\n\nJOHN HARGROVE, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: My parents first brought me to a SeaWorld park when I was very young. From that point forward, I was hooked. It meant everything to me because, you know, I've never wanted anything more.\n\nSAMANTHA BERG, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I remember, you know, being probably in first or second grade, watching National Geographic Specials or Mutual of Omaha's specials and seeing whales and seeing dolphins. And you know, as a little kid, just being really incredibly inspired by it. I never went to Sea World. I grew up in New York so I went to the Bronx Zoo.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I grew up on a lake with horses. We'd swim the horses.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I grew up around the ocean.\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I came from the middle of the country in flat land Kansas.\n\nMARK SIMMONS, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I'm from Virginia, travel down, did the theme park thing in Orlando when I was 17 and saw the night show at Shamu Stadium, very emotional, you know, popular music and I was just -- I was very driven to one who do that.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And I saw what the trainers did. And I said, \"That's what I want to do.\"\n\nDEAN GORNERSALL, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: One of the trainers there and do, \"What are you doing out there, you should be a trainer?\" I know how to train animals and they are training in almost my life.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: How do you prepare yourself for an encounter with an 8,000 pound Orcinus orca?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I always thought you needed like a Master's Degree in marine biology to be a trainer.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It takes years of study and experience to meet the strict requirements necessary to interact in the water with Shamu.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Come to find out, it really is more about your personality and how good you can swim.\n\nGORNERSALL: I went to try out, got the job by the way. I'm like, yeah, I'm so excited and I was so, so excited.\n\nBERG: I really wanted to be there. I really wanted to do the job. I couldn't wait to get in the water with the animals. I really was proud of being a SeaWorld trainer. You know, I thought this was the most amazing job.\n\nCAROL RAY, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I showed up there on my first day, not really knowing what to expect. I was told to put on wet suit and get in the water.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi mom.\n\nRAY: I was scared. I hold my wits.\nSIMMONS: First of all, I put my wet suit on backwards because I was raised on -- in a farm in Virginia.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hi dad.\n\nSIMMONS: My first part in memory at that time was that dolphins are a lot bigger than they look when you get in the water next to him.\n\nGORNERSALL: Well, I watch the sea lion under show and that is kind of Mike Morocco. He comes out during the show with the dress on as Dorky, the alter ego of Dorothy, getting dressed with a sea lion -- the coward sea lion, right. He's walking along with his little basket. I go, \"I will never ever do that, you know.\" Two months later, \"Hi, I'm Dorky,\" walking out on stage with the sea lion.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I was overwhelmed and I was so excited. I mean, just seeing a killer whale is breathtaking.\n\nJOHN JETT, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I was just in awe. It's shocking to see how large they are and how beautiful they are.\n\nBERG: Being, you know, in the presence of the killer whale, it was just inspiring and amazing and I remember seeing them for the first time, it's not being able to believe how huge they were.\n\nYou're there because you want to train killer whales and that's your goal. I didn't know what's going to happen so I wasn't expecting it. And one day, they say \"OK Sam, you're ready to go.\"\n\nBERG: Rise Dotty (ph).\n\nYou're going to stand on the whale, you're going to dive off the whale. The whale's going to swim under you and pick you up again then you're going do a criminal (ph) rider on the floor.\n\nThey just told me to go do it and I did it. Wow, I just rode a killer whale.\n\nYey, girly.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you look into their eyes, you know somebody is home, somebody is looking back. You form a very personal relationship with your animal.\n\nSIMMONS: There is something absolutely amazing about working with an animal. You are a team and you build a relationship together and you both understand the goal and you help each other.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I feel like this whale she's probably 18 years old. I've seen her half up. We've grown up together.\n\nSIMMONS: That's the joy I got out of it is this is a relationship like I've never had.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I come back and have Sinatra (ph).\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Bro, I have to know, are you nervous?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm scared.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nice hair Jeff.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can you see anything?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nJEFFREY VENTRE, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I knew Dawn when she was new. She's a great person to work with and she obviously blossomed into one of the SeaWorld's best trainers.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is Dawn Brancheau. Dawn is the senior trainer here at Shamu Stadium.\n\nVENTRE: I guess you could say I kind of knew Dawn the past life. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's a tough job, isn't it?\n\nDAWN BRANCHEAU: Yes, we really do go to a lot of physical exertion, you can see in the show. You do a lot of deep water work, breath hold and very high energy behaviors with the animals. Obviously, they're given a lot of energy too but we're working together and have long fun as well.\n\nBERG: She's beautiful. She's blonde. She's athletic. She is friendly. You know, everybody loves Dawn.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And I mean this is sincerely, I've been watching you performing yesterday. You're amazing.\n\nBRANCHEAU: Thank you.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You really are.\n\nBERG: She captured what it means to be a SeaWorld trainer. She had so much experience that it made me realize what happened to her really could have happen to anyone.\n\nREVERE: This is Detective Revere at Orange County Sherriff's office. Today's date is February 24, 2010, the time is 4:15. In the room with me right now is Thomas George Tobin, is that correct?\n\nTHOMAS TOBIN, SEAWORLD PARAMEDIC: Correct.\n\nREVERE: Did you see any blood in the water or anything like that?\n\nTOBIN: Well, that's part of it -- she was scalped and there was no blood.\n\nREVERE: OK.\n\nTOBIN: So, pretty much we knew then that the heart wasn't beating.\n\nREVERE: Once they were able to pull her away, how did he let go of the ...\n\nTOBIN: He didn't.\n\nREVERE: He never let go of the ...\n\nTOBIN: The arm?\n\nREVERE: ... the arm.\n\nTOBIN: He swallowed it.\n\nREVERE: He swallowed it? So the arm Is nowhere.\n\nTOBIN: Right. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (inaudible) in behalf of the federal government. He is basically suggesting that swimming with orcas is inherit the dangers and that you can't completely predict the outcome when you enter the water or enter their environment.\n\nDAVE DUFFUS, OSHA EXPERT WITNESS, WHALE RESEARCHER: I said cracks (ph) in the Osha case. Stay out of proximity with the animals and you won't get killed.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's -- It will have a ripple effect to the whole industry. This was national headline news.\n\nMARTHA SUGALSKI: SeaWorld's whale performances may never be the same.\n\nJIM PAYNE: But right now, the theme park is arguing in court to keep whale trainers in the water something OSHA says is extremely dangerous.\n\nWHOOPI GOLDBERG: These are wild animals and they are unpredictable because we don't speak whale. We don't speak whale. We don't speak tiger. We don't speak monkey.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And temper has slurred between the two sides today when OSHA's attorney suggested that SeaWorld only made changes after trainer Dawn Brancheau's death outraged the public.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: OSHA doesn't want the trainers going back in the water without a physical barrier between them and the whales.\n\nDAVID KIRBY, AUTHOR, \"DEATH IN SEAWORLD\": Being in close proximity to this top predators is too dangerous.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: They won't then be getting in the water riding on the whales things like that.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you were on a bathtub for 25 years, don't you think you get a little irritated, aggravated, maybe a little psychotic?\n\nDUFFUS: The situation of Dawn Brancheau, it didn't just happen. It's not a singular event. You have to go back over 20 years to understand this.\n\nJOHN CROWE, DIVER: One of the real exciting thing to do until everybody want to do it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What were they telling you you're going to do?\n\nCROWE: Capture orcas.\n\nHOWARD GARRETT, ORCA RESEARCHER: They've had air craft. They had spotters. They had speedboats. They had bombs they were throwing in the water. They were lighting their bombs with acetylene torches in their boats and throwing those as fast they could to herd the whales into coves. But the Orcas have been caught before and they knew what was going on and they knew their young ones would be taken from them.\n\nSo the adults without young went East into cul-de-sac. And the boats followed them thinking they were all going that way while the mothers with babies went north but they captured king side (ph) aircraft. And they have to come up rear eventually and when they did, the capture teams alerted the boats and said, \"Oh, no, they're going north -- the ones with babies.\"\n\nSo the boats, the speedboats caught them there and hurtled them in. And then they had fishing boats with same nets that they would spread across so none could leave and they could just pick out the young ones.\n\nCROWE: We're only after the little ones. And the little ones, you know, also big animals still but I was told because of shipping cost that's why they only take the little ones.\n\nGARRETT: They had -- the young ones that they wanted in the corals -- so they dropped the same nets and all the others could have left but they stayed.\n\nCROWE: Whether they're trying to get the young Orca in the decker and the whole fam-damn-ly is out here 25 yards away maybe in a big lawn and they're communicating back and forth. Well, you understand then what you're doing, you know. I loft it. I mean, I just in turn crying. I didn't stop working but I, you know, just couldn't handle it -- just like kidnapping a little kid away from his mother. Everybody is watching, what can you do? But the worst thing that I could think of, you know, I can't think of being worst than that. Now, it does really sounds bad.\n\nBut when the whole hunt was over, there were three dead whales in the net. And so, they had Peter (ph) and Brian (ph), and I cut the whales open fill them with rocks and put anchors on their tail and sink them. Well, you know, really, I didn't even think about it being illegal at that point. I thought it was the PR thing.\n\nGARRETT: They were finally ejected from the state of Washington by a court order in 1976. It was SeaWorld by name that was told, \"Do not come back to Washington to capture whales.\" Without missing a beat, they went from Washington to Iceland and began capturing there.\n\nCROWE: I've been part of the revolution to change the presidents in Central and South America. And seen some things that are hard to believe, but this is the worst thing that I've ever done, is hunt that whale.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sealand is part of Victoria for over 20 years. They specialized in the care and display of killer whales.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: : By the time I started and he was four. He was up to 16 feet long and weight 4,000 pounds.\n\nKAN BATCOMB, DIRECTOR: I haven't actually seen Tilikum quite a number of times. He was right across the street here in Victoria.\n\nAll Sealand was a net hanging in a marina with a float around it. .\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: : Tilikum was the one we really love to work with. He is very well-behaved and it was always eager to please.\n\nSTEVE HUXTER, FORMER DIRECTOR: When he is first introduced Tilikum just went fine and dandy (ph), but the previous head trainer used techniques that involved punishment with team, a trained Orca up with Tilikum who was untrained.\n\nHe would send them both off to do the same behavior. If Tilikum didn't do it, then both animals were punished.\n\nDeprive of food to keep them hungry, this caused a lot of frustration with the larger animal that in establish animal and would in turn get frustrated with Tilikum and with rake him with his teeth.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: There would be times during certain seasons that Tilikum would be covered head to toe with rakes. Rakes are teeth on teeth and raking the skin and from head to toe you could see blood and you could see scratches and he would just be raked up.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Both females would gang up on him. Tilikum was the one we trusted. We never were concerned about Tilikum.\n\nThe issue was really that we store these whales at night in what we call a modular which was 20 feet across and probably 30 feet deep, as a safety precaution because were worried about people cutting the net and letting them go, and the lights were all turned out.\n\nSo, literally no stimulation they're just in this dark metal 20 foot by 30 foot pool for two thirds of their life.\n\nHUXTER: When we first started they were quite small and quite young. So they fit in their quite nicely, but they're immobile for the most part.\n\nIt didn't feel good. It just didn't and it was just wrong.\n\nCHRISTOPHER PORTER: We started having difficult in getting them all into this one small steel box to be honest that's what it was. It was a floating steel box.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's where food deprivation would come in. We would hold back food and they would know if they were in the module that they would get their food. So they're hungry now, they're going go in there.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: And during the winter that would be from 5 at night till 7 in the morning.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: When you let them out, you see these new two streaks and sometimes you see blood.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Closing that door on him and knowing that he's locked in there for the whole night is like, (inaudible) into.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, if that is true, that's not only, you know, inhumane and I'll tell him so but it probably led to what I think is a psychosis that he was on here (inaudible) kill.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: An employee is dead after an encounter.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Here at the Canadian park called Sealand of the Pacific.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The victim Keltie Byrne was a championship swimmer and a part-time worker at Sealand.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: AS seen at this home video, rescuers used the huge net to try -- the workers' efforts were hindered by the agitated whale.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'd like to make the (inaudible) Pacific team this summer but my more media goes just to swim fast and (inaudible)\n\nNADINE KATLEN: It was sort of cloudy grey day and we were looking for something to do, so we -- why not go to Sealand, it was kind of like this dingy pool with these whales and ...\n\nCORINNE COWELL: It just felt a little bit of like an amusement park that was kind of one of glass place (ph) and everything was a bit grey.\n\nKATLEN: Yeah. It was like a swimming pool.\n\nCOWELL: Yeah, yup.\n\nKATLEN: You know, dirty whales in a swimming pool.\n\nCOWELL: No, and they would come up and touch the ball and there was, I think there was some tail splashing and there was some ...\n\nKATLEN: Some jumping ...\n\nCOWELL: Of the fish and ...\n\nKATLEN: And they hold the fish and the whales jump up. I remember saying, \"Oh, what a fun job,\" you know, she's still lucky, and then I saw her walking with her rubber boots and she tripped and her foot just dipped into the edge of the pool and she lost her balance and fell in and then she was pushing her way up to get out of the pool and the whales zoomed over, grab her boot and pulled her back in. At first I didn't think it was that serious because you see the trainer in the pool with the whale and you think, \"Oh, well, you know, the whales are used to that,\" and you know, and then all of a sudden, they had started getting -- there is more swimming, more activity, more trashing, and then she was starting to get panicked and then as it progressed, you started to realize, well, some thing is not right here.\n\nCOWELL: She started to scream and she started looking around and her eyes were like bigger and bigger and realizing that I really am in trouble here.\n\nKATLEN: And then they would pull her under and then they would come up and then when she -- they came up she'd be, \"Help me, help me,\" and then they take her down again.\n\nCOWELL: And she would be submerged for several seconds up to -- I don't know maybe a minute, you don't -- you're not keep in tracked.\n\nKATLEN: So, you know, it was harder and harder for her to, you know, get that air in because she was screaming and my sister remembers her saying, \"I don't want to die.\"\n\nWell, condolences to Keltie's family.\n\nCOWELL: Yeah. That we couldn't help her. It's pretty wretched.\n\nDUFFUS: The Sealand close well, it's probably a good thing, I mean, it was a little pond and I think the owner, you know, made the right decision for whatever reasons. I don't believe he's a bad guy, a bad man, and then he was shocked by the whole affair too.\n\nHUXTER: The blush was gone from the business and he decided that was it, we should shut (ph) down.\n\nKATLEN: And no one ever contacted us, there was an inquest, no one ever asked us to say what happened, you know, we just left.\n\nDUFFUS: You know, there was no big lawsuits afterwards and there's no memorial and, you know, the only thing remain in of Keltie Byrne is, you know, what's left in the folk's minds who recall the case.\n\nKATLEN: So in the newspaper articles, the cause of death was that she drowned accidentally, but you know, she was pulled under by the whale.\n\nDUFFUS: Well, there's a bit of smoking mirrors (ph) going on, I mean one of the fundamental facts is that none of the witnesses were clear about which whale pulled Keltie in.\n\nKATLEN: Yes, yeah, it was the large whale Tilikum, the male is the one that went after her, and the other two just kind of circled around but he was definitely the instigator and we knew it was that whale because he had the flapped over fin like it was very easy to tell. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sealand of Pacific closed its doors and was looking I guess to make a bulk on the way out and these whales are worth millions of dollars.\n\nBERG: When SeaWorld heard that Tilikum was available after this accident at Sealand of the Pacific they really wanted Tilikum because they needed a breather. So, I don't even think that anybody even was questioning like, is this a good idea?\n\nHUXTER: My understanding of the situation was that Tilikum and the others would not be used in a show, they would not performance animals, our understanding of their behavior was that it was such a highly stimulating event for them that they were likely to repeat it.\n\nPORTER: The Sealand was -- we were all young and a bit of sea cowboys and a bit -- we weren't so technical only scientific at the SeaWorld. So, we all have this vision that they knew more than us and they were better than us and Tilikum would have a bigger pool, and he would have a better life, then he would have a better care, and he would have better food, and be a great life for him.\n\nSo, it was like, \"OK Tili you're going to Disneyland. Lucky you.\"\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Orca's intelligence maybe even superior to man's. As parents they are exemplary other than many human beings, unlike human beings they have a profound instinct for vengeance. Dino De Laurentiis presents, \"Orca\".\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGARRETT: If you go back only 35 years, we knew nothing in fact less than nothing. What the public had was superstition and fear.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Between the two most dangerous animals on earth.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What in hell are you?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGARRETT: These were the vicious killer whales that, you know, have 48 sharp teeth that would rip to shreds if they got a change.\n\nWhat we learn is that they are amazingly friendly and understanding and intuitively want to be your companion.\n\nAnd to this day there is no record of an Orca doing any harm to any human in the wild. They lived in these big families. And they have life spans very similar to human life spans. The females can live to about a hundred maybe more. Males to about 50 or 60, but the adult offspring never leave their mother's side.\n\nEach community has a completely different set of behaviors. Each has a complete repertoire of vocalizations with no overlap. And you can call them languages the scientific community is reluctant to say any another animal but humans uses languages, but there's every indication that they use languages.\n\nLORI MARINO, NEUROSCIENTIST: The Orca brain just screens out intelligence awareness. We took this tremendous brain and we put in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner, what we found is just astounding. They've got a part in the brain that humans don't have. A part of their brain has extended out right adjacent to their limbic system. The system processes emotions.\n\nThe safest inference would be these are animals that have highly elaborated emotional lives. It's becoming clear that dolphins and whales have a sense itself, a sense of social bonding that they've taken to another level much stronger, much more complex than another mammals including humans.\n\nWe looked at mass trendings (ph) the fact that they stand by each other. Everything about them is social, everything. It's been suggested that their whole sense of self is distributed among the individuals in their group.\n\n(BEGIM VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Five of them. This Orca are going to attack this sea lion, cave in, breaking the ice off and swimming around. Oh, here they come. Two of them Look it underneath them. You can se them underneath. They made a big wave. Look at that, big wave.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, God, no. No. Oh, I can't stand it.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you can't watch the bull fight. You better leave. Here they go. Look at this, three of them.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: God. Oh, no. Oh, God.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's all over.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No. Not quite.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yeah, it's all over. It's all over.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDUFFUS: The first nation's vehicle and, you know, fishermen from the a coast, they call him blackfish. There are an animal that possesses great spiritual power and not to be meddled with.\n\nI spent a lot of time around killer whales. They're always in charge (ph). I never get out of the boat. I never mess with them. The speed and the power is quite amazing. Rules are the same as (inaudible) one foot on the floor at all times.\n\nEven after seeing them thousands of times. You see them and you still, you know, wake up.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVENTRE: He arrived I think in 1992. I was at well in the (ph) on dolphin stadium when he arrived and he's twice as large as the next animal in the facility.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This guy is right in about 12,000 pounds. That's incredible. He looks fantastic.\n\nJETT: When until it came arrived at SeaWorld, he was attacked viciously, repeatedly by Catina (ph) and others. In the wild, it's a very matriarchal society, male whales are kept at the perimeter. In captivity, animals are squeezed into very close proximity.\n\nTilikum, the poor guy is so large. He couldn't get away because he just as not as immobile relative to the smaller and more agile females. And where is he going to run, there's no place to run.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think he spent a lot of time in isolation. And SeaWorld it claims, \"No, no, he's always in with the other -- with the females,\" but I mean, you know, from what I thought he was mostly put with the females for breeding purposes. And he didn't spend a lot of time, you know, with the other whales.\n\nJETT: It's for his own protection, you know, he gets beat up and so by segregating him it provides a physical barrier so that females can't kick his butt.\n\nVENTRE: Tilikum is pretty much kept in the back and then brought out at the very end like the big splash.\n\nHe was always happy to see in the morning. Maybe because he was alone, maybe because he was hungry and maybe because he just like you, who knows what was going on in his head.\n\nBERG: He seemed to like to work, he seemed to be interested, he seemed to want to learn new things. He seemed to be enjoying, you know, working with the trainers.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He for me it was a, a joy. He really responded to me and I, you know, everyday I wen to work, I was happy to see Tili.\n\nBERG: I never got the impression of him while I was there that, you know, \"Oh, my God.\" You know, he's the scary whale, you know, not at all.\n\nVENTRE: Maybe some of us just are naivete or whatever, you know, because we weren't given the full details of the Keltie situation.\n\nBERG: I was under the impression that Tilikum had nothing to do with her death specifically that it was the female whales responsible for her death. What I found really odd at first was the way they are acting around this whale and what they had told us seemed to me to be two different things.\n\nOn the first day he arrived, I remember one of the seniors trainers at, SeaWorld, she -- Tilikum was in a pool and she was blocking over a gate and she had her wet suit unzipped and was tied around her waist. And she was making cooing (ph) noises and going, \"Hey, Tilikum, you cute little whale.\" You know, she was like just, you know, come play talking at him and one of the supervisor said, \"Get her out of there.\" And just screamed at her, you know, like \"Get her, get her away from there.\" Like they were so worried that something was going to happen. And I remember thinking why you guys making such a big deal out of this when he didn't actually kill her.\n\nWell, clearly management thought there was, there was some reason to exercise caution around him. You know, it's clearly they knew more than they were telling us.\n\nJeff was out in the audience filming one of the Shamu shows. It was a perfect show all of the hotdog sequences, the water works sequences went off great.\n\nVENTRE: I was really excited just to be capturing this because it was kind of turning out to be a great show.\n\nA show that's kind of complete. It doesn't -- it probably when it happens a few times a week.\n\nBERG: At the very end of the show, Liz (ph) was working Tilikum and apparently Tilikum lunged out of the water at her.\n\nVENTRE: And I had captured Tilikum coming out of the water kind of turning sideways and appeared to be to try to grab Liz (ph). And at that moment that the tape became unusable, I was just kind of basically instructed to get rid of the tape.\n\nWanting to kind of preserve the tape I actually used the editing equipment and like snipped out that little half second or a second when he did that and stitched it back together. So, it's just kind of look like a glitch in the tape and I'm like, \"Look at this.\" And it was like no. This is no longer usable, you know. And so we had to destroy the tape.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nVENTRE: It's pretty outrageous that SeaWorld would claim there was no expecting Tilikum would come out of the water because they had witnessed him coming out of the water and it's written into his profile. He lunges at trainers.\n\nRAY: I spewed out the party line during shows. I'm totally mortified now there is like something like look at Namu (ph), you know, and Namu (ph) is not doing that because she has to.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRAY: Namu (ph) is doing that because she really wants to.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRAY: Oh my gosh. Like some of the things I'm embarrassed by, so embarrassed by.\n\nAt the time I think I could have convinced myself that the relationships that we have were built on something stronger than the fact that I'm giving them fish, you know, I like to think that but I don't know if that's the truth.\n\nI had been there awhile and I'd seen a few other things along the way that made me question why I was there and what we were doing with these animals.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: November 4th, 1988, a killer whale at SeaWorld gave a performance of a lifetime. Don't miss this small miracle. Come see our new baby Shamu.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRAY: I know it was naive of me, but I thought that it was our responsibility to do as much as we could to keep their family units together since we knew that in the wild that's what happens.\n\nKalina (ph) was the first baby Shamu. She had become quite disruptive and challenging her mom a little bit, and disrupting from shows and that kind of thing.\n\nIt was decided by the higher ups that she would be moved to another park when she was just four and a half years old and that was new to us as trainers that we're working with her. To me it had never crossed my mind that they might be moving the baby from her mom.\n\nThe supervisors basically kind of mocking me like, \"Oh, you're saying poor Kalina (ph)?\" You know, \"What she going to do without her mommy?\" And, you know, and that of course to shut me off.\n\nSo the night of the move, we had to deploy the net and separate them and got Kalina (ph) the baby into the net pool and Catina (ph) was generally a quiet whale. She was not overly vocal whale.\n\nAfter Kalina (ph) was removed from the scene and put on the truck and taken to the airport and Catina (ph), her mom, was left on pool. She stayed in the corner of the pool like literally just shaking and screaming -- screeching crying like I'd never seen her do anything like that.\n\nAnd the other females in the pool maybe once or twice during the night they come out and check on her. And she just screech and cry and they would just run back. There is nothing that you could call that watching it besides grief.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those are not your whales. You know, you love them and you think I'm the one that touches them, tease them, keeps them alive, gives them the care that they need. They're not your whales. They own them. Kusaka (ph) and Takara we're very close. Kusaka (ph) was the mother, Takara is a calf. Takara was special to me.\n\nThey were inseparable. When they separated to Kusaka (ph) and Takara it was to take Takara to Florida. Once Takara had already been stretchered out of the pool, put on the truck, driven to the airport, Kusaka (ph) continued to make the vocals that had never been heard before.\n\nThey brought in the senior research scientist to analyze the vocals. They were long range vocals. She was trying something that no one had even heard before looking for Takara. That's heartbreaking.\n\nHow can anyone look at that and think that that is morally acceptable. It's not. It is not OK.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good afternoon Richard. The new show is whale and off (inaudible) -- what it does is it shows the relationship we have between all our animals here at the whale ...\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGORNERSALL: There's so many things that were told to us, that they tell us -- they tell you so many times that you just start believing it, you know.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: So, all the animals here get along very well. It's just like turning your dog really.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was blind, you know. I was a kid and I didn't notice I was down really.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBERG: Ladies and gentlemen this is David from Maryland. Go ahead and wave at everyone, David.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBERG: It just really bought into what they told us. You know, I learned to say what they told us to the audience.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBERG: Hello out here. Children are some of Shamu's biggest fan.\n\nWe can do just about anything we want.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBERG: I thought I'd do everything about killer whales when I work there. You know and everything about these animals and really know nothing about killer whales. I know a lot about being an animal trainer or killer whale trainer, but I don't know anything about these animals, their natural history, or their behavior.\n\nI really in some ways believed a lot of way I was learning from them, because why would they lie.\n\nGARRET: Because the whales in their pools die young, they like to say that all Orcas die at 25 or 30 years.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 25 to 35 years. 25 to 35 years. There's a documentary that says in the wild they live to be about 35 to mid 30. They tend to live a lot longer in this environment because they have all the veterinary care.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGARRET: And of course (inaudible). We knew by 1980 after a half a dozen years of the research that they live equivalent to human life spans. And every other potentially embarrassing fact is twisted and turned and denied one way or another.\n\nLike the floppy dorsal fins.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: 25 percent of whale have fin that turns over like that as they get older.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nVEMTRE: Dorsal collapse happens in less than 1 percent of wild killer whales. We know this. All of the captive males, 100 percent have collapsed dorsal fins.\n\nGARRET: And they say that they are family, that the whales are in their family. They have their pods, but that's just the, you know, an artificial assembly that show their collection, however management decides they should mix them in whichever one's happy to be born or bought and brought in or that -- that's not a family, you know, it's a lie.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: You got animals from different cultural subsets that have been brought in from various parks. These are different nations. These aren't just two different killer whales.\n\nThese animals they've got different gene, they use different languages. MARINO: Well, what could happen as a result of them being thrown in with other whales that they haven't grown up with, that are not part of their culture, is there's hyper-aggression, a lot of violence, a lot of killing in captivity that you don't ever see in the wild.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: For the health and safety of the animals, please, do not put your hands in the water.\n\nJOHN JETT, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: There's always sort of this backdrop, this underpinning of tension between animals. Whale-on- whale aggression was just part of your -- you know, the daily existence.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We ask that you use the stairs and aisleways as you exit. Please, do not step on the seats. These areas may become wet, and therefore slippery to some footwear. Thank you.\n\nJETT: In the wild, when there's tension, they have got thousands of square miles to exit the scene, and they can get away.\n\nYou don't have that in captivity.\n\nJEFFREY VENTRE, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: Can you imagine being IN a small concrete enclosure for your life, when you're used to swimming 100 miles a day?\n\nJETT: Sometimes, this aggression became very severe, and in fact whales have died in captivity because of this aggression.\n\nVENTRE: I think it was 1988, Kandu trying to assert her dominance over Corky rammed Corky. It fractured her jaw, which cut an artery in her head, and then she bled out. And that's got to be a hard way to go down.\n\nJETT: I saw that there was just a lot of things that weren't right. And there was a lot of misinformation and something was amiss. And I sort of compartmentalized that part of it and did the best that I could with the knowledge that I had to take care of the animals that were there.\n\nAnd I think all the trainers there have the same thing in their heart. They're trying to make a difference in the lives of the animals. They think that, if I leave, who is going to take care of Tilikum? That's why I stayed. I felt sorry for Tilikum. I mean, if you want to get down to the nuts and bolts of it, I stayed because I felt sorry for Tilikum.\n\nAnd I couldn't bring myself to stop coming and trying to take care of him.\n\nDAWN BRANCHEAU, TRAINER: Gosh, do I love coming out here every day and having the audience just love what we're doing with the animals. How do I make this animal as beautiful as they are and have people walk away loving this animal? And if they're touched and they're moved, then I feel like I made a difference to them. KIM ASHDOWN, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I left in January of 2010, a month before Dawn passed away. She was like a safety guru. I mean, she was always double-checking and making sure that everyone was doing the right thing.\n\nSo I remember she would record every show that she did and she would watch it and critique herself. And she was constantly trying to be better. When I found out it was Dawn, I was shocked. That could have been me. I could have been the spotter. What if I was there and I could have saved her? All these things go through your mind.\n\nSAMANTHA BERG, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: John Sillick is the guy who in 1987 was crushed between two whales at SeaWorld in San Diego. Now, even though I had been working at SeaWorld for six months, I had no idea that that had even happened. I never even heard that story. And the SeaWorld party line was, that was -- it was a trainer error.\n\nDEAN GOMERSALL, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: It was John's fault, John's fault. He was supposed to get off that whale. And for years, I believed that. And I told people that.\n\nVENTRE: I actually started at SeaWorld like five days after that event occurred. And we didn't -- we weren't told much about it, other than it was trainer error.\n\nAnd, you know, especially when you're new into the program, you don't really question a whole lot.\n\nGOMERSALL: Well, years later, when you actually look at the footage, you go, you know what, he didn't do anything wrong. That whale just landed on him. That whale just went to the wrong spot, or it could have been aggression. Who knows. But it was not the trainer's fault at all, watching that video.\n\nBERG: When I saw the video of the killer whale landing on John, I mean, it just absolutely took my breath away. I gasped. I watched it two or three times. And every time I saw, I just gasped. I could not believe what I was seeing.\n\nWhat kept his body together is that his wet suit basically held him together. But I know he's had multiple surgeries and he's got tons of hardware in his body, and it's hard for me to believe that I didn't actually see that while I was actually an animal trainer, because it seems to me that every person who works with killer whales should have to watch that video.\n\nJOHN HARGROVE, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: Tamarie (ph). You know, Tamarie made mistakes. The most important was interacting with whales without a spotter. So she's putting her foot on Orkid. She's taking it off. She's putting her foot on Orkid, her rostrum. She's taking it off.\n\nWatching your video and knowing Orkid, your stomach drops, because you know what is probably going to happen. She grabbed her foot. Tamarie whips around and she grabs the gate. You see her just ripped from the gate. At this point, Tamarie knows that she's in trouble. She's under the water. Splash and Orkid both have her. She's totally out of view.\n\nNo other trainer knows that this is happening. People start to scream, the park guest that was filming it. You hear. You don't see her. But you hear Tamarie surface. You hear her just scream out, \"Somebody, help me.\" And the way she screamed it, it was just such a blood-curdling, like, she knew she was going to die.\n\nRobin (ph), when he ran over, he made a brilliant decision. He told the trainer to run and take the chain off Kasatka's gate. By taking that chain off, it would give the precursor to Orkid that Kasatka was coming in. Kasatka is more dominant than Orkid, so Orkid let her go.\n\nHer arm, it was U-shaped. It was compound-fractured. She's very lucky to be alive. That's for sure.\n\nBERG: I believe it's 70-plus, maybe even more, just killer whale trainer accidents. Maybe 30 of them happened prior to me actually being hired at SeaWorld. And I knew about none of them.\n\nVENTRE: I have seen animals come out at trainers. I have seen people get slammed.\n\nGOMERSALL: The whales, they are just playing, or they're upset for a second. It was just something that happened, you know?\n\nJETT: It's culture of you get back on the horse and you dive back in the water, and if you're hurt, well, then we have got other people that will replace you, and you came a long way. You sure you want that?\n\nMEREDITH VIEIRA, NBC: A SeaWorld trainer is recovering after a terrifying ordeal in front of a horrified audience.\n\nDAVE DUFFUS, WHALE RESEARCHER: For some reason, the whale just took a different approach to what it was going to do with a very senior, very experienced trainer, Ken Peters, and dragged him to the bottom of the pool and held him in the bottom, let him go, picked him up, took him down again.\n\nAnd these periods he was taken down were pretty close to the mark, you know, a minute, a minute and 20.\n\nWhen he was at the surface, he didn't panic. He didn't thrash. He didn't scream. Maybe he's just built that way, but he stroked the whale. And the whale let go of one foot and grabbed the other. That's a pretty deep pool. And he took him right down.\n\nI think that's to two atmospheres pressure. Apparently, Mr. Peters is an experienced scuba diver. And I think that knowledge contributed to how he was able to be hauled down there that and stay calm and know what to do.\n\nHe knew what he was doing because when -- you can see him actually in the film. The depth is so good, you can see him ventilating. You can see him ventilating really hard. So, he knows about swimming and diving and being underwater. He may have been assuming he was going under again. I did not walk away unimpressed by his calm demeanor during that whole affair. I would be scared (EXPLETIVE DELETED)-less.\n\nHe was near to the end. Presumably, Ken Peters had a relationship with this whale. Maybe he did. And maybe that's what saved him, but Peters got the whale to let him go. And they strung a net across, and Ken Peters pulled himself over the float line, swam like a demon to a slide-out because the whale was coming right behind him. The whale jumped over it and kept right after him.\n\nHe tried to stand up and run, of course, but his feet were damaged. He just fell. He scrambled. And they take this as a prime example of their training working. And they say, well, just stand back and stay calm. And that did work.\n\nThey claim this is a victory of how they do business, and maybe so, but it can also be interpreted as a hair's breadth away from another fatality.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Hi, Shamu. Hi, everybody.\n\nWe're the Johnsons from Detroit, Michigan.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We sure had a great time when we visited SeaWorld. It's one of our favorite places.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes. I like the part when Shamu gets everybody wet.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: When the whales get close to the glass and start kicking up the water, wammo, you're a goner.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Orange County sheriff's deputies have identified the 27-year-old man found dead in a killer whale's tank at SeaWorld. The victim is Daniel P. Dukes from South Carolina. Dukes was found yesterday draped over the back of Tilikum, the largest orca held in captivity.\n\nVENTRE: Well, all I know is the public relations version of it. He was a young man that had been arrested not long before he snuck into SeaWorld. Maybe he climbed the barbed-wire fence and stayed after hours.\n\nJETT: Perfect storyline. A mentally disturbed guy hides in the park after hours and strips his clothes off and decides he wants to have a magical experience with an orca and drowns because he became hypothermic.\n\nRight, so that's the storyline, and none of us were there to know the difference.\n\nVENTRE: He was not detected by the night watch trainers who were presumably at that station.\n\nJETT: There are cameras all over SeaWorld. There are cameras all over the back of Shamu Stadium pointing every which way. There are underwater cameras. I find it hard to believe that nobody knew until the morning that there was a body in there.\n\nThey have a night watch trainer every night. That person didn't hear any slashing or screaming or -- I just find that really suspicious.\n\nVENTRE: One of the employees, I don't know if it was a physical therapist or somebody, was coming in, in the morning, and there was Tilikum with a dead guy, a dead naked guy on his back, kind of parading him around the back pool.\n\nThe public relations spin on this was that he was kind of a drifter and died of hypothermia, but the medical examiner reports were more graphic than that. For example, Tilikum stripped him, bit off his genitals. There was bite marks all over his body.\n\nJETT: Now, whether that was post-death or pre-death, I don't know, but all I can comment on is that the guy definitely jumped in the wrong pool.\n\nSo why keep Tilikum there? This guy, he has a proven track record of killing people. He's clearly a liability to the institution. Why keep him around? Well, it's quite simple to answer, and that is that his semen is worth quite a lot of money.\n\nBERG: Over the years, Tilikum has been one of the main breeding whales at SeaWorld, which is brilliant because they can inseminate way more female whales because they can just get his sperm and freeze it and then he's basically operating as a sperm bank.\n\nIn a reputable breeding program, rule number one is you certainly would not breed an animal that has shown a history of aggression towards humans. Imagine if you had a pit bull who had killed. I mean, that animal would have likely been put down, but in the entire SeaWorld collection, it's like 54 percent of the whales in SeaWorld's collection now have Tilikum's genes.\n\nMARK SIMMONS, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: The flaw is to assume that all killer whales are like Tilikum. You have to look at their learning history from birth. You have to understand why Tilikum was a hazard to anybody in the water. And you have to understand that none of the other killer whales at SeaWorld who are in that system are that way.\n\nQUESTION: What about the incident at Loro Parque?\n\nSIMMONS: First of all, I can't speak with specificity about Loro Parque. I wasn't there. I -- in fact, I know very little about it, probably about as much as the general public knows. ESTEFANIA RODRIGUEZ, FIANCEE OF VICTIM (through translator): He told me he had something important to say. He knelt down and proposed to me. Very romantic. Of course I said yes. He said, really? I said, of course.\n\n(INAUDIBLE) He always loved animals and decided to try it out. He loved it. He tried it, and just fell in love with it.\n\nSUZANNE ALLEE, FORMER VIDEO SUPERVISOR, LORO PARQUE: Loro Parque, it is in the Canary Islands, which is an autonomous region of Spain. It's the largest tourist attraction in all of Spain. And when SeaWorld sent the orcas to Loro Parque, everybody was always questioning, like, how did they make that leap to send four young orcas to park off the west coast of Africa with trainers who a lot of them had never been around orcas before?\n\nNothing was ready. The venue wasn't ready. It wasn't ready for the orcas. It wasn't ready for the show. The owner of the park didn't want to lose revenue by shutting down the pools and repairing them. So, for three years, the animals ate the pools, and for three years the animals had problems with their teeth, with their stomachs.\n\nThat's the reason why these animals are enduring the endoscope procedures. Those are still SeaWorld's animals, and they are responsible for those animals. Loro Parque doesn't have a good reputation. People that work in the business know the reputation of places, and Loro Parque doesn't have a good reputation.\n\nThey didn't spend the same amount of time as the SeaWorld trainers, didn't go through the same regimen that the SeaWorld trainers went through.\n\nAnd Alexis really was the best trainer. I did say -- I said, you know, you're the only trainer there that can hold its own with a SeaWorld trainer, and I said, but you need to be careful.\n\nRODRIGUEZ (through translator): He complained to me that he was tired, but I didn't take it seriously. (INAUDIBLE)\n\n\"Maybe tomorrow, something might happen to me.\" He said this the night before the attack.\n\nALLEE: Anywhere along the line, it could have been stopped, because everyone knew it was a tragedy waiting to happen, but no one every did anything about it.\n\nAnd in the end, it was the best trainer who lost his life.\n\nRODRIGUEZ (through translator): My cell phone rang. It was Miguel Diaz, Alex's boss. He said, \"There was an incident with one of the whales. Alex is fine.\"\n\nMERCEDES MARTINEZ, MOTHER OF ALEXIS (through translator): We noticed new ambulances and the company owners.\n\nRODRIGUEZ (through translator): The owner was there with the director and their lawyers. He told us, \"There was nothing we could do.\"\n\nMARTINEZ: \"There was nothing we could do.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nThey asked me if I wanted to see him. It was horrible.\n\nRODRIGUEZ: They took us to -- the room where his body was. Only his head was showing. He was completely covered up. I leaned over his chest. I noticed something was wrong. It seemed as though his chest had burst. I asked what had happened. I couldn't understand why they had told me he was fine.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, I saw him like this.\n\nMARTINEZ: I just gave him a big hug and said, \"I love you, I love you.\" Then they escorted us out. And I don't remember anything else.\n\nRODRIGUEZ (through translator): It was an accident. It was an accident. But I wasn't content with that answer. Finally, the autopsy gave us the reason. It was no accident. It was an attack, a brutal attack. This was not just an accident. That is a lie.\n\nDUFFUS: Those were SeaWorld's whales. They were trained using SeaWorld's techniques, and their training was being supervised at the time of the fatal accident by one of the senior trainers from San Diego.\n\nFor somebody to get up and say in a court of law they have no knowledge of the linkages between SeaWorld and this park in Tenerife, well, either she doesn't know and is telling the truth, or it's just a boldfaced lie.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nJEFFREY VENTRE, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: As trainers we never forget Shamu's true potential. We see it each and every day. That's why all of our interactions are very carefully thought out, especially our water work interaction. Whoa! You big dork! Especially our water work interactions, because they're potentially the most dangerous.\n\nJOHN JETT, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: I've been expecting it since the second person was killed. I've been expecting somebody to be killed by Tilikum. I'm surprised it took as long as it did.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: First tonight, a six-time killer whale has lived up to its name, killing an experienced trainer at SeaWorld Orlando today.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A tourist in an earlier show said the animal seemed agitated.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Trainers complained the whales weren't cooperating.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The whole show, the main show was a disaster that day.\n\nSAMANTHA BERG, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: There were whales chasing each other, and eventually, the trainers decided they had to stop the show, because they couldn't get the whales under control.\n\nVENTRE: Tilikum was in the back pool, set up to do a Dine with Shamu performance with Dawn.\n\nBERG: Likely she saw what had gone on during the main show and she had probably felt more pressure to do a good show.\n\nWhen you watch the whole video, you can see that Tilikum is actually really with Dawn in the beginning of the video. There's a couple of behaviors that she asks him to do, where Tilikum just jumps right in, and he does exactly what she asks him to do.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to show you how agile these guys are.\n\nVENTRE: There seemed to be a point in the session where things went south, so to speak, and in my humble opinion, it was at that missed bridge, whistle bridge on the perimeter pec wave.\n\nBERG: She asked him to do a perimeter pec wave, where she asked him to basically go all the way around the pool and wave his pectoral flipper, and she blows her whistle, which is a bridge, which tells the animal that, OK, you've done a good job. Come back and get food. But he missed that cue. And he went all the way around the pool on this perimeter pec wave.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're going to let him keep on waving.\n\nVENTRE: My interpretation is that he didn't hear the whistle.\n\nBERG: So not only did he not hear the bridge, then he went and did a perfect behavior and came back and what he got was what we call three-second neutral response, which is just no, no you didn't do the correct thing. You're not going to get rewarded, and then we're going to move on. And you can also see through the video that Dawn is running out of food.\n\nVENTRE: The animals can sense when you're getting to the bottom of your bucket of fish, because they can hear the ice clanging around and the kind of fishy soupy water at the bottom, and the handfuls of fish that they're getting delivered by the trainer are all getting smaller. So they know that they're coming down to the end of session.\n\nBERG: When you see the difference between the beginning of the video and the end of the video, you can see he's just not quite on his game anymore.\n\nJETT: There's no food left. She kept asking him for more and more behaviors. He wasn't getting reinforced for the behaviors that he was doing correctly. He probably was frustrated towards the end.\n\nVENTRE: Then she walked around the perimeter of G-pool. He followed her. And then continued over into the rocky ledge area, where she laid down with him to do a relationship session, which is quiet time basically.\n\nJETT: Tilikum at some point grabbed ahold of her left forearm and started to drag her and eventually did a barrel roll and pulled her in. May have started as play or frustration, and clearly escalated to the very violent behavior that I think was anything but play.\n\nIn the end, you know, he basically just completely mutilated that poor girl.\n\nJOHN HARGROVE, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: They were gathering all of the trainers at the Texas park. He said, \"There's been an accident at the Florida park, and a trainer was killed.\"\n\nHearing that it was Dawn, I was -- I couldn't believe it. I just remember saying to myself, \"Not Dawn. It can't be Dawn.\"\n\nHe said that -- \"And he still has her.\" And I just was so disturbed by that, and the reality of how powerless we are.\n\nDAVE DUFFUS, OSHA EXPERT WITNESS/WHALE RESEARCHER: Evulsion, laceration, abrasion, fractures, fractures and associated hemorrhages, blunt-force traumas to the main body, to the extremities. To see this beating against a trainer, and I cannot fathom the reason, is shocking.\n\nThe lawyer for OSHA asked me what I thought we'd learned, and I'm sitting in the courtroom, and I've got the Keltie Byrne case file in one hand, and I've got Dawn Brancheau in the other, and they're almost to the day 20 years apart. And I'm looking at these two things and my only answer is, \"Nothing. Not a damn thing. We have not learned a damn thing for something like that to happen 20 years apart.\"\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Could you tell if it was an accident?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Did the female trainer work with this whale on a regular basis?\n\nJIM SOLOMONS, SPOKESMAN, ORANGE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE: I don't know what really happened. We had a female trainer back in the whale holding area. She apparently slipped or fell into the tank and was fatally injured by one of the whales.\n\nBERG: At first SeaWorld reported that a trainer slipped and fell in the water and was drowned. So that was the first report.\n\nJETT: It wasn't until eyewitness accounts disputed that that they had to go back in their huddle and say, \"Wait a minute. We've got to come up with a new plan.\" UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Tonight SeaWorld has confirmed the killer whale pulled the woman into the water. She didn't fall into the tank as the sheriff's department initially reported.\n\nJETT: The new plan is that he grabbed her ponytail. This is a subtle way of placing the blame on Dawn's shoulders. She shouldn't have had a long ponytail, or if she did have that ponytail, it should have been up in a bun.\n\nTHAD LACINAK, FORMER SEAWORLD EXECUTIVE: Dawn, if she were standing here with you right now, would tell you that it was her -- that was her mistake in allowing that to happen.\n\nHARGROVE: They blamed her. How dare you? How disrespectful for you to blame her when she's not even alive to defend herself?\n\nLACINAK: He grabbed her ponytail and pulled her into the water. That's as simple as it gets.\n\nBERG: There are photographs of plenty of other trainers doing exactly the same thing that she was doing. So I knew that SeaWorld was lying about the fact that this was her fault.\n\nVENTRE: The ponytail in all likelihood is just a tale. The safety spotter, who apparently didn't actually see the takedown, came up with that.\n\nDAVE MCDANIEL, REPORTER: Now during the spotter's testimony, OSHA pushed him to say that he wasn't really sure it was her ponytail that was in the whale's mouth, that he just saw her underwater, and he assumed it was the ponytail.\n\nOSHA contends that the whale came up and grabbed on Brancheau's arm, saying that that was another level of aggressiveness. Again, SeaWorld is saying it was not an aggressive move.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: One of SeaWorld's top curator's, Chuck Tompkins, said when Dawn Brancheau was pulled off that ledge it wasn't necessarily aggressive behavior by the whale.\n\nMARK SIMMONS, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: The initial grab was not an act of aggression. This is not a crazed animal.\n\nJETT: The industry has a vested interest in spinning these so that the animals continue to appear like cuddly teddy bears that are completely safe. You know. That sells a lot of Shamu dolls. It sells a lot of tickets at the gate. And that's the story line that they're going to continue to stick with for as long as they can.\n\nGRAPHIC: Jeff Andrews, SeaWorld expert witness, \"Tilikum is not an aggressive killer whale. The only thing that lead to (ph) event was a mistake made by Ms. Brancheau.\"\n\nSIMMONS: Recognize that those that say this is a crazed animal that acted out and grabbed Dawn maliciously, they want to prove the theorem that captivity makes animals crazy, and that is just false. LORI MARINO, NEUROSCIENTIST: All whales in captivity have a bad life. They're all psychologically traumatized. So they are ticking time bombs. It's not just Tilikum.\n\nSIMMONS: We have to separate what happened to Dawn, and as tragic as it is, no one wants to ever see it ever happen again. Can SeaWorld create an environment where it never happens again? Yes, I absolutely believe they can.\n\nWhat if there were no SeaWorlds? I can't imagine a society with the value we put in marine mammals if those parks didn't exist.\n\nJETT: I'm not at all interested in having my daughter, who is 3 1/2, grow up thinking that it's normalized to have these intelligent, highly-evolved animals in concrete pools. I don't want her to think that's how we treat the kin that we find ourselves around on this planet. I think it's atrocious.\n\nMCDANIEL: This hearing is expected to last all week with OSHA continuing to work towards this theory: that SeaWorld knew there was a calculated risk of injury or death, but put trainers in the water with the whales anyway. While SeaWorld will say that Dawn Brancheau's death was an isolated incident.\n\nReporting live in Seminole County, Dave McDaniel, West 2 News.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCHRISTOPHER PORTER, FORMER TILIKUM TRAINER: There's something wrong with Tilikum that there's -- there's something wrong, and that's when you have a relationship with an animal, and you understand that he's killing, not to be a savage. He's not killing because he's just crazy. He's not killing because he doesn't know what he's doing. He's killing because he's frustrated, and he's got aggravations, and he doesn't know how to -- he has no outlet for it.\n\nJETT: Now Tilikum is spending a great deal of time by himself and basically floating lifeless in a pool.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Three hours now. And he hasn't moved.\n\nDEAN GAMERSALL, FORMER SEAWORLD TRAINER: They try to sugar coat it by saying he comes out in the front pool every once in a while. Now he's doing shows. You know what he does in his show? He does a few bows. And then he goes back into his little jail cell. That's his life.\n\nDUFFUS: I feel sad for Tilikum. A regal thing like him swimming around a tank with his fin flopped over like that, you know, compared to a wild bull killer whale that size, which is one of the most kinetic and dynamic things you can imagine. I feel sad when I see him.\n\nGRAPHIC: Tilikum remains at SeaWorld Orlando, performing daily. BERG: It's time to stop the shows. It's time to stop forcing the animals to perform in basically a circus environment. And they should release the animals that are young enough and healthy enough to be released. And the animals like Tilikum, who are old and sick and have put in 25 years in the industry, should be released to an open ocean pen so they can live out their lives and just experience the national rhythms of the ocean.\n\nVENTRE: This is a multibillion-dollar corporation that makes its money through the exploitation of orcas.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: They're not suitable to have in captivity.\n\nJETT: The whales are really bored. You deprive them of all the environmental stimulation.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think that in 50 years we'll look back and go, \"My God, what a barbaric time.\"\n\nGRAPHIC: SeaWorld repeatedly declined to be interviewed for this film.\n\nMay 30, 2012, Judge Ken Welsch issued a ruling on OSHA vs. SeaWorld. During shows, SeaWorld trainers must now remain behind barriers, separated from the orcas. SeaWorld has appealed.\n\nDIANE GROSS, DAWN BRANCHEAU'S SISTER: Dawn Brancheau, D.B., dream big. Dawn was the most loving, giving person you ever met. Her smile just radiated. She fulfilled her life.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1688402", "artist_names": "Joe Simon", "full_title": "Farther on Down the Road by\u00a0Joe\u00a0Simon",

go?\"\n\"Kids sure play funny music these days!\"\n\"They play it in the strangest ways.\"\nSaid, \"It looks to me like they've all gone wild.\"\n\"It was peaceful back when I was a child\"\nWell, man, could it be that the girls and boys\nAre trying to be heard above your noise?\nAnd the lonely voice of youth cries\n\"What is truth?\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nA little boy of three sitting on the floor\nLooks up and says, \"Daddy, what is war?\"\n\"Son, that's when people fight and die.\"\nThe little boy of three says, \"Daddy, why?\"\nA young man of seventeen in Sunday school\nBeing taught the golden rule\nAnd by the time another year has gone around\nIt may be his turn to lay his life down\nCan you blame the voice of youth for asking\n\"What is truth?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nA young man sitting on the witness stand\nThe man with the book says - \"Raise your hand!\"\n\"Repeat after me, I solemnly swear\"\nThe man looked down at his long hair\nAnd although the young man solemnly swore\nNobody seems to hear anymore\nAnd it didn't really matter if the truth was there\nIt was the cut of his clothes and the length of his hair\nAnd the lonely voice of youth cries\nYou might also

cares\nYeah, the ones that you're calling wild\nAre going to be the leaders in a little while\nThis old world's waking to a new born day\nAnd I solemnly swear that it'll be their way\nYou better help

Kill Lyrics1. City of Snakes\nEddie runs on stage, jumping around.\nIn heels as well! Yeah. Runs around some more.\nYes, I'm a professional transvestite so I can run about in heels and not fall over, \u2018cause,you know, if women fall over wearing heels, that's embarrassing; but if a bloke falls over wearing heels, then you have to kill yourself! It\u2019s the end of your life, it's quite difficult.\nSo, San Francisco! singing  San Francisco, San Francisco\u2026 Not \u201cSan Fran,\u201d no, apparently not! I didn\u2019t know that, I would\u2019ve said \u201cSan Fran,\u201d but you\u2019d go, \u201cNo, we don\u2019t like \u201cSan Fran,\u201d fuck it!\u201d Or what\u2019s the other one you don\u2019t\u2026? Oh, Frisco! You don\u2019t like that either.\n( audience hissing ) And you\u2019re a city of snakes, I see! ( Eddie hisses ) Everyone goes to a gig with a snake in their bag. ( hisses ) No other cities have snakes as much as you. I\u2019ve been to New York, no fucking snakes; Paris, no snakes; London, no snakes. San Francisco, full of fucking snakes! ( hisses ) We did that at school! So you call it ( rolling eyes ) \u201cThe City.\u201d ( mocking sounds ) \u201cThe City.\u201d\nAnd you don\u2019t tell tourists about the weather in July and August. You don\u2019t fucking tell anyone. They\u2019re all going around in summer shirts, going, \u201cJesus Christ!(mimes fighting through fog) I can\u2019t see! I can\u2019t see! Fog! There\u2019s fog!\u201d And it really shifts it, your fog! I saw John Carpenter\u2019s film, \u201cThe Fog,\u201d seen it a few times, and that fog shifts it. I thought, \u201cWell, that\u2019s Hollywood, that\u2019s fog moving really fast,\u201d but your fog is that speed! ( mimes running ) Busy, busy, busy! It could be late to get in someone\u2019s face somewhere! It runs down the road, doesn\u2019t it? Faster than the fucking taxis! pause Of which there are five\u2026\nI don\u2019t know what that\u2019s about. You\u2019re a no-taxi city, aren\u2019t you? Five taxis, all going, \u201cI got people in.\u201d Hours! (sounds of taxis speeding by ) Then, when you get in, they don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going. I had to tell the guy, \u201cGet in the back, I\u2019ll drive!\u201d He\u2019s sitting in the back, going, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I\u2019ve only lived here four million years!\u201d\nCable cars are fun. Everyone gets on board and becomes a rhesus monkey. No one talks on a cable car, they just hang and stare\u2026 And the guy in the front, with no steering wheel, going, \u201cWhat the fuck? What the fuck\u2019s this one?\u201d Pulling levers, levers\u2026 Is it four levers that just do fuckall? That it? He\u2019s always ringing that bell, going, \u201cHelp! Help!\u201d ( imitates bell clanging ) Endless bell ringing! What is he, the Hunchback of Notre Dame? The bell\u2026 Him and the guy from the stock market are the same person, I think. At the end of the stock market, they ring a bell. It\u2019s the same bell. Oh, yes. ( mimes writing ) \u201cNever link those two together again.\u201d\n\n2. Squirrels in Makeup\nYes, so I was going to be in the army when I was a kid. Yes. I say that, and people go, \u201cOh, yeah, yeah!\u201d No, I was, I was going to be in the army when I was a kid. \u2018Cause if you're a transvestite, you're actually a male tomboy, that's where the sexuality is. Yeah, it's not drag queen, no; gay men have got that covered. This is male tomboy, and people do get that mixed up, they put transvestite there - no no no no! Little bit of a crowbar separation, thank you! And gay men, I think, would agree. It's male lesbian, that's really where it is, ok? Because\u2026 it's true! \u2018Cause most transvestites fancy girls, fancy women. So that's where it is. So it\u2019s \u201crunning, jumping, climbing trees, putting on makeup when you're up there.\u201d That's where it is!\nI used to keep my makeup in a squirrel hole, up the tree. The squirrel would keep makeup on one side, and he'd keep nuts on the other side. And sometimes I'd get up that tree, and that squirrel would be covered in makeup! ( mimes squirrel putting on makeup ) \"La la, la la\u2026 Oh! ( mimes squirrel eating ) What?! Fuck off!\" He seemed to say. And squirrels always eat nuts with two hands, always two hands, and occasionally, they stop and go ( gasps ), as if they're going, \"Did I leave the gas on? No! I'm a fucking squirrel!\" And occasionally they go, \"Fucking nuts! Fed up with them always. I long for a grapefruit.\"\nYeah. So that's very much like the army-- the running, jumping, climbing trees is, not the squirrel bit-- the trees bit. And I was! I loved the army stuff, which is the running, jumping, standing still, \u201cFound you,\u201d ah-ah, flag, \u201cLook,\u201d hat, you know. Bang! I liked all that stuff, the gun thing\u2026 I liked blowing up milk bottles. You know, kill the milk bottles. Boom! Explode milk bottles. Yes. It seems fun - there's this thing of power in you hands. There's all this National Rifle Association and everyone in America is - I mean, 13 year olds keep going out and they get hold of weapons from their grandfather's arsenal! \"I'll borrow the Howitzer, the M16 machine gun, the Uzi\u2026\" What the fuck's the grandfather doing?! This kid down in Arkansas just helped himself to a ton of military weapons, and went and blew away his school!\nAnd the National Rifle Association says that, \"Guns don't kill people, people do,\u201d but I think the gun helps, you know? I think it helps. I just think just standing there going, \"Bang!\" That's not going to kill too many people, is it? You'd have to be really dodgy on the heart to have that\u2026 ( imitates gunfire noises ) I think they should just try that, you know.\nBut yeah, shooting clay pigeons, I think, yeah, go for that. Shooting clay pigeons, they\u2019re fuckers! Come round your house, whiz through ( fly-by noises ) They do nothing, they don't even eat flies! You know? Spiders eat flies, so they're all right, keep them, you know? Flies don't eat fuckall, so kill 'em! And clay pigeons - everyone shoots them in the air. Wait 'til they land! Then go up to the clay pigeon... ( shoots ) Much easier.\nYeah. So! I didn't join the army, as you might have noticed... Yeah, \u2018cause there's not much makeup in the army, is there? No? They only have that night-time look, and that's a bit slapdash, isn't it? And they look a mess! So you can't join, even though the American armed forces have a distinct policy of \"don't ask, don't tell\" towards the alternative sexualities. If you're a bloke wearing a lot of makeup, you know\u2026 I don't think they need to ask, really! And so you can't join, they go, \"No, no, you can't.It's the wrong shade of lipstick for the Army, I'm afraid...\" And they're missing a huge opportunity here, \u2018cause we all know one of the main elements of attack is the element of surprise, and so what could be more surprising than the 1st Battalion Transvestite Brigade? Airborne wing! The airborne wing parachuting into dangerous areas with fantastic makeup! And a fantastic gun! And the opposing forces going, \"Fucking \u2018ell, look at these guys! Look at that! They\u2019ve got guns. They've got guns! Jesus, they've got guns!\" Ah, bugger. I was so surprised! Were you surprised? I was surprised.\nAnyway, so yes, sooo\u2026 Also, if you're a transvestite, you get lumped into that weirdo grouping, you know? When I was in New York, there was a guy in the Bronx whowas living in a cave\u2026like you do, and he was coming out and shooting at geese and\u2026 ( chuckles ) a lot of weird things going on with this guy; and the police picked him up and they found a collection of women's shoes, and they thought, \"Maybe he's a transvestite.\u201d And if he is, he's a fucking weirdo transvestite! I'm much more in the executive transvestite area. Travel the world, yes, it's much more executive. Like J. Edgar Hoover, what a fuckhead he was! They found out when he died that he was a transvestite, and they go, \"Well, that explains his weird behavior!\" Yeah, fucking weirdo transvestite! ( pointing to himself )Executive transvestite. It's a lot wider community, more wide than you'd think\u2026\n3. History\nYes, and I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from. Oh, yeah. You tear your history down, man! \u201c30 years old, let's smash it to the floor and put a car park here!\" I have seen it in stories. I saw something in a program on something in Miami, and they were saying, \"We've redecorated this building to how it looked over 50 years ago!\" And people were going, \"No, surely not, no. No one was alive then!\"\nWell, we got tons of history lying about the place, big old castles, and they just get in the way. We're driving-- \"Oh, a fucking castle! Have to drive around it...\" Disney came over and built Euro Disney, and they built the Disney castle there, and it was, \"You better make it a bit bigger, they've actually got them here... And they're not made of plastic!\" We got tons of them, \u2018cause you think we all live in castles, and we do all live in castles! We all got a castle each. We're up to here with fucking castles! We just long for a bungalow or something.\nAnd I grew up in the 70s, when the careers advisor used to come to school, and he used to get the kids together and say, \"Look, I advise you to get a career, what can I say? That's it.\" And he took me aside, he said, \"Whatcha you want to do, kid? Whatcha you want to do? Tell me, tell me your dreams!\" \"I want to be a space astronaut! Go to outer space, discover things that have never been discovered.\" He said, \"Look, you're British, so scale it down a bit, all right?\" \"All right, I want to work in a shoe shop then! Discover shoes that no one's ever discovered right in the back of the shop, on the left.\" And he said, \"Look, you're British, so scale it down a bit, all right?\" \"All right, I want to work in a sewer then! Discover sewage that no one's ever discovered, and pile it on my head, then come to the surface and sell myself to an art gallery.\" He said, \"What the fuck have you been smoking, eh? Certainly you haven't been smoking in a bar in California, that's for certain!\" \u2018Cause you can't! No, no smoking in bars now, and soon, no drinking and no talking! Be careful, California! You're supposed to be the crazy state, the out there, the wild ones, you know? In the future, everyone's going to say, \"Come down to the library, we'll have a wild time, shall we? \u201c ( mimes dragging on a joint ) \u201cDon't know where that fucking book is, mate, it could be anywhere! There's a lot of 'em about!\"\nYeah,so, yes, so that was it. There was a spirit of ex-empire, this thing of \u201cthings can't be done,\" whereas in America, I thought there was a spirit of \"can be done!\" The pioneer thing.\n\"Go do it, what do you want to do?\"\n\u201cI want to put babies on spikes.\"\n\"Go then! Go!\u201d\nIt's the American Dream! \"Hi! I'm Crazy Eddie! I put babies on spikes. Do you want a rack of babies? We've got babies on racks! Mmm, they taste of chicken!\" They do! Babies taste of chicken! Cannibals say that human flesh tastes of chicken, so babies must taste of chicken. And chicken tastes of humans. ( nervous laughter from audience ) Good, I'm glad you're coming with me on that.\nYes, so this is all true. And so, yes. Soin Europe, we had empires. Everyone had them - France and Spain and Britain and Turkey! The Ottoman Empire, full of furniture for some reason. And the Austro-Hungarian Empire, famous for fuck all! Yes, all they did was slowly collapse like a flan in a cupboard.\nAnd the German empire, very organized, they\u2019d always build an empire, \u201cein, zwei, ein, zwei, \u201cbuild an empire, very Prussian, and then they'd celebrate with a World War! And then lose the whole fucking empire by the end of the war. In the 30s, Hitler, Czechoslovakia, Poland, France, World War II... the Russian front, not a good idea...! Hitler never played \u201cRisk\u201d when he was a kid...! \u2018Cause, you know, playing \u201cRisk,\u201d you could never hold on to Asia. That Asian-Eastern European area, you could never hold it, could you? Seven extra men at the beginning of every go, but you couldn't fucking hold it! Australasia, that was the one! Australasia, all the purple ones! Get everyone on Papua New Guinea and just build up and build up...\nAnd Hitler ended up in a ditch, covered in petrol, on fire, so, that's fun! I think that's funny, \u2018cause he was a mass-murdering fuckhead. And that was his honeymoon as well! Double trouble!\n\"Eva, let's marry.\"\n\"Where should our honeymoon be?\"\n\"Well, in a ditch, covered in petrol, on fire. I've already arranged it upstairs.\"\n\"Oh, how romantic, Adolf.\"\n\"Yes, I thought!\"\nFun! What a bastard! And he was a vegetarian, and a painter, so he must have been going, \"I can't get the fucking trees\u2026 Damn! I will kill everyone in the world!\"\nAnd he was a mass-murdering fuckhead, as many important historians have said. But there were other mass murderers that got away with it! Stalin killed many millions, died in his bed, well done there; Pol Pot killed 1.7 million Cambodians, died under house arrest at age 72, well done indeed! And the reason we let them get away with it is because they killed their own people, and we're sort of fine with that. \u201cAh, help yourself,\u201d you know? \u201cWe've been trying to kill you for ages!\u201d So kill your own people, right on there. Seems to be\u2026 Hitler killed people next door... \u201cOh\u2026 stupid man!\u201d After a couple of years, we won't stand for that, will we?\nPol Pot killed 1.7 million people. We can't even deal with that! You know, we think if somebody kills someone, that's murder, you go to prison. You kill 10 people, you go to Texas, they hit you with a brick, that's what they do. 20 people, you go to a hospital, they look through a small window at you forever. And over that, we can't deal with it, you know? Someone's killed 100,000 people. We're almost going, \"Well done! You killed 100,000 people? You must get up very early in the morning. I can't even get down the gym! Your diary must look odd: \u201cGet up in the morning, death, death, death, death, death, death, death \u2013 lunch- death, death, death -afternoon tea - death, death, death - quick shower\u2026\"\nSo I suppose we're glad that Pol Pot's under house arrest\u2026 you know, 1.7 million people. At least he - we know where he is - under house arrest! Just don't go in that fucking house, you know? I know a lot of people who'd love to be under house arrest! They bring you your food\u2026 \"Just stay here? Oh, all right. (singing laconically ) Have you got any videos?\" You know, you just sit there all day... And Pol Pot was a history teacher. And Hitler was a vegetarian painter. So... mass-murderers come from the areas you least expect it. I don't know how the flip comes over, but it happens.\nSo, yeah. There was a lot of that, and we built up empires - we stole countries! That's what you do,that's how you build an empire. We stole countries with the cunning use of flags! Yeah, just sail around the world and stick a flag in.\n\"I claim India for Britain!\"\nThey go, \"You can't claim us, we live here! 500 million of us!\"\n\"Do you have a flag?\"\n\"We don't need a bloody flag! It's our country, you bastards!\"\n\"No flag, no country, you can't have one! That's the rules that I've just made up, and I'm backing it up with this gun that was lent from the National Rifle Association.\"\nThat was it, you know?\n4. Royal Genetics\nAnd Queen Victoria became Empress of India. She never even fucking went there, you know?\nShe was one of our more frumpy queens\u2026 they're all frumpy, aren't they? Because it's a bad idea when cousins marry! Bottom of the gene pool, you know. You're just scraping the barrel there, \u201cWe've haven't got enough for any more of you royals there, sorry.\u201d First rule of genetics: spread the genes apart! But the royals are just obsessed with, \"Are you a royal family? Are you a royal member? Well, then you can marry me \u2018cause you're same gene pool, and our IQs will go down the toilet.\u201d Fantastic! That's why there's no crazy royals, they're all kind of, \"Hello! Hello, what do you do? You're a plumber! What on Earth is that?\"\nSo yeah. And after World War II, all the empires sort of dissolved. And we didn't - we came first inWorld War II, but we were financially fucked by the end, \u2018cause there was a period of time where it was just us and the Nazis, and they'd been making weapons for ages! They had a head start! We were going, \"Get the tanks out! Get the\u2026 we haven't got any tanks? Then get that ice cream van out there! Get it out there! Kill! All right,fuck it. ( mimes making ice cones and throwing them ) Fuck off! Everything! Just throw everything at them! Just\u2026 that's not\u2026 harder! Orange fruities! And Zooms! Throw the Zooms! Fuck off, you bastards! Pots and pans! Get pots\u2026 just throw the pots and pans at them!\"\nSo by the time America came in - \u2018cause you were watching a U.S. cavalry film, \u2018cause the U.S. cavalry always comes in right just towards the end of the film - ( sings charge melody ) \"Ok, let's go America!\" ( charge melody ) \"I love the smell of Europe in the morning! So, how're you doing?\", we were going, \"Fucking \u2018ell, where've you been?\" \"Ah, having breakfast. So, what's going on, hey?\"\nSo, America did well, Russia did well, and deservedly so, because half a million American soldiers died, half a million British soldiers died, and about 26 million Russian soldiers died. Soldiers and civilians, and that's just 50 times as many. It's just un-fucking-believable, you know, and no one mentions it! These are just figures I discovered. That's why they put up\u2026\u2019cause, I mean, Napoleon had been steaming in there 100 years before: \"I'm going to kill them, I'm going to kill them, going to\u2026 Oh, it's a bit cold, it's a bit cold. Right! Ok, ok, bad idea.\" And then Hitler, \"I've got a better idea, got a better idea\u2026 Oh, it's the same idea! It's the same idea, it's the same idea...\" So no wonder they set up the Eastern Bloc! They wanted a buffer zone. It wasn't fair, but that's what they did. So that's where they're coming from.\nAnd about 20 million Nazi Germans died, but they did start it, they did start that one. And, yeah, so it was that,and France hated them all \u2018cause Southern France was collaborating with the Germans, embarrassing! So since then, they've been kind of spiky and kind of, French... I'm very positive on the French, my family way back was French, so I go with it, but they are kind of, well, fucking French at times...\n\"All of Europe, you must do this!\"\n\"Well\u2026 we're not gonna! We're gonna have a sandwich.\"\nAnd Germany and Japan, they do seem to have a natural instinct in a very generalized way for organization and being military, but,you know, there's a very strong Green Party there now, kids with beards, it's getting okay, and I just think Japan and Germany should be the peacekeepers of the world. They should be parachuted in; whenever something breaks out, parachute Germans and Japanese in. They\u2019ll go, \"Look, we've done this before, we've done the killing. Hello! Take it from us, just chill out!\" And then, they\u2019d organize peace really quickly. \"All right, peace, peace, peace, peace is organized!\u201d It could be brilliant if they could do that. That's their destiny, man! Yeah.\nItaly invented fascism in 1922. Mussolini said, \"Right, we're all fascists!\" but most Italian people are always on scooters going, \"Ciao!\" And they're into football, and life, and they're not fascists, you know? He said, \"We're all fascists!\" \"All right, ciao!\" No helmet on\u2026 ( imitates scooter running ) All those 50s films, like \u201cRoman Holiday,\u201d it's just like that! Everyone's just cool and hangs out.\n\n5. Strategic Sheep\nSo after World War II, the whole world was going,\n\"Come on, Europe, give these countries back. Come on, we just had a bloody war; let's give 'em back. Britain?\"\n\"Wha'?\"\n\"What's that behind your back?\"\n\"Oh, it's India and a number of other countries.\"\n\"Give 'em back.\"\n\"Oh, all right. There's that one there, and there's that one\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFalkland Islands?\u201d\n\u201cOh, we need the Falkland Islands... for strategic sheep purposes!\"\nYeah. And then it was a case of no empire no longer.\nBut in America, it was different. The founding fathers landed in 16 ( mumbles ). They set off from Plymouth and landed in Plymouth! How lucky is that? \"This is Plymouth? We've just come from Plymouth! We've gone round in a circle. Lads, back on the boats.\" They finally got there and said, \"Ah, this is where our God has brought us to! We can practice our religion here, we can raise a family. There's nobody here! Excuse me\u2026 There's nobody here! Yes, a land empty of human existence\u2026 Who the fuck are these guys? ( mimes the headdress) What's all this, please? No, we don't want any of your food, thank you very much! Just put some clothes on!\"\nMeanwhile, that winter\u2026 \"Excuse me, do you have any food?(mimes the headdress) I love all this, love the idea! ( chuckles ) Yes, I'm sorry, we were a bit brusque when we first arrived, we didn't realize you owned the entire country! But you have no system of ownership? Mmm, interesting! Maybe that can come in useful later\u2026 Food! Thank you very much, very nice... Yes, there're more of us coming but we'll keep our promises.\" So the American government lied to the Native Americans for many, many years, and then President Clinton lied about a relationship, and everyone was surprised! A little na\u00efve, I feel!\nEveryone fucking lies! When we were kids, we lied our heads off! \"I didn't do it! I was\u2026 I wasn't\u2026I was dead at the time! I was on the Moon! With Steve!\" And your Dad's going,\n\"I haven't evenaccused you of anything yet.\"\n\"Oh, all right. Well\u2026 what is\u2026 what's the que\u2026 well, I\u2026 I\u2026 well\u2026 what?\"\n\"Did you brush your teeth?\"\n\"No\u2026 yes\u2026 what's correct? Anywa \u2026 yeah. I was dead at the time!\"\nThen when you're more mature, you do start telling the truth in odd situations. \"I'm sorry, I've broken the glass, I've broken this\u2026 is that expensive? I've broke it. I'll pay for that, I'm sorry.\" And you do that so people in the room might go, \"What a strong personality that person has. I like to have sex with people with strong personalities.\"\"And I've broke other things, I smashed that, and that's gone, and I've just thrown the cat out the window and...\"\nOh, yeah! So, perjury, you know! If you commit perjury, I don't care, don't give a shit. I don't think you should because you grade murder. You have murder one, murder two; you realize that there can be a difference in the level of murder, so there must be a difference in the level of perjury. Perjury one is when you're saying there's no Holocaust when 10 million people have died in it, and perjury... nine, is when you said you shagged someone when you didn't. You know, it's...\nSo yes, so in America, the Native American situation, and slavery didn't do very well.And in Europe now we've a new thing: the European Union. 500 million people, 200 languages - no one's got a clue what there saying to each other! But it's the cutting edge of politics, in a very extraordinarily boring way. Because we've got 15 different countries in the European Union at the moment and trying to get them to decide anything is a little bit, \"Which\u2026 wha\u2026 is it\u2026 oh no, here, back up, you\u2026 oh, you're in with him! Uh-huh, I'm with\u2026 Oh, you're with him!\" you know.\nFor 18 years we had a government in Britain who was a right-wing government and their policy towards Europe was one of, \"No! No! No! I can't! ( singing with his fingers in his ears )\" And now we've got a government whose policy is more, \"Bonjour! Hola! Tak! Da! ( mimes playing banjo ) Ciao!\" Britain needs to be in the driving seat of Europe. In the driving seat, or in the passenger seat, that's pretty good, you know, \u2018cause you can take a sleep for a little bit... \"Are we there yet?\" At the moment, Britain's not even in the European car. We're outside the car, at the traffic lights, going, \"We're going to clean your windows, all right?\"\nYes.\nAnd we had the Pagans in Britain. You didn't really have the Pagans here. You had the Native Americans and it was much more of a warrior, aboriginal-type existence, and... we had the Pagans. They were into sex, death, and religion in an interesting night-time telly type of way. And we had the Druids! Long white robes, long white beards, early transvestites, didn't get their shaving together; and they built Stonehenge, one of the biggest henges in the world. No one's built a henge like that ever since. No one knows what the fuck a henge is! Before Stonehenge, there was Woodhenge and Strawhenge, but a big bad wolf came and blew them down, and three little piggies were relocated to the projects.\nBut they built Stonehenge, and it's built in an area called Salisbury Plain in the South of England. The area of Salisbury Plain where they built it is very ( eerie chanting ), \u2018cause that's good, you know. It's a mystical thing; build it in a mystical area. You don't want to build it in an area that's ( singing upbeat jazzy tune ). No, there you build Trump Tower. But yeah, so they built it there. And the stones! The stones are 50 foot high, 30 foot long, 20 foot deep, and other measurements as well! And they\u2019re not from \u2018round there, that's the amazing thing! Remember, this is B.C. ( mumbles). This was before the B.C./A.D. changeover,when everyone was going, \u201cIs it A.D. yet?\u201d ( mimes adjusting watch ) You didn't have to wind your watch back, you had to get a new bloody watch! \u201cOh, it\u2019s A.D., isn\u2019t it? Fucking \u2018ell!\u201d And the Muslim people going, \"A.D? Who's he?\" Yes. ( hearty laugh from audience member ) Good laugh there!\nSo, yeah, the stones are from 200 miles away,in Wales, so these guys in Wales were obviously carving the rocks out of the very living mountain... \"Fantastic, building a henge, are we? That's a fantastic idea! That's a marvelous religion the Druids have got! Yes, got a lot of white clothing, I like that. There we go!\" And they smashed out a huge stone and then they put tree trunks down to roll it along on.\n\"All right, walk it along, here we go, here we go.\"\n\"Help you push 'em along? It's not far, is it?\"\nAnd the Druids going,\n\"Heave, everyone, heave! Well done, everyone, you're doing very well! You'll love it when you see it. I've seen some of the drawings already, it's very special.\"\nAfter 200 miles\u2026\n\"You fucking bastards! You never told us 200 miles! 200 miles in this day and age - I don't even know where I live now! ( sighs ) I wish the Christians would hurry up and get here!\"\nAnd they set all the stones up and the Druids still there tinkering around going,\n\"No, that stone and this one - can we swap them around?\"\nSo that was the Pagans.\nAnd then the Romans came along with their gods that they had borrowed from the Greeks. They invaded Greece,conquered them and stole all their gods... and renamed them with Roman names, \u2018cause the Roman gods before that were kind of crap, you know - Geoff, the god of biscuits, and Simon, the god of hairdos\u2026 You know, they had the God of War, the God of Thunder, the God of Running Around and Jumping, and stuff. \"Oh, let's get some of those! Thank God they've got some gods, \u2018cause we have these crap gods, you know?\"\nYes, the Emperor Fabulous put that into operation and... There should have been an Emperor Fabulous, shouldn't there?\n\"I am the Emperor Fabulous!\"\n\"Oh, yes, so you are.\"\n\"Yes. And my son, Fabulous II, and him\u2026 really interesting guy... \u201c\nSo yeah, and the Romans went Christian and then we had Christianity for about 1500 years. You know, Catholicism, we believed in the teachings of Cathol, and everything it stood for... Then Henry VIII came along. Henry VIII, a big, hairy king, and he said to the Pope, the head of the Catholic Church:\n\"Mr. Pope! I'm going to marry my first wife, and then I'm going to divorce her. Now, I know what you're going to say but stick with me, my story gets better. I'm going to marry my second wife and then I'm gong to kill her, cut her head off! Ah, not expecting that, are ya? Third wife, gonna shoot her. Fourth wife, put her into a bag. Fifth wife, into outer space. Sixth wife, on a Rotissimat. Seventh wife, made out of jam. Eighth wife\u2026\u201d ( makes sound similar to putting babies on spikes )\nAnd the Pope's going,\n( Italian accent )\"You crazy bugger! You can't do all this! What are you, a Mormon? You can't marry all these people! It's illegal! You can't do all this! I am the Pope, I am the head of the Church, I have to keep up\u2026 ciao! I have to keep up standards. What have you been reading, the gospel according to St. Bastard?\"\nSo Henry VIII, who was Sean Connery for this film, said:\n( imitating Sean Connery ) \"Well then, I will set up a new religion in this country. I will set up the Psychotic Bastard religion.\"\nAnd an advisor said,\n\"Why not call it Church of England, Sire?\"\n\"Church of England, actually. Much better... Even though I\u2019m Scottish myself.\"\nSo they did! That's the birth of Church of England, the birth of the Anglican Church! Disgusting, eh? That's no basis to start a religion on! Nothing to do with the Protestant church,I mean,Henry just shagged and killed a lot of women and then stole all the money off the monasteries. You know, rape and pillage, that is!\nThe Protestant faith was different. That started probably around a similar time, but that was about Martin Luther, this German guy who pinned a note on a church door saying, \" 'ang on a minute!\" But in German, so, \"Ein Minuten, bitte. Ich habe einen kleinen Problemo avec diese Religione.\" He was from everywhere. So yeah and so the Protestant faith was sort of tacked on by Queen Elizabeth I a bit later. \"Oh, principles! Thank God! We've got some principles.\" Nowadays, Church of England is much more, \"Hello, how are you?\" Much more a hobby-type... \"Hello!\" A lot of people in Church of England have no muscles in their arms. \"Hello, yes... ( chuckles ) Yes, that's what I thought. ( chuckles ) Do come in, you're the only one today! Now the sermon today is taken from a magazine that I found in a hedge. Now lipstick colors this season are in the frosted pink area and nail colors to match... And this reminds me rather of our Lord Jesus! Because surely, when Jesus went into Nazareth on a donkey, he must have got tarted up a bit\u2026\u201d\n6. Jeezy Creezy\n\u201cWe will now sing hymn 405, \"Oh God, What on Earth Is My Hairdo All About?\" ( drearily )\"Oh God, what on earth is my hai-airdo...\"\nThere's something weird, something phenomenally dreary about Christian singing. The Gospel singers are the only singers that just go crazy, joyous and it's fucking amazing! And it's born out of kidnapping, imprisonment, slavery, murder, all of that - and this joyous singing! And the Church of England, well, all those sort of Christian religions, which is mainly Caucasian white people, with all the power and money - enough power and money to make Solomon blush, and they're all singing, ( dirge-like ) \"Oh, God, our hope in ages past, our hope for years...\" They're the only groups of people that could sing, \"Hallelujah\" without feeling like it's a \"Hallelujah!\" thing. ( drearily ) \"Hallelujah, hallelujah, joyfully we lark about.\" It's just not kicking, is it?God must be up there going, \"What on Earth is that?\" God, who is James Mason.\n(Imitating Mason ) \"What on earth is that, Jesus? Jesus Christ! What on earth is that?\"\n\"Don't take my name in vain, Dad!\"\n\"Jeezy Creezy, what on Earth is that?\"\n\"Don't call me Jeezy Creezy! Look Dad, I went down there, I taught 'em to be hang out, be groovy, drink a bit of wine, they split into different groups!\nYou've got the Catholics, the Protestants, the Jesuits, the Methodists, the Evangelicals, the free Presbyterians, the locked up Presbyterians... the Quakers, the Bakers, the Candlestick Makers... The Mormons are from Mars, Dad, we've had that checked out.\"\n\"And what does the Holy Ghost think of all this?\"\n\"Oh, he's useless, Dad. Got a sheet over his head these days.\"\n( spookily ) \"Oh... Holy Ghost! Holy Ghost... Holy Ghost!\"\n\"Holy Ghost, this is not an episode of Scooby Doo!\"\n\"I would have succeeded if it wasn't for those pesky God and Jesus fellows!\"\nCause Shaggy and Scooby are interesting characters. They're two of the most major characters in American literature. Because, and I mean this sincerely, and I think it's fantastic, because they are cowards. They are cowardly characters - they believe in cowardice and sandwiches. And can you think of any in the whole realm of the English-speaking literature that are characters like that? Cowardly characters that you identify with. \u2018Cause you identify with them, you're with them all the way! \"Go Shaggy! Go Scooby!\" The rest of the guys who drive the van, \"Fuck off!\" Scrappy Doo, a Magnum... ( shoots ) \"Thank you, Granddad.\" ( general laughter ) Well remembered.\nBut Shaggy and Scooby; the only other character, I mean, tell me now if you can think of any character \u2018cause I'm willing to learn, but somebody mentioned Falstaff. A Shakespearean character!It's that level of greatness! Falstaff, you sort of identify with him, but he has a melancholy with him. But Shaggy and Scooby are upbeat all the time, saying ( imitates Scooby Doo talking ) And you love 'em! You're with 'em! There's part of us that - Shaggy and Scooby at every stage of the way.\nSo if you travel around the world, and, you know, \u2018cause your American foreign policy does give you a difficult time to exist around the world, two tricks: one, say you're Canadian, that helps. It works in Europe, it's very good! And the second is just say, \"Shaggy and Scooby.\" And they go \"Shaggy and Scooby!\" International credit card, I think! So yeah.\n\n7. Church of England Fundamentals\nSo the Pagan religion I don't know a huge amount about, but it was this earthy thing. Christianity had split into many different areas - Catholicism still has the fire and brimstone,( beating drum ) \"Row, you bastards!\u201d You know... Original sin! What a hellish idea that is! People have to go,\n\"Father, bless me for I have sinned, I did an original sin\u2026 I poked a badger with a spoon.\"\n\"I've never heard of that one before! Five Hail Mary's and two Hello, Dolly's.\"\n\"Oh, all right...\"\n\"Bless me, Father, for I have slept with my next door neighbor's wife.\"\n\"Heard it! I want an original sin.\"\n\"Oh, I'm terribly sorry!\"\nThe Anglican faith doesn't have that. You'll never go,\n\"Vicar, I have done many bad things.\"\n\"Well, so have I.\"\n\"What shall I do?\"\n\"Well, drink five Bloody Marys and you won't remember.\"\nBecause the Anglican faith had a lack of principles for a long time. You can't get really headstrong about it. You can't say, you know, like the Islamic jihads that we hear bout. We get scared about those Islamic jihads. I think we do assume that everyone who is into the Islamic religion is having a jihad every other bloody day. There's a lot of very relaxed Islamic people, and we got to understand - remember, this is very important - and we do assume that jihads are just like, you know,everyday three jihads are issued by every individual. It just seems they're everywhere . \"The fruit shop shortchanged me! A fucking jihad on them!\" Bump into someone, say,\n\"Hey! A fucking jihad on you!\"\n\"How many jihads have you got going now, Dad?\"\n\"Well, 24. God, it's difficult to keep up with them!\"\nI just don't think that's happening. But you can't do that in Church of England, you can't say, \"You must have tea and cake with the Vicar, or you die!\" You can't have extreme points of view, you know. The Spanish Inquisition wouldn't have worked with Church of England.\n\"Talk! Will you talk!\"\n\"But it hurts!\"\n\"Well, loosen it up a bit, will you? Fine...\"\n\u2018Cause that's what it would be. \"Tea and cake or death? Tea and cake or death? Tea and cake or death!\" Students with beards, ( mimes demonstrating with picket signs ) \"Tea and cake or death! Tea and cake or death! Little Red Cookbook! Little Red Cookbook!\" \u2018Cause, \"Cake or death?\" That's a pretty easy question. Anyone could answer that.\n\"Cake or death?\"\n\"Eh, cake please.\"\n\"Very well! Give him cake!\"\n\"Oh, thanks very much. It's very nice.\"\n\"You! Cake or death?\"\n\u201cUh, cake for me, too, please.\"\n\"Very well! Give him cake, too! We're gonna run out of cake at this rate. You! Cake or death?\"\n\"Uh, death, please. No, cake! Cake! Cake, sorry. Sorry...\"\n\"You said death first, uh-uh, death first!\"\n\"Well, I meant cake!\"\n\"Oh, all right. You're lucky I'm Church of England!\" Cake or death?\"\n\"Uh, cake please.\"\n\"Well, we're out of cake! We only had three bits and we didn't expect such a rush. So what do you want?\"\n\"Well, so my choice is 'or death\u2019? I\u2019ll have the chicken then, please.\n\u201cTaste of human, sir. Would you like a white wine? There you go, thank you very much.\u201d\n\u201c Thank you for flying Church of England, cake or death?\"\n\u201cI asked for the vegetarian.\"\n\"Ah, yes, the vegetarian, yes! There we go, Mr. Hitler. There we go... Like a bit of wine? Thank you very much...you Nazi shithead!\"\nSo, yeah. So the Pagan religion had very big festivals, remember, on Easter and Christmas. The Christian religion came along and had very big festivals, at Easter and Christmas. Jesus died on one and was born on the other. ( doubting sounds ) \u2018Cause Jesus I do think did exist, and he was, I think, a guy who had interesting ideas in the Gandhi-type area, in the Nelson Mandela-type area, you know, relaxed and groovy; and the Romans thought, \"Relaxed and groovy?! No, no, no, no, no!\" So they murdered him. And kids eat chocolate eggs, because of the color of the chocolate, and the color of the... wood on the cross. Well, you tell me! It's got nothing to do with it, has it? You know, people going, \"Remember, kids,\" the kids who're eating the chocolate eggs,\n\"Jesus died for your sins.\"\n\"Yeah, I know, it's great!\u201d\n\u201cNo, no no, it's bad, it's bad!\u201d\n\u201c No, it's bad! It's very bad. It's terrible! Whatever you want, just keep giving me these eggs.\"\nAnd the bunny rabbits! Where do they come into the crucifixion? There were no bunny rabbits up on the hill going, \"Hey, what, are you going to put those crosses in our warrens? We live below this hill, all right?\" Bunny rabbits are for shagging, eggs are for fertility. It's a festival - it's the spring festival!\nChristmastime, you know, Jesus born to a big jolly guy in a red jacket.\n\"Ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho, baby Jesus! And what would you like for Christmas?\"\n\"Peace on Earth and goodwill towards men.\"\n\"Well, what about a clockwork train?\"\n\"Oh, yes, much better. Forget peace on earth, I don't care.\u201d\nAnd, you know, the Christmas fir tree, there's none of them in Nazareth. The \u201cpartridge in a pear tree\u201d song was not sung at the Last Supper. They weren't there going,\n\" 'And a partridge in a pear tree. Five goold rings!' Come on, loosen up, Judas.\"\n\"Oh, all right...\"\n\" 'On the seventh day of Christmas...\u2019 Judy, come on, Judy, loosen up.\"\n\"Don't call me Judy, I've told you!\"\n\"Oh! Can you lend us a fiver, Judy? I'm a bit short.\"\n\"All right, lads, Leonardo da Vinci's painting the picture, so everyone get your positions, here we go.\"\"Jesus, why are you doing the big arms thing?\"\n\"Well, I don't know\u2026 I just thought I'd do a big arms thing, I don't know.\"\n\"Well, I'm going to do a big arms thing as well.\"\n\"Yeah, me too! I'll call that the big arms...\"\n\"Look, we can't all do big arms! We'll look like a squadron of Spitfires, for fuck's sake! I'll do big arms and you just look at me and go, 'Ooh, he's doing big arms.' \"\n\"All right.\"\n\"Leonardo, have you got that one? Have you got the painting? All right, now a fun one as well, \u2018member...( mocking laughter ) \"\n\n8. God Attack The Queen\nThat \u201cPartridge in a pear tree\u201d song, the only bit we like of it is that,( singing )\"Five gold rings!\" People go berserk at that point! People come running in from other rooms, ( singing ) \"Five gold rings!\" The rest of it, we don't know; above that, it's just,( singing, uncertain ) \"Twelve\u2026monkeys mating, eleven\u2026 donkeys dancing, ten pigmies farming, nine\u2026 socks\u2026 a swimming\u2026( certain ) five gold rings!\" This is a human thing. We only like to learn a little bit of a song. We can't be bothered, yeah.\nThe American national anthem I've noticed is a bit hazy in the middle! \u2018Cause it starts strong and you finish strong, but the middle bit's a bit, ( singing ) \"And fish in the sky, and a big\u2026 monkey pie...\" I've seen guys up there, halfway through, just losing it.\n\"What the fuck is it?\"\n\"I came second, I'm from Turkey! I don't know! Would you like some furniture?\u201d\nBut in Britain we don't win many gold medals at the Olympics\u2026 because we've chosen not to! It's a political statement! Because we hate our national anthem. Because it's \u201cGod Save the Queen,\u201d you see? \u201cGod Save the Queen.\u201d Now the Queen lives in a very big house, she has barbed wire outside, and people with guns in front of that. That's one saved fucking queen, I'll tell you! That's the problem! She's overly saved! She has no idea of the struggle of human existence. We have to work for a living, raise a family\u2026 we don't have nannies all running around the place. It's what you've got to do in your life, you know?So it's \"God Save the Queen.\" No! It's too saved. It's \"God Attack the Queen,\" that's what it should be! ( singing ) \"God attack the Queen, send big dogs after her that bite her bum. Let them chase after her and rip her knickers off...\" That'd be fantastic! Then she'd have to fight the crazy dog with a handbag with a brick inside of it.\n\"Crazy dog! Crazy dog!\"\n\"Arrgghh, kill the Queen!\"\n\"No - crazy dog!\"\nAnd maybe she'd kill the crazy dog and everyone in Britain would go, \"Hey, fair play to the Queen,- killed the crazy dog.\" And the Queen would have self-respect for the first time in her life! Yes. It would work. It'd be fantabulous.\nBut in America, you win the gold medal, I\u2019ve seen you at the Olympics. You stand there, hand on the hearts\u2026 You and the Roman Empire are the only people who\u2019ve ever done that, so be very careful! \u2018Cause you\u2019re the new Roman Empire, you realize that? There\u2019s no one else going! \u2018Cause the only other big power is China, I supposed, but they\u2019re going, \u201cAh\u2026 oh\u2026\u201d kind of thing. 1.000 million, but they\u2019re all just getting ready.\nBut you\u2019re the Roman Empire, yeah! So you\u2019ve got vomitoriums and orgies to look forward to\u2026 Let the President lead the way! \u2018Cause no one cares in America and\u2026 I don\u2019t know. In Europe, we\u2019re just watching you, and going, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u2018Cause in France they wouldn\u2019t care, and in Britain, they\u2019d get shot. If the Prime Minister had done something, everyone would go, ( mumbling sheepishly ).\n\u201cCan the government say what was happening on the recent affair with the Prime Minister?\u201d\n\u201cWell, the government would like to say ( more mumbling ).\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nBut you do sing the national anthem - I've seen you singing the national anthem, and I've worked out how to do it. If you're lost in the middle of it and you're singing the words, becausethe Tannoy systems at big stadiums, you know, it doesn't matter wherever you're singing it. All that people care about is the look,because there's figures on this. 70% of what people react to is the look, you know, it's how you look; and 20% is about how you sound; and only 10% is what you say. So if you look good and sound good, just up there going, ( sings gibberish to a few bars of The Star Spangled Banner ) Big mouth! ( more gibberish to a few more bars ) The eyes! ( more gibberish ) Use that! ( more gibberish ) And keep confirming and denying things. ( more gibberish, up to the words 'Star spangled banner yet wave' )Everyone will go wild! Oh, yeah, oh yeah!\n\n9. Action Transvestite\nI'm an action transvestite, actually, as well as being an executive transvestite. I'm an action transvestite! \u2018Cause it's running, jumping, climbing trees, you know. So I went snowboarding when I was in Aspen. And you look cool when you snowboard, you just look cool, you know? You cannot but look cool \u2018cause you're nailed to a fucking plank of wood. As long as you're vertical, you're going, \"Hey, yes!\" ( swishing sounds )\nSkiing, you can be kinda\u2026 ( wobbles about ). There's a lot of that stuff, but this is just ( speeding sounds ). And there's only two positions in snowboarding: One is looking cool; the second is DEAD! Right? Pow! So I was looking cool and I was going 50, 60 thousand miles an hour! \u2018Cause you have no idea! The police never pull you over. They never, ( makes siren noises ) \"Ah, fucking \u2018ell! ( swishing sound to stop ) \u2018Cause the police need to be able to walk up to you in that kind of condescending way. \"Ok, Sonny Jim, what do you think you're doing, eh?\" And they can't do that on a snowboard, because they have to go... ( jumping with legs together, then wobbling to keep vertical ) \"Your tail light's out, and\u2026 you've got no\u2026 knees.\" So anyway, that didn't happen. No, I was just going fast, and I fell, and I smashed my head, and... my head was fine. But my neck went, \"Oh, no. Oh, no, thank you.\"\nSo I had to go see a chiropractor in New York, and they're different to osteopaths, chiropractors, because of the spelling. Of course, they're both very powerful figures on the Scrabble board, though... \"Chiropractor... chiropractor... chiropractor... 93 letters, chiropractor.\" And they crack your bones, that's what they do, they crack your bones! And they take x-rays, but it\u2019s pointless, because whatever is wrong with you\u2026 \"You've got a bad back, I'm gonna crack your bones.\u201d \u201cYou've got diphtheria, I'm gonna crack your bones.\u201d \u201cYour head's come off! I'm gonna crack your bones.\u201d \u201cIt looks like your mother! I'm going to crack your bones. \" And then, when they crack your bones it goes ( painful sigh ) and then, \u201cAhh!\u201d but not sort of ( relief sigh ), but ( disconcerted sigh ). All the way up your spine, \"Crack your bones, crack your bones, crack your bones.\" And they sort of arrange you into a nice, comfortable ( mimes chiropractor\u2019s actions ) And sometimes it doesn't crack! Sometimes it just goes, \"____\". Then they pull a mallet from their belt and they try to make the noise. \u201cMake the noise! I live for the noise...\" And they do your head as well, around here, and they get it into a nice position, and you're thinking, \"Where the\u2026? No, I don't think it's supposed to go around that...!\" In the end, you just trust them, you trust them. They could havetheir fingers in your nostrils, one foot on the back of your underpants, and they're pushing your spine away with a broom.\n\"Well, what's this one about?\"\n\"I have no idea.\"\n( sings fanfare ) \"Wherever he falls, there shall he be buried.\"\n\n10. Heimlich Gesture\nAlso, if you're in a restaurant and you're choking to death, you can say the magic words, \"Heimlich maneuver.\" If you're just coughing and got some, you say, \"Heimlich maneuver,\" and all will be well. The trouble is, it's very difficult to say \"Heimlich maneuver\" when you're choking to death. Yeah.\n( mumbling and coughing )\n\"Your hymen\u2019s been removed?\"\n\"No no. ( more mumbling and coughing )\n\"You need it removed? Right\u2026\"\nI don't know how you remove a hymen... But yeah. No, Heimlich maneuver,developed by Dr. Heimlich who woke up one night, obviously, and went,\n\"A fist, a hand, hoocha hoocha hoocha... lobster! Yes, Hilda! Hilda! Wake up, Hilda!\"\n\"Oh, what is it, Dr. Heimlich?\"\n\"Why are you calling me Dr. Heimlich? I'm you're husband, for fuck's sake! Loosen up, don't be so bloody Prussian.\"\n\"Well, what is it, G\u00fcnther?\"\n\"I have invented a maneuver!\"\n\"What are you, a bloody tank commander now?\"\n\"No! My name is going to be famous in restaurants!\"\nI don't think he actually did it that way. I don't think it was ( snaps fingers ) a wing and a prayer, I think he must have experimented. He was German, organized.\n( German accent ) \"Ok, Hans, I want you to swallow this golf ball...\"\n( choking and coughing ) \u201cI cannot breath.\"\n\u201cI know you cannot breath. I will now make you breath with the cunning use of...\" ( muffled shot)\n\u201cI still cannot breath.\"\n\"Ok, maybe not, maybe this will\u2026 ( muffled shot )\n\u201cJesus fucking Christ!\u201d\n\"Ok, then maybe with a frying pan...\" Pow!\n( Hans coughing throughout, as Dr Heimlich smacks him )\n\"Must be a combination. No, ok\u2026 \"\n\"Ok, two frying pans\u2026 Frying pan in the bollocks\u2026 Bollocks stop\u2026\n\"Frying pan\u2026\"\n( Hans collapses to the floor )\n\"Oh, he's dead.\"\nOther doctors are going,\n\"How's it coming along, Dr. Heimlich?\"\n\"Well, not very well at the moment. It's not really a maneuver at the moment. It's more of a gesture.\"\nAs the National Rifle Association says, it's not guns that kill people - it's maneuvers.\nI'm a film nut as well,complete nut on films. I used to break into film studios; there's a studio called Pinewood Studios near London, and I broke in there when I was 15. And I crept around, creeping, creeping, and hoping that some guy with a big cigar might go,\n\"Hey! A creeping kid! For my film, 'The Creeping Kid!' You, you're in!\"\n\"Ah, me? Uh, yeah...\"\nBut no, it didn't happen! They were filming tall, angular...veterinarians that day... I didn't have my bag\u2026 And my hand up a horse's... anyway. So yes! But we've got known in Britain for making the smaller films, you know. Recently, we've been pulling out of that into the more \u201cTrainspotting\u201d area, but the smaller films, they're kind of \u201ca room with a view with a staircase and a pond\u201d-type movies. Films with very fine acting, but the drama is rather sort of subsued and - subsumed or - a word like that. Sub- something or another. You know, just folded in and everything's people opening doors.\n\"Oh, I'm - oh, what? Well, I\u2019ve - oh.\"\n\"What is it, Sebastian? I'm arranging matches.\"\n\"Well, I - I thought you - ... I'd better go.\"\n\"Yes, I think you'd better had.\" ( sings morose melody )\nAnd you can't eat popcorn to that! You're going ( mimes trying to eat popcorn but getting frustratedand sighs ).\nWhereas if the film did any little bit of business in America, if the film did some decent bit of business, then Hollywood would take it, and they'd remake it, and they'd up the budget by 50 million and it'd be called, \u201cThe Room With A View of Hell!\u201d \u201cStaircase of Satan!\u201d \u201cPond of Death.\u201d And have people open the door, going,\n\"You're fucking in here all the time! All the time you're in here with the fucking matches! In here with the fucking matches! You're fucking doing and fucking ( clucking )\"\n\"You don't talk to me that way! You don't talk to me that way! You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife? You fuck my wife?\"\n\"I am your wife!\"\n\"That doesn't matter! That doesn't matter! I say again, you fuck my wife?\"\n\"All right, yes, I fucked your wife. I am your wife, and I fucked her.\"\n\" ( Nonsensical ) fucking matches - I can't get 'em... I'm going to drive around town and put babies on spikes.\"\n( sounds of babies sliding on the spikes )\n\u201cOh, no! Space monkeys are attacking!\u201d A whole new part of the film that wasn't in the original! ( mimics battle sounds )\n\"Damn, its jammed!\" ( dialing on mobile ) \u201cJanine, I love you really, even though you fucked my wife...\" ( big explosion )\n( mimics eating and drinking everything in sight while watching ) \"It\u2019s a fucking handbag. With a brick in it! It's the Queen! Don't know who that is...\u201d Yeah.\n\n11. British Bad Guys\nWe play bad guys in Hollywood movies because of the Revolutionary War. Yes, there\u2019s no two ways about it. And the French, who were on your side in the Revolutionary war, they play more esoteric characters. They have characters who turn up and go,\n\"My name is Pierre! I come from Paris. I\u2019ve come to have sex with your family.\"\n\"Help yourself... because of the debt of honor to General Lafayette.\"\nYou know your own history, right? You don't know who he is, do you?! What was it? The Spanish-American War? The French Banana War? What? The Revolutionary War! Hung out with Washington. Lafayette. Street named after him in New York. Forget it!\nBut we play bad guys, like take \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back,\u201d from the \u201cStar Wars trilogy.\u201d The Death Star! The Death Star\u2026 just full of British actors opening doors and going,\n\"Oh, I'm - oh, oh...\"\n\"What is it, Lieutenant Sebastian?\"\n\"It's just the Rebels, sir. They're here.\"\n\"My God, man! Do they want tea?\"\n\"No, I think they're after something more than that, sir. I don't know what it is, but they've brought a flag.\" ( cracks up )\n\"Damn, that's dash cunning of them! Ah, Lord Vader!\"\n( heavy breathing and in a deep voice ) \u201cUh, hello.\"( cracks up again )\n\u2018Cause he was only impressive \u2018cause he had that James Earl Jones voice. ( deep voice )\u201dI am Vader. The Force is strong with you.\" If he had a much more,\n( camp Cockney accent ) \u201cHello. Look, I'm Lord Vader and just pay a-bloody-ttention, all right? Luke, Luke, the Force is strong with you.\"\n\"Is it?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"Well, who told you that?\"\n\"Some bloke! Yeah, he said the Force was really rather strong with you.\"\n\"Well, how strong?\"\n\"Uh, as strong as a small pony.\"\n\"Oooh, that's quite strong, that is.\"\nThe film would never have fucking worked, would it?\n\n12. The Great Escape\n\u201cThe Great Escape,\u201d now there\u2019s a film. A lot of British actors, I\u2019m British, so link up there. Steve McQueen, action hero; action transvestite, linkup there. The story is based on a true story about 76 British prisoners, I think, who escaped from the prisoner of war camp in Silesia, in Poland. They\u2019re all experts at escaping; they\u2019ve escaped from lots of other prisons, and they\u2019re all put together, so they say, \u201cHey, let\u2019s work together.\u201d\nSteve McQueen plays the American guy who is dropped into British films in order to make them sell\u2026 in America, that is, because you\u2019d go, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not gonna see it, it\u2019s full of British guys, and what the fuck do I know about British things?\u201d\nI was in\u2026 where was I? I did a gig in Memphis, and this guy came up to me, and it was fucking weird. This guy had two kids, and he said, \u201cYou British?\u201d I went, \u201cYeah,\u201d but wanted to go, \u201cNo, I\u2019m from Mars, actually.\u201d \u201cYou British?\u201d \u201cYeah\u201d And he said, \u201cHey, kids! Jimmy Sue, Bobby Will, Fishy Bob!\u201d No, he said, \u201cTalk British to my kids!\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not gonna talk British to your kids, you don\u2019t talk\u2026 it\u2019s English! \u2018ello?\u201d And the kids were, ( shaky accent ) \u201cNo, Dad, we wanna go see\u2026\u201d ( Slow, slurry ) \u201cNo, Dad, we wanna go see the man emasculating a donkey over there.\u201d \u201cTalk British to my kids! Talk, or I\u2019ll get my arsenal of weapons out!\u201d So that was fun.\nSo yes, \u201cThe Great Escape,\u201d yes. It\u2019s all true, and Steve McQueen is there to make it sell, and he\u2019s cool, I\u2019m totally into him, I\u2019m a very big fan of Steve McQueen \u2013 \u201cBullitt.\u201d Fog\u2026 no fucking fog in \u201cBullitt,\u201d does it? That film, \u201cThe Rock,\u201d when they\u2019re all out in Alcatraz, they go,\n\u201cWe can\u2019t send this nuclear weapon to San Francisco, we can\u2019t fucking find it! It\u2019s covered in fog!\n\u201cAll right, we\u2019ll have to get Oakland, then.\u201d\n( people stirring ) Oh, fight, fight, fight! ( in sing-song ) Oakland, San Francisco, Oakland, East Bay! You\u2019re not called West Bay, are you? No, you\u2019re just( mockingly )\u201cThe City.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to \u201cThe City\u201d today?\n\u201cI might go to \u201cThe City.\u201d\nAnd Oakland is just a collection of houses, is it?\nSo\u2026 so yes, \u201cThe Great Escape.\u201d In \u201cThe Great Escape,\u201d they say,\n\u201cLook, we\u2019re gonna do the biggest escape in the history of people escaping from things they shouldn\u2019t.\u201c\n\u201cFantastic.\u201d\nAnd Steve isn\u2019t really a part of this, he\u2019s just hanging out, playing baseball, runs with the van, does an escape, gets caught, covered in mud, and stuff like that; but the British are working away, they\u2019re digging three tunnels \u2013 Charley, Barley and Farley. No, four tunnels, Charley, Barley, Farley and Wally; no, five tunnels, Charley, Barley, Farley and Wally\u2026 Nobody expects the Spanish tunnel king!\nAnd they\u2019re digging away, and there\u2019s people in charge of shoveling it up, people putting breathing apparatus in, putting things on trolleys, lighting apparatus; people disguising the entrance of the tunnel so it looks like a kibbutz or something; people saying, \u201cI\u2019ve turned my uniform inside out, turned up my collar, I\u2019ve turned my buttocks into a hat, and I now look like a German officer\u2026 but I have no buttocks.\u201d\n\u201cJawol, mein Herr. So habe ich linge wenige. Locherbekommen.\u201d\n\u201cWell done, Simpkins. That\u2019s a line from Monty Python, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nDonald Pleasance is doing forgeries on bits of tin can with a bit of jam. Clang! And on the day of the escape, they\u2019re all there, and Steve McQueen has joined up in the escape, and the British have trilby hats on, overcoats, canoe, a bit of a rabbit\u2026 And Steve\u2019s just there in jeans and a T-shirt, disguised as an American man! He romps out, jumps in a motorbike, knocks a guy off, and within 15 minutes, he\u2019s in the borders of Switzerland. This is from Poland! And if you don\u2019t know the geography, it goes Poland, Czechoslovakia, Holland, Venezuela, Africa, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon\u2026 and then Switzerland, where the Nazi gold comes from. ( imitates people muttering about Nazi gold ) I love the way you do that! Whenever I say something slightly weird, you all mutter. \u201cI\u2019m catching the ferry right now!\u201d\nAnyway, so yes, so Steve\u2019s just damn cool, he jumps on the motorbike, and as soon as he gets on, the music cuts to ( sings action film theme ). The British are all down at the train station. \u201cCan\u2019t we do a motorbike? Damn!\u201d\n\u201cYes, a train ticket to\u2026 Ich m\u00f6chte einen ticket to nach\u2026 London. No, not London! Calais! That\u2019s nice and Nazi, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cIhre P\u00e4sse, bitte.\u201d\n\u201cMy passport? All right.\u201d ( clangs )\n( clanging continues ) \u201cIt\u2019s a bit clangy and a bit jammy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m from the steel and jam area of Stuttgart.\u201d\nThe British are getting hassled, and Steve is away, and he gets to Switzerland. Remember, Jim Rockford nicks an airplane in that film, and he flies to Switzerland, and he gets about 20 miles away from it in an airplane! Steve is on a fucking motorbike and he gets there! Before him! What\u2019s he got in the fucking motorbike, jet wings? I dunno!\nSo yeah, all the British are getting hassled, the Gestapo are after them, people are on rowing boats, some on bicycles, one on a rabbit, in a kangaroo, you know, in pogo stick. Steve\u2019s motor biking away\u2026 Steve\u2019s over the first line of bared wire, \u201cGo, Steve, go!\u201d Into the second line of barbed wire\u2026 Nearly makes it, doesn\u2019t quite, but lives to tell the tale.\nMeanwhile, the British are all rounded up and shot in the head! Now what signals is this giving to kids from the different countries, Britain and America? American kids watching Steve, saying, ( shaky accent ) \u201cSteve, you\u2019re damn cool! Yeah, I\u2019m fucking with you, man, all the way! Absolutely! Lived to tell the tale, good on you!\u201d You know? I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s Australian, but anyway\u2026 \u201cAbsolutely. G\u2019day.\u201d But we\u2019re just watching it and thinking, \u201cWe\u2019re fucked! All that planning, the logistics, everything, and we get fucking blown away.\u201d Chip on my- fish and chips on my shoulder.\n\n13. Engelbert and JFK\nAnd Engelbert Humperdinck! Yes, he was the man. That's not his real name; he's from Britain, but that's not his name. There's very few Humperdincks in Britain. He was born Gerry Dorsey, not Engelbert Humperdinck. His parents were not Mr. and Mrs. Humperdinck. They never said,\n\"What shall we call our son so he does not get the shit kicked out of him at school?\"\n\u201cWe shall call him Engelbert!\"\n\"Good, that'll work!\"\nNo, his name was Gerry Dorsey, and he released songs as Gerry Dorsey, songs such as ( mumbles )which didn't work \u2018cause nobody could hear what he was saying. And then his managers, obviously, said, \"We're going to change your name, Gerry! It's the name that's the problem.\" And his name changed from Gerry Dorsey to Engelbert Humperdinck. I mean, I just wanted to be in the room when they were working that one through.\n\"Zingelbert Bembledack! Yingybert Dambleban! Zangelbert Bingledack! Wingelbert Humptyback! Slut Bunwalla!\"\n\"What?!\"\n\"All right, Kringelbert Fishtybuns! Steviebuns Bottrittrundle...\"\n\"No, Gerry Dorsey, I like Gerry Dorsey!\"\n\"No, we can't do it... Who we got? Zingelbert Bembledack, Tringelbert Wangledack, Slut Bunwalla, Klingybun Fistelvase, Dindlebert Zindledack, Gerry Dorsey, Engelbert Humptyback, Zengelbert Bingledack, Engelbert Humperdinck, Vingelbert Wingledanck\u2026\"\n\"No, no, go back one. Go back one. \"Engelbert Humperdinck.\" That's it.\"\nAnd it worked! But he's dead now, you hear that? Yeah, today, on CNN. I heard it as I was just coming out. Very weird, \u2018cause Frank Sinatra was just recently as well, wasn't it? Yeah. Hmm. No, this is what I heard on the telly when I coming out. ( inhales deeply and exhales ) It's not true, heh. ( exhales ) No, it is true. Yeah, he was L.A. Something happened. He was in L.A., and that's all I caught\u2026 it was just before I came out. So, yeah. ( exhales ) No, it is true. No, he was in a car in L.A. driving along and something hit him or something like that. ( about 25 seconds of pauses and audience laughter, as Eddie nods and denies the truth of this statement ) No no, no, he's all right, he's all right! He's fine! He's cooking, he's jumping, he's doing his thing in L.A. - he's absolutely fine. How do I know? I don't know, I don't know! I think he's got a cold, that's what they said. No, a tan, that's it!\nBut back in the 60s, though, back in the 60s, President Kennedy became the President of the United States of America, and he we went to Berlin, stood on the Berlin wall and he said, \"People of Berlin...\" ( hearty American )\u201dPeople of Berlin.\" I can't do an impression of President Kennedy, so this is... \"People of Berlin. Amy dumped\u2026\" No, James Mason playing him... ( imitates Mason ) \u201c People of Berlin, I have come to you to tell you something about the American states. I sound a bit like God, don't I? Yes. But I have come to say to you that every free citizen of the world is a citizen of Berlin. And I wish to say to you, 'Ich bin ein Berliner.' \" And the crowd went fucking wild!\nTrouble is, \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" means \"I am a donut,\" and... This is true, and this is what he said, he said \"I am a donut!\" And, as I say, 70% of how you look, 20% of how you sound, only 10% is what you say. He said \"I am a donut\" and they went wild! Because \"Ich bin Berliner\" is \"I am a Berliner.\" But \"Ich bin ein Berliner,\" is - that's the name of a donut they have there. And it's like going to Frankfurt:\n\"I am a Frankfurter!\"\n\"Yeah, we've heard about that one, Jackie.\"\nHamburg - \"I am a Hamburger, too!\" Lucky he didn't do a tour of Germany, eh? \"I am a Hamburger, a Frankfurter, and a donut.\" But the people in Berlin must've gone,\n\"What did he say?\"\n\"He said he was a donut!\"\n\"I thought he said he was a donut too!\"\n\"So what does that mean?\"\n\"It's a slang! It's American! He's a donut! He's a fucking donut. Fucking donut, a fucking donut, a fucking donut. He's a fucking donut. I think that's what it must mean.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think, Dr. Heimlich?\"\n\"Huh? ( coughing throughout ) I don't\u2026I don't know, I have swallowed a football and I can'tget it out. Can you perform my maneuver on me, the me maneuver?\"\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Hilda, Hilda, get me a map of everything.\"\nHe also made a speech about space. President Kennedy said, \"By the end of this decade, I have decided to put a man on the surface of the Moon.\" At the same time, our Prime Minister in Britain, Sir Dingly Dang... You don't know anyway, do you? You have no idea! It was Sir Fritz Bunwalla. Engelbert Slaptyback, who was Prime Minister at the time, and he stood up and he said, \"By the end of this decade, I have decided to put a man on the surface of the Earth!\" And so he did. But it was kinda weird, \u2019cause we couldn't do the space race. We had no money, you know, rationing didn't stop 'til the year 2001! I still haven't even lived that long. But anyway,we just didn't have any money. So you were getting space rockets, testing them, sending a cat, dog, a fish, a monkey up into space. The fish was interesting! We didn't have enough money to put a man in a track suit up a ladder! I mean, I would've been there,\n\"Go man, go!\" \"\nI'm going, I'm going! 'Ang on!\"\n\"Just hang on to the ladder!\"\n\"Hello, Swindon, I am here. Swindon, can you hear me?\"\n\"Swindon here, we are monitoring you on our instruments at the moment, we've got you on a tuba.\u201d \u201cThere should be a bigger laugh for that joke, I think.\"\n\"Yeah, I can't quite understand it; I thought it was really funny. Swindon, a knackered, kind of Fresno town.\"\n\"They don't seem to be going for it.\u201d\n\u201cThey're obviously bastards.\"\n\"Anyway,Swindon, I'm nearly at the Moon\u2026 actually, that's a bit of an understatement, that one.\nHave you got another big ladder, another bit of ladder? I don't think we're quite at the Moon yet, but I can see right over the top of the houses! Fantastic!\"\n\n14. Moon Monsters\nBut they went to the Moon, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin,and Michael Collins, going round and round, working out the IRA thing. And Neil stepped on the Moon and said, \"One small step for man, a giant leap for mankind.\" Good line but not his line, I don't think\u2026 it didn't feel like his line, you know? I bet that was just given to him and he was coming down the steps going, \"Small step for man, a giant leap for mankind. Small step for man, a giant leap for mankind. Don't get it wrong, Neil. Don't fuck it up. Here we go. I'm a small man with a giant big - shit!... One man, small giant, two...two mens... What was it?\" \u2018Cause you gotta say something, you can't go down to the Moon and go, \"Oh, it's all sticky! It's covered in jam!\" You can't land on the Moon and go, \"Fucking \u2018ell, I've been in that spacecraft ( stretching noises ) Right, I need a piss.\" You can't land on the Moon and wind down the window and go, \"Is this - Sea of Tranquility? Sea of Tranquility? Is this Sea of Tranquility? Sea of Tranquility? There's no one around!\u201d But he had a sense of humor so he should have used it, \u2018cause there was that lunar module there \u2013 a fixed camera, just fixed, not panning left or right, just stationary. So he could've been there saying, \"Hi, people on the Moon. As you can see, the Sea of Tranquility here, there's the mountains in the distance, there's the Earth! There, you're looking back up at yourselves there. Over to my right, I can see a fucking monster! There's a monster behind me! ( screaming ) Oh no, help! Get off my leg!\" Buzz Aldrin in a monster outfit ( growling ) Neil doing a close-up with\u2026 \"He's got me, Houston. The monster's got me! He wants cash! He's got my hand up behind my back. I think he knows jiu-jitsu! He wants cash for the release of my life. Send a million\u2026 - two million dollars, leave it in a bag by the Sea of Tranquility. I don't know, the North Shore! What the fucking \u2018ell...?\" Oh, it would have worked, wouldn't it?\nBut they went to the Moon and they brought back rock. They brought back rock! Trouble is, we\u2019ve got rock. That was the one thing we didn\u2019t need, wasn\u2019t it?\n\u201cRock, Neil? I don\u2019t know whether you looked at the planet before you took off, but it\u2019s made of fucking rock!\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s Moon rock\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh, fucking hell! This is Earth rock, Neil, come on! ( mocking ) Earth rock with special minerals. It\u2019s rock, isn\u2019t it? Have you heard? On the stock market, rock\u2019s gone up three points! No, it hasn\u2019t, has it? \u2018Cause it\u2019s fucking rock! We wanted diamonds, or sherbet or a squirrel with a gun!\u201d\nSo they went to the Moon and they found rock. They\u2019ve found ice as well recently, so it\u2019s rocks and ice. What an exciting planet! Obviously a party planet. And they went to mars and found more rock, but it\u2019s red this time, so\u2026 We\u2019ve got the most boring solar system I\u2019ve ever heard of\u2026! And I\u2019ve never heard of any!\nAnd no monsters, either! Not one fucking monster has turned up in the history of looking. \u2018Cause we\u2019ve been ready for monsters, we\u2019ve been waiting for them for so long! Pictures of monsters, stories of monsters, documentaries of monsters, films, programs, television things- not one fucking monster! Nothing, not even a squirrel with a flute has turned up. ( sings jaunty flute tune )\n\u201cMonster! Very small monster!\u201d\n\u201cGet the flute off him, that\u2019s where he gets his power!\u201d\nI think the world needs monsters, I think we need them because we\u2019ve got this thing of\u2026 Humans are very good with a little bit of adversity, not too much, but enough. It\u2019s like in the Cold War- World War II is better, the Cold War was just a negative thing. World War II had everyone pulling together against something, and there was some positive stuff that came out of it. Now that the Cold War is gone, everything is loose and free. Everyone\u2019s a bit obsessed with upstairs,have you noticed? All the films lately, \u201cThe X Files,\u201d \u201cIndependence Day,\u201d \u201cArmageddon,\u201d \u201cDeep Impact,\u201d \u201cDeep Throat\u2026\u201d All these things. We\u2019re all looking upstairs now.\nAnd in America, terrorism is starting to happen. You know, the Oklahoma City bombing, which everyone was sure was some Islamic fundamentalist thing, and you found out it was some white guys from nearby. That must have freaked you out something rotten! \u201cThese guys from around the corner? They look like us! Oh, fuck!\u201d Yeah, bit of a weird one.\nAnd the Aryan supremacists have come around with their ideas of \u201cget some chemical weapons and kill people.\u201d And you say,\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the plan? What does that achieve?\u201d\n\u201cNothing, really.\u201d\nAnd it won\u2019t work \u2013 Aryan supremacists, white supremacists, black supremacists, blue supremacists- especially the blue supremacists, they\u2019ll never work, because if you get the same people from the same genetic group to all intermarry, hello? Cousins marrying, hello?? IQ down the toilet! Hitler was trying this\u2019 first generation of Nazis would have been, \u201cSieg Heil!\u201d Second generation, \u201cSieg Heil\u2026\u201d Third generation, \u201cEr\u2026 Sieg\u2026 er\u2026 I\u2019ve no idea.\u201d\nThe FBI picked up a guy who was trying to access anthrax through the mail. Who the fuck do you write to for anthrax?! Is there a big desk, with people going, \u201cMore requests for anthrax? Thank you, Jeff.\u201d\n( mimes typing ) \u201cDear Mrs. Stevens, thank you for your request for anthrax, one of the most dangerous chemical weapons known to humankind. We have pleasure in rushing you three buckets of anthrax for your own personal use only\u2026\u201d But this guy was doing it fraudulently, he must have been a bit cunning. ( mimes typing again ) \u201cDear Sir, my name is Daisy, I am a cow. I wish to take my own life, so please send me three buckets of anthrax, as anthrax is designed to kill cattle and I want to end it all right now. P.S.: I cannot shoot myself as I have no opposable thumbs.\u201d\nPedigree dogs and mongrel dogs are proof of this experiment. Pedigree dogs are all inbred, you take the grandmother and the great-nephew,( mimes forcing copulation ) \u201cThere you go\u2026\u201d And they\u2019re all next to each other in the genetic pool, so they look kinda good, but they just go, \u201cEr\u2026 woof\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd what do you think about the latest doggie situation?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026 w-woof\u2026 I like meeting other dogs.\u201d\nWhereas the mongrel dog with a black patch over a white face, furry on top and sleek down below because a lion shagged a whippet\u2026 that\u2019s the one! That\u2019s the one that goes on and nicks your credit cards and drives to the Bahamas!\n\n15. Puberty\nBut I'm going to finish up today by talking about puberty! Which is a, kind of spiky subject, but it's interesting, because there's things like these kids that started shooting people, which you've had in America. Because guns don't kill people, it's just that certain noise they make. It's just a bullet ripping through peoples' bodies. That's what kills people! Yeah, have guns but don't allow any ammunition. There! We got it! We got it sorted! And they just go ( mimes throwing gun in frustration ) So, yeah.\nBut puberty was\u2026 well, before puberty, at school, I didn't tell kids I was a transvestite \u2018cause I thought they might kill me with sticks, you know?\n\"Why?\"\n\"I don't know, he said a word we didn't understand. And he won at Scrabble with it.\"\nSo, yes. So most transvestites fancy girls, and you can tell people this.\n\"Yes, most transvestites fancy girls.\"\n\"Well who told you that?\"\n\"A transvestite told me that!\"\n\"Probably lives in a cave somewhere.\"\n\"No, an executive transvestite did!\u201d\n\"Oh, really? Well\u2026 fantastico.\"\nSo, yeah. So I played kiss-chase with the girls - tag a girl, she has to kiss you, kinda sexy. But then puberty came! Puberty came and destroyed my confidence, destroyed my everything! Which, I think, is part of the thing that causes these kids to go off and commit murder, essentially, \u2018cause it is such a hell of a gear change. Think about it! \u2018Cause before puberty, girls and boys are going, \"Girls! ( disgusted noise )!\" \"Boys! ( disgusted noise )\" Then it gets to puberty, and instead they're going, \"Girls! Oh\u2026\" or, you know, \"Boys, boys,\" whatever sexual preference you're going, but you just start switching on, sort of\u2026 ( interested noises ). And you think, \"God, I want to get off with some of these people, I better look my best.\" And then Mother Nature says, \"No, you will look the worst you've ever looked in your life!\" ( raspberry mimicking explosion ) \"Hold on, where did I get all this from? Jesus! It's ( disgusted noises ). We repulse ourselves! I mean, I used to look in the mirror and go, \"Well, I'm not going to shag me, that's for certain!\" \u2018Cause that's what narcissism is all about, is looking in the mirror and going, \"God, I'd like to have sex with myself!\" You know? It's all sort of self-attraction thing. And then, when you're at the acne thing, you just go, \"Uh-uh, no way!\"\nAnd parents should tell you the facts of puberty! \"Look, your hair's going to go greasy, your face will become a general plague area... Here's a book on the Black Death... Tufts of hair will grow on your chin, not in a sexy stubble way, but in a continuing plague theme. Down here, I'm not going to even talk about that! But here's a picture of your Uncle Jim... ( getting scared and turning picture around alternately ) Sorry, it\u2019s the other way up... No, that's your aunt, sorry... That's Queen Victoria.\" And it's over months and years, isn't it. Puberty's over months and years. It should be one day, get the fucker over with! Go into school, ( squeakily ) \u201cSorry I'm late, I don't know why I was late.\" By the time you get home, ( gruffly ) \"Right, I'm going home to get a job with a drill.\" And that one day at school will be, ( swinging from high to low ) \"Sorry, I don't know the answer to that question, I don't... 'Scuse me, can I be excused? I seem to have the plague...\"\nAnd then I had to chat up girls and I had never used my vocal ability to chat up girls, and when your voice is breaking it's very hard! It's going, ( silkily ) \"Why, Susan, I really kind of ( squeakily ) fancy you. ( low voice ) I saw you in the ( squeaky ) playground.\" I had to chat up girls and I'd only tagged them before and I didn't have the verbal power to be able to say, \"Susan, I saw you in the classroom today. As the sun came from behind the clouds, a burst of brilliant light caught your hair, it was haloed in front of me. You turned, your eyes flashed fire into my soul, I immediately read the words of Dostoyevsky and Karl Marx, and in the words of Albert Schweitzer, 'I fancy you.' \" But no. At 13, you're just going, \" 'ello, Sue. I've got legs. Do you like bread? I've got a French loaf. ( smacking sound ) Bye! I love you!\"\nSo it was all not working very well. And later on, when we become more mature, we have that line, where if you're talking to someone, getting on well, you can say that great line, \"Do you want a cup of coffee?\" And if they go, \"Ah\u2026 yeah, okay,\" then sex is on, yeah? That's the unwritten rule. Doesn't always work. If the President of Burundi says, \"Would you like a cup of coffee,\" you're not supposed to go, \"Oh, I'm in here!\"\n\"And how do you take it?\"\n\"Anywhere I can find it big boy! Oh, just a cup of coffee? All right... I thought you meant 'Do you want a cup of coffee!' So you're from Burundi, are you? Fantastic! Yeah! No, I know, it's near Zaire, isn't it? Near Tanzania, yeah. Yeah. No, I learned them all when I had chicken pox. I have to go now, \u2018cause my grandmother's on fire...\"\nBut normally it does work as long as you keep the chat sexy. \"Yes, I like my coffee hot and strong. Like I like my women! Hot and strong... With a spoon in them. Ah, the curve of the spoon, the curve of your breast! I like to run the spoon ( talking with the tongue sticking out ) across my lips...\" Then you're pretty close, yeah?\n\n16. Splashy Splashy\nAnd I was a very driven Boy Scout. Very driven Boy Scout! Driven everywhere I was, and... ( chuckles ) This is such a crap joke! Other nights I've never even said it \u2018cause I thought, \"It\u2019s so crap...\" I'm just laughing that you laughed. Anyway. But I was a driven Boy Scout. No, I was actually just driven. You know, I was just a\u2026 forget this. Anyway, so... Yeah, I had all the badges! I had all the badges, I had my sort of \u201cLanding on the Moon\u201d badge! You know, advanced badges. My \u201cNuclear Fusion\u201d badge, and my \u201cMenachem Beguin Disguise Kit\u201d badge, which was great, and so I was a top scout! I was a chief scout, had my own tribe and everything, and me and this other guy who was a chief scout, we went on an outing as sort of chaperones for these girls who were slightly younger than us. So it was 10 girls, two boys - pretty good odds for a shy kid. We went to an activity center, where you climb a tree and eat a sausage and it's kind of\u2026 It builds your character so you know about sausages. And we end up in a swimming pool, and I'm doing splashy splashy with this girl I really fancy. And she's doing splashy splashy back and I'm going, \"Fucking \u2018ell, splashy back!\" You know, \u2018cause splashy splashy is the aquatic equivalent of \"Do you want a cup of coffee?\" Right? So splashy splashy's going well and I suddenly think, \u201cI know! I'll turn around, I'll do swimmy swimmy, and then maybe she'll do swimmy swimmy too in a kind of chase me-chase me way and then we'd do catchy catchy and underwater sexy sexy!\u201d But I was so elated that splashy splashy was actually working that I just swam like a boy chased by sharky-sharky! I swam, and I swam and I swam, and I was in Egypt when they caught up to me! And that's a long way from England. \u2018cause it goes England, Venezuela, Beirut, Africa, Cincinnati, Hanging Gardens of Babylon... It's near Switzerland. So, yeah, it was just\u2026 it wasn't working.\nAnd I was saving my virginity! You know, it's cool to lose your virginity at 13. Yeah, say, \"Yeah, I was 13, she was 25, you know... Yeah... I was an animal! What can I say?\" But I was saving my virginity for a woman made out of breasts! And I was getting on! I was 18 and they were going,\n\"Have you done it? Have you done it yet?\"\n\"Uh, I'm not from your country.\"\nGo on to college, you know, still nothing, and I thought, \"Stop saving yourself for some imaginary person who just isn't there! Just lose your virginity! Just find anyone, anyone, as long as they've got a pulse. Or not! Pulse optional!\" And I was 21 before I lost my virginity. 21! That's not cool at all, is it? But then I tell everyone about it, so that's quite cool. And I've done it since then.( counts with his fingers )\nBut the weirdest thing of all was I actually lost my virginity a year before I lost my virginity. Yeah \u2026 weird! A year before, when I was 20, I actually had a night of whey-hey-hey-hey! So the next morning it was one of those post-virginity breakfasts, I was thinking, you know. \"Hey, just sit there. ( singing ) Breakfast cereal, bacon and eggs. Bit of coffee bubbling away. Freshly squeezed mango juice!\" She's going, \"You're very chipper this morning.\" I'm going,\n\"Yeah, yeah, fucking \u2018ell! Yeah! \u2018cause last night, ( chuckles, then sings ) lost my virginity!\"\n\"Oh yeah, with who?\"\n( moving head from left to right ) I did this for an hour, and I was going, \"With you! With you! What the fuck ( clucks incoherently ) What the fuck was last night all about?!\" You know, and she said, \"No!\" And we had this conversation, and the words ejaculation came into the conversation, and the world 'premature' as well. And I came back with, \"No, ejaculation - mature, mature ejaculation. Not premature, post-mature, veteran ejaculation! Wise, learned man ejaculation! Mature man who does the washing up-type ejaculation...\" But she said, \"No!\" She vetoed it! She was China in the United Nations Security Council\u2026 in the United Nations Security Council Of My Virginity. And so it just didn't work! It was\u2026 fucked me off, I tell you. But she's dead now, so... No, she isn't... No, she was in L.A., in a car, with Engelbert Humperdinck, and...\n\n17. Bilingual Encore\nSo that's the end of my show, and I do like to end the show with a kind of \"Oh\" feeling, and I think I've done that quite well. But thank you very much for being here. I hope you've enjoyed it. Yeah... N\n( Eddie comes back and plays with a clapping audience for about 30 seconds )\nWhat?\nNow I just wanna talk quickly about language, and then we can all go. Yeah, language. They do say Britain and America are two countries separated by the Atlantic Ocean, and it\u2019s true. No, they say, \u201ctwo countries separated by a common language,\u201d that\u2019s the line; it\u2019s an Oscar Wilde line, I think. And we do pronounce things in a different way, like you say \u201ccaterpillar\u201d and we say \u201ccaterpillar,\u201d and\u2026 You say \u201caluminum\u201d and we say \u201caluminium.\u201d You say, \u201ccentrifugal\u201d and we say \u201ccentrifugal.\u201d You say, \u201cleisure\u201d and we say \u201clizuray.\u201d You say \u201cbaysil\u201d and we say \u201cbahsil.\u201d You say \u201c\u2019erbs\u201d and we say \u201cherbs,\u201d because there\u2019s a fucking \u201cH\u201d in it\u2026 But you spell through THRU, and I\u2019m with you on that, \u2018cause we spell it \u201cTHRUFF,\u201d and that\u2019s trying to cheat at Scrabble.\n\u201cHow can we get that \u201cOU\u201d sound?\u201d\n\u201cWell, a \u201cU\u201d will work,\u201d\n\u201cWhat about an \u201cO\u201d as well?\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need it, we\u2019re fine.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I think an \u201cO\u201d in.\u201d\n\u201cWell, all right.\u201d\n\u201cAnd a \u201cG\u201d as well.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d\n\u201cYes, a \u201cG\u201d would be good. We need a silent \u201cG\u201d in the background, in case of any accidents or something.\u201d\n\u201cWell, all right.\u201d\n\u201cAnd an \u201cH\u201d as well.\u201d\n\u201cFucking \u2018ell! Hang on.\u201d\n\u201cAn \u201cH\u201d in case some herbs come along.\u201d\n\u201cAll right\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd a Q, and a P, and a Z\u2026 Look it\u2019s a word in Scrabble that\u2019s 480 points!\u201d\nSo yes, and we do have slight differences in that arena, but in Europe we have 200 languages. 200 languages! Just count them, I know you won\u2019t! And future generations of Europeans \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Europeans, but we\u2019re gonna have to be bilingual; we\u2019re gonna have to be, and English speakers hate this!\n\u201cTwo languages in one head? No one can live at that speed! Good Lord, man! You\u2019re asking the impossible!\u201d\n\u201cBut the Dutch speak four languages and smoke marijuana\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes, but they\u2019re cheating! Everyone knows marijuana is a drug enhancement that can help you on track and field to come last in a team of 8 million other runners\u2026 who are all dead.\u201d\nI don\u2019t know how the Dutch do it, but anyway, we\u2019re gonna have to learn, and the reason for doing it is, one, for being groovy and just getting out there and doing it, but the second is we just lose a lot of business in the rest of Europe, \u2018cause German people phone up\u2026\n\u201cWir haben f\u00fcnf millionen Deutschmark\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJust fuck off, will you, mate?\u201d ( hangs up )\n\u201cHe was speaking German, I told him to go away, I told him to fuck off..! I don\u2019t know, something about f\u00fcnf million in Deutschmarks. I told him to get knotted! We don\u2019t want any of his deutschy markys\u2026 We do? We do want that? Oh, I\u2019m terribly sorry! Oh, fuck! Redial\u2026\u201d\nSo yeah, I\u2019m into this, I\u2019m into this idea; it\u2019s a positive thing, man. I took my last show, \u201cGlorious,\u201d to Paris and I did it in French, and the French people came and stared at me, with that look in their eyes of \u201cquoi?\u201d Because, you know, there\u2019s no standup in France, and they\u2019re not used to English people speaking French, but I was doing it as a positive thing, because we could be the biggest melting pot in the world! 500 million people, all we have to do is melt a bit, just move it around\u2026 Fucking move it around! It was partly that and partly to just go, \u201cyeah\u2026\u201d ( mocking sounds ) So I did that.\nAnd I learnt French at school, up to the age of 16, and then I just kept talking it endlessly after that. And at school, the first page I ever learnt in French was full of things that are quite difficult to get into conversation, thinks like \u201cthe mouse is underneath the table\u201d \u2013 la souris est en dessous la table. Just slip that when you\u2019re buying a ticket to Paris: \u201cLe train \u00e0 Paris, oui? C\u2019est ici? C\u2019est maintenant? Cinq minutes\u2026 la souris est en dessous la table\u2026\u201d\nThe other line was, \u201cthe cat is on the chair\u201d \u2013 le chat est sur la chaise \u2013 slightly more easy to fit in; and \u201cthe monkey is on the branch\u201d \u2013 \u201cle singe est sur la branche.\u201d Very difficult to get into a conversation! Not a lot of jungle in France\u2026 monkeys thin on the ground\u2026 thin in the air\u2026 just generally pretty trim!\nAnd yes, so it just wasn\u2019t working. We go to bars and caf\u00e9s, that\u2019s where we go; we go to bars and caf\u00e9s, and we sit there and we have chats in the caf\u00e9.\n\u201cOui, j\u2019aime beaucoup le caf\u00ea, le caf\u00ea noir and tr\u00e8s fort; tr\u00e8s choud\u2026 ( inhales ) avec une cuill\u00e8re dedans\u2026 ( mocking sound ) Ah, le virage de la cuill\u00e8re; le virage des poitrines\u2026 Je mets la cuill\u00e8re dans la bouche\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJe suis le Pr\u00e9sident de Burundi!\u201d\nAh, oui, Burundi! Je le connais bien! C\u2019est tout pr\u00e8s de Zaire, oui? Tout pr\u00e8s de Mozambique\u2026 No, Tanzanie, Tanzanie! ( chuckles falsely ) Oui, je les ai appris quand j\u2019ai les pox de poulet. Je dois part maintenant parce que ma grandm\u00e8re est flamb\u00e8e\u2026\u201d\nIf you don\u2019t speak French, by the way, all that was fucking funny, all right? We go and get hotel rooms for the night:\n\u201cVous avez une chambre, monsieur?\u201d\n\u201cOui, nous avons les chambres, nous sommes un h\u00f4tel!\u201d\n\u201cOK, je voudrais une chambre avec un grand lit\u2026\u201d \u2013 a large bed \u2013 \u201cavec une vue de la mer\u2026\u201d \u2013 a view of the sea \u2013 \u201cavec une douche\u2026 with a spider.\u201d\n\u201cOui, monsieur\u2026 c\u2019est chambre 42, monsieur.\u201d \u201c42? Merci beaucoup. Mais, la souris est en dessous la table, le chat est sur la chaise et le singe est sur la branche.\u201d\n\u201cQuois?\u201d\n\u201cIl y a un singe sur la branche? Le chat? La souris?\u201d\n\u201cOu est le singe?\u201d\n\u201cLe singe est sur la branche.\u201d\n\u201cEst-ce que le singe est dans la chambre?\u201d\nIn the end, the only way I could get that line into a conversation was I had to go to France with a cat, a mouse, a monkey, a table and a chair, and wander around heavily wooded areas. \u201cCome on, come on! Someone\u2019s coming, someone\u2019s coming! Quick, positions! Les positions, maintenant! Boulot, boulot! Tout de suite! Vas-y! Vas-y!\n\u201cBonjour!\u201d\n\u201cEh, bonjour. Qu\u2019est-ce qui se passe?\u201d\n\u201cBonjour, je suis Anglais, je suis ici en vacances. C\u2019est tr\u00e8s belle ici, les couleurs, les bois, tr\u00e8s belle.\u201d\n( inhaling ) \u201cTu est un travesti?\u201d\n\u201cOui, je suis un travesti, mais pas un travesti typical. Je suis un travesti executive\u2026 Un travesti d\u2019action!\u201d\n\u201cTr\u00e8s bien\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMais, la souris est en dessous la table, le chat est sur la chaise et le singe est\u2026 est\u2026 le singe est disparu.\u201d\nCause the monkey would fuck off! He\u2019d do his own thing. He was a bloody monkey! He was a cheeky monkey\u2026 and he knew my French wasn\u2019t very good, so he\u2019d go off and do things.\n\u201cAh, le singe\u2026 maintenant\u2026 regarde. Il est sur une bicyclette. Il joue au banjo. Et il fume une pipe. Maintenant, il arr\u00eate\u2026 Il lit un journal, il a on journal\u2026\nEt maintenant il est dans l\u2019autobus! Il conduit l\u2019autobus! Et Sandra Bullock est dans l\u2019autobus! Il y a une bombe dans l\u2019autobus! Il faut conduire l\u2019autobus plus de 50 kilom\u00e8tres par l\u2019heure. Et Keanu Reeves! L\u00e0! Il arrive dans la voiture! Il a pas de cheveuxet Jeff Daniels est d\u00e9j\u00e0 mort\u2026 Regarde, il se jette dans l\u2019autobus. Et Dennis Hopper, oh! Dennis Hopper, quel m\u00e9chant!\u201d\nThat was the film \u201cSpeed\u201d in French, which in France was called \u201cLa Vitesse!\u201d Or at least it should have been, but in fact it was called \u201cSpeed.\u201d Yeah\u2026\n\n18. In Conclusion\nSo in conclusion, ladies and jellyspoons\u2026 America, you have the American Dream, you have the American Dream! We haven\u2019t got the European Dream yet, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to get; we\u2019ve got to get a dream to build on. You have the American Dream; the dream is to be born in the gutter, and raise, and grow up and get all the money in the world and stick it in your ears and go ( blows raspberry ) The American Dream! A fantastic dream of money in your ears and swimming through fivers. The American Dream!\nIn Europe\u2026 I don\u2019t know, we haven\u2019t got a dream yet. Well, the dream was\u2026 ( mimics sleeping and dreaming ) \u201cOh\u2026 get off, you fuckin\u2019\u2026! Flag. No!\u201d ( wakes up with a gasp )\n\u201cHilda, Hilda, wake up, Hilda!\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it, Dr. Heimlich, you waking-up type person?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve dreamed the European Dream. I dreamt that every country in Europe spoke a different language and they hated each other\u2026 Oh, that\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it? Yes.\u201d\nThat was the dream, but now, maybe now, the dream is to be in the South of Europe \u2013 to be in Greece, in Italy, in Spain, and to be on a moped with no helmet on, riding along, going, \u201cciao!\u201d\nThat\u2019s a pretty cool dream; it\u2019s not much of a dream, but it\u2019s as good as we\u2019ve got so far, and it\u2019s pretty funky, \u2018cause when you die\u2026 you look a mess, but I don\u2019t know, I just like it. ( mimics riding on a Vespa ) \u2018Cause you\u2019re in a fucking hairdryer. There\u2019s dogs walking faster than you! It\u2019s just pretty damn cool for me. That\u2019s the European Dream, thank you very much. Good night.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1345893", "artist_names": "Van Morrison", "full_title": "Come Running by\u00a0Van\u00a0Morrison",

LyricsWell, well, well, well\nSeems like it was only yesterday\nWhen my mama told me don't fall in love\nWith the first guy that comes your way\nHe was handsome and nice\nBut I took her advice and passed him by\nYears have passed and don't look\nLike love's gonna give me a second try\nBoy the look on your face tells me you understand\nCould it be your love life's like mine\nNeeds a helping hand well, well\nYou need love like I do (don't you)\nBoy I can tell by the way\nYou look when I'm looking at you\nI know it ain't fit and proper\nFor a girl to talk this way\nBut I can't cope with this loneliness\nNot one more doggone day\nEveryday has been an uphill climb\nKeeping my hopes a-float\nJudging from your silence boy\nYou must be in the same boat\nAin't it true now\nYou need love like I do (don't you)\nBoy I can tell by the way you look\nWhen I'm looking at you\n\nWell, well, well you need love\nLike I do (don't you)\n\nBoy it seems like I'm looking in the mirror\nWhen I'm looking at you\nI can't begin to tell\nThe many nights I sit home lonely\nCome on and tell me boy\nHas it ever happened to you\nBoy I'm gonna tell you something\nAnd believe me it ain't no joke\nMy love life is just like a sinking boat\nI can understand a person being without money\nBut there sho' ain't no reason\nFor a person to be without love\nListen to me now\nI'm a girl and you're a guy\nSo come on let's give love a try\nTell me lil' boy\nYou need love like I do (don't you)\nI can tell by the way you look\nWhen I'm looking at you\nBoy finding true love is a dream\nThat everyone wants to come true\nBoy can't you see it's up to us\nTo make this dream come true ohYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1628400", "artist_names": "Marty

Lyrics1\nMissing Data\nSponsors get the answer they want\n\n\nBefore we get going, we need to establish one thing beyond any doubt: industry-funded trials are more likely to produce a positive, flattering result than independently-funded trials. This is our core premise, and you\u2019re about to read a very short chapter, because this is one of the most well-documented phenomena in the growing field of \u2018research about research\u2019. It has also become much easier to study in recent years, because the rules on declaring industry funding have become a little clearer.\n\nWe can begin with some recent work: in 2010, three researchers from Harvard and Toronto found all the trials looking at five major classes of drug \u2013 antidepressants, ulcer drugs and so on \u2013 then measured two key features: were they positive, and were they funded by industry?1 They found over five hundred trials in total: 85 per cent of the industry-funded studies were positive, but only 50 per cent of the government-funded trials were. That\u2019s a very significant difference.\nIn 2007, researchers looked at every published trial that set out to explore the benefit of a statin.2 These are cholesterol-lowering drugs which reduce your risk of having a heart attack, they are prescribed in very large quantities, and they will loom large in this book. This study found 192 trials in total, either comparing one statin against another, or comparing a statin against a different kind of treatment. Once the researchers controlled for other factors (we\u2019ll delve into what this means later), they found that industry-funded trials were twenty times more likely to give results favouring the test drug. Again, that\u2019s a very big difference.\n\nWe\u2019ll do one more. In 2006, researchers looked into every trial of psychiatric drugs in four academic journals over a ten-year period, finding 542 trial outcomes in total. Industry sponsors got favourable outcomes for their own drug 78 per cent of the time, while independently-funded trials only gave a positive result in 48 per cent of cases. If you were a competing drug put up against the sponsor\u2019s drug in a trial, you were in for a pretty rough ride: you would only win a measly 28 per cent of the time.3\n\nThese are dismal, frightening results, but they come from individual studies. When there has been lots of research in a field, it\u2019s always possible that someone \u2013 like me, for example \u2013 could cherry-pick the results, and give a partial view. I could, in essence, be doing exactly what I accuse the pharmaceutical industry of doing, and only telling you about the studies that support my case, while hiding the reassuring ones from you.\n\nTo guard against this risk, researchers invented the systematic review. We\u2019ll explore this in more detail soon (p.14), since it\u2019s at the core of modern medicine, but in essence a systematic review is simple: instead of just mooching through the research literature, consciously or unconsciously picking out papers here and there that support your pre-existing beliefs, you take a scientific, systematic approach to the very process of looking for scientific evidence, ensuring that your evidence is as complete and representative as possible of all the research that has ever been done.\n\nSystematic reviews are very, very onerous. In 2003, by coincidence, two were published, both looking specifically at the question we\u2019re interested in. They took all the studies ever published that looked at whether industry funding is associated with pro-industry results. Each took a slightly different approach to finding research papers, and both found that industry-funded trials were, overall, about four times more likely to report positive results.4 A further review in 2007 looked at the new studies that had been published in the four years after these two earlier reviews: it found twenty more pieces of work, and all but two showed that industry-sponsored trials were more likely to report flattering results.5\n\nI am setting out this evidence at length because I want to be absolutely clear that there is no doubt on the issue. Industry-sponsored trials give favourable results, and that is not my opinion, or a hunch from the occasional passing study. This is a very well-documented problem, and it has been researched extensively, without anybody stepping out to take effective action, as we shall see.\n\nThere is one last study I\u2019d like to tell you about. It turns out that this pattern of industry-funded trials being vastly more likely to give positive results persists even when you move away from published academic papers, and look instead at trial reports from academic conferences, where data often appears for the first time (in fact, as we shall see, sometimes trial results only appear at an academic conference, with very little information on how the study was conducted).\n\nFries and Krishnan studied all the research abstracts presented at the 2001 American College of Rheumatology meetings which reported any kind of trial, and acknowledged industry sponsorship, in order to find out what proportion had results that favoured the sponsor\u2019s drug. There is a small punch-line coming, and to understand it we need to cover a little of what an academic paper looks like. In general, the results section is extensive: the raw numbers are given for each outcome, and for each possible causal factor, but not just as raw figures. The \u2018ranges\u2019 are given, subgroups are perhaps explored, statistical tests are conducted, and each detail of the result is described in table form, and in shorter narrative form in the text, explaining the most important results. This lengthy process is usually spread over several pages.\n\nIn Fries and Krishnan [2004] this level of detail was unnecessary. The results section is a single, simple, and \u2013 I like to imagine \u2013 fairly passive-aggressive sentence:\n\nThe results from every RCT (45 out of 45) favored the drug of the sponsor.\n\nThis extreme finding has a very interesting side effect, for those interested in time-saving shortcuts. Since every industry-sponsored trial had a positive result, that\u2019s all you\u2019d need to know about a piece of work to predict its outcome: if it was funded by industry, you could know with absolute certainty that the trial found the drug was great.\n\nHow does this happen? How do industry-sponsored trials almost always manage to get a positive result? It is, as far as anyone can be certain, a combination of factors. It may be that companies are more likely to run trials when they\u2019re more confident their treatment is going to \u2018win\u2019; this sounds reasonable, although even this conflicts with the ethical principle that you should only do a trial when there\u2019s genuine uncertainty about which treatment is best (otherwise you\u2019re exposing half of your participants to a treatment you already know to be inferior). Sometimes the chances of one treatment winning can be increased with outright design flaws. You can compare your new drug with something you know to be rubbish \u2013 an existing drug at an inadequate dose, perhaps, or a placebo sugar pill that does almost nothing. You can choose your patients very carefully, so they are more likely to get better on your treatment. You can peek at the results halfway through, and stop your trial early if they look good (which is \u2013 for interesting reasons we shall discuss \u2013 statistical poison). And so on.\n\nBut before we get to these fascinating methodological twists and quirks, these nudges and bumps that stop a trial from being a fair test of whether a treatment works or not, there is something very much simpler at hand.\nSometimes drug companies conduct lots of trials, and when they see that the results are unflattering, they simply fail to publish them. This is not a new problem, and it\u2019s not limited to medicine. In fact, this issue of negative results that go missing in action cuts into almost every corner of science. It distorts findings in fields as diverse as brain imaging and economics, it makes a mockery of all our efforts to exclude bias from our studies, and despite everything that regulators, drug companies and even some academics will tell you, it is a problem that has been left unfixed for decades.\n\nIn fact, it is so deep-rooted that even if we fixed it today \u2013 right now, for good, forever, without any flaws or loopholes in our legislation \u2013 that still wouldn\u2019t help, because we would still be practising medicine, cheerfully making decisions about which treatment is best, on the basis of decades of medical evidence which is \u2013 as you\u2019ve now seen \u2013 fundamentally distorted.\n\nBut there is a way ahead.\n\nWhy missing data matters\n\nReboxetine is a drug I myself have prescribed. Other drugs had done nothing for this particular patient, so we wanted to try something new. I\u2019d read the trial data before I wrote the prescription, and found only well-designed, fair tests, with overwhelmingly positive results. Reboxetine was better than placebo, and as good as any other antidepressant in head-to-head comparisons. It\u2019s approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (the MHRA), which governs all drugs in the UK. Millions of doses are prescribed every year, around the world. Reboxetine was clearly a safe and effective treatment. The patient and I discussed the evidence briefly, and agreed it was the right treatment to try next. I signed a piece of paper, a prescription, saying I wanted my patient to have this drug.\n\nBut we had both been misled. In October 2010 a group of researchers were finally able to bring together all the trials that had ever been conducted on reboxetine.6 Through a long process of investigation \u2013 searching in academic journals, but also arduously requesting data from the manufacturers and gathering documents from regulators \u2013 they were able to assemble all the data, both from trials that were published, and from those that had never appeared in academic papers.\n\nWhen all this trial data was put together it produced a shocking picture. Seven trials had been conducted comparing reboxetine against placebo. Only one, conducted in 254 patients, had a neat, positive result, and that one was published in an academic journal, for doctors and researchers to read. But six more trials were conducted, in almost ten times as many patients. All of them showed that reboxetine was no better than a dummy sugar pill. None of these trials was published. I had no idea they existed.\n\nIt got worse. The trials comparing reboxetine against other drugs showed exactly the same picture: three small studies, 507 patients in total, showed that reboxetine was just as good as any other drug. They were all published. But 1,657 patients\u2019 worth of data was left unpublished, and this unpublished data showed that patients on reboxetine did worse than those on other drugs. If all this wasn\u2019t bad enough, there was also the side-effects data. The drug looked fine in the trials which appeared in the academic literature: but when we saw the unpublished studies, it turned out that patients were more likely to have side effects, more likely to drop out of taking the drug, and more likely to withdraw from the trial because of side effects, if they were taking reboxetine rather than one of its competitors.\n\nIf you\u2019re ever in any doubt about whether the stories in this book make me angry \u2013 and I promise you, whatever happens, I will keep to the data, and strive to give a fair picture of everything we know \u2013 you need only look at this story. I did everything a doctor is supposed to do. I read all the papers, I critically appraised them, I understood them, I discussed them with the patient, and we made a decision together, based on the evidence. In the published data, reboxetine was a safe and effective drug. In reality, it was no better than a sugar pill, and worse, it does more harm than good. As a doctor I did something which, on the balance of all the evidence, harmed my patient, simply because unflattering data was left unpublished.\n\nIf you find that amazing, or outrageous, your journey is just beginning. Because nobody broke any law in that situation, reboxetine is still on the market, and the system that allowed all this to happen is still in play, for all drugs, in all countries in the world. Negative data goes missing, for all treatments, in all areas of science. The regulators and professional bodies we would reasonably expect to stamp out such practices have failed us.\n\nIn a few pages, we will walk through the literature that demonstrates all of this beyond any doubt, showing that \u2018publication bias\u2019 \u2013 the process whereby negative results go unpublished \u2013 is endemic throughout the whole of medicine and academia; and that regulators have failed to do anything about it, despite decades of data showing the size of the problem. But before we get to that research, I need you to feel its implications, so we need to think about why missing data matters.\n\nEvidence is the only way we can possibly know if something works \u2013 or doesn\u2019t work \u2013 in medicine. We proceed by testing things, as cautiously as we can, in head-to-head trials, and gathering together all of the evidence. This last step is crucial: if I withhold half the data from you, it\u2019s very easy for me to convince you of something that isn\u2019t true. If I toss a coin a hundred times, for example, but only tell you about the results when it lands heads-up, I can convince you that this is a two-headed coin. But that doesn\u2019t mean I really do have a two-headed coin: it means I\u2019m misleading you, and you\u2019re a fool for letting me get away with it. This is exactly the situation we tolerate in medicine, and always have. Researchers are free to do as many trials as they wish, and then choose which ones to publish.\n\nThe repercussions of this go way beyond simply misleading doctors about the benefits and harms of interventions for patients, and way beyond trials. Medical research isn\u2019t an abstract academic pursuit: it\u2019s about people, so every time we fail to publish a piece of research we expose real, living people to unnecessary, avoidable suffering.\nTGN1412\n\nIn March 2006, six volunteers arrived at a London hospital to take place in a trial. It was the first time a new drug called TGN1412 had ever been given to humans, and they were paid \u00a32,000 each.7 Within an hour these six men developed headaches, muscle aches, and a feeling of unease. Then things got worse: high temperatures, restlessness, periods of forgetting who and where they were. Soon they were shivering, flushed, their pulses racing, their blood pressure falling. Then, a cliff: one went into respiratory failure, the oxygen levels in his blood falling rapidly as his lungs filled with fluid. Nobody knew why. Another dropped his blood pressure to just 65/40, stopped breathing properly, and was rushed to an intensive care unit, knocked out, intubated, mechanically ventilated. Within a day all six were disastrously unwell: fluid on their lungs, struggling to breathe, their kidneys failing, their blood clotting uncontrollably throughout their bodies, and their white blood cells disappearing. Doctors threw everything they could at them: steroids, antihistamines, immune-system receptor blockers. All six were ventilated on intensive care. They stopped producing urine; they were all put on dialysis; their blood was replaced, first slowly, then rapidly; they needed plasma, red cells, platelets. The fevers continued. One developed pneumonia. And then the blood stopped getting to their peripheries. Their fingers and toes went flushed, then brown, then black, and then began to rot and die. With heroic effort, all escaped, at least, with their lives.\n\nThe Department of Health convened an Expert Scientific Group to try to understand what had happened, and from this two concerns were raised.8 Firstly: can we stop things like this from happening again? It\u2019s plainly foolish, for example, to give a new experimental treatment to all six participants in a \u2018first-in-man\u2019 trial at the same time, if that treatment is a completely unknown quantity. New drugs should be given to participants in a staggered process, slowly, over a day. This idea received considerable attention from regulators and the media.\n\nLess noted was a second concern: could we have foreseen this disaster? TGN1412 is a molecule that attaches to a receptor called CD28 on the white blood cells of the immune system. It was a new and experimental treatment, and it interfered with the immune system in ways that are poorly understood, and hard to model in animals (unlike, say, blood pressure, because immune systems are very variable between different species). But as the final report found, there was experience with a similar intervention: it had simply not been published. One researcher presented the inquiry with unpublished data on a study he had conducted in a single human subject a full ten years earlier, using an antibody that attached to the CD3, CD2 and CD28 receptors. The effects of this antibody had parallels with those of TGN1412, and the subject on whom it was tested had become unwell. But nobody could possibly have known that, because these results were never shared with the scientific community. They sat unpublished, unknown, when they could have helped save six men from a terrifying, destructive, avoidable ordeal.\n\nThat original researcher could not foresee the specific harm he contributed to, and it\u2019s hard to blame him as an individual, because he operated in an academic culture where leaving data unpublished was regarded as completely normal. The same culture exists today. The final report on TGN1412 concluded that sharing the results of all first-in-man studies was essential: they should be published, every last one, as a matter of routine. But phase 1 trial results weren\u2019t published then, and they\u2019re still not published now. In 2009, for the first time, a study was published looking specifically at how many of these first-in-man trials get published, and how many remain hidden.9 They took all such trials approved by one ethics committee over a year. After four years, nine out of ten remain unpublished; after eight years, four out of five were still unpublished.\n\nIn medicine, as we shall see time and again, research is not abstract: it relates directly to life, death, suffering and pain. With every one of these unpublished studies we are potentially exposed, quite unnecessarily, to another TGN1412. Even a huge international news story, with horrific images of young men brandishing blackened feet and hands from hospital beds, wasn\u2019t enough to get movement, because the issue of missing data is too complicated to fit in one sentence.\n\nWhen we don\u2019t share the results of basic research, such as a small first-in-man study, we expose people to unnecessary risks in the future. Was this an extreme case? Is the problem limited to early, experimental, new drugs, in small groups of trial participants? No.\n\nIn the 1980s, doctors began giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to all patients who\u2019d had a heart attack. This practice made perfect sense on paper: we knew that anti-arrhythmic drugs helped prevent abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that people who\u2019ve had a heart attack are quite likely to have abnormal heart rhythms; we also knew that often these went unnoticed, undiagnosed and untreated. Giving anti-arrhythmic drugs to everyone who\u2019d had a heart attack was a simple, sensible, preventive measure.\n\nUnfortunately, it turned out that we were wrong. This prescribing practice, with the best of intentions, on the best of principles, actually killed people. And because heart attacks are very common, it killed them in very large numbers: well over 100,000 people died unnecessarily before it was realised that the fine balance between benefit and risk was completely different for patients without a proven abnormal heart rhythm.\n\nCould anyone have predicted this? Sadly, yes, they could have. A trial in 1980 tested a new anti-arrhythmic drug, lorcainide, in a small number of men who\u2019d had a heart attack \u2013 less than a hundred \u2013 to see if it was any use. Nine out of forty-eight men on lorcainide died, compared with one out of forty-seven on placebo. The drug was early in its development cycle, and not long after this study it was dropped for commercial reasons. Because it wasn\u2019t on the market, nobody even thought to publish the trial. The researchers assumed it was an idiosyncrasy of their molecule, and gave it no further thought. If they had published, we would have been much more cautious about trying other anti-arrhythmic drugs on people with heart attacks, and the phenomenal death toll \u2013 over 100,000 people in their graves prematurely \u2013 might have been stopped sooner. More than a decade later, the researchers finally did publish their results, with a mea culpa, recognising the harm they had done by not sharing them earlier:\n\nWhen we carried out our study in 1980, we thought that the increased death rate that occurred in the lorcainide group was an effect of chance. The development of lorcainide was abandoned for commercial reasons, and this study was therefore never published; it is now a good example of \u2018publication bias\u2019. The results described here might have provided an early warning of trouble ahead.10\n\nAs we shall shortly see, this problem of unpublished data is widespread throughout medicine, and indeed the whole of academia, even though the scale of the problem, and the harm it causes, have been documented beyond any doubt. We will see stories on basic cancer research, Tamiflu, cholesterol blockbusters, obesity drugs, antidepressants and more, with evidence that goes from the dawn of medicine to the present day, and data that is still being withheld, right now, as I write, on widely used drugs which many of you reading this book will have taken this morning. We will also see how regulators and academic bodies have repeatedly failed to address the problem.\n\nBecause researchers are free to bury any result they please, patients are exposed to harm on a staggering scale throughout the whole of medicine, from research to practice. Doctors can have no idea about the true effects of the treatments they give. Does this drug really work best, or have I simply been deprived of half the data? Nobody can tell. Is this expensive drug worth the money, or have the data simply been massaged? No one can tell. Will this drug kill patients? Is there any evidence that it\u2019s dangerous? No one can tell.\n\nThis is a bizarre situation to arise in medicine, a discipline where everything is supposed to be based on evidence, and where everyday practice is bound up in medico-legal anxiety. In one of the most regulated corners of human conduct we\u2019ve taken our eyes off the ball, and allowed the evidence driving practice to be polluted and distorted. It seems unimaginable. We will now see how deep this problem goes.\n\nWhy we summarise data\n\nMissing data has been studied extensively in medicine. But before I lay out that evidence, we need to understand exactly why it matters, from a scientific perspective. And for that we need to understand systematic reviews and \u2018meta-analysis\u2019. Between them, these are two of the most powerful ideas in modern medicine. They are incredibly simple, but they were invented shockingly late.\n\nWhen we want to find out if something works or not, we do a trial. This is a very simple process, and the first recorded attempt at some kind of trial was in the Bible (Daniel 1:12, if you\u2019re interested). Firstly, you need an unanswered question: for example, \u2018Does giving steroids to a woman delivering a premature baby increase the chances of that baby surviving?\u2019 Then you find some relevant participants, in this case, mothers about to deliver a premature baby. You\u2019ll need a reasonable number of them, let\u2019s say two hundred for this trial. Then you divide them into two groups at random, give the mothers in one group the current best treatment (whatever that is in your town), while the mothers in the other group get current best treatment plus some steroids. Finally, when all two hundred women have gone through your trial, you count up how many babies survived in each group.\n\nThis is a real-world question, and lots of trials were done on this topic, starting from 1972 onwards: two trials showed that steroids saved lives, but five showed no significant benefit. Now, you will often hear that doctors disagree when the evidence is mixed, and this is exactly that kind of situation. A doctor with a strong pre-existing belief that steroids work \u2013 perhaps preoccupied with some theoretical molecular mechanism, by which the drug might do something useful in the body \u2013 could come along and say: \u2018Look at these two positive trials! Of course we must give steroids!\u2019 A doctor with a strong prior intuition that steroids were rubbish might point at the five negative trials and say: \u2018Overall the evidence shows no benefit. Why take a risk?\u2019\n\nUp until very recently, this was basically how medicine progressed. People would write long, languorous review articles \u2013 essays surveying the literature \u2013 in which they would cite the trial data they\u2019d come across in a completely unsystematic fashion, often reflecting their own prejudices and values. Then, in the 1980s, people began to do something called a \u2018systematic review\u2019. This is a clear, systematic survey of the literature, with the intention of getting all the trial data you can possibly find on one topic, without being biased towards any particular set of findings. In a systematic review, you describe exactly how you looked for data: which databases you searched, which search engines and indexes you used, even what words you searched for. You pre-specify the kinds of studies that can be included in your review, and then you present everything you\u2019ve found, including the papers you rejected, with an explanation of why. By doing this, you ensure that your methods are fully transparent, replicable and open to criticism, providing the reader with a clear and complete picture of the evidence. It may sound like a simple idea, but systematic reviews are extremely rare outside clinical medicine, and are quietly one of the most important and transgressive ideas of the past forty years.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got all the trial data in one place, you can conduct something called a meta-analysis, where you bring all the results together in one giant spreadsheet, pool all the data and get one single, summary figure, the most accurate summary of all the data on one clinical question. The output of this is called a \u2018blobbogram\u2019, and you can see one on the opposite page, in the logo of the Cochrane Collaboration, a global, non-profit academic organisation that has been producing gold-standard reviews of evidence on important questions in medicine since the 1980s.\n\nThis blobbogram shows the results of all the trials done on giving steroids to help premature babies survive. Each horizontal line is a trial: if that line is further to the left, then the trial showed steroids were beneficial and saved lives. The central, vertical line is the \u2018line of no effect\u2019: and if the horizontal line of the trial touches the line of no effect, then that trial showed no statistically significant benefit. Some trials are represented by longer horizontal lines: these were smaller trials, with fewer participants, which means they are prone to more error, so the estimate of the benefit has more uncertainty, and therefore the horizontal line is longer. Finally, the diamond at the bottom shows the \u2018summary effect\u2019: this is the overall benefit of the intervention, pooling together the results of all the individual trials. These are much narrower than the lines for individual trials, because the estimate is much more accurate: it is summarising the effect of the drug in many more patients. On this blobbogram you can see \u2013 because the diamond is a long way from the line of no effect \u2013 that giving steroids is hugely beneficial. In fact, it reduces the chances of a premature baby dying by almost half.\n\nThe amazing thing about this blobbogram is that it had to be invented, and this happened very late in medicine\u2019s history. For many years we had all the information we needed to know that steroids saved lives, but nobody knew they were effective, because nobody did a systematic review until 1989. As a result, the treatment wasn\u2019t given widely, and huge numbers of babies died unnecessarily; not because we didn\u2019t have the information, but simply because we didn\u2019t synthesise it together properly.\n\nIn case you think this is an isolated case, it\u2019s worth examining exactly how broken medicine was until frighteningly recent times. The diagram on the opposite page contains two blobbograms, or \u2018forest plots\u2019, showing all the trials ever conducted to see whether giving streptokinase, a clot-busting drug, improves survival in patients who have had a heart attack.11\n\nLook first only at the forest plot on the left. This is a conventional forest plot, from an academic journal, so it\u2019s a little busier than the stylised one in the Cochrane logo. The principles, however, are exactly the same. Each horizontal line is a trial, and you can see that there is a hodgepodge of results, with some trials showing a benefit (they don\u2019t touch the vertical line of no effect, headed \u20181\u2019) and some showing no benefit (they do cross that line). At the bottom, however, you can see the summary effect \u2013 a dot on this old-fashioned blobbogram, rather than a diamond. And you can see very clearly that overall, streptokinase saves lives.\n\nSo what\u2019s that on the right? It\u2019s something called a cumulative meta-analysis. If you look at the list of studies on the left of the diagram, you can see that they are arranged in order of date. The cumulative meta-analysis on the right adds in each new trial\u2019s results, as they arrived over history, to the previous trials\u2019 results. This gives the best possible running estimate, each year, of how the evidence would have looked at that time, if anyone had bothered to do a meta-analysis on all the data available to them. From this cumulative blobbogram you can see that the horizontal lines, the \u2018summary effects\u2019, narrow over time as more and more data is collected, and the estimate of the overall benefit of this treatment becomes more accurate. You can also see that these horizontal lines stopped touching the vertical line of no effect a very long time ago \u2013 and crucially, they do so a long time before we started giving streptokinase to everyone with a heart attack.\n\nIn case you haven\u2019t spotted it for yourself already \u2013 to be fair, the entire medical profession was slow to catch on \u2013 this chart has devastating implications. Heart attacks are an incredibly common cause of death. We had a treatment that worked, and we had all the information we needed to know that it worked, but once again we didn\u2019t bring it together systematically to get that correct answer. Half of the people in those trials at the bottom of the blobbogram were randomly assigned to receive no streptokinase, I think unethically, because we had all the information we needed to know that streptokinase worked: they were deprived of effective treatments. But they weren\u2019t alone, because so were most of the rest of the people in the world at the time.\n\nThese stories illustrate, I hope, why systematic reviews and meta-analyses are so important: we need to bring together all of the evidence on a question, not just cherry-pick the bits that we stumble upon, or intuitively like the look of. Mercifully the medical profession has come to recognise this over the past couple of decades, and systematic reviews with meta-analyses are now used almost universally, to ensure that we have the most accurate possible summary of all the trials that have been done on a particular medical question.\n\nBut these stories also demonstrate why missing trial results are so dangerous. If one researcher or doctor \u2018cherry-picks\u2019, when summarising the existing evidence, and looks only at the trials that support their hunch, then they can produce a misleading picture of the research. That is a problem for that one individual (and for anyone who is unwise or unlucky enough to be influenced by them). But if we are all missing the negative trials, the entire medical and academic community, around the world, then when we pool the evidence to get the best possible view of what works \u2013 as we must do \u2013 we are all completely misled. We get a misleading impression of the treatment\u2019s effectiveness: we incorrectly exaggerate its benefits; or perhaps even find incorrectly that an intervention was beneficial, when in reality it did harm.\n\nNow that you understand the importance of systematic reviews, you can see why missing data matters. But you can also appreciate that when I explain how much trial data is missing, I am giving you a clean overview of the literature, because I will be explaining that evidence using systematic reviews.\n\nHow much data is missing?\n\nIf you want to prove that trials have been left unpublished, you have an interesting problem: you need to prove the existence of studies you don\u2019t have access to. To work around this, people have developed a simple approach: you identify a group of trials you know have been conducted and completed, then check to see if they have been published. Finding a list of completed trials is the tricky part of this job, and to achieve it people have used various strategies: trawling the lists of trials that have been approved by ethics committees (or \u2018institutional review boards\u2019 in the USA), for example; or chasing up the trials discussed by researchers at conferences.\n\nIn 2008 a group of researchers decided to check for publication of every trial that had ever been reported to the US Food and Drug Administration for all the antidepressants that came onto the market between 1987 and 2004.12 This was no small task. The FDA archives contain a reasonable amount of information on all the trials that were submitted to the regulator in order to get a licence for a new drug. But that\u2019s not all the trials, by any means, because those conducted after the drug has come onto the market will not appear there; and the information that is provided by the FDA is hard to search, and often scanty. But it is an important subset of the trials, and more than enough for us to begin exploring how often trials go missing, and why. It\u2019s also a representative slice of trials from all the major drug companies.\n\nThe researchers found seventy-four studies in total, representing 12,500 patients\u2019 worth of data. Thirty-eight of these trials had positive results, and found that the new drug worked; thirty-six were negative. The results were therefore an even split between success and failure for the drugs, in reality. Then the researchers set about looking for these trials in the published academic literature, the material available to doctors and patients. This provided a very different picture. Thirty-seven of the positive trials \u2013 all but one \u2013 were published in full, often with much fanfare. But the trials with negative results had a very different fate: only three were published. Twenty-two were simply lost to history, never appearing anywhere other than in those dusty, disorganised, thin FDA files. The remaining eleven which had negative results in the FDA summaries did appear in the academic literature, but were written up as if the drug was a success. If you think this sounds absurd, I agree: we will see in Chapter 4, on \u2018bad trials\u2019, how a study\u2019s results can be reworked and polished to distort and exaggerate its findings.\n\nThis was a remarkable piece of work, spread over twelve drugs from all the major manufacturers, with no stand-out bad guy. It very clearly exposed a broken system: in reality we have thirty-eight positive trials and thirty-six negative ones; in the academic literature we have forty-eight positive trials and three negative ones. Take a moment to flip back and forth between those in your mind: \u2018thirty-eight positive trials, thirty-six negative\u2019; or \u2018forty-eight positive trials and only three negative\u2019.\n\nIf we were talking about one single study, from one single group of researchers, who decided to delete half their results because they didn\u2019t give the overall picture they wanted, then we would quite correctly call that act \u2018research misconduct\u2019. Yet somehow when exactly the same phenomenon occurs, but with whole studies going missing, by the hands of hundreds and thousands of individuals, spread around the world, in both the public and private sector, we accept it as a normal part of life.13 It passes by, under the watchful eyes of regulators and professional bodies who do nothing, as routine, despite the undeniable impact it has on patients.\n\nEven more strange is this: we\u2019ve known about the problem of negative studies going missing for almost as long as people have been doing serious science.\n\nThis was first formally documented by a psychologist called Theodore Sterling in 1959.14 He went through every paper published in the four big psychology journals of the time, and found that 286 out of 294 reported a statistically significant result. This, he explained, was plainly fishy: it couldn\u2019t possibly be a fair representation of every study that had been conducted, because if we believed that, we\u2019d have to believe that almost every theory ever tested by a psychologist in an experiment had turned out to be correct. If psychologists really were so great at predicting results, there\u2019d hardly be any point in bothering to run experiments at all. In 1995, at the end of his career, the same researcher came back to the same question, half a lifetime later, and found that almost nothing had changed.15\n\nSterling was the first to put these ideas into a formal academic context, but the basic truth had been recognised for many centuries. Francis Bacon explained in 1620 that we often mislead ourselves by only remembering the times something worked, and forgetting those when it didn\u2019t.16 Fowler in 1786 listed the cases he\u2019d seen treated with arsenic, and pointed out that he could have glossed over the failures, as others might be tempted to do, but had included them.17 To do otherwise, he explained, would have been misleading.\n\nYet it was only three decades ago that people started to realise that missing trials posed a serious problem for medicine. In 1980 Elina Hemminki found that almost half the trials conducted in the mid-1970s in Finland and Sweden had been left unpublished.18 Then, in 1986, an American researcher called Robert Simes decided to investigate the trials on a new treatment for ovarian cancer. This was an important study, because it looked at a life-or-death question. Combination chemotherapy for this kind of cancer has very tough side effects, and knowing this, many researchers had hoped it might be better to give a single \u2018alkylating agent\u2019 drug first, before moving on to full chemotherapy. Simes looked at all the trials published on this question in the academic literature, read by doctors and academics. From this, giving a single drug first looked like a great idea: women with advanced ovarian cancer (which is not a good diagnosis to have) who were on the alkylating agent alone were significantly more likely to survive longer.\n\nThen Simes had a smart idea. He knew that sometimes trials can go unpublished, and he had heard that papers with less \u2018exciting\u2019 results are the most likely to go missing. To prove that this has happened, though, is a tricky business: you need to find a fair, representative sample of all the trials that have been conducted, and then compare their results with the smaller pool of trials that have been published, to see if there are any embarrassing differences. There was no easy way to get this information from the medicines regulator (we will discuss this problem in some detail later), so instead he went to the International Cancer Research Data Bank. This contained a register of interesting trials that were happening in the USA, including most of the ones funded by the government, and many others from around the world. It was by no means a complete list, but it did have one crucial feature: the trials were registered before their results came in, so any list compiled from this source would be, if not complete, at least a representative sample of all the research that had ever been done, and not biased by whether their results were positive or negative.\n\nWhen Simes compared the results of the published trials against the pre-registered trials, the results were disturbing. Looking at the academic literature \u2013 the studies that researchers and journal editors chose to publish \u2013 alkylating agents alone looked like a great idea, reducing the rate of death from advanced ovarian cancer significantly. But when you looked only at the pre-registered trials \u2013 the unbiased, fair sample of all the trials ever conducted \u2013 the new treatment was no better than old-fashioned chemotherapy.\n\nSimes immediately recognised \u2013 as I hope you will too \u2013 that the question of whether one form of cancer treatment is better than another was small fry compared to the depth charge he was about to set off in the medical literature. Everything we thought we knew about whether treatments worked or not was probably distorted, to an extent that might be hard to measure, but that would certainly have a major impact on patient care. We were seeing the positive results, and missing the negative ones. There was one clear thing we should do about this: start a registry of all clinical trials, demand that people register their study before they start, and insist that they publish the results at the end.\n\nThat was 1986. Since then, a generation later, we have done very badly. In this book, I promise I won\u2019t overwhelm you with data. But at the same time, I don\u2019t want any drug company, or government regulator, or professional body, or anyone who doubts this whole story, to have any room to wriggle. So I\u2019ll now go through all the evidence on missing trials, as briefly as possible, showing the main approaches that have been used. All of what you are about to read comes from the most current systematic reviews on the subject, so you can be sure that it is a fair and unbiased summary of the results.\n\nOne research approach is to get all the trials that a medicines regulator has record of, from the very early ones done for the purposes of getting a licence for a new drug, and then check to see if they all appear in the academic literature. That\u2019s the method we saw used in the paper mentioned above, where researchers sought out every paper on twelve antidepressants, and found that a 50/50 split of positive and negative results turned into forty-eight positive papers and just three negative ones. This method has been used extensively in several different areas of medicine:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Lee and colleagues, for example, looked for all of the 909 trials \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0submitted alongside marketing applications for all ninety new \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0drugs that came onto the market from 2001 to 2002: they \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0found that 66 per cent of the trials with significant results \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0were published, compared with only 36 per cent of the rest.19\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Melander, in 2003, looked for all forty-two trials on five \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0antidepressants that were submitted to the Swedish drug \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regulator in the process of getting a marketing authorisation: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0all twenty-one studies with significant results were published; \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0only 81 per cent of those finding no benefit were published.20\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Rising et al., in 2008, found more of those distorted write-ups \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that we\u2019ll be dissecting later: they looked for all trials on two \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0years\u2019 worth of approved drugs. In the FDA\u2019s summary of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the results, once those could be found, there were 164 trials. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those with favourable outcomes were a full four times more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0likely to be published in academic papers than those with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0negative outcomes. On top of that, four of the trials with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0negative outcomes changed, once they appeared in the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0academic literature, to favour the drug.21\n\nIf you prefer, you can look at conference presentations: a huge amount of research gets presented at conferences, but our current best estimate is that only about half of it ever appears in the academic literature.22 Studies presented only at conferences are almost impossible to find, or cite, and are especially hard to assess, because so little information is available on the specific methods used in the research (often as little as a paragraph). And as you will see shortly, not every trial is a fair test of a treatment. Some can be biased by design, so these details matter.\n\nThe most recent systematic review of studies looking at what happens to conference papers was done in 2010, and it found thirty separate studies looking at whether negative conference presentations \u2013 in fields as diverse as anaesthetics, cystic fibrosis, oncology, and A&E \u2013 disappear before becoming fully-fledged academic papers.23 Overwhelmingly, unflattering results are much more likely to go missing.\n\nIf you\u2019re very lucky, you can track down a list of trials whose existence was publicly recorded before they were started, perhaps on a register that was set up to explore that very question. From the pharmaceutical industry, up until very recently, you\u2019d be very lucky to find such a list in the public domain. For publicly-funded research the story is a little different, and here we start to learn a new lesson: although the vast majority of trials are conducted by the industry, with the result that they set the tone for the community, this phenomenon is not limited to the commercial sector.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0By 1997 there were already four studies in a systematic review \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0on this approach. They found that studies with significant \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0results were two and a half times more likely to get \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0published than those without.24\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0A paper from 1998 looked at all trials from two groups of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0triallists sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health over \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the preceding ten years, and found, again, that studies with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0significant results were more likely to be published.25\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Another looked at drug trials notified to the Finnish National \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agency, and found that 47 per cent of the positive results \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0were published, but only 11 per cent of the negative ones.26\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*\u00a0Another looked at all the trials that had passed through the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0pharmacy department of an eye hospital since 1963: 93 per \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cent of the significant results were published, but only 70 per \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0cent of the negative ones.27\n\nThe point being made in this blizzard of data is simple: this is not an under-researched area; the evidence has been with us for a long time, and it is neither contradictory nor ambiguous.\n\nTwo French studies in 2005 and 2006 took a new approach: they went to ethics committees, and got lists of all the studies they had approved, and then found out from the investigators whether the trials had produced positive or negative results, before finally tracking down the published academic papers.28 The first study found that significant results were twice as likely to be published; the second that they were four times as likely. In Britain, two researchers sent a questionnaire to all the lead investigators on 101 projects paid for by NHS R&D: it\u2019s not industry research, but it\u2019s worth noting anyway. This produced an unusual result: there was no statistically significant difference in the publication rates of positive and negative papers.29\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough simply to list studies. Systematically taking all the evidence that we have so far, what do we see overall?\n\nIt\u2019s not ideal to lump every study of this type together in one giant spreadsheet, to produce a summary figure on publication bias, because they are all very different, in different fields, with different methods. This is a concern in many meta-analyses (though it shouldn\u2019t be overstated: if there are lots of trials comparing one treatment against placebo, say, and they\u2019re all using the same outcome measurement, then you might be fine just lumping them all in together).\n\nBut you can reasonably put some of these studies together in groups. The most current systematic review on publication bias, from 2010, from which the examples above are taken, draws together the evidence from various fields.30 Twelve comparable studies follow up conference presentations, and taken together they find that a study with a significant finding is 1.62 times more likely to be published. For the four studies taking lists of trials from before they started, overall, significant results were 2.4 times more likely to be published. Those are our best estimates of the scale of the problem. They are current, and they are damning.\n\nAll of this missing data is not simply an abstract academic matter: in the real world of medicine, published evidence is used to make treatment decisions. This problem goes to the core of everything that doctors do, so it\u2019s worth considering in some detail what impact it has on medical practice. Firstly, as we saw in the case of reboxetine, doctors and patients are misled about the effects of the medicines they use, and can end up making decisions that cause avoidable suffering, or even death. We might also choose unnecessarily expensive treatments, having been misled into thinking they are more effective than cheaper older drugs. This wastes money, ultimately depriving patients of other treatments, since funding for health care is never infinite.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth being clear that this data is withheld from everyone in medicine, from top to bottom. NICE, for example, is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, created by the British government to conduct careful, unbiased summaries of all the evidence on new treatments. It is unable either to identify or to access data that has been withheld by researchers or companies on a drug\u2019s effectiveness: NICE has no more legal right to that data than you or I do, even though it is making decisions about effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness, on behalf of the NHS, for millions of people. In fact, as we shall see, the MHRA and EMA (the European Medicines Agency) \u2013 the regulators that decide which drugs can go on the market in the UK \u2013 often have access to this information, but do not share it with the public, with doctors, or with NICE. This is an extraordinary and perverse situation.\n\nSo, while doctors are kept in the dark, patients are exposed to inferior treatments, ineffective treatments, unnecessary treatments, and unnecessarily expensive treatments that are no better than cheap ones; governments pay for unnecessarily expensive treatments, and mop up the cost of harms created by inadequate or harmful treatment; and individual participants in trials, such as those in the TGN1412 study, are exposed to terrifying, life-threatening ordeals, resulting in lifelong scars, again quite unnecessarily.\n\nAt the same time, the whole of the research project in medicine is retarded, as vital negative results are held back from those who could use them. This affects everyone, but it is especially egregious in the world of \u2018orphan diseases\u2019, medical problems that affect only small numbers of patients, because these corners of medicine are already short of resources, and are neglected by the research departments of most drug companies, since the opportunities for revenue are thinner. People working on orphan diseases will often research existing drugs that have been tried and failed in other conditions, but that have theoretical potential for the orphan disease. If the data from earlier work on these drugs in other diseases is missing, then the job of researching them for the orphan disease is both harder and more dangerous: perhaps they have already been shown to have benefits or effects that would help accelerate research; perhaps they have already been shown to be actively harmful when used on other diseases, and there are important safety signals that would help protect future research participants from harm. Nobody can tell you.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most shamefully, when we allow unflattering data to go unpublished, we betray the patients who participated in these studies: the people who have given their bodies, and sometimes their lives, in the implicit belief that they are doing something to create new knowledge, that will benefit others in the same position as them in the future. In fact, their belief is not implicit: often it\u2019s exactly what we tell them, as researchers, and it is a lie, because the data might be withheld, and we know it.\n\nSo whose fault is this?\n\nWhy do negative trials disappear?\n\nIn a moment we will see more clear cases of drug companies withholding data \u2013 in stories where we can identify individuals \u2013 sometimes with the assistance of regulators. When we get to these, I hope your rage might swell. But first, it\u2019s worth taking a moment to recognise that publication bias occurs outside commercial drug development, and in completely unrelated fields of academia, where people are motivated only by reputation, and their own personal interests.\n\nIn many respects, after all, publication bias is a very human process. If you\u2019ve done a study and it didn\u2019t have an exciting, positive result, then you might wrongly conclude that your experiment isn\u2019t very interesting to other researchers. There\u2019s also the issue of incentives: academics are often measured, rather unhelpfully, by crude metrics like the numbers of citations for their papers, and the number of \u2018high-impact\u2019 studies they get into glamorous well-read journals. If negative findings are harder to publish in bigger journals, and less likely to be cited by other academics, then the incentives to work at disseminating them are lower. With a positive finding, meanwhile, you get a sense of discovering something new. Everyone around you is excited, because your results are exceptional.\n\nOne clear illustration of this problem came in 2010. A mainstream American psychology researcher called Daryl Bem published a competent academic paper, in a well-respected journal, showing evidence of precognition, the ability to see into the future.fn1 These studies were well-designed, and the findings were statistically significant, but many people weren\u2019t very convinced, for the same reasons you aren\u2019t: if humans really could see into the future, we\u2019d probably know about it already; and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, rather than one-off findings.\n\nBut in fact the study has been replicated, though Bem\u2019s positive results have not been. At least two groups of academics have rerun several of Bem\u2019s experiments, using the exact same methods, and both found no evidence of precognition. One group submitted their negative results to the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, \u2013 the very same journal that published Bem\u2019s paper in 2010 \u2013 and that journal rejected their paper out of hand. The editor even came right out and said it: we never publish studies that replicate other work.\n\nHere we see the same problem as in medicine: positive findings are more likely to be published than negative ones. Every now and then, a freak positive result is published showing, for example, that people can see into the future. Who knows how many psychologists have tried, over the years, to find evidence of psychic powers, running elaborate, time-consuming experiments, on dozens of subjects \u2013 maybe hundreds \u2013 and then found no evidence that such powers exist? Any scientist trying to publish such a \u2018So what?\u2019 finding would struggle to get a journal to take it seriously, at the best of times. Even with the clear target of Bem\u2019s paper on precognition, which was widely covered in serious newspapers across Europe and the USA, the academic journal with a proven recent interest in the question of precognition simply refused to publish a paper with a negative result. Yet replicating these findings was key \u2013 Bem himself said so in his paper \u2013 so keeping track of the negative replications is vital too.\n\nPeople working in real labs will tell you that sometimes an experiment can fail to produce a positive result many times before the outcome you\u2019re hoping for appears. What does that mean? Sometimes the failures will be the result of legitimate technical problems; but sometimes they will be vitally important statistical context, perhaps even calling the main finding of the research into question. Many research findings, remember, are not absolute black-and-white outcomes, but fragile statistical correlations. Under our current system, most of this contextual information about failure is just brushed under the carpet, and this has huge ramifications for the cost of replicating research, in ways that are not immediately obvious. For example, researchers failing to replicate an initial finding may not know if they\u2019ve failed because the original result was an overstated fluke, or because they\u2019ve made some kind of mistake in their methods. In fact, the cost of proving that a finding was wrong is vastly greater than the cost of making it in the first place, because you need to run the experiment many more times to prove the absence of a finding, simply because of the way that the statistics of detecting weak effects work; and you also need to be absolutely certain that you\u2019ve excluded all technical problems, to avoid getting egg on your face if your replication turns out to have been inadequate. These barriers to refutation may partly explain why it\u2019s so easy to get away with publishing findings that ultimately turn out to be wrong.31\n\nPublication bias is not just a problem in the more abstract corners of psychology research. In 2012 a group of researchers reported in the journal Nature how they tried to replicate fifty-three early laboratory studies of promising targets for cancer treatments: forty-seven of the fifty-three could not be replicated.32 This study has serious implications for the development of new drugs in medicine, because such unreplicable findings are not simply an abstract academic issue: researchers build theories on the back of them, trust that they\u2019re valid, and investigate the same idea using other methods. If they are simply being led down the garden path, chasing up fluke errors, then huge amounts of research money and effort are being wasted, and the discovery of new medical treatments is being seriously retarded.\n\nThe authors of the study were clear on both the cause of and the solution for this problem. Fluke findings, they explained, are often more likely to be submitted to journals \u2013 and more likely to be published \u2013 than boring, negative ones. We should give more incentives to academics for publishing negative results; but we should also give them more opportunity.\n\nThis means changing the behaviour of academic journals, and here we are faced with a problem. Although they are usually academics themselves, journal editors have their own interests and agendas, and have more in common with everyday journalists and newspaper editors than some of them might wish to admit, as the episode of the precognition experiment above illustrates very clearly. Whether journals like this are a sensible model for communicating research at all is a hotly debated subject in academia, but this is the current situation. Journals are the gatekeepers, they make decisions on what\u2019s relevant and interesting for their audience, and they compete for readers.\n\nThis can lead them to behave in ways that don\u2019t reflect the best interests of science, because an individual journal\u2019s desire to provide colourful content might conflict with the collective need to provide a comprehensive picture of the evidence. In newspaper journalism, there is a well-known aphorism: \u2018When a dog bites a man, that\u2019s not news; but when a man bites a dog \u2026\u2019 These judgements on newsworthiness in mainstream media have even been demonstrated quantitatively. One study in 2003, for example, looked at the BBC\u2019s health news coverage over several months, and calculated how many people had to die from a given cause for one story to appear. 8,571 people died from smoking for each story about smoking; but there were three stories for every death from new variant CJD, or \u2018mad cow disease\u2019.33 Another, in 1992, looked at print-media coverage of drug deaths, and found that you needed 265 deaths from paracetamol poisoning for one story about such a death to appear in a paper; but every death from MDMA received, on average, one piece of news coverage.34\n\nIf similar judgements are influencing the content of academic journals, then we have a problem. But can it really be the case that academic journals are the bottleneck, preventing doctors and academics from having access to unflattering trial results about the safety and effectiveness of the drugs they use? This argument is commonly deployed by industry, and researchers too are often keen to blame journals for rejecting negative findings en masse. Luckily, this has been the subject of some research; and overall, while journals aren\u2019t blameless, it\u2019s hard to claim that they are the main source of this serious public-health problem. This is especially so since there are whole academic journals dedicated to publishing clinical trials, with a commitment to publishing negative results written into their constitutions.\n\nBut to be kind, for the sake of completeness, and because industry and researchers are so keen to pass the blame on to academic journals, we can see if what they claim is true.\n\nOne survey simply asked the authors of unpublished work if they had ever submitted it for publication. One hundred and twenty-four unpublished results were identified, by following up on every study approved by a group of US ethics committees, and when the researchers contacted the teams behind the unpublished results, it turned out that only six papers had ever actually been submitted and rejected.35 Perhaps, you might say, this was a freak finding. Another approach is to follow up all the papers submitted to one journal, and see if those with negative results are rejected more often. Where this has been tried, the journals seem blameless: 745 manuscripts submitted to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) were followed up, and there was no difference in acceptance rate for significant and non-significant findings.36 The same thing has been tried with papers submitted to the BMJ, the Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine and the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.37 Again and again, no effect was found. Some have argued that this might still represent evidence of editorial bias, if academics know that manuscripts with negative results have to be of higher quality before submission, to get past editors\u2019 prejudices. It\u2019s also possible that the journals played fair when they knew they were being watched, although turning around an entire publishing operation for one brief performance would be tough.\n\nThese studies all involved observing what has happened in normal practice. One last option is to run an experiment, sending identical papers to various journals, but changing the direction of the results at random, to see if that makes any difference to the acceptance rates. This isn\u2019t something you\u2019d want to do very often, because it wastes a lot of people\u2019s time; but since publication bias matters, it has been regarded as a justifiable intrusion on a few occasions.\n\nIn 1990 a researcher called Epstein created a series of fictitious papers, with identical methods and presentation, differing only in whether they reported positive or negative results. He sent them at random to 146 social-work journals: the positive papers were accepted 35 per cent of the time, and the negative ones 26 per cent of the time, a difference that wasn\u2019t large enough to be statistically significant.38\n\nOther studies have tried something similar on a smaller scale, not submitting a paper to a journal, but rather, with the assistance of the journal, sending spoof academic papers to individual peer reviewers: these people do not make the final decision on publication, but they do give advice to editors, so a window into their behaviour would be useful. These studies have had more mixed results. In one from 1977, sham papers with identical methods but different results were sent to seventy-five reviewers. Some bias was found from reviewers against findings that disagreed with their own views.39\n\nAnother study, from 1994, looked at reviewers\u2019 responses to a paper on TENS machines: these are fairly controversial devices sold for pain relief. Thirty-three reviewers with strong views one way or the other were identified, and again it was found that their judgements on the paper were broadly correlated with their pre-existing views, though the study was small.40 Another paper did the same thing with papers on quack treatments; it found that the direction of findings had no effect on reviewers from mainstream medical journals deciding whether to accept them.41\n\nOne final randomised trial from 2010 tried on a grand scale to see if reviewers really do reject ideas based on their pre-existing beliefs (a good indicator of whether journals are biased by results, when they should be focused simply on whether a study is properly designed and conducted). Fabricated papers were sent to over two hundred reviewers, and they were all identical, except for the results they reported: half of the reviewers got results they would like, half got results they wouldn\u2019t. Reviewers were more likely to recommend publication if they received the version of the manuscript with results they\u2019d like (97 per cent vs 80 per cent), more likely to detect errors in a manuscript whose results they didn\u2019t like, and rated the methods more highly in papers whose results they liked.42\n\nOverall, though, even if there are clearly rough edges in some domains, these results don\u2019t suggest that the journals are the main cause of the problem of the disappearance of negative trials. In the experiments isolating the peer reviewers, those individual referees were biased in some studies, but they don\u2019t have the last word on publication, and in all the studies which look at what happens to negative papers submitted to journals in the real world, the evidence suggests that they proceed into print without problems. Journals may not be entirely innocent \u2013 The Trouble With Medical Journals by Richard Smith, previously editor of the BMJ, is an excellent overview of their faults;43 and we will see later how they fail to police important and simple flaws in studies. But it would be wrong to lay the blame for publication bias entirely at their door.\n\nIn the light of all this, the data on what researchers say about their own behaviour is very revealing. In various surveys they have said that they thought there was no point in submitting negative results, because they would just be rejected by journals: 20 per cent of medical researchers said so in 1998;44 61 per cent of psychology and education researchers said so in 1991;45 and so on.46 If asked why they\u2019ve failed to send in research for publication, the most common reasons researchers give are negative results, a lack of interest, or a lack of time.\n\nThis is the more abstract end of academia \u2013 largely away from the immediate world of clinical trials \u2013 but it seems that academics are mistaken, at best, about the reasons why negative results go missing. Journals may pose some barriers to publishing negative results, but they are hardly absolute, and much of the problem lies in academics\u2019 motivations and perceptions.\n\nMore than that, in recent years, the era of open-access academic journals has got going in earnest: there are now several, such as Trials, which are free to access, and have a core editorial policy that they will accept any trial report, regardless of result, and will actively solicit negative findings. Trials registers like clinicaltrials.gov will also post results. With offers like this on the table, it is very hard to believe that anyone would really struggle to disseminate the findings of a trial with a negative result if they wanted to. And yet, despite this, negative results continue to go missing, with vast multinational companies simply withholding results on their drugs, even though academics and doctors are desperate to see them.\n\nYou might reasonably wonder whether there are people who are supposed to prevent this kind of data from being withheld. The universities where research takes place, for example; or the regulators; or the \u2018ethics committees\u2019, which are charged with protecting patients who participate in research. Unfortunately, our story is about to take a turn to the dark side. We will see that many of the very people and organisations we would have expected to protect patients from the harm inflicted by missing data have, instead, shirked their responsibilities; and worse than that, we will see that many of them have actively conspired in helping companies to withhold data from patients. We are about to hit some big problems, some bad people, and some simple solutions.\n\nHow ethics committees and universities have failed us\n\nBy now, you will, I hope, share my view that withholding results from clinical trials is unethical, for the simple reason that hidden data exposes patients to unnecessary and avoidable harm. But the ethical transgressions here go beyond the simple harm inflicted on future patients.\n\nPatients and the public participate in clinical trials at some considerable cost to themselves: they expose themselves to hassle and intrusion, because clinical trials almost always require that you have more check-ups on your progress, more blood tests, and more examinations; but participants may also expose themselves to more risk, or the chance of receiving an inferior treatment. People do this out of altruism, on the implicit understanding that the results from their experience will contribute to improving our knowledge of what works and what doesn\u2019t, and so will help other patients in the future. In fact, this understanding isn\u2019t just implicit: in many trials it\u2019s explicit, because patients are specifically told when they sign up to participate that the data will be used to inform future decisions. If this isn\u2019t true, and the data can be withheld at the whim of a researcher or a company, then the patients have been actively lied to. That is very bad news.\n\nSo what are the formal arrangements between patients, researchers and sponsors? In any sensible world, we\u2019d expect universal contracts, making it clear that all researchers are obliged to publish their results, and that industry sponsors \u2013 which have a huge interest in positive results \u2013 must have no control over the data. But despite everything we know about industry-funded research being systematically biased, this does not happen. In fact, quite the opposite is true: it is entirely normal for researchers and academics conducting industry-funded trials to sign contracts subjecting them to gagging clauses which forbid them to publish, discuss or analyse data from the trials they have conducted, without the permission of the funder. This is such a secretive and shameful situation that even trying to document it in public can be a fraught business, as we shall now see.\n\nIn 2006 a paper was published in JAMA describing how common it was for researchers doing industry-funded trials to have these kinds of constraints placed on their right to publish the results.47 The study was conducted by the Nordic Cochrane Centre, and it looked at all the trials given approval to go ahead in Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. (If you\u2019re wondering why these two cities were chosen, it was simply a matter of practicality, and the bizarre secrecy that shrouds this world: the researchers applied elsewhere without success, and were specifically refused access to data in the UK.48) These trials were overwhelmingly sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry (98 per cent), and the rules governing the management of the results tell a story which walks the now-familiar line between frightening and absurd.\n\nFor sixteen of the forty-four trials the sponsoring company got to see the data as it accumulated, and in a further sixteen they had the right to stop the trial at any time, for any reason. This means that a company can see if a trial is going against it, and can interfere as it progresses. As we will see later (early stopping, breaking protocols, pp.186, 202), this distorts a trial\u2019s results with unnecessary and hidden biases. For example, if you stop a trial early because you have been peeking at the preliminary results, then you can either exaggerate a modest benefit, or bury a worsening negative result. Crucially, the fact that the sponsoring company had this opportunity to introduce bias wasn\u2019t mentioned in any of the published academic papers reporting the results of these trials, so nobody reading the literature could possibly know that these studies were subject \u2013 by design \u2013 to such an important flaw.\n\nEven if the study was allowed to finish, the data could still be suppressed. There were constraints on publication rights in forty of the forty-four trials, and in half of them the contracts specifically stated that the sponsor either owned the data outright (what about the patients, you might say?), or needed to approve the final publication, or both. None of these restrictions was mentioned in any of the published papers, and in fact, none of the protocols or papers said that the sponsor had full access to all the data from the trial, or the final say on whether to publish.\n\nIt\u2019s worth taking a moment to think about what this means. The results of all these trials were subject to a bias that will significantly distort the academic literature, because trials that show early signs of producing a negative result (or trials that do produce a negative result) can be deleted from the academic record; but nobody reading these trials could possibly have known that this opportunity for censorship existed.\n\nThe paper I\u2019ve just described was published in JAMA, one of the biggest medical journals in the world. Shortly afterwards, a shocking tale of industry interference appeared in the BMJ.49 Lif, the Danish pharmaceutical industry association, responded to the paper by announcing in the Journal of the Danish Medical Association that it was \u2018both shaken and enraged about the criticism, that could not be recognised\u2019. It demanded an investigation of the scientists, though it failed to say by whom, or of what. Then Lif wrote to the Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty, accusing the Cochrane researchers of scientific misconduct. We can\u2019t see the letter, but the Cochrane researchers say the allegations were extremely serious \u2013 they were accused of deliberately distorting the data \u2013 but vague, and without documents or evidence to back them up.\n\nNonetheless, the investigation went on for a year, because in academia people like to do things properly, and assume that all complaints are made in good faith. Peter G\u00f8tzsche, the director of the Cochrane centre, told the BMJ that only Lif\u2019s third letter, ten months into this process, made specific allegations that could be investigated by the committee. Two months later the charges were dismissed. The Cochrane researchers had done nothing wrong. But before they were cleared, Lif copied the letters alleging scientific dishonesty to the hospital where four of them worked, and to the management organisation running that hospital, and sent similar letters to the Danish Medical Association, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science, and so on. G\u00f8tzsche and his colleagues said that they felt \u2018intimidated and harassed\u2019 by Lif\u2019s behaviour. Lif continued to insist that the researchers were guilty of misconduct even after the investigation was completed. So, researching in this area is not easy: it\u2019s hard to get funding, and the industry will make your work feel like chewing on a mouthful of wasps.\n\nEven though the problem has been widely recognised, attempts to fix it have failed.50 The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, for example, stood up in 2001, insisting that the lead author of any study it published must sign a document stating that the researchers had full access to the data, and full control over the decision to publish. Researchers at Duke University, North Carolina, then surveyed the contracts between medical schools and industry sponsors, and found that this edict was flouted as a matter of routine. They recommended boilerplate contracts for the relationship between industry and academia. Was this imposed? No. Sponsors continue to control the data.\n\nHalf a decade later, a major study in the New England Journal of Medicine investigated whether anything had changed.51 Administrators at all 122 accredited medical schools in the US were asked about their contracts (to be clear, this wasn\u2019t a study of what they did; rather it was a study of what they were willing to say in public). The majority said contract negotiations over the right to publish data were \u2018difficult\u2019. A worrying 62 per cent said it was OK for the clinical trial agreement between academics and industry sponsor to be confidential. This is a serious problem, as it means that anyone reading a study cannot know how much interference was available to the sponsor, which is important context for the person reading and interpreting the research. Half of the centres allowed the sponsor to draft the research paper, which is another interesting hidden problem in medicine, as biases and emphases can be quietly introduced (as we shall see in more detail in Chapter 6). Half said it was OK for contracts to forbid researchers sharing data after the research was completed and published, once again hindering research. A quarter said it was acceptable for the sponsor to insert its own statistical analyses into the manuscript. Asked about disputes, 17 per cent of administrators had seen an argument about who had control of data in the preceding year.\n\nSometimes, disputes over access to such data can cause serious problems in academic departments, when there is a divergence of views on what is ethical. Aubrey Blumsohn was a senior lecturer at Sheffield University, working on a project funded by Procter & Gamble to research an osteoporosis drug called risedronate.52 The aim was to analyse blood and urine samples from an earlier trial, led by Blumsohn\u2019s head of department, Professor Richard Eastell. After signing the contracts, P&G sent over some \u2018abstracts\u2019, brief summaries of the findings, with Blumsohn\u2019s name as first author, and some summary results tables. That\u2019s great, said Blumsohn, but I\u2019m the researcher here: I\u2019d like to see the actual raw data and analyse it myself. The company declined, saying that this was not their policy. Blumsohn stood his ground, and the papers were left unpublished. Then, however, Blumsohn saw that Eastell had published another paper with P&G, stating that all the researchers had \u2018had full access to the data and analyses\u2019. He complained, knowing this was not true. Blumsohn was suspended by Sheffield University, which offered him a gagging clause and \u00a3145,000, and he was eventually forced out of his job. Eastell, meanwhile, was censured by the General Medical Council, but only after a staggering delay of several years, and he remains in post.\n\nSo contracts that permit companies and researchers to withhold or control data are common, and they\u2019re bad news. But that\u2019s not just because they lead to doctors and patients being misled about what works. They also break another vitally important contract: the agreement between researchers and the patients who participate in their trials.\n\nPeople participate in trials believing that the results of that research will help to improve the treatment of patients like them in the future. This isn\u2019t just speculation: one of the few studies to ask patients why they have participated in a trial found that 90 per cent believed they were making a \u2018major\u2019 or \u2018moderate\u2019 contribution to society, and 84 per cent felt proud that they were making this contribution.53 Patients are not stupid or na\u00efve to believe this, because it is what they are told on the consent forms they sign before participating in trials. But they are mistaken, because the results of trials are frequently left unpublished, and withheld from doctors and patients. These signed consent forms therefore mislead people on two vitally important points. Firstly, they fail to tell the truth: that the person conducting the trial, or the person paying for it, may decide not to publish the results, depending on how they look at the end of the study. And worse than that, they also explicitly state a falsehood: researchers tell patients that they are participating in order to create knowledge that will be used to improve treatment in future, even though the researchers know that in many cases, those results will never be published.\n\nThere is only one conclusion that we can draw from this: consent forms routinely lie to patients participating in trials. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, made all the more extraordinary by the huge amounts of red tape that everyone involved in a trial must negotiate, closely monitoring endless arcane pieces of paperwork, and ensuring that patients are fully informed on the minutiae of their treatment. Despite all this regulatory theatre, which hinders good research on routine practice (as we shall see \u2013 p.232), we allow these forms to tell patients outright lies about the control of data, and we fail to police one of the most important ethical problems in the whole of medicine. The deceit of these consent forms is, to me, a good illustration of how broken and outdated the regulatory frameworks of medicine have become. But it also, finally, poses a serious problem for the future of research.\n\nWe desperately need patients to continue to believe that they are contributing to society, because trial recruitment is in crisis, and it is increasingly hard to persuade patients to participate at all. In one recent study, a third of all trials failed to reach their original recruitment target, and more than half had to be awarded an extension.54 If word gets out that trials are often more promotional than genuinely scientific, recruitment will become even more difficult. The answer is not to hide this problem, but rather to fix it.\n\nSo universities and ethics committees may have failed us, but there is one group of people we might expect to step up, to try to show some leadership on missing trial data. These are the medical and academic professional bodies, the Royal Colleges of General Practice, Surgery and Physicians, the General Medical Council, the British Medical Association, the pharmacists\u2019 organisations, the bodies representing each sub-specialty of academia, the respiratory physiologists, the pharmacologists, the Academy of Medical Sciences, and so on.\n\nThese organisations have the opportunity to set the tone of academic and clinical medicine, in their codes of conduct, their aspirations, and in some cases their rules, since some have the ability to impose sanctions, and all have the ability to exclude those who fail to meet basic ethical standards. We have established, I hope, beyond any doubt, that non-publication of trials in humans is research misconduct, that it misleads doctors and harms patients around the world. Have these organisations used their powers, stood up and announced, prominently and fiercely, that this must stop, and that they will take action?\n\nOne has: the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine, a small organisation of doctors \u2013 largely working in the industry \u2013 with 1,400 members. And none of the others have bothered.\n\nNot one.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThere are several simple solutions to these problems, which fall into three categories. There is no argument against any of the following suggestions that I am aware of. The issue of missing data has been neglected through institutional inertia, and reluctance by senior academics to challenge industry. Their failure to act harms patients every day.\n\nGagging clauses\n\nIf there is nothing to be ashamed of in gagging clauses \u2013 if companies, and legislators, and academics, and university contracts departments, all believe that they are acceptable \u2013 then everything should be out in the open, prominently flagged up, so that everyone outside those systems can decide if they agree.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Until they can be eradicated, where gagging clauses exist, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patients should be told, at the time they are invited to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0participate in a trial, that the company sponsoring it is allowed \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to hide the results if it doesn\u2019t like them. The consent form \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0should also explain clearly that withholding negative results \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0will lead to doctors and patients being misled about the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0effectiveness of the treatment being trialled, and so exposed \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to unnecessary harm. Trial participants can then decide for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0themselves if they think these contracts are acceptable.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Wherever the sponsoring company has the contractual right \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to gag publication, even if it doesn\u2019t exercise that right, the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0fact that a gagging clause existed should be stated clearly: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the academic paper; in the trial protocol; and in the publicly \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0available trial registry entry that goes up before the trial \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0starts. Readers of the trial findings can then decide for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0themselves if they trust that sponsor and research group to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0publish all negative findings, and interpret any reported \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0positive findings in that light.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0All university contracts should follow the same boilerplate \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0format, and forbid gagging clauses. Failing that, all universities \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0should be forced to prominently declare which contracts \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0with gagging clauses they have permitted, and to publish those \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0clauses online for all to see, so that all can be alerted that the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0institution is producing systematically biased research, and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0discount any findings from them accordingly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0In legislation, gagging clauses should be made illegal, with no \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0possibility of quibbles. If there is a dispute about analysis or \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0interpretation between the people running the trial and the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0people paying for it, it should take place in the published \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0academic literature, or some other public forum. Not in secret.\n\nProfessional bodies\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0All professional bodies should take a clear stand on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unpublished trial data, declare it clearly as research \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0misconduct, and state that it will be handled like any other \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0form of serious misconduct that misleads doctors and harms \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patients.That they have not done so is a stain on the reputation \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0of these organisations, and on their senior members.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0All research staff involved in any trial on humans should be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regarded as jointly and severally liable for ensuring that it is \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0published in full within one year of completion.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.All those responsible for withholding trial data should have \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0their names prominently posted in a single database, so \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0that others can be made aware of the risk of working with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0them, or allowing them access to patients for research, in \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0future.\n\nEthics committees\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.No person should be allowed to conduct trials in humans if a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0research project they are responsible for is currently \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0withholding trial data from publication more than one year \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0after completion. Where any researcher on a project has a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0previous track record of delayed publication of trial data, the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ethics committee should be notified, and this should be taken \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0into account, as with any researcher guilty of research \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0misconduct.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.No trial should be approved without a firm guarantee of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0publication within one year of completion.\n\nHow regulators and journals have failed us\n\nSo far we\u2019ve established that ethics committees, universities and the professional bodies of medical researchers have all failed to protect patients from publication bias, even though the selective non-publication of unflattering data is a serious issue for medicine. We know that it distorts and undermines every decision that researchers, doctors and patients make, and that it exposes patients to avoidable suffering and death. This is not seriously disputed, so you might reasonably imagine that governments, regulators and medical journals must all have tried to address it.\n\nThey have tried, and failed. Worse than simply failing, they have repeatedly provided what we might regard as \u2018fake fixes\u2019: we have seen small changes in regulations and practices, announced with great fanfare, but then either ignored or bypassed. This has given false reassurance to doctors, academics and the public that the problem has been fixed. What follows is the story of these fake fixes.\n\nRegisters\n\nThe earliest and simplest solution proposed was to open registers of trials: if people are compelled to publish their protocol, in full, before they start work, then we at least have the opportunity to go back and check to see if they\u2019ve published the trials that they\u2019ve conducted. This is very useful, for a number of reasons. A trial protocol describes in great technical detail everything that researchers will do in a trial: how many patients they\u2019ll recruit, where they\u2019ll come from, how they\u2019ll be divided up, what treatment each group will get, and what outcome will be measured to establish if the treatment was successful. Because of this, it can be used to check whether a trial was published, but also whether its methods were distorted along the way, in a manner that would allow the results to be exaggerated (as described in Chapter 4).\n\nThe first major paper to call for a registry of clinical trial protocols was published in 1986,55 and it was followed by a flood. In 1990 Iain Chalmers (we can call him Sir Iain Chalmers if you likefn2) published a classic paper called \u2018Underreporting Research is Scientific Misconduct\u2019,57 and he has traced the chequered history of trials registers in the UK.58 In 1992, as the Cochrane Collaboration began to gather influence, representatives of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) asked to meet Chalmers.59 After explaining the work of Cochrane, and the vital importance of summarising all the trial results on a particular drug, he explained very clearly to them how biased under-reporting of results harms patients.\n\nThe industry\u2019s representatives were moved, and soon they took action. Mike Wallace, the chief executive of Schering and a member of that ABPI delegation, agreed with Chalmers that withholding data was ethically and scientifically indefensible, and said that he planned to do something concrete to prevent it, if only to protect the industry from having the issue forced upon it in less welcome terms. Wallace stepped out of line from his colleagues, and committed to registering every trial conducted by his company with Cochrane. This was not a popular move, and he was reprimanded by colleagues, in particular those from other companies.\n\nBut then GlaxoWellcome followed suit, and in 1998 its chief executive, Richard Sykes, wrote an editorial in the BMJ called \u2018Being a modern pharmaceutical company involves making information available on clinical trial programmes\u2019.60 \u2018Programmes\u2019 was the crucial word, because as we\u2019ve seen, and as we shall see in greater detail later, you can only make sense of individual findings if you assess them in the context of all the work that has been done on a drug.\n\nGlaxoWellcome set up a clinical trials registry, and Elizabeth Wager, the head of the company\u2019s medical writers group, pulled together a group from across the industry to develop ethical guidelines for presenting research. The ABPI, seeing individual companies take the lead, saw the writing on the wall: it decided to commend GlaxoWellcome\u2019s policy to the whole industry, and launched this initiative at a press conference where Chalmers \u2013 a strong critic \u2013 sat on the same side of the table as the industry. AstraZeneca, Aventis, MSD, Novartis, Roche, Schering Healthcare and Wyeth began registering some of their trials \u2013 only the ones involving UK patients, and retrospectively \u2013 but there was movement at last.\n\nAt the same time, there was movement in America. The 1997 FDA Modernization Act created clinicaltrials.gov, a register run by the US government National Institutes of Health. This legislation required that trials should be registered, but only if they related to an application to put a new drug on the market, and even then, only if it was for a serious or life-threatening disease. The register opened in 1998, and the website clinicaltrials.gov went online in 2000. The entry criteria were widened in 2004.\n\nBut soon it all began to fall apart. GlaxoWellcome merged with SmithKline Beecham to become GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), and initially the new logo appeared on the old trials register. Iain Chalmers wrote to Jean-Paul Garnier, the chief executive of the new company, to thank him for maintaining this valuable transparency: but no reply ever came. The registry website was closed, and the contents were lost (though GSK was later forced to open a new register, as part of a settlement with the US government over the harm caused by its withholding of data on new drug trials just a couple of years later). Elizabeth Wager, the author of the Good Publication Practice guidelines for drug companies, was out of a job, as her writing department at GSK was closed. Her guidelines were ignored.61\n\nFrom the moment that these registries were first suggested, and then opened, it was implicitly assumed that the shame of producing this public record, and then not publishing your study, would be enough to ensure that people would do the right thing. But the first problem for the US register, which could have been used universally, was that people simply chose not to use it. The regulations required only a very narrow range of trials to be posted, and nobody else was in a hurry to post their trials if they didn\u2019t have to.\n\nIn 2004 the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) \u2013 a collection of editors from the most influential journals in the world \u2013 published a policy statement, announcing that none of them would publish any clinical trials after 2005, unless they had been properly registered before they began.62 They did this, essentially, to force the hand of the industry and researchers: if a trial has a positive result, then people desperately want to publish it in the most prestigious journal they can find. Although they had no legal force, the journal editors did have the thing that companies and researchers wanted most: the chance of a major journal publication. By insisting on pre-registration, they were doing what they could to force researchers and industry sponsors to register all trials. Everyone rejoiced: the problem had been fixed.\n\nIf you think it seems odd \u2013 and perhaps unrealistic \u2013 that fixing this crucial flaw in the information architecture of a $700 billion industry should be left to an informal gathering of a few academic editors, with no legislative power, then you\u2019d be right. Although everybody began to talk as if publication bias was a thing of the past, in reality it was continuing just as before, because the journal editors simply ignored their own threats and promises. Later (pp.247, 307) we will see the phenomenal financial inducements on offer to editors for publishing positive industry papers, which can extend to millions of dollars in reprint and advertising revenue. But first we should look at what they actually did after their solemn promise in 2005.\n\nIn 2008 a group of researchers went through every single trial published in the top ten medical journals, every one of which was a member of the ICMJE, after the deadline for pre-registration. Out of 323 trials published during 2008 in these high-impact academic journals, only half were adequately registered (before the trial, with the main outcome measure properly specified), and trial registration was entirely lacking for over a quarter.63 The ICMJE editors had simply failed to keep their word.\n\nMeanwhile, in Europe, there were some very bizarre developments. With enormous fanfare, the European Medicines Agency created a registry of trials called EudraCT. EU legislation requires all trials to be posted here if they involve any patients in Europe, and many companies will tell you that they\u2019ve met their responsibilities for transparency by doing so. But the contents of this EU register have been kept entirely secret. I can tell you that it contains around 30,000 trials, since that figure is in the public domain, but that is literally all I know, and all anyone can know. Despite EU legislation requiring that the public should be given access to the contents of this register, it remains closed. This creates an almost laughable paradox: the EU clinical trials register is a transparency tool, held entirely in secret. Since March 2011, after heavy media criticism (from me at any rate), a subset of trials has slowly been made public through a website called EudraPharm. As of summer 2012, although the agency now claims that its register is accessible to all, at least 10,000 trials are still missing, and the search engine doesn\u2019t work properly.64 It\u2019s absolutely one of the strangest things I\u2019ve ever seen, and nobody other than the EU even regards this peculiar exercise as a trials register: I certainly don\u2019t, I doubt you do, and both the ICMJE and the World Health Organization have explicitly stated that EudraCT is not a meaningful register.\n\nBut new work was being done in the US, and it seemed sensible. In 2007 the FDA Amendment Act was passed. This is much tighter: it requires registration of all trials of any drug or device, at any stage of development other than \u2018first-in-man\u2019 tests, if they have any site in the US, or involve any kind of application to bring a new drug onto the market. It also imposes a startling new requirement: all results of all trials must be posted to clinicaltrials.gov, in abbreviated summary tables, within one year of completion, for any trial on any marketed drug that completes after 2007.\n\nOnce again, to great fanfare, everyone believed that the problem had been fixed. But it hasn\u2019t been, for two very important reasons.\n\nFirstly, unfortunately, despite the undoubted goodwill, requiring the publication of all trials starting from \u2018now\u2019 does absolutely nothing for medicine today. There is no imaginable clinic, anywhere in the world, at which medicine is practised only on the basis of trials that completed within the past three years, using only drugs that came to market since 2008. In fact, quite the opposite is true: the vast majority of drugs currently in use came to market over the past ten, twenty or thirty years, and one of the great challenges for the pharmaceutical industry today is to create drugs that are anything like as innovative as those that were introduced in what has come to be known as the \u2018golden era\u2019 of pharmaceutical research, when all the most widely used drugs, for all the most common diseases, were developed. Perhaps they were the \u2018low-lying fruit\u2019, plucked from the research tree, but in any case, these are the tablets we use.\n\nAnd crucially, it is for these drugs \u2013 the ones we actually use \u2013 that we need the evidence: from trials completed in 2005 or 1995. These are the drugs that we are prescribing completely blind, misled by a biased sample of trials, selectively published, with the unflattering data buried in secure underground data archives somewhere in the hills (I am told) of Cheshire.\n\nBut there is a second, more disturbing reason why these regulations should be taken with a pinch of salt: they have been widely ignored. A study published in January 2012 looked at the first slice of trials subject to mandatory reporting, and found that only one in five had met its obligation to post results.65 Perhaps this is not surprising: the fine for non-compliance is $10,000 a day, which sounds spectacular, until you realise that it\u2019s only $3.5 million a year, which is chickenfeed for a drug bringing in $4 billion a year. And what\u2019s more, no such fine has ever been levied, throughout the entire history of the legislation.\n\nSo that, in total, is why I regard the ICMJE, the FDA and the EU\u2019s claims to have addressed this problem as \u2018fake fixes\u2019. In fact, they have done worse than fail: they have given false reassurance that the problem has been fixed, false reassurance that it has gone away, and they have led us to take our eyes off the ball. For half a decade now, people in medicine and academia have talked about publication bias as if it was yesterday\u2019s problem, discovered in the 1990s and early 2000s, and swiftly fixed.\n\nBut the problem of missing data has not gone away, and soon we will see exactly how shameless some companies and regulators can be, in the very present day.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe ICMJE should keep its promises, the EU should be less risible, and the FDA Amendment Act 2007 should be muscularly enforced. But there are many more disappointments to come, so I will leave my action plan on missing data for later in this chapter.\n\nBlood from a stone: trying to get data from regulators\n\nSo far we\u2019ve established that doctors and patients have been failed by a range of different people and organisations, all of whom we might have expected to step up and fix the problem of missing data, since it harms patients in large numbers around the world. We have seen that governments take no action against those who fail to publish their results, despite the public pretence to the contrary; and that they take no action against those who fail to register their trials. We have seen that medical journal editors continue to publish unregistered trials, despite the public pretence that they have taken a stand. We have seen that ethics committees fail to insist on universal publication, despite their stated aim of protecting patients. And we have seen that professional bodies fail to take action against what is obviously research misconduct, despite evidence showing that the problem of missing data is of epidemic proportions.66\n\nWhile the published academic record is hopelessly distorted, you might hope that there is one final route which patients and doctors could use to get access to the results of clinical trials: the regulators, which receive large amounts of data from drug companies during the approval process, must surely have obligations to protect patients\u2019 safety? But this, sadly, is just one more example of how we are failed by the very bodies that are supposed to be protecting us.\n\nIn this section, we will see three key failures. Firstly, the regulators may not have the information in the first place. Secondly, the way in which they \u2018share\u2019 summary trial information with doctors and patients is broken and shabby. And finally, if you try to get all of the information that a drug company has provided \u2013 the long-form documents, where the bodies are often buried \u2013 then regulators present bizarre barriers, blocking and obfuscating for several years at a time, even on drugs that turn out to be ineffective and harmful. Nothing of what I am about to tell you is in any sense reassuring.\n\nOne: Information is withheld from regulators\n\nParoxetine is a commonly used antidepressant, from the class of drugs known as \u2018selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\u2019, or SSRIs. You will hear more about this class of drugs later in this book, but here we will use paroxetine to show how companies have exploited our longstanding permissiveness about missing trials, and found loopholes in our inadequate regulations on trial disclosure. We will see that GSK withheld data about whether paroxetine works as an antidepressant, and even withheld data about its harmful side effects, but most importantly, we will see that what it did was all entirely legal.\n\nTo understand why, we first need to go through a quirk of the licensing process. Drugs do not simply come onto the market for use in all medical conditions: for any specific use of any drug, in any specific disease, you need a separate marketing authorisation. So, a drug might be licensed to treat ovarian cancer, for example, but not breast cancer. That doesn\u2019t mean the drug doesn\u2019t work in breast cancer. There might well be some evidence that it\u2019s great for treating that disease too, but maybe the company hasn\u2019t gone to the trouble and expense of getting a formal marketing authorisation for that specific use. Doctors can still go ahead and prescribe it for breast cancer, if they want, because the drug is available for prescription, and there are boxes of it sitting in pharmacies waiting to go out (even though, strictly speaking, it\u2019s only got marketing approval for use in ovarian cancer). In this situation the doctor will be prescribing the drug legally, but \u2018off-label\u2019.\n\nThis is fairly common, as getting a marketing authorisation for a specific use can be time-consuming and expensive. If doctors know that there\u2019s a drug which has been shown in good-quality trials to help treat a disease, it would be perverse and unhelpful of them not to prescribe it, just because the company hasn\u2019t applied for a formal licence to market it for that specific use. I\u2019ll discuss the ins and outs of all this in more detail later. But for now, what you need to know is that the use of a drug in children is treated as a separate marketing authorisation from its use in adults.\n\nThis makes sense in many cases, because children can respond to drugs in very different ways to adults, so the risks and benefits might be very different, and research needs to be done in children separately. But this licensing quirk also brings some disadvantages. Getting a licence for a specific use is an arduous business, requiring lots of paperwork, and some specific studies. Often this will be so expensive that companies will not bother to get a licence specifically to market a drug for use in children, because that market is usually much smaller.\n\nBut once a drug is available in a country for one specific thing, as we have seen, it can then be prescribed for absolutely anything. So it is not unusual for a drug to be licensed for use in adults, but then prescribed for children on the back of a hunch; or a judgement that it should at least do no harm; or studies that suggest benefit in children, but that would probably be insufficient to get through the specific formal process of getting marketing authorisation for use in kids; or even good studies, but in a disease where the market is so small that the company can\u2019t be bothered to get a marketing approval for use in children.\n\nRegulators have recognised that there is a serious problem with drugs being used in children \u2018off-label\u2019, without adequate research, so recently they have started to offer incentives for companies to conduct the research, and formally seek these licences. The incentives are patent extensions, and these can be lucrative. All drugs slip into the public domain about a decade after coming onto the market, and become like paracetamol, which anyone can make very cheaply. If a company is given a six-month extension on a drug, for all uses, then it can make a lot more money from that medicine. This seems a good example of regulators being pragmatic, and thinking creatively about what carrots they can offer. Licensed use in children will probably not itself make a company much extra money, since doctors are prescribing the drug for children already, even without a licence or good evidence, simply because there are no other options. Meanwhile, six months of extra patent life for a blockbuster drug will be very lucrative, if its adult market is large enough.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of debate about whether the drug companies have played fair with these offers. For example, since the FDA started offering this deal, about a hundred drugs have been given paediatric licences, but many of them were for diseases that aren\u2019t very common in children, like stomach ulcers, or arthritis. There have been far fewer applications for less lucrative products that could be used in children, such as more modern medicines called \u2018large-molecule biologics\u2019. But there it is.\n\nWhen GSK applied for a marketing authorisation in children for paroxetine, an extraordinary situation came to light, triggering the longest investigation in the history of UK drugs regulation. This investigation was published in 2008, and examined whether GSK should face criminal charges.67 It turned out that what the company had done \u2013 withholding important data about safety and effectiveness that doctors and patients clearly needed to see \u2013 was plainly unethical, and put children around the world at risk; but our laws are so weak that GSK could not be charged with any crime.\n\nBetween 1994 and 2002 GSK conducted nine trials of paroxetine in children.68 The first two failed to show any benefit, but the company made no attempt to inform anyone of this by changing the \u2018drug label\u2019 that is sent to all doctors and patients. In fact, after these trials were completed, an internal company management document stated: \u2018it would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine\u2019. In the year after this secret internal memo, 32,000 prescriptions were issued to children for paroxetine in the UK alone: so, while the company knew the drug didn\u2019t work in children, it was in no hurry to tell doctors that, despite knowing that large numbers of children were taking it. More trials were conducted over the coming years \u2013 nine in total \u2013 and none showed that the drug was effective at treating depression in children.\n\nIt gets much worse than that. These children weren\u2019t simply receiving a drug that the company knew to be ineffective for them: they were also being exposed to side effects. This should be self-evident, since any effective treatment will have some side effects, and doctors factor this in, alongside the benefits (which in this case were non-existent). But nobody knew how bad these side effects were, because the company didn\u2019t tell doctors, or patients, or even the regulator about the worrying safety data from its trials. This was because of a loophole (on which more in a couple of pages\u2019 time): you only had to tell the regulator about side effects reported in studies looking at the specific uses for which the drug has a marketing authorisation. Because the use of paroxetine in children was \u2018off-label\u2019, GSK had no legal obligation at the time to tell anyone about what it had found.\n\nPeople had worried for a long time that paroxetine might increase the risk of suicide, though that is quite a difficult side effect to detect in an antidepressant, because people with depression are at a much higher risk of suicide than the general population anyway, as a result of their depression. There are also some grounds to believe that as patients first come out of their depression, and leave behind the sluggish lack of motivation that often accompanies profound misery, there may be a period during which they are more capable of killing themselves, just because of the depression slowly lifting.\n\nFurthermore, suicide is a mercifully rare event, which means you need a lot of people on a drug to detect an increased risk. Also, suicide is not always recorded accurately on death certificates, because coroners and doctors are reluctant to give a verdict that many would regard as shameful, so the signal you are trying to detect in the data \u2013 suicide \u2013 is going to be corrupted. Suicidal thoughts or behaviours that don\u2019t result in death are more common than suicide itself, so they should be easier to detect, but they too are hard to pick up in routinely collected data, because they\u2019re often not presented to doctors, and where they are, they can be coded in health records in all sorts of different ways, if they appear at all. Because of all these difficulties, you would want to have every scrap of data you could possibly cobble together on the question of whether these drugs cause suicidal thoughts or behaviour in children; and you would want a lot of experienced people, with a wide range of skills, all looking at the data and discussing it.\n\nIn February 2003, GSK spontaneously sent the MHRA a package of information on the risk of suicide on paroxetine, containing some analyses done in 2002 from adverse-event data in trials the company had held, going back a decade. This analysis showed that there was no increased risk of suicide. But it was misleading: although it was unclear at the time, data from trials in children had been mixed in with data from trials in adults, which had vastly greater numbers of participants. As a result, any sign of increased suicide risk among children on paroxetine had been completely diluted away.\n\nLater in 2003, GSK had a meeting with the MHRA to discuss another issue involving paroxetine. At the end of this meeting, the GSK representatives gave out a briefing document, explaining that the company was planning to apply later that year for a specific marketing authorisation to use paroxetine in children. They mentioned, while handing out the document, that the MHRA might wish to bear in mind a safety concern the company had noted: an increased risk of suicide among children with depression who received paroxetine, compared with those on dummy placebo pills.\n\nThis was vitally important side-effect data, being presented, after an astonishing delay, casually, through an entirely inappropriate and unofficial channel. GSK knew that the drug was being prescribed in children, and it knew that there were safety concerns in children, but it had chosen not to reveal that information. When it did share the data, it didn\u2019t flag it up as a clear danger in the current use of the drug, requiring urgent attention from the relevant department in the regulator; instead it presented it as part of an informal briefing about a future application. Although the data was given to completely the wrong team, the MHRA staff present at this meeting had the wit to spot that this was an important new problem. A flurry of activity followed: analyses were done, and within one month a letter was sent to all doctors advising them not to prescribe paroxetine to patients under the age of eighteen.\n\nHow is it possible that our systems for getting data from companies are so poor that they can simply withhold vitally important information showing that a drug is not only ineffective, but actively dangerous? There are two sets of problems here: firstly, access for regulators; and secondly, access for doctors.\n\nThere is no doubt that the regulations contain ridiculous loopholes, and it\u2019s dismal to see how GSK cheerfully exploited them. As I\u2019ve mentioned, the company had no legal duty to give over the information, because prescription of the drug in children was outside of paroxetine\u2019s formally licensed uses \u2013 even though GSK knew this was widespread. In fact, of the nine studies the company conducted, only one had its results reported to the MHRA, because that was the only one conducted in the UK.\n\nAfter this episode, the MHRA and the EU changed some of their regulations, though not adequately, and created an obligation for companies to hand over safety data for uses of a drug outside its marketing authorisation, closing the paroxetine loophole.\n\nThis whole incident illustrates a key problem, and it is one that recurs throughout this section of the book: you need all of the data in order to see what\u2019s happening with a drug\u2019s benefits, and risks. Some of the trials that GSK conducted were published in part, but that is obviously not enough: we already know that if we see only a biased sample of the data, we are misled. But we also need all the data for the more simple reason that we need lots of data: safety signals are often weak, subtle and difficult to detect. Suicidal thoughts and plans are rare in children \u2013 even those with depression, even those on paroxetine \u2013 so all the data from a large number of participants needed to be combined before the signal was detectable in the noise. In the case of paroxetine, the dangers only became apparent when the adverse events from all of the trials were pooled and analysed together.\n\nThat leads us to the second obvious flaw in the current system: the results of these trials \u2013 the safety data and the effectiveness data \u2013 are given in secret to the regulator, which then sits and quietly makes a decision. This is a huge problem, because you need many eyes on these difficult problems. I don\u2019t think that the people who work in the MHRA are bad, or incompetent: I know a lot of them, and they are smart, good people. But we shouldn\u2019t trust them to analyse this data alone, in the same way that we shouldn\u2019t trust any single organisation to analyse data alone, with nobody looking over its shoulder, checking the working, providing competition, offering helpful criticism, speeding it up, and so on.\n\nThis is even worse than academics failing to share their primary research data, because at least in an academic paper you get a lot of detail about what was done, and how. The output of a regulator is often simply a crude, brief summary: almost a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 about side effects. This is the opposite of science, which is only reliable because everyone shows their working, explains how they know that something is effective or safe, shares their methods and their results, and allows others to decide if they agree with the way they processed and analysed the data.\n\nYet for the safety and efficacy of drugs, one of the most important of all analyses done by science, we turn our back on this process completely: we allow it to happen behind closed doors, because drug companies have decided that they want to share their trial results discreetly with the regulators. So the most important job in evidence-based medicine, and a perfect example of a problem that benefits from many eyes and minds, is carried out alone and in secret.\n\nThis perverse and unhealthy secrecy extends way beyond regulators. NICE, the UK\u2019s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, is charged with making recommendations about which treatments are most cost-effective, and which work best. When it does this, it\u2019s in the same boat as you or me: it has absolutely no statutory right to see data on the safety or effectiveness of a drug, if a company doesn\u2019t want to release it, even though the regulators have all of that data. For \u2018single technology appraisals\u2019, on one treatment, they ask the company to make available to them the information the company thinks is relevant. For \u2018guidelines\u2019 on treatment in a whole area of medicine, they are more vulnerable to what is published in journals. As a result, even NICE can end up working on distorted, edited, biased samples of the data.\n\nSometimes NICE is able to access some extra unpublished data from the drug companies: this is information that doctors and patients aren\u2019t allowed to see, despite the fact that they are the people making decisions about whether to prescribe the drugs, or are actually taking them. But when NICE does get information in this way, it can come with strict conditions on confidentiality, leading to some very bizarre documents being published. On the opposite page, for example, is the NICE document discussing whether it\u2019s a good idea to have Lucentis, an extremely expensive drug, costing well over \u00a31,000 per treatment, that is injected into the eye for a condition called acute macular degeneration.\n\nAs you can see, the NICE document on whether this treatment is a good idea is censored. Not only is the data on the effectiveness of the treatment blanked out by thick black rectangles, in case any doctor or patient should see it; absurdly, even the names of some trials are missing, preventing the reader from even knowing of their existence, or cross referencing information about them. Most disturbing of all, as you can see in the last bullet point, the data on adverse events is also censored: I\u2019m reproducing the whole page here because I worry that it would otherwise be almost too bizarre for you to believe. This level of censorship isn\u2019t an everyday phenomenon; but it illustrates the absurdity of what medicine has come to accept, in professional documents that most people wouldn\u2019t bother to read.69\n\nWhy shouldn\u2019t we all \u2013 doctors, patients and NICE \u2013 have access to the information on trials that regulators see? This is something I asked both Kent Woods from the MHRA, and Hans Georg Eichler, Medical Director of the European Medicines Agency, in 2010. Both, separately, gave me the same answer: people outside the agencies cannot be trusted with this information, because they might misinterpret it, either deliberately or through incompetence. Both, separately \u2013 though I guess they must chat at parties \u2013 raised the MMR vaccine scare, as the classic example of how the media can contrive a national panic on the basis of no good evidence, creating dangerous public-health problems along the way. What if they released raw safety data, and people who don\u2019t know how to analyse it properly found imaginary patterns, and created scares that put patients off taking life-saving medication?\n\nI accept that this is a risk, but I also believe their priorities are wrong: I think that the advantages of many eyes working on these vitally important problems are enormous, and the possibility of a few irrational scaremongers is no excuse for hiding data. Drug companies and regulators also both say that you can already get all the information you need from regulators\u2019 websites, in summary form.\n\nWe shall now see that this is untrue.\n\nTwo: Regulators make it hard to access the data they do have\n\nWhen exposed to criticism, drug companies often become indignant, and declare that they already share enough data for doctors and patients to be informed. \u2018We give everything to the regulator,\u2019 they say, \u2018and you can get it from them.\u2019 Similarly, regulators insist that all you need to do is look on their website, and you will easily find all the data you need. In reality, there is a messy game, in which doctors and academics trying to find all the data on a drug are sent around the houses, scrabbling for information that is both hard to find and fatally flawed.\n\nFirstly, as we\u2019ve already seen, regulators don\u2019t have all the trials, and they don\u2019t share all the ones that they do. Summary documents are available on the early trials used to get a drug onto the market in the first place, but only for the specific licensed uses of the drug. Even where the regulator has been given safety data for off-label uses (following the paroxetine case above) the information from these trials still isn\u2019t made publicly available through the regulator: it simply sits quietly in the regulator\u2019s files.\n\nFor example: duloxetine is another drug in fairly widespread use, which is usually given as an antidepressant. During a trial on its use for a completely different purpose \u2013 treating incontinence \u2013 there were apparently several suicides.70 This is important and interesting information, and the FDA holds the relevant data: it conducted a review on this issue, and came to a view on whether the risk was significant. But you cannot see any of that on the FDA website, because duloxetine never got a licence for use in treating incontinence.71 The trial data was only used by the FDA to inform its internal ruminations. This is an everyday situation.\n\nBut even when you are allowed to see trial results held by regulators, getting this information from their public websites is supremely tricky. The search functions on the FDA website are essentially broken, while the content is haphazard and badly organised, with lots missing, and too little information to enable you to work out if a trial was prone to bias by design. Once again \u2013 partly, here, through casual thoughtlessness and incompetence \u2013 it is impossible to get access to the basic information that we need. Drug companies and regulators deny this: they say that if you search their websites, everything is there. So let\u2019s walk, briefly, through the process in all its infuriating glory. The case I will use was published three years ago in JAMA as a useful illustration of how broken the FDA site has become:72 replicating it today, in 2012, nothing has changed.\n\nSo: let\u2019s say we want to find the results from all the trials the FDA has, on a drug called pregabalin, in which the drug is used to treat pain for diabetics whose nerves have been affected by their disease (a condition called \u2018diabetic peripheral neuropathy\u2019). You want the FDA review on this specific use, which is the PDF document containing all the trials in one big bundle. But if you search for \u2018pregabalin review\u2019, say, on the FDA website, you get over a hundred documents: none of them is clearly named, and not one of them is the FDA review document on pregabalin. If you type in the FDA application number \u2013 the unique identifier for the FDA document you\u2019re looking for \u2013 the FDA website comes up with nothing at all.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, or wise, you\u2019ll get dropped at the Drugs@FDA page: typing \u2018pregabalin\u2019 there brings up three \u2018FDA applications\u2019. Why three? Because there are three different documents, each on a different condition that pregabalin can be used to treat. The FDA site doesn\u2019t tell you which condition each of these three documents is for, so you have to use trial and error to try to find out. That\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. I have the correct document for pregabalin and diabetic peripheral neuropathy right here in front of me: it\u2019s almost four hundred pages long, but it doesn\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s about diabetic peripheral neuropathy until you get to here. There\u2019s no executive summary at the beginning \u2013 in fact, there\u2019s no title page, no contents page, no hint of what the document is even about, and it skips randomly from one sub-document to another, all scanned and bundled up in the same gigantic file.\n\nIf you\u2019re a nerd, you might think: these files are electronic; they\u2019re PDFs, a type of file specifically designed to make sharing electronic documents convenient. Any nerd will know that if you want to find something in an electronic document, it\u2019s easy: you just use the \u2018find\u2019 command: type in, say, \u2018peripheral neuropathy\u2019, and your computer will find the phrase straight off. But no: unlike almost any other serious government document in the world, the PDFs from the FDA are a series of photographs of pages of text, rather than the text itself. This means you cannot search for a phrase. Instead, you have to go through it, searching for that phrase, laboriously, by eye.\n\nI could go on. I will. There\u2019s some kind of \u2018table of contents\u2019 on the seventeenth page, but it gets the page numbers wrong. I\u2019ve finished now. There is simply no reason for this obfuscation and chaos. These problems aren\u2019t caused by technical issues specific to trials, and they would hardly cost any money at all to fix. This is plainly, simply, unhelpful, and the best we can hope is that it\u2019s driven by thoughtlessness.\n\nThat\u2019s a tragedy, because if you can unearth this document, and decode it, you will find that it is full of terrifying gems: perfect examples of situations in which a drug company has used dodgy statistical methods to design and analyse a study, in such a way that it is predestined \u2013 from the outset \u2013 to exaggerate the benefits of the drug.\n\nFor example, in the five trials on pregabalin and pain, lots of people dropped out during the study period. This is common in medical trials, as you will shortly see, and it often happens because people have found a drug to be unhelpful, or have had bad side effects. During these trials you\u2019re measuring pain at regular intervals. But if some people drop out, you\u2019re left with an important question: what kind of pain score should you use for them in your results? We know, after all, that people dropping out are more likely to have done badly on the drug.\n\nPfizer decided to use a method called \u2018Last Observation Carried Forward\u2019, which means what you\u2019d expect: you take the last measurement of pain severity while the patients were on the drug, from just before they dropped out, and then paste that in for all the remaining pain measures that they missed, after they stopped coming to follow-up appointments.\n\nThe FDA disapproved of this: it pointed out, quite correctly, that Pfizer\u2019s strategy would make the drug look better than it really is. For a fairer picture, we have to assume that the drop-outs stopped taking the drug because of side effects, so their pain score should reflect the reality, which is that they would never get any benefit from the drug in normal use. The correct level of pain to record for them is, therefore, their pain at the beginning of the study, before they had any kind of treatment (if you\u2019re interested, this is called \u2018Baseline Observation Carried Forward\u2019). The analysis was duly redone, properly, and a more modest, more accurate view of the benefits of the drug was produced. In this case, it turns out that using the \u2018last observation\u2019 method overestimated the improvement in pain by about a quarter.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch. Four out of five of these trials were then published in the peer-reviewed academic literature, the place where doctors look for evidence on whether a drug works or not (one trial wasn\u2019t published at all). Every single one of the published analyses used \u2018Last Observation Carried Forward\u2019, the dodgy method, the one that exaggerates the benefits of the drug. Not one of them acknowledges that \u2018last observation\u2019 is a technique that overstates these benefits.\n\nYou can see why it is important that we have access to all the information we can possibly get on every drug trial: not only are some whole trials withheld from us, but there are often hidden flaws in the methods used. The devil is in the detail, and there are many dodgy trials, as we shall soon see, with flaws that may not be clear even in the academic papers, let alone in the thin and uninformative summaries from regulators. Furthermore, as we shall also see very shortly, there are often worrying discrepancies between the regulators\u2019 summary documents and what actually happened in the trial.\n\nThis is why we need to get hold of a more detailed document on each trial: something called the Clinical Study Report (CSR). These are long pieces of work, sometimes thousands of pages, but they are complete enough for the reader to reconstruct exactly what happened to all the participants; and they will let you find out where the bodies are buried. Drug companies give this study report to the regulator \u2013 though still only for formally licensed uses of the drug \u2013 so both have a copy, and both should be happy to hand it over.\n\nWe will now see what happens when you ask them.\n\nThree: Regulators withhold study reports that they do have\n\nIn 2007, researchers from the Nordic Cochrane Centre were working on a systematic review for two widely used diet drugs, orlistat and rimonabant. A systematic review, as you know, is the gold-standard summary of the evidence on whether a treatment is effective. These are life-saving, because they give us the best possible understanding of the true effects of a treatment, including its side effects. But doing this requires access to all of the evidence: if some is missing, especially if unflattering data is deliberately harder to obtain, we will be left with a distorted picture.\n\nThe researchers knew that the trial data they were able to find in the published academic literature was probably incomplete, because negative trials are routinely left unpublished. But they also knew that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) would have much of this information, since the manufacturers of drugs are obliged to give the study reports to the regulator when trying to get them onto the market. Since regulators are supposed to act in the interests of patients, they applied to the EMA for the protocols and the study reports. That was in June 2007.\n\nIn August, the EMA responded: it had decided not to give out the study reports for these trials, and was invoking the section of its rules which allows it to protect the commercial interests and intellectual property of drug companies. The researchers replied immediately, almost by return of post: there is nothing in the study reports that will undermine the protection of someone\u2019s commercial interests, they explained. But if there was, could the EMA please explain why it felt the commercial interests of the drug companies should override the welfare of patients?\n\nWe should pause for just one moment, and think about what the EMA is doing here. It is the regulator that approves and monitors drugs for the whole of Europe, with the aim of protecting the public. Doctors and patients can only make meaningful decisions about treatments if they have access to all the data. The EMA has that data, but has decided that the drug companies\u2019 interests are more important. Having spoken to a lot of people in regulation, I can offer one small insight into what on earth they might be thinking. Regulators, in my experience, are preoccupied with the idea that they see all the data, and use it to make the decision about whether a drug should go on the market, and that this is enough: doctors and patients don\u2019t need to see the data, because the regulator has done all that work.\n\nThis misunderstands a crucial difference between the decisions made by regulators and the decisions made by doctors. Contrary to what some regulators seem to think, a drug is not either \u2018good\u2019 and therefore on the market, or \u2018bad\u2019 and therefore off it. A regulator makes a decision about whether it\u2019s in the interests of the population as a whole that the drug should be available for use, at all, ever \u2013 even if only in some very obscure circumstance, infrequently and cautiously. This bar is set pretty low, as we shall see, and lots of drugs that are on the market (in fact, the overwhelming majority) are hardly ever used.\n\nA doctor needs to use the same information as that available to the regulator in order to make a very different decision: is this the right drug for the patient in front of me right now? The simple fact that a drug is approved for prescription doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s particularly good, or the best. In fact, there are complex decisions to be made in each clinical situation about which drug is best. Maybe the patient has failed to get better on one drug, so you want to try another, from a different class of drugs; maybe the patient has mild kidney failure, so you don\u2019t want to use the most popular drug, as that causes very occasional problems in patients with dodgy kidneys; maybe you need a drug that won\u2019t interfere with other drugs the patient is taking.\n\nThese complex considerations are the reason we are OK with having a range of drugs on the market: even if some of them are less useful overall, they might be useful in specific circumstances. But we need to be able to see all of the information about them, in order to make these decisions. It is not enough for the regulators to grandly state that they have approved a drug, and therefore we should all feel happy to prescribe it. Doctors and patients need the data just as much as regulators do.\n\nIn September 2007 the EMA confirmed to the Cochrane researchers that it wasn\u2019t going to share the study reports on orlistat and rimonabant, and explained that it had a policy of never disclosing the data given as part of a marketing authorisation. A serious problem had emerged. These weight-loss drugs were being widely prescribed throughout Europe, but doctors and patients were unable to access important information about whether they worked, how bad the side effects were, which was more effective, or any of a whole host of other important questions. Real patients were being exposed to potential harm, in everyday prescribing decisions, through this lack of information that was enforced by the EMA.\n\nThe researchers went to the European Ombudsman with two clear allegations. Firstly, the EMA had failed to give sufficient reasons for refusing them access to the data; and secondly, the EMA\u2019s brief, dismissive claim that commercial interests must be protected was unjustified, because there was no material of commercial interest in the trial results, other than the data on safety and effectiveness, which doctors and patients obviously need to access. They didn\u2019t know it at the time, but this was the beginning of a battle for data that would shame the EMA, and would last more than three years.\n\nIt took four months for the EMA to respond, and over the next year it simply reiterated its position: as far as it was concerned, any kind of information the disclosure of which would \u2018unreasonably undermine or prejudice the commercial interests of individuals or companies\u2019 was commercially confidential. The study reports, it said, might contain information about the commercial plans for the drug. The researchers responded that this was unlikely, but was in any case of marginal importance, as part of a much more important and pressing situation: \u2018As a likely consequence of [the] EMA\u2019s position, patients would die unnecessarily, and would be treated with inferior and potentially harmful drugs.\u2019 They regarded the EMA\u2019s position as ethically indefensible. More than that, they said, the EMA had a clear conflict of interest: this data could be used to challenge its summary views on the benefits and risks of these treatments. The EMA had failed to explain why doctors and patients having access to study reports and protocols should undermine anyone\u2019s reasonable commercial interests, and why these commercial interests were more important than the welfare of patients.\n\nThen, almost two years into this process, the EMA changed tack. Suddenly, it began to argue that study reports contain personal data about individual patients. This argument hadn\u2019t been raised by the EMA before, but it\u2019s also not true. There may have been some information in some whole sections of the study reports that gave detail on some individual participants\u2019 odd presentations, or on possible side effects, but these were all in the same appendix, and could easily be removed.\n\nThe EU Ombudsman\u2019s conclusions were clear: the EMA had failed in its duty to give an adequate or even coherent explanation of why it was refusing access to this important information. He made a preliminary finding of maladministration. After doing that, he was under no obligation to offer any further opinion on the weak excuses offered by the EMA, but he decided to do so anyway. His report is damning. The EMA had flatly failed to address a serious charge that its withholding information about these trials was against the public interest, and exposed patients to harm. The Ombudsman also described how he had gone through the study reports in detail himself, and had found that they contained neither any commercially confidential information, nor any details about the commercial development of the drugs. The EMA\u2019s claims that answering the request would have put it under an inappropriate administrative burden were untrue, and it had overestimated the work this would have involved: specifically, he explained, removing any personal data, where it did sometimes appear, would be easy.\n\nThe Ombudsman told the EMA to hand over the data, or produce a convincing explanation of why it shouldn\u2019t. Amazingly, the EMA, the drugs regulator covering the whole of Europe, still refused to hand over the documents. During this delay, people certainly suffered unnecessarily, and some possibly also died, simply for want of information. But the behaviour of the EMA then deteriorated even further, into the outright surreal. Any scrap of the company\u2019s thinking about how to run the trial, it argued, which could be intuited from reading the study reports and protocols, was commercially sensitive with respect to its thoughts and plans. This was true, the EMA said, even though the drugs were already on the market, and the information was from final clinical trials, at the very end of the commercial drug-development process. The researchers responded that this was perverse: they knew that withheld data is often negative, so if anything, any other company seeing negative data about these drugs would be less likely to try to get a competitor to market, if it appeared that the benefits of the drugs were more modest than had been thought.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the end of it. The EMA also grandly dismissed the idea that lives were at risk, stating that the burden of proof was on the researchers to demonstrate this. To me this is \u2013 if you can forgive me \u2013 a slightly contemptuous attitude, especially given what happens in the next paragraph. It\u2019s plainly true that if doctors and patients are unable to see which is the best treatment, then they will make worse decisions, exposing patients to unnecessary harm. Furthermore, it is obvious that larger numbers of academics making transparent judgements about publicly accessible trial data are a much more sensible way of determining the risks and benefits of an intervention than a brief blanket \u2018yes or no\u2019 edict and summary from a regulator. This is all true of drugs like orlistat and rimonabant, but it\u2019s also true of any drug, and we will see many cases where academics spotted problems with drugs that regulators had missed.\n\nThen, in 2009, one of the two drugs, rimonabant, was taken off the market, on the grounds that it increases the risk of serious psychiatric problems and suicide. This, at the same time that the EMA was arguing that researchers were wrong to claim that withholding information was harming patients.\n\nAnd then the EMA suddenly claimed that the design of a randomised trial itself is commercially confidential information.\n\nIn case it needs reiterating, let me remind you that the first trial appears in the Bible, Daniel 1:12, and although the core ideas have certainly been refined over time, all trials are essentially identical experiments, generic across any field, with the basics of a modern trial sketched out at least half a century ago. There is absolutely no earthly sense in which anyone could realistically claim that the design of a randomised controlled trial is a commercially confidential or patentable piece of intellectual property.\n\nThis was now a farce. The researchers opened all barrels. The EMA was in breach of the Declaration of Helsinki, the international code of medical ethics, which states that everyone involved in research has a duty to make trial findings public. The researchers knew that published papers give a flattering subset of the trial data, and so did the EMA. Patients would die if the EMA continued to withhold data. There was nothing of serious commercial value in there. The EMA\u2019s brief public summaries of the data were inaccurate. The EMA was complicit in the exploitation of patients for commercial gain.\n\nIt was now August 2009, and the researchers had been fighting for more than two years for access to data on two widely prescribed drugs, from the very organisation that is supposed to be protecting patients and the public. They weren\u2019t alone. The French \u2018prescribers\u2019 bulletin\u2019 Prescrire was trying at the same time to get the EMA\u2019s documents on rimonabant. It was sent some unhelpful documents, including the rather remarkable \u2018Final Assessment Report\u2019, from the Swedish agency that had handled the drug\u2019s approval much earlier. You can read this PDF in full online. Or rather, you can\u2019t. On the following page you can see exactly what the scientific analysis of the drug looked like \u2013 the document the EMA sent to one of France\u2019s most respected journals for doctors.73 I think it tells a rather clear story, and to add to the insult, there are sixty pages of this in total.\n\nIn the meantime, the Danish Medical Authority had handed over fifty-six study reports to Cochrane (though it still needed more from the EMA); a complaint from the drug company about this had been rejected by the Danish government, which had seen no problem with commercial information (there was none), nor administrative hassle (it was minimal), nor the idea that the design of a randomised trial is commercial information (which is laughable). This was chaos. The EMA \u2013 which you may remember was responsible for EudraCT, the transparency tool that is held in secret \u2013 was going out on a very peculiar limb. It seemed that it would do anything it could to withhold this information from doctors and patients. As we shall see, sadly, this level of secrecy is its stock in trade.\n\nBut now we come to the end of this particular road for the EMA. It handed the full, final study reports over to the Ombudsman, reminding him that even the table of contents for each was commercial. Once he had had these documents in his hand, his final opinion came swiftly. There was no commercial data here. There was no confidential patient information here. Hand it over to the public, now. The EMA, at glacial pace, agreed to set a deadline for delivering the data to the researchers, doctors and patients who needed it. The Ombudsman\u2019s final ruling was published at the end of November 2010.74 The initial complaint was made in June 2007. That is a full three and a half years of fighting, obstruction and spurious arguments from the EMA, during which one of the drugs had to be removed from the market because it was harming patients.\n\nAfter this precedent had been set, things had to shift at the EMA; it was forced to revise its approach, and study reports were briefly made more widely available under a new policy (this window has just been shut down, in 2013, as you will read in the Afterword). But even this policy of sharing reports did not solve the problem of access to all information about a trial: the EMA often doesn\u2019t hold all the modules, of all the reports, for all the uses of all the medicines it has approved. And it only holds records for the most recent few years, which is hopelessly incomplete, since in medicine we use treatments that have come on the market over the past few decades. In fact, this loophole is illustrated by the very first request made by the Cochrane researchers who won this great breakthrough with the Ombudsman. They applied for documents on antidepressants: a good place to start, since these drugs have been the focus of some particularly bad behaviour over the years (though we should remember that missing trial data pervades every corner of medicine). What happened next was even more bizarre than the EMA\u2019s three-year battle to withhold information on orlistat and rimonabant.\n\nThe researchers put in their request to the EMA, but were told that the drugs had been approved back in the era when marketing authorisations were given out by individual countries, rather than by the EMA centrally. These local authorisations were then \u2018copied\u2019 to all other nations. The MHRA, the UK drugs regulator, held the information the researchers wanted, so they would have to approach it for a copy. The researchers dutifully wrote to the MHRA, asked for the reports on a drug called fluoxetine, and then waited patiently. Finally the answer came: the MHRA explained that it would be happy to hand over this information, but there was a problem.\n\nThe documents had all been shredded.75\n\nThis was in keeping, it explained, with the agency\u2019s retention policy, which was that such documents were only kept if they were of particular scientific, historical or political interest, and the files didn\u2019t meet those criteria. Let\u2019s just take a moment to think through what the criteria must be. The SSRI antidepressant drugs have seen many scandals on hidden data, and that should be enough on its own, but if you think back to the beginning of this chapter, one of them \u2013 paroxetine \u2013 was involved in an unprecedented, four-year-long investigation into whether criminal charges could be brought against GSK. That investigation into paroxetine was the largest investigation that the MHRA has ever conducted into drug safety: in fact, it was the largest investigation the MHRA has ever conducted, of any kind, ever. Quite apart from that, these original study reports contain vitally important data on safety and efficacy. But the MHRA shredded them all the same, feeling that they were not of sufficient scientific, historical or political interest.76\n\nI can only leave you there.\n\nWhere are we so far?\n\nThe missing data saga is long and complex, and involves patients around the world being put at risk, and some major players which have let us down to an extraordinary extent. Since we are almost at the end of it, this is a good moment to gather together what we\u2019ve seen so far.\n\nTrials are frequently conducted, but then left unpublished, and so are unavailable to doctors and patients. Only half of all trials get published, and those with negative results are twice as likely to go missing as those with positive ones. This means that the evidence on which we base decisions in medicine is systematically biased to overstate the benefits of the treatments we give. Since there is no way to compensate for this missing data, we have no way of knowing the true benefits and risks of the drugs doctors prescribe.\n\nThis is research misconduct on a grand, international scale. The reality of the problem is universally recognised, but nobody has bothered to fix it:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Ethics committees allow companies and individual \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0researchers with a track record of unpublished data to do more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0trials on human participants.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*University administrators and ethics committees permit \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0contracts with industry that explicitly say the sponsor can \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0control the data.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Registers have never been enforced.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Academic journals continue to publish trials that were \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0unregistered, despite pretending that they won\u2019t.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Regulators have information that would be vital to improve \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0patient care, but are systematically obstructive:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*they have poor systems to share poor summaries of the \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information that they do have;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*and they are bizarrely obstructive of people asking for more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0information.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Drug companies hold trial results that even regulators don\u2019t \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0see.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Governments have never implemented laws compelling \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0companies to publish data.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*Doctors\u2019 and academics\u2019 professional bodies have done nothing.\n\nWhat to do about all this?\n\nYou will need to wait, because in the next section there are even greater horrors to come.\n\nTrying to get trial data from drug companies: the story of Tamiflu\n\nGovernments around the world have spent billions of pounds on stockpiling a drug called Tamiflu. In the UK alone we have spent several hundred million pounds \u2013 the total figure is not yet clear \u2013 and so far we\u2019ve bought enough tablets to treat 80 per cent of the population if an outbreak of bird flu occurs. I\u2019m very sorry if you have the flu, because it\u2019s horrid being ill; but we have not spent all this money to reduce the duration of your symptoms in the event of a pandemic by a few hours (though Tamiflu does do this, fairly satisfactorily). We have spent this money to reduce the rate of \u2018complications\u2019: a medical euphemism, meaning pneumonia and death.\n\nLots of people seem to think Tamiflu will do this. The US Department of Health and Human Services said it would save lives and reduce hospital admissions. The European Medicines Agency said it would reduce complications. The Australian drugs regulator said so too. Roche\u2019s website said it reduces complications by 67 per cent.77 But what is the evidence that Tamiflu really will reduce complications? Answering questions like this is the bread and butter of the Cochrane Collaboration, which you will remember is the vast and independent non-profit international collaboration of academics producing hundreds of systematic reviews on important questions in medicine every year. In 2009 there was concern about a flu pandemic, and an enormous amount of money was being spent on Tamiflu. Because of this, the UK and Australian governments specifically asked the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group to update its earlier reviews on the drug.\n\nCochrane reviews are in a constant review cycle, because evidence changes over time as new trials are published. This should have been a pretty everyday piece of work: the previous review, in 2008, had found some evidence that Tamiflu does indeed reduce the rate of complications. But then a Japanese paediatrician called Keiji Hayashi left a comment that would trigger a revolution in our understanding of how evidence-based medicine should work. This wasn\u2019t in a publication, or even a letter: it was a simple online comment, posted underneath the Tamiflu review on the Cochrane website.\n\nYou\u2019ve summarised the data from all the trials, he explained, but your positive conclusion is really driven by data from just one of the papers you cite, an industry-funded meta-analysis led by an author called Kaiser. This, \u2018the Kaiser paper\u2019, summarises the findings of ten earlier trials, but from these ten trials, only two have ever been published in the scientific literature. For the remaining eight, your only information comes from the brief summary in this secondary, industry source. That\u2019s not reliable enough.\n\nIn case it\u2019s not immediately obvious, this is science at its best. The Cochrane review is readily accessible online; it explains transparently the methods by which it looked for trials, and then analysed them, so any informed reader can pull the review apart, and understand where the conclusions came from. Cochrane provides an easy way for readers to raise criticisms. And, crucially, these criticisms did not fall on deaf ears. Tom Jefferson is an editor at the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group, and the lead author on the 2008 review. He realised immediately that he had made a mistake in blindly trusting the Kaiser data. He said so, without any defensiveness, and then set about getting the information in a straight, workpersonlike fashion. This began a three-year battle, which is still not resolved, but which has thrown stark light on the need for all researchers to have access to clinical study reports on trials wherever possible.\n\nFirst, the Cochrane researchers wrote to the authors of the Kaiser paper, asking for more information. In reply, they were told that this team no longer had the files, and that they should contact Roche, the manufacturer of Tamiflu. So naturally they wrote to Roche and asked for the data.\n\nThis is where the problems began. Roche said it would hand over some data, but the Cochrane reviewers would need to sign a confidentiality agreement. This was an impossibility for any serious scientist: it would prevent them from conducting a systematic review with any reasonable degree of openness and transparency. More than this, the proposed contract also raised serious ethical issues, in that it would have required the Cochrane team to actively withhold information from the reader: it included a clause saying that on signing it, the reviewers would never be allowed to discuss the terms of this secrecy agreement; and more than that, they would be forbidden from ever publicly acknowledging that it even existed. Roche was demanding a secret contract, with secret terms, requiring secrecy about trial data, in a discussion about the safety and efficacy of a drug that has been taken by hundreds of thousands of people around the world. Jefferson asked for clarification, and never received a reply.\n\nThen, in October 2009, the company changed tack: they would like to hand the data over, they explained, but another meta-analysis was being conducted elsewhere. Roche had given them the study reports, so Cochrane couldn\u2019t have them. This was a simple non-sequitur: there is no reason why many groups shouldn\u2019t all work on the same question. In fact, quite the opposite: replication is the cornerstone of good science. Roche\u2019s excuse made no sense. Jefferson asked for clarification, but never received a reply.\n\nOne week later, unannounced, Roche sent seven short documents, each around a dozen pages long. These contained excerpts of internal company documents on each of the clinical trials in the Kaiser meta-analysis. This was a start, but it didn\u2019t contain anything like enough information for Cochrane to assess the benefits, or the rate of adverse events, or fully to understand exactly what methods were used in the trials.\n\nAt the same time, it was rapidly becoming clear that there were odd inconsistencies in the information on this drug. Firstly, there was considerable disagreement at the level of the broad conclusions drawn by different organisations. The FDA said there were no benefits on complications, while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (in charge of public health in the USA \u2013 some wear nice naval uniforms in honour of their history on the docks) said it did reduce complications. The Japanese regulator made no claim for complications, but the EMA said there was a benefit. In a sensible world, we might think that all these organisations should sing from the same hymn sheet, because all would have access to the same information. Of course, there is also room for occasional, reasonable disagreement, especially where there are close calls: this is precisely why doctors and researchers should have access to all the information about a drug, so that they can make their own judgements.\n\nMeanwhile, reflecting these different judgements, Roche\u2019s own websites said completely different things in different jurisdictions, depending on what the local regulator had said. It\u2019s na\u00efve, perhaps, to expect consistency from a drug company, but from this and other stories it\u2019s clear that industry utterances are driven by the maximum they can get away with in each territory, rather than any consistent review of the evidence.\n\nIn any case, now that their interest had been piqued, the Cochrane researchers also began to notice that there were odd discrepancies between the frequency of adverse events in different databases. Roche\u2019s global safety database held 2,466 neuropsychiatric adverse events, of which 562 were classified as \u2018serious\u2019. But the FDA database for the same period held only 1,805 adverse events in total. The rules vary on what needs to be notified to whom, and where, but even allowing for that, this was odd.\n\nIn any case, since Roche was denying them access to the information needed to conduct a proper review, the Cochrane team concluded that they would have to exclude all the unpublished Kaiser data from their analysis, because the details could not be verified in the normal way. People cannot make treatment and purchasing decisions on the basis of trials if the full methods and results aren\u2019t clear: the devil is often in the detail, as we shall see in Chapter 4, on \u2018bad trials\u2019, so we cannot blindly trust that every study is a fair test of the treatment.\n\nThis is particularly important with Tamiflu, because there are good reasons to think that these trials were not ideal, and that published accounts were incomplete, to say the least. On closer examination, for example, the patients participating were clearly unusual, to the extent that the results may not be very relevant to normal everyday flu patients. In the published accounts, patients in the trials are described as typical flu patients, suffering from normal flu symptoms like cough, fatigue, and so on. We don\u2019t do blood tests on people with flu in routine practice, but when these tests are done \u2013 for surveillance purposes \u2013 then even during peak flu season only about one in three people with \u2018flu\u2019 will actually be infected with the influenza virus, and most of the year only one in eight will really have it. (The rest are sick from something else, maybe just a common cold virus.)\n\nTwo thirds of the trial participants summarised in the Kaiser paper tested positive for flu. This is bizarrely high, and means that the benefits of the drug will be overstated, because it is being tested on perfect patients, the very ones most likely to get better from a drug that selectively attacks the flu virus. In normal practice, which is where the results of these trials will be applied, doctors will be giving the drug to real patients who are diagnosed with \u2018flu-like illness\u2019, which is all you can realistically do in a clinic. Among these real patients, many will not actually have the influenza virus. This means that in the real world, the benefits of Tamiflu on flu will be diluted, and many more people will be exposed to the drug who don\u2019t actually have flu virus in their systems. This, in turn, means that the side effects are likely to creep up in significance, in comparison with any benefits. That is why we strive to ensure that all trials are conducted in normal, everyday, realistic patients: if they are not, their findings may not be relevant to the real world.\n\nSo the Cochrane review was published without the Kaiser data in December 2009, alongside some explanatory material about why the Kaiser results had been excluded, and a small flurry of activity followed. Roche put the short excerpts it had sent over online, and committed to make full study reports available (it still hasn\u2019t done so).\n\nWhat Roche posted was incomplete, but it began a journey for the Cochrane academics of learning a great deal more about the real information that is collected on a trial, and how that can differ from what is given to doctors and patients in the form of brief, published academic papers. At the core of every trial is the raw data: every single record of blood pressure of every patient, the doctors\u2019 notes describing any unusual symptoms, investigators\u2019 notes, and so on. A published academic paper is a short description of the study, usually following a set format: an introductory background; a description of the methods; a summary of the important results; and then finally a discussion, covering the strengths and weaknesses of the design, and the implications of the results for clinical practice.\n\nA clinical study report, or CSR, is the intermediate document that stands between these two, and can be very long, sometimes thousands of pages.78 Anybody working in the pharmaceutical industry is very familiar with these documents, but doctors and academics have rarely heard of them. They contain much more detail on things like the precise plan for analysing the data statistically, detailed descriptions of adverse events, and so on.\n\nThese documents are split into different sections, or \u2018modules\u2019. Roche has shared only \u2018module 1\u2019, for only seven of the ten study reports Cochrane has requested. These modules are missing vitally important information, including the analysis plan, the randomisation details, the study protocol (and the list of deviations from that), and so on. But even these incomplete modules were enough to raise concerns about the universal practice of trusting academic papers to give a complete story about what happened to the patients in a trial.\n\nFor example, looking at the two papers out of ten in the Kaiser review which were published, one says: \u2018There were no drug-related serious adverse events,\u2019 and the other doesn\u2019t mention adverse events. But in the \u2018module 1\u2019 documents on these same two studies, there are ten serious adverse events listed, of which three are classified as being possibly related to Tamiflu.79\n\nAnother published paper describes itself as a trial comparing Tamiflu against placebo. A placebo is an inert tablet, containing no active ingredient, that is visually indistinguishable from the pill containing the real medicine. But the CSR for this trial shows that the real medicine was in a grey and yellow capsule, whereas the placebos were grey and ivory. The \u2018placebo\u2019 tablets also contained something called dehydrocholic acid, a chemical which encourages the gall bladder to empty.80 Nobody has any clear idea of why, and it\u2019s not even mentioned in the academic paper; but it seems that this was not actually an inert, dummy pill placebo.\n\nSimply making a list of all the trials conducted on a subject is vitally important if we want to avoid seeing only a biased summary of the research done on a subject; but in the case of Tamiflu even this proved to be almost impossible. For example, Roche Shanghai informed the Cochrane group of one large trial (ML16369), but Roche Basel seemed not to know of its existence. But by setting out all the trials side by side, the researchers were able to identify peculiar discrepancies: for example, the largest \u2018phase 3\u2019 trial \u2013 one of the large trials that are done to get a drug onto the market \u2013 was never published, and is rarely mentioned in regulatory documents.fn3\n\nThere were other odd discrepancies. Why, for example, was one trial on Tamiflu published in 2010, ten years after it was completed?82 Why did some trials report completely different authors, depending on where they were being discussed?83 And so on.\n\nThe chase continued. In December 2009 Roche had promised: \u2018full study reports will also be made available on a password-protected site within the coming days to physicians and scientists undertaking legitimate analyses\u2019. This never happened. Then an odd game began. In June 2010 Roche said: Oh, we\u2019re sorry, we thought you had what you wanted. In July it announced that it was worried about patient confidentiality (you may remember this from the EMA saga). This was an odd move: for most of the important parts of these documents, privacy is no issue at all. The full trial protocol, and the analysis plan, are both completed before any single patient is ever touched. Roche has never explained why patient privacy prevents it from releasing the study reports. It simply continued to withhold them.\n\nThen in August 2010 it began to make some even more bizarre demands, betraying a disturbing belief that companies are perfectly entitled to control access to information that is needed by doctors and patients around the world to make safe decisions. Firstly, it insisted on seeing the Cochrane reviewers\u2019 full analysis plan. Fine, they said, and posted the whole protocol online. Doing so is completely standard practice at Cochrane, as it should be for any transparent organisation, and allows people to suggest important changes before you begin. There were few surprises, since all Cochrane reports follow a pretty strict manual anyway. Roche continued to withhold its study reports (including, ironically, its own protocols, the very thing it demanded Cochrane should publish, and that Cochrane had published, happily).\n\nBy now Roche had been refusing to publish the study reports for a year. Suddenly, the company began to raise odd personal concerns. It claimed that some Cochrane researchers had made untrue statements about the drug, and about the company, but refused to say who, or what, or where. \u2018Certain members of Cochrane Group involved with the review of the neuraminidase inhibitors,\u2019 it announced, \u2018are unlikely to approach the review with the independence that is both necessary and justified.\u2019 This is an astonishing state of affairs, where a company feels it should be allowed to prevent individual researchers access to data that should be available to all; but still Roche refused to hand over the study reports.\n\nThen it complained that the Cochrane reviewers had begun to copy journalists in on their emails when responding to Roche staff. I was one of the people copied in on these interactions, and I believe that this was exactly the correct thing to do. Roche\u2019s excuses had become perverse, and the company had failed to keep its promise to share all study reports. It\u2019s clear that the modest pressure exerted by researchers in academic journals alone was having little impact on Roche\u2019s refusal to release the data, and this is an important matter of public health, both for the individual case of this Tamiflu data, and for the broader issue of companies and regulators harming patients by withholding information.\n\nThen things became even more perverse. In January 2011 Roche announced that the Cochrane researchers had already been given all the data they need. This was simply untrue. In February it insisted that all the studies requested were published (meaning academic papers, now shown to be misleading on Tamiflu). Then it declared that it would hand over nothing more, saying: \u2018You have all the detail you need to undertake a review.\u2019 But this still wasn\u2019t true: it was still withholding the material it had publicly promised to hand over \u2018within a few days\u2019 in December 2009, a year and a half earlier.\n\nAt the same time, the company was raising the broken arguments we have already seen: it\u2019s the job of regulators to make these decisions about benefit and risk, it said, not academics. Now, this claim fails on two important fronts. Firstly, as with many other drugs, we now know that not even the regulators had seen all the data. In January 2012 Roche claimed that it \u2018has made full clinical study data available to health authorities around the world for their review as part of the licensing process\u2019. But the EMA never received this information for at least fifteen trials. This was because the EMA had never requested it.\n\nAnd that brings us on to our final important realisation: regulators are not infallible. They make outright mistakes, and they make decisions which are open to judgement, and should be subject to second-guessing and checking by many eyes around the world. In the next chapter we will see more examples of how regulators can fail, behind closed doors, but here we will look at one story that illustrates the benefit of \u2018many eyes\u2019 perfectly.\n\nRosiglitazone is a new kind of diabetes drug, and lots of researchers and patients had high hopes that it would be safe and effective.84 Diabetes is common, and more people develop the disease every year. Sufferers have poor control of their blood sugar, and diabetes drugs, alongside dietary changes, are supposed to fix this. Although it\u2019s nice to see your blood sugar being controlled nicely in the numbers from lab tests and machines at home, we don\u2019t control these figures for their own sake: we try to control blood sugar because we hope that this will help reduce the chances of real-world outcomes, like heart attack and death, both of which occur at a higher rate in people with diabetes.\n\nRosiglitazone was first marketed in 1999, and from the outset it was a magnet for disappointing behaviour. In that first year, Dr John Buse from the University of North Carolina discussed an increased risk of heart problems at a pair of academic meetings. The drug\u2019s manufacturer, GSK, made direct contact in an attempt to silence him, then moved on to his head of department. Buse felt pressured to sign various legal documents. To cut a long story short, after wading through documents for several months, in 2007 the US Senate Committee on Finance released a report describing the treatment of Dr Buse as \u2018intimidation\u2019.\n\nBut we are more concerned with the safety and efficacy data. In 2003 the Uppsala Drug Monitoring Group of the World Health Organization contacted GSK about an unusually large number of spontaneous reports associating rosiglitazone with heart problems. GSK conducted two internal meta-analyses of its own data on this, in 2005 and 2006. These showed that the risk was real, but although both GSK and the FDA had these results, neither made any public statement about them, and they were not published until 2008.\n\nDuring this delay, vast numbers of patients were exposed to the drug, but doctors and patients only learned about this serious problem in 2007, when cardiologist Professor Steve Nissen and colleagues published a landmark meta-analysis. This showed a 43 per cent increase in the risk of heart problems in patients on rosiglitazone. Since people with diabetes are already at increased risk of heart problems, and the whole point of treating diabetes is to reduce this risk, that finding was big potatoes. His findings were confirmed in later work, and in 2010 the drug was either taken off the market or restricted, all around the world.\n\nNow, my argument is not that this drug should have been banned sooner, because as perverse as it sounds, doctors do often need inferior drugs for use as a last resort. For example, a patient may develop idiosyncratic side effects on the most effective pills, and be unable to take them any longer. Once this has happened, it may be worth trying a less effective drug, if it is at least better than nothing.\n\nThe concern is that these discussions happened with the data locked behind closed doors, visible only to regulators. In fact, Nissen\u2019s analysis could only be done at all because of a very unusual court judgement. In 2004, when GSK was caught out withholding data showing evidence of serious side effects from paroxetine in children, the UK conducted an unprecedented four-year-long investigation, as we saw earlier. But in the US, the same bad behaviour resulted in a court case over allegations of fraud, the settlement of which, alongside a significant payout, required GSK to commit to posting clinical trial results on a public website.\n\nProfessor Nissen used the rosiglitazone data, when it became available, found worrying signs of harm, and published this to doctors, which is something that the regulators had never done, despite having the information years earlier. (Though before doctors got to read it, Nissen by chance caught GSK discussing a copy of his unpublished paper, which it had obtained improperly.85)\n\nIf this information had all been freely available from the start, regulators might have felt a little more anxious about their decisions, but crucially, doctors and patients could have disagreed with them, and made informed choices. This is why we need wider access to full CSRs, and all trial reports, for all medicines, and this is why it is perverse that Roche should be able even to contemplate deciding which favoured researchers should be allowed to read the documents on Tamiflu.\n\nAstonishingly, a paper published in April 2012 by regulators from the UK and Europe suggests that they might agree to more data sharing, to a limited extent, within limits, for some studies, with caveats, at the appropriate juncture, and in the fullness of time.86 Before feeling any sense of enthusiasm, we should remember that this is a cautious utterance, wrung out after the dismal fights I have already described; that it has not been implemented; that it must be set against a background of broken promises from all players across the whole field of missing data; and that in any case, regulators do not have all the trial data anyway. But it is an interesting start.\n\nTheir two main objections \u2013 if we accept their goodwill at face value \u2013 are interesting, because they lead us to the final problem in the way we tolerate harm to patients from missing trial data. Firstly, they raise the concern that some academics and journalists might use study reports to conduct histrionic or poorly conducted reviews of the data: to this, again, I say, \u2018Let them,\u2019 because these foolish analyses should be conducted, and then rubbished, in public.\n\nWhen UK hospital mortality statistics first became easily accessible to the public, doctors were terrified that they would be unfairly judged: the crude figures can be misinterpreted, after all, because one hospital may have worse figures simply because it is a centre of excellence, and takes in more challenging patients than its neighbours; and there is random variation to be expected in mortality rates anyway, so some hospitals might look unusually good, or bad, simply through the play of chance. Initially, to an extent, these fears were realised: there were a few shrill, unfair stories, and people overinterpreted the results. Now, for the most part, things have settled down, and many lay people are quite able to recognise that crude analyses of such figures are misleading. For drug data, where there is so much danger from withheld information, and so many academics desperate to conduct meaningful analyses, and so many other academics happy to criticise them, releasing the data is the only healthy option.\n\nBut secondly, the EMA raises the spectre of patient confidentiality, and hidden in this concern is one final prize.\n\nSo far I have been talking about access to trial reports, summaries of patients\u2019 outcomes in trials. There is no good reason to believe that this poses any threat to patient confidentiality, and where there are specific narratives that might make a patient identifiable \u2013 a lengthy medical description of one person\u2019s idiosyncratic adverse event in a trial, perhaps \u2013 these can easily be removed, since they appear in a separate part of the document. These CSRs should undoubtedly, without question, be publicly available documents, and this should be enforced retrospectively, going back decades, to the dawn of trials.\n\nBut all trials are ultimately run on individual patients, and the results of those individual patients are all stored and used for the summary analysis at the end of the study. While I would never suggest that these should be posted up on a public website \u2013 it would be easy for patients to be identifiable, from many small features of their histories \u2013 it is surprising that patient-level data is almost never shared with academics.\n\nSharing data of individual patients\u2019 outcomes in clinical trials, rather than just the final summary result, has several significant advantages. Firstly, it\u2019s a safeguard against dubious analytic practices. In the VIGOR trial on the painkiller Vioxx, for example, a bizarre reporting decision was made.87 The aim of the study was to compare Vioxx against an older, cheaper painkiller, to see if it was any less likely to cause stomach problems (this was the hope for Vioxx), and also if it caused more heart attacks (this was the fear). But the date cut-off for measuring heart attacks was much earlier than that for measuring stomach problems. This had the result of making the risks look less significant, relative to the benefits, but it was not declared clearly in the paper, resulting in a giant scandal when it was eventually noticed. If the raw data on patients was shared, games like these would be far easier to spot, and people might be less likely to play them in the first place.\n\nOccasionally \u2013 with vanishing rarity \u2013 researchers are able to obtain raw data, and re-analyse studies that have already been conducted and published. Daniel Coyne, Professor of Medicine at Washington University, was lucky enough to get the data on a key trial for epoetin, a drug given to patients on kidney dialysis, after a four-year-long fight.88 The original academic publication on this study, ten years earlier, had switched the primary outcomes described in the protocol (we will see later how this exaggerates the benefits of treatments), and changed the main statistical analysis strategy (again, a huge source of bias). Coyne was able to analyse the study as the researchers had initially stated they were planning to in their protocol; and when he did, he found that they had dramatically overstated the benefits of the drug. It was a peculiar outcome, as he himself acknowledges: \u2018As strange as it seems, I am now the sole author of the publication on the predefined primary and secondary results of the largest outcomes trial of epoetin in dialysis patients, and I didn\u2019t even participate in the trial.\u2019 There is room, in my view, for a small army of people doing the very same thing, reanalysing all the trials that were incorrectly analysed, in ways that deviated misleadingly from their original protocols.\n\nData sharing would also confer other benefits. It allows people to conduct more exploratory analyses of data, and to better investigate \u2013 for example \u2013 whether a drug is associated with a particular unexpected side effect. It would also allow cautious \u2018subgroup analyses\u2019, to see if a drug is particularly useful, or particularly useless, in particular types of patients.\n\nThe biggest immediate benefit from data sharing is that combining individual patient data into a meta-analysis gives more accurate results than working with the crude summary results at the end of a paper. Let\u2019s imagine that one paper reports survival at three years as the main outcome for a cancer drug, and another reports survival at seven years. To combine these two in a meta-analysis, you\u2019d have a problem. But if you were doing the meta-analysis with access to individual patient data, with treatment details and death dates for all of them, you could do a clean combined calculation for three-year survival.\n\nDarby S, McGale P, Correa C, Taylor C, Arriagada R, Clarke M, Cutter D, Davies C, Ewertz M, Godwin J, Gray R, Pierce L, Whelan T, Wang Y, Peto R.Albain K, Anderson S, Arriagada R, Barlow

to have driven a pioneering culture of easier collaboration. The summaries they are publishing represent real collaboration, between vast numbers of people, and on vast numbers of patients, producing highly reliable guidance for doctors and patients.\n\nThe process sheds a stark light on the reality of data collaboration on such a large scale. Here, for example, is the author list on an academic paper from the Lancet in November 2011: it\u2019s reporting an immense, definitive, and incredibly useful metaanalysis of breast cancer treatment outcomes, using individual patient data pooled from seventeen different trials. The author list is printed in four-point font size (though I suspect that might go wrong in the e-book edition \u2026) because there are seven hundred individual researchers named in it. I typed each of them in by hand for you.\n\nThis is what medicine should look like. An honest list of all the people involved, free access to information, and all the data pooled together, giving the most accurate information we can manage, to inform real decisions, and so prevent avoidable suffering and death.\n\nWe are a very, very long way away from there.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nWe urgently need to improve access to trial data. In addition to the previous suggestions, there are small changes that would vastly improve access to information, and so improve patient care.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The results of all trials conducted on humans must be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0made available within one year of completion, in summary \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0table form if academic journal publication has not occurred. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This requires the creation of a body that is charged with \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0publicly auditing whether or not trials have withheld results at \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0twelve months; and primary legislation that is enforced, as a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0matter of urgency, internationally, with stiff penalties for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0transgression. In my view these penalties should include fines, \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0but also prison terms for those who are found to be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0responsible for withholding trial data, as patients are harmed \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0by this process.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.All systematic reviews \u2013 such as Cochrane reviews \u2013 that draw \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0together trial results on any clinical question should also \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0include a section on the trials which they know have been \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0conducted, but whose results are being withheld. This should \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0state: which completed trials have not reported results; how \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0many patients\u2019 worth of information there is in each unreported \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0trial; the names of the organisations and the individuals who \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0are withholding the data; the efforts the reviewers have made \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0to get the information from them. This is trivial extra work, as \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0review teams already attempt to access this kind of data. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Documenting this will draw attention to the problem, and make \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it easier for doctors and the public to see who is responsible \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0for harming patient care in each area of medicine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0All clinical study reports should also be made publicly \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0available, for all the trials that have ever been conducted on \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0humans. This will be cheap, as the only costs are in finding one \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0paper copy, scanning it and placing it online, perhaps with a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0check to remove confidential patient information. There is a \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0vast mountain of highly relevant data on drugs that is currently \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0being withheld, distorting what we know about treatments in \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0widespread current use. Many of these documents will be \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0sitting in the dry paper archives of drug companies and \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0regulators. We need legislation compelling the industry to hand \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0them over. Our failure to fix this is costing lives.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0We need to work on new methods for academics to extract \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0summary information from these documents, as they are more \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0detailed than published academic papers. The Cochrane group \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0working on Tamiflu have made great progress here, learning as \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0they go, and this field will need manuals.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05.\u00a0We should work towards all triallists having an obligation to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0share patient-level data wherever possible, with convenient \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0online data warehouses,89 and streamlined systems \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0whereby legitimate senior researchers can make requests for \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0access, in order to conduct pooled analyses and double-check \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0the results reported in published trials.\n\nNone of this is difficult, or impossible. Some of it is technical, for which I apologise. The field of missing data is a tragic and strange one. We have tolerated the emergence of a culture in medicine where information is routinely withheld, and we have blinded ourselves to the unnecessary suffering and death that follows from this. The people we should have been able to trust to handle all this behind the scenes \u2013 the regulators, the politicians, the senior academics, the patient organisations, the professional bodies, the universities, the ethics committees \u2013 have almost all failed us. And so I have had to inflict the details on you, in the hope that you can bring some pressure to bear yourself.\n\nIf you have any ideas about how we can fix this, and how we can force access to trial data \u2013 politically or technically \u2013 please write them up, post them online, and tell me where to find them.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1665623", "artist_names": "R.B.

Ithaca) LyricsWhat parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?\n\nStarting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner's place by an inadvertance as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north: then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.\n\nOf what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?\n\nMusic, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glow-lamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.\n\nDid Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?\n\nBoth were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.\nWere their views on some points divergent?\n\nStephen dissented openly from Bloom's view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (266 A.D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman's hand.\n\nWas there one point on which their views were equal and negative?\n\nThe influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.\n\nHad Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?\n\nIn 1884 with Ower Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.\n\nWhat reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?\n\nHe reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.\n\nAs in what ways?\n\nFrom inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.\n\nWhat action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?\n\nAt the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.\n\nWas it there?\nIt was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.\n\nWhy was he doubly irritated?\n\nBecause he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.\n\nWhat were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?\n\nTo enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.\n\nBloom's decision?\n\nA stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.\n\nDid he fall?\n\nBy his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Fraedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the Christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number $, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, MXMIV.\n\nDid he rise uninjured by concussion?\n\nRegaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a Lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.\n\nWhat discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?\n\nReclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 C P, a man lighting a candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of ICP.\nDid the man reappear elsewhere?\n\nAlter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.\n\nDid Stephen obey his sign?\n\nYes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house.\n\nWhat did Bloom do?\n\nHe extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.\n\nOf what similar apparitions did Stephen think?\n\nOf others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.\n\nWhat did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?\n\nUnder a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.\n\nWhat did Bloom see on the range?\n\nOn the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.\n\nWhat did Bloom do at the range?\n\nHe removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.\n\nDid it flow?\n\nYes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2,400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of #5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee, had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.\n\nWhat in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?\n\nIts universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's projection: its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8,000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: Its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.\n\nHaving set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?\n\nTo wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.\n\nWhat reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?\n\nThat he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.\n\nWhat impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach, and thenar or sole of foot?\n\nThe incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.\n\nWhat additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?\n\nDietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.\n\nWhich seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?\n\nConfidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.\n\nWhat concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?\n\nThe phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise I pound of water from 50\u00b0 to 212\u00b0 Fahrenheit.\n\nWhat announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?\n\nA double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.\n\nFor what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?\n\nTo shave himself.\n\nWhat advantages attended shaving by night?\n\nA softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done.\n\nWhy did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises\n\nBecause of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.\n\nWhat quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?\n\nThe operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.\n\nWhat lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by Bloom?\n\nOn the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, and open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits. On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's choice tea at 2/- per lb. in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences.\n\nWhat attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?\n\nFour polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 887, 886.\n\nWhat reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?\n\nReminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.\n\nWhere had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?\n\nIn Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited) dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman's Journal and National Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.\n\nWhat qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?\n\nThe difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.\n\nHis mood?\n\nHe had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.\n\nWhat satisfied him?\n\nTo have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles.\n\nHow did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?\n\nHe poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.\n\nWhat supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?\n\nRelinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).\n\nWas the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?\n\nHis attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct, the creature cocoa.\n\nWere there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?\n\nThe reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.\n\nWho drank more quickly?\n\nBloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to two, nine to three.\n\nWhat cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?\n\nConcluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.\n\nHad he found their solution?\n\nIn spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing on all points.\n\nWhat lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes at 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the Shamrock, a weekly newspaper?\n\nAn ambition to squint\nAt my verses in print\nMakes me hope that for these you'll find room.\nIf you so condescend\nThen please place at the end\nThe name of yours truly, L. Bloom.\n\nDid he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?\n\nName, age, race, creed.\n\nWhat anagrams had he made on his name in youth?\n\nLeopold Bloom\n\nEllpodbomool\n\nMolldopeloob.\n\nBollo edoom\n\nOld Ollebo, M. P.\n\nWhat acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?\n\nPoets oft have sung in rhyme\nOf music sweet their praise divine.\nLet them hymn it nine times nine.\nDearer far than song or wine,\nYou are mine. The world is mine.\n\nWhat had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G. Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual years, entitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor (written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan, produced by R. Shelton 26 December 1892 under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist principal girl?\n\nFirstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses, the duke and duchess of York (real), and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary); thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-political, nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white articles of nonintellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from Everybody's Book of Jokes (1,000 pages and a laugh in every one); sixthly, the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.\n\nWhat relation existed between their ages?\n\n16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen was 6.16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.\n\nWhat events might nullify these calculations?\n\nThe cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.\n\nHow many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?\n\nTwo. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.\n\nDid Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?\n\nVery gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.\n\nDid their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?\n\nMrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.\n\nHad he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?\n\nHe had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.\n\nWhy could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?\n\nBecause in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe.\n\nWhat distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?\n\nThe older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositions wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.\n\nWere there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?\n\nThe indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's Physical Strength and How To Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.\n\nHad any special agility been his in earlier youth?\n\nThough ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.\n\nDid either openly allude to their racial difference?\n\nNeither.\n\nWhat, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?\n\nHe thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.\n\nWhat, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?\n\nBloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty); Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).\n\nHad Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?\n\nBloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A. alone in the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe; by James O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords; and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.\n\nDid they find their educational careers similar?\n\nSubstituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree course of the royal university.\n\nWhy did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?\n\nBecause of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.\n\nWhat two temperaments did they individually represent?\n\nThe scientific. The artistic.\n\nWhat proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?\n\nCertain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.\n\nWere these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?\n\nYes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playingballs, historically costumed dolls.\n\nWhat also stimulated him in his cogitations?\n\nThe financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the former by his 1d. bazaar at 42 George's street, South, the latter at his 6 1/2d. shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d., children 1d.; and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.\n\nSuch as?\n\nK. 11. Kino's 111- Trousers.\n\nHouse of Keys. Alexander J. Keyes.\n\nSuch as not?\n\nLook at this long candle. Calculate when it burns out and you receive gratis I pair of our special non-compo boots, guaranteed I candle power. Address: Barclay and Cook, 18 Talbot Street.\n\nBacilikil (Insect Powder).\n\nVeribest (Boot Blacking).\n\nUwantit (Combined pocket twoblade penknife with corkscrew, nailfile and pipecleaner).\n\nSuch as never?\n\nWhat is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat?\n\nIncomplete.\n\nWith it an abode of bliss.\n\nManufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants' quay, Dublin, put up in 4 oz. pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree is a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Montpat. Plamtroo.\n\nWhich example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?\n\nHis own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.\n\nWhat suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?\n\nSolitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary\n\nWhat?\n\nIn sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's hotel, Queen's hotel, Queen's Ho...\n\nWhat suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?\n\nThe Queen's Hotel, Ennis, County, Glare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment, composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.\n\nDid he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?\n\nCoincidence.\n\nDid he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?\n\nHe preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.\n\nDid he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of the Plums?\n\nIt, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e.g. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon's Studies in Blue, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlict, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.\n\nWhich domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?\n\nWhat to do with our wives.\n\nWhat had been his hypothetical singular solutions?\n\nParlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spillikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.\n\nWhat instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?\n\nIn disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred Scripture).\n\nWhat compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?\n\nThe false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.\n\nHow had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?\n\nVariously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's ignorant lapse.\n\nWith what success had he attempted direct instruction?\n\nShe followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest, comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.\n\nWhat system had proved more effective?\n\nIndirect suggestion implicating self-interest.\n\nExample?\n\nShe disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.\n\nAccepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?\n\nThree seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of More Neubkim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).\n\nWhat statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?\n\nThat the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.\n\nWere other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?\n\nFelix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).\n\nWhat fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?\n\nBy Stephen: suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus, suil go cuin (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).\n\nBy Bloom: Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).\n\nHow was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?\n\nOn the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entitled Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted goph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1,4 and 100.\n\nWas the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?\n\nTheoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.\n\nWhat points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?\n\nThe presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara) Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and Jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanan David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.\n\nWhat anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreductible consummation?\n\nKolod balejwaw pnimali\nNefesch, jehudi, homijah.\n\nWhy was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?\n\nIn consequence of defective mnemotechnic.\n\nHow did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? By a periphrastic version of the general text.\n\nIn what common study did their mutual reflections merge?\n\nThe increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).\n\nDid the guest comply with his host's request?\n\nDoubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.\n\nWhat was Stephen's auditive sensation?\n\nHe heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.\n\nWhat was Bloom's visual sensation?\n\nHe saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.\n\nWhat were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?\n\nVisually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.\n\nAuditively, Bloom's: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.\n\nWhat future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?\n\nIn the church, Roman, Anglican, or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.J., the reverend T. Salmon, D.D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.C., Rufus Isaacs, K.C. On the stage, modern or Shakespearean exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle (1901), exponent of Shakespeare.\n\nDid the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?\n\nReassuringly, their place where none could hear them talk being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.\n\nRecite the first (major) part of this chanted legend?\n\nD Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball\nAnd the very first ball little Harry Hughes played\nHe drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.\nAnd the very second ball little Harry Hughes played\nHe broke the jew's windows all.\n\nHow did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?\n\nWith unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.\n\nRecite the second part (minor) of the legend.\n\nThen out there came the jew's daughter\nAnd she all dressed in green.\n`Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,\nAnd play your ball again.'\n\n`I can't come back and I won't come back\nWithout my schoolfellows all,\nFor if my master he did hear\nHe'd make it a sorry ball.'\n\nShe took him by the lilywhite hand\nAnd led him along the hall\nUntil she led him to a room\nWhere none could hear him call.\n\nShe took a penknife out of her pocket\nAnd cut off his little head,\nAnd now he'll play his ball no more\nFor he lies among the dead.\n\nHow did the father of Millicent receive this second part?\n\nWith mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's daughter, all dressed in green.\n\nCondense Stephen's commentary.\nOne of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.\n\nWhy was the host (victim predestined) sad?\n\nHe wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.\n\nWhy was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?\n\nIn accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.\n\nWhy was the host (secret infidel) silent?\n\nHe weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.\n\nFrom which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?\n\nFrom hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated in night attire had lain, sleeping.\n\nHad this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?\n\nTwice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.\n\nWhat other infantile memories had he of her?\n\n15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.\n\nWhat endemic characteristics were present?\n\nConversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals.\n\nWhat memories had he of her adolescence?\n\nShe relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).\n\nDid that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?\n\nLess than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.\n\nWhat second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently?\n\nA temporary departure of his cat.\n\nWhy similarly, why differently?\n\nSimilarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.\n\nIn other respects were their differences similar?\n\nIn passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.\n\nAs?\n\nInasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat). Hence in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.\n\nIn what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?\n\nAs object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of movable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour, when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, videlicet, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.\n\nIn what manners did she reciprocate?\n\nShe remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.\n\nWhat proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?\n\nTo pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.\n\nWhat various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such extemporisation?\n\nFor the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.\n\nWhy might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter?\n\nBecause the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.\n\nTo what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?\n\nIf he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.\n\nWhat inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?\n\nA statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus, born Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).\n\nWas the proposal of asylum accepted?\n\nPromptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.\n\nWhat exchange of money took place between host and guest?\n\nThe former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (\u01531.7s.0.), one pound seven shillings, advanced by the latter to the former.\n\nWhat counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?\n\nTo inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places).\n\nWhat rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?\n\nThe irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2s.) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.\n\nWas the clown Bloom's son?\n\nNo.\n\nHad Bloom's coin returned?\n\nNever.\n\nWhy would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?\n\nBecause at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.\n\nHe believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?\n\nThere remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay.\n\nWhy did he desist from speculation?\n\nBecause it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.\n\nDid Stephen participate in his dejection?\n\nHe affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro- and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.\n\nWas this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?\n\nNot verbally. Substantially.\n\nWhat comforted his misapprehension?\n\nThat as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.\n\nI n what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?\n\nLighted Candle in Stick borne by\nBLOOM.\nDiaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by\nSTEPHEN.\n\nWith what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?\n\nThe 113th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Isra\u00ebl de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro.\n\nWhat did each do at the door of egress?\n\nBloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.\n\nFor what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?\n\nFor a cat.\n\nWhat spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?\n\nThe heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.\n\nWith what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?\n\nMeditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipent lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Major) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.\n\nWere there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?\n\nOf the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.\n\nWhy did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?\n\nBecause some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.\n\nDid he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?\n\nOf a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and all that is vanity.\n\nAnd the problem of possible redemption?\nThe minor was proved by the major.\n\nWhich various features of the constellations were in turn considered?\n\nThe various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.\n\nHis (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?\n\nThat it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositions probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its future spectators had entered actual present existence.\n\nWas he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?\n\nIndubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.\n\nDid he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?\n\nIt seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.\n\nWhat special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?\n\nHer antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.\n\nWhat visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's gaze?\n\nIn the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.\n\nHow did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?\n\nWith indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.\n\nBoth then were silent?\n\nSilent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.\n\nWere they indefinitely inactive?\n\nAt Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.\n\nSimilarly?\n\nThe trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.\n\nWhat different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?\n\nTo Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.\n\nWhat celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?\n\nA star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.\n\nHow did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?\n\nBy inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.\n\nHow did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?\n\nStanding perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.\n\nWhat sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?\n\nThe sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.\n\nWhat echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?\n\nBy Stephen:\n\nLiliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.\nIubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.\n\nBy Bloom:\n\nHeigho, heigho,\nHeigho, heigho.\n\nWhere were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?\n\nMartin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).\n\nAlone, what did Bloom hear?\n\nThe double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.\n\nAlone, what did Bloom feel?\n\nThe cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or R\u00e9aumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.\n\nOf what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?\n\nOf companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordi? hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).\n\nWhat prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?\n\nThe disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of day-break, the apparition of a new solar disk.\n\nHad he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?\n\nOnce, in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.\n\nHe remembered the initial paraphenomena?\n\nMore active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.\n\nDid he remain?\n\nWith deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.\n\nWhat suddenly arrested his ingress?\n\nThe right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.\n\nDescribe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furnitures?\n\nA sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.\n\nDescribe them.\n\nOne: a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.\n\nWhat significances attached to these two chairs?\n\nSignificances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.\n\nWhat occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?\n\nA vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of Love's Old Sweet Song (words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained, pedal, ritirando, close.\n\nWith what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?\n\nWith strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focusing his gaze on a large dull passive and slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.\n\nHis next proceeding?\n\nFrom an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.\n\nWhat followed this operation?\n\nThat truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.\n\nWhat homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?\n\nA timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.\n\nWhat interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?\n\nIn the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.\n\nWhat composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?\n\nThe image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.\n\nWhy solitary (ipsorelative)?\n\nBrothers and sisters had he none,\nYet that man's father was his grandfather's son.\n\nWhy mutable (aliorelative)?\n\nFrom infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal creator.\n\nWhat final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?\n\nThe optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.\n\nCatalogue these books.\n\nThorn's Dublin Post Office Directory, 1886.\n\nDenis Florence M'Carthy's Poetical Works (copper beechleaf bookmark at p. 5).\n\nShakespeare's Works (dark crimson morocco, goldtooled).\n\nThe Useful Ready Reckoner (brown cloth).\n\nThe Secret History of the Court of Charles II (red cloth, tooled binding).\n\nThe Child's Guide (blue cloth).\n\nWhen We Were Boys by William O'Brien M.P.

A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.\n\nWhat caused him irritation in his sitting posture?\n\nInhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.\n\nHow was the irritation allayed?\n\nHe removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hair extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebr?, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.\n\nWhat involuntary actions followed?\n\nHe compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.\n\nCompile the budget for 16 June 1904.\n\n#. s. d. #. s. d.\n\n1 Pork kidney 0. 0. 3 Cash in hand 0.4.9\n\n2 Copy Freeman's Journal 0.0.2 Commission recd.

continue?\n\nSensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguinal fragment.\n\nWhy with satisfaction?\n\nBecause the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other unguinal fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.\n\nIn what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions now coalesced?\n\nNot to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English, or possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number of acres, roods and perches, statute land measure (valuation #42), of grazing turbary surrounding a baronial hall with gatelodge and carriage drive nor, on

above and through a quickset hornbeam hedge of topiary cutting, situate at a given point not less than 1 statute mile from the periphery of the metropolis, within a time limit of not more than 5

vintages) for distinguished guests, if entertained to dinner (evening dress), carbon monoxide gas supply throughout.\n\nWhat additional attractions might the grounds contain?\n\nAs addenda, a tennis

rectangular grassplots set with eccentric ellipses of scarlet and chrome tulips, blue scillas, crocuses, polyanthus, sweet William, sweat pea, lily of the valley (bulbs obtainable from sir James W. Mackey (Limited) (wholesale and retail) seed and bulb merchant and nurseryman, agent for chemical manures, 23 Sackville street, upper), an orchard, kitchen garden and vinery, protected against illegal trespassers by glasstopped mural enclosures, a lumbershed with padlock for various inventoried implements.\n\nAs?\n\nEeltraps, lobsterpots, fishingrods, hatchet, steelyard, grindstone, clodcrusher, swatheturner, carriagesack, telescope ladder, 10 tooth rake, washing clogs, haytedder, tumbling rake, billhook, paintpot, brush, hoe and so on.\n\nWhat improvements might be subsequently introduced?\n\nA rabbitry and fowlrun, a dovecote, a botanical conservatory, 2 hammocks (lady's and gentleman's), a sundial shaded and sheltered by laburnum or lilac trees, an exotically harmonically accorded Japanese tinkle gatebell affixed to left lateral gatepost, a capacious waterbutt, a lawnmower with side delivery and grassbox, a lawnsprinkler with hydraulic hose.\n\nWhat facilities of transit were desirable?\n\nWhen citybound frequent connection by train or tram from their respective intermediate station or terminal. When countrybound velocipedes, a chainless freewheel roadster cycle with side basketcar attached, or draught conveyance, a donkey with wicker trap or smart phaeton with good working solidungular cob (roan gelding, 14h).\n\nWhat might be the name of this erigible or erected residence?\n\nBloom Cottage. Saint Leopold's. Flowerville.\n\nCould Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?\n\nIn loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving longevity.\n\nWhat syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible?\n\nSnapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the celestial constellations.\n\nWhat lighter recreations?\n\nOutdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways, ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation), vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with inspection of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers' fires of smoking peat turves (period of hibernation). Indoor discussion in tepid security of unsolved historical and criminal problems: lecture of unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house carpentry with toolbox containing hammer, awl, nails, screws, tintacks, gimlet, tweezers, bullnose plane and turnscrew.\n\nMight he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock?\n\nNot impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper etc.\n\nWhat would be his civic functions and social status among the county families and landed gentry?\n\nArranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that of gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto (Semper paratus), duly recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C., K. P., L. L. D. honoris cause, Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left Kingstown for England).\n\nWhat course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?\n\nA course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.\n\nProve that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.\n\nTo master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf Virag, later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in The Descent of Man and The Origin of Species. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O'Brien and others, the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of Charles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for Midlothian, N. B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000, divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2,000 torches in escort of the marquess of Ripon and John Morley.\n\nHow much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?\n\nAs per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum of #60 per annum, being 116th of an assured income, derived from giltedged securities, representing at 5% simple interest on capital of #1,200 (estimate of price at 20 years purchase) of which 1/3rd to be paid on acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. #800 plus 2 1/2% interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal annual instalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for purchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of #64, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession of the lender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale, foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the absolute property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of years stipulated.\n\nWhat rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate purchase?\n\nA private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of 1 or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr. 8 m. p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time) the message being received and available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink time). The unexpected discovery of an object of great monetary value: precious stone, valuable adhesive or impressed postage stamps (7-shilling, mauve, imperforate, Hamburg, 1866: 4 pence, rose, blue paper perforate, Great Britain, 1866: 1 franc, stone, official, rouletted, diagonal surcharge, Luxembourg, 1878): antique dynastical ring, unique relic in unusual repositories or by unusual means: from the air (dropped by an eagle in flight), by fire (amid the carbonised remains of an incendiated edifice), in the sea (amid flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict), on earth (in the gizzard of a comestible fowl). A Spanish prisoner's donation of a distant treasure of valuables or specie or bullion lodged with a solvent banking corporation 100 years previously at 5% compound interest of the collective worth of #5,000,000 stg (five million pounds sterling). A contract with an inconsiderate contractee for the delivery of 32 consignments of some given commodity in consideration of cash payment on delivery at the initial rate of 1/4d. to be increased constantly in the geometrical progression of 2 (1/4d., 1/2d., 1d., 2d., 4d., 8d., 1s. 4d., 2s. 8d. to 32 terms). A prepared scheme based on a study of the laws of probability to break the bank at Monte Carlo. A solution of the secular problem of the quadrature of the circle, government premium #1,000,000 sterling.\n\nWas vast wealth acquirable through industrial channels?\n\nThe reclamation of dunams of waste arenary soil, proposed in the prospectus of Agendath Netaim, Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W.15 by the cultivation of orange plantations and melonfields and reafforestation. The utilisation of waste paper, fells of sewer rodents, human excrement possessing chemical properties, in view of the vast production of the first, vast number of the second and immense quantity of the third, every normal human being of average vitality and appetite producing annually, cancelling byproducts of water, a sum total of 80 lbs. (mixed animal and vegetable diet), to be multiplied by 4,386,035 the total population of Ireland according to the census returns of 1901.\n\nWere there schemes of wider scope?\n\nA scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour commissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power), obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at head of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main streams for the economic production of 500,000 W. H. P. of electricity. A scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the North Bull at Dollymount and erect on the space of the foreland, used for golf links and rifle ranges, an asphalted esplanade with casinos, booths, shooting galleries, hotels, boardinghouses, readingrooms, establishments for mixed bathing. A scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the delivery of early morning milk. A scheme for the development of Irish tourist traffic in and around Dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats, plying in the fluvial fairway between island bridge and Ringsend, charabancs, narrow gauge local railways, and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation (10/- per person per day, guide (trilingual) included). A scheme for the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over Irish waterways, when freed from weedbeds. A scheme to connect by tramline the Cattle Market (North Circular road and Prussia street) with the quays (Sheriff street, lower, and East Wall), parallel with the Link line railway laid (in conjunction with the Great Southern and Western railway line) between the cattle park, Liffey junction, and terminus of Midland Great Western railway 43 to 45 North Wall, in proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of Great Central Railway, Midland Railway of England, City of Dublin Steam Packet Company, Lancashire Yorkshire Railway Company, Dublin and Glasgow Steam Packet Company, Glasgow Dublin and Londonderry Steam Packet Company (Laird line), British and Irish Steam Packet Company, Dublin and Morecambe Steamers, London and North Western Railway Company, Dublin Port and Docks Board Landing Sheds and transit sheds of Palgrave, Murphy and Company, steamship owners, agents for steamers from Mediterranean, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Holland and for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the Dublin United Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers' fees.\n\nPositing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes become a natural and necessary apodosis?\n\nGiven a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of gift and transfer vouchers during donor's lifetime or by bequest after donor's painless extinction, of eminent financiery (Blum Pasha, Rothschild, Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller) possessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.\n\nWhat eventually would render him independent of such wealth?\n\nThe independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.\n\nFor what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?\n\nIt was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality.\n\nHis justifications?\n\nAs a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at least 2/7ths, viz., 20 years passed in sleep. As a philosopher he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any person's desires has been realised. As a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.\n\nWhat did he fear?\n\nThe committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions.\n\nWhat were habitually his final meditations?\n\nOf some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded, reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life.\n\nWhat did the first drawer unlocked contain?\n\nA Vere Foster's handwriting copybook, property of Milly (Millicent) Bloom, certain pages of which bore diagram drawings marked Papli, which showed a large globular head with 5 hairs erect, 2 eyes in profile, the trunk full front with 3 large buttons, 1 triangular foot: 2 fading photographs of queen Alexandra of England and of Maud Branscombe, actress and professional beauty: a Yuletide card, bearing on it a pictorial representation of a parasitic plant, the legend Mizpah, the date Xmas 1892, the name of the senders, from Mr and Mrs M.

Gott... dein...\n\nWhat reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?\n\nAn old man widower, unkempt hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian suicide by poison.\n\nWhy did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?\n\nBecause in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.\n\nAs?\n\nThe prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal, the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaron: the sanctity of the sabbath.\n\nHow did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?\n\nNot more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.\n\nWhat first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?\n\nRudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely, with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresa, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves). Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.\n\nHad time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?\n\nIn narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.\n\nWhat idiosyncrasies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?\n\nOccasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.\n\nWhat two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?\n\nThe myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.\n\nWhat object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?\n\nThe endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.\n\nReduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.\n\nSuccessively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s. 4d. in the #, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff's man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man's House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson's Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.\n\nWith which attendant indignities?\n\nThe unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing or less than nothing.\n\nBy what could such a situation be precluded?\n\nBy decease (change of state), by departure (change of place).\n\nWhich preferably?\n\nThe latter, by the line of least resistance.\n\nWhat considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?\n\nConstant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.\n\nWhat considerations rendered it not irrational?\n\nThe parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if now disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.\n\nWhat considerations rendered it desirable?\n\nThe attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures.\n\nIn Ireland?\n\nThe cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.\n\nAbroad?\n\nCeylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues, nude Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where O'Hara of the camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.\n\nUnder what guidance, following what signs?\n\nAt sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Major produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa Major. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.\n\nWhat public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?\n\n#5 reward lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery.\n\nWhat universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and nonentity?\n\nAssumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.\n\nWhat tributes his?\n\nHonour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.\n\nWould the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?\n\nEver he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or of the silver King.\n\nWhat would render such return irrational?\n\nAn unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time.\n\nWhat play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?\n\nThe lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.\n\nWhat advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?\n\nThe removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).\n\nWhat past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?\n\nThe preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and Thummin): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchizedek): the visit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford row, Merchants' Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan's premises (holocaust): a blank period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman's shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).\n\nWhat selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?\n\nThe cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.\n\nWhat selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?\n\nWho was M'Intosh?\n\nWhat selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?\n\nWhere was Moses when the candle went out?\n\nWhat imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, silently, successively, enumerate?\n\nA provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement, to obtain a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 5 Dame street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C.), to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic female divinities, to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandman Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49, South King street.\n\nWhat impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?\n\nThe face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.\n\nWhat recurrent impressions of the same were possible by the hypothesis?\n\nRetreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.\n\nWhat miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived by him?\n\nA pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of baptiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).\n\nWhat impersonal objects were perceived?\n\nA commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat. Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor, and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).\n\nBloom's acts?\n\nHe deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.\n\nHow?\n\nWith circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adder: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.\n\nWhat did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?\n\nNew clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.\n\nIf he had smiled why would he have smiled?\n\nTo reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone, whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating In and repeated to infinity.\n\nWhat preceding series?\n\nAssuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show, Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to nolast term.\n\nWhat were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?\n\nReflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).\n\nWhy for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?\n\nBecause he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.\n\nWith what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?\n\nEnvy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.\n\nEnvy?\n\nOf a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.\n\nJealousy?\n\nBecause a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because action between agents and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.\n\nAbnegation?\n\nIn virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.\n\nEquanimity?\n\nAs natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.\n\nWhy more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?\n\nFrom outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.\n\nWhat retribution, if any?\n\nAssassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witness), not yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting separator from both.\n\nBy what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?\n\nThe preordained frangibility of the hymen, the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the self abbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female, the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.\n\nIn what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?\n\nSatisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise) of adipose posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.\n\nThe visible signs of antesatisfaction?\n\nAn approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation; a silent contemplation.\n\nThen?\n\nHe kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.\n\nThe visible signs of postsatisfaction?\n\nA silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.\n\nWhat followed this silent action?\n\nSomnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.\n\nWith what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?\n\nNegative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandman Palmer of Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36, and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entitled Sweets of Sin, anonymous, author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.\n\nWas the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nWhich event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?\n\nStephen Dedalus, professor and author.\n\nWhat limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?\n\nBy the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8 September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.\n\nHow?\n\nBy various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.\n\nWhat moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible thoughts?\n\nThe upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.\n\nIn what directions did listener and narrator lie?\n\nListener, S. E. by E.; Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of latitude, N. and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45\u00f8 to the terrestrial equator.\n\nIn what state of rest or motion?\n\nAt rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space.\n\nIn what posture?\n\nListener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the indexfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted on a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.\n\nWomb? Weary?\n\nHe rests. He has travelled.\n\nWith?\n\nSinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and Binbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and Hinbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and Vinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.\n\nWhen?\n\nGoing to a dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc's auk's egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad the Brightdayler.\n\nWhere?2Embed"}]
