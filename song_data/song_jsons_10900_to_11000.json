Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI wanna tell you all a story\nAbout a Harper Valley widowed wife\nWho had a teenage daughter\nWho attended Harper Valley Junior High\nWell, her daughter came home one afternoon\nAnd didn't even stop to play\nAnd she said, \"Mom, I got a note here\nFrom the Harper Valley PTA\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell the note said, \"Mrs. Johnson\nYou're wearin' your dresses way too high\nIt's reported you've been drinking\nAnd a-running round with men and goin' wild\nAnd we don't believe you oughta be\nA-bringin' up your little girl this way\"\nAnd it was signed by the Secretary\nHarper Valley PTA\n[Verse 3]\nWell, it happened that the PTA\nWas gonna meet that very afternoon\nAnd they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson\nWore her miniskirt into the room\nAnd as she walked up to the blackboard\nI can still recall the words she had to say\nShe said, \"I'd like to address this meeting\nOf the Harper Valley PTA\"\n\n[Verse 4]\n\"Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there\nAnd seven times he asked me for a date\nAnd Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lotta ice\nWhenever he's away\nAnd Mr. Baker can you tell us why\nYour secretary had to leave this town?\nAnd shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep\nHer window shades all pulled completely down?\"\n\n[Verse 5]\n\"Well, Mr Harper couldn't be here\n'Cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar again\nAnd if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath\nYou'll find she's had a little nip of gin\nAnd then you have the nerve to tell me\nYou think that as a mother I'm not fit\nWell this is just a little Peyton Place\nAnd you're all Harper Valley hypocrites\"\nYou might also like[Outro]\nNo, I wouldn't put you on because it really did\nIt happened just this way\nThe day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley PTA\nThe day my mama socked it to

in the dance\nBetween the parted pages and were pressed\nIn love's hot, fevered iron\nLike a striped pair of pants\n\n[Chorus]\nMacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\nAll the sweet green icing flowing down\nSomeone left the cake out in the rain\nI don't think that I can take it\n'Cause it took so long to bake it\nAnd I'll never have that recipe again, oh no\n[Verse 2]\nI recall the yellow cotton dress\nFoaming like a wave\nOn the ground around your knees\nThe birds like tender babies in your hands\nAnd the old men playing checkers\nBy the trees\n\n[Chorus]\nMacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\nAll the sweet green icing flowing down\nSomeone left the cake out in the rain\nI don't think that I can take it\n'Cause it took so long to bake it\nAnd I'll never have that recipe again, oh no\n\n[Bridge 1]\nThere will be another song for me\nFor I will sing it\nThere will be another dream for me\nSomeone will bring it\nI will drink the wine while it is warm\nAnd never let you catch me\nLooking at the sun\nAnd after all the loves of my life\nAfter all the loves of my life\nYou'll still be the one\nYou might also like[Bridge 2]\nI will take my life into my hands\nAnd I will use it\nI will win the worship in their eyes\nAnd I will lose it\nI will have the things that I desire\nAnd my passion flow\nLike rivers through the sky\nAnd after all the loves of my life\nOh, after all the loves in my life\nI'll be thinking of you\nAnd wondering why\n\n[Chorus]\nMacArthur's Park is melting in the dark\nAll the sweet green icing flowing down\nSomeone left the cake out in the rain\nI don't think that I can take it\n'Cause it took so long to bake it\nAnd I'll never have that recipe again\n(Oh no, oh no)2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 14, "api_path": "/songs/79642",

Monks, At Their Nocturnal Interview\n\nIt was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. The clouds, which had been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river.\n\nThey were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might, perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain, and sheltering them from observation. The husband carried a lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in front, as though\u2014the way being dirty\u2014to give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints. They went on, in profound silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of destination.\n\nThis was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime. It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part, within a few feet of the river's bank. A few leaky boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it: and here and there an oar or coil of rope: appeared, at first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed.\n\nIn the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a manufactory of some kind. It had, in its day, probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements. But it had long since gone to ruin. The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving itself in the same fate.\n\nIt was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain commenced pouring violently down.\n'The place should be somewhere here,' said Bumble, consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand.\n\n'Halloa there!' cried a voice from above.\n\nFollowing the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.\n\n'Stand still, a minute,' cried the voice; 'I'll be with you directly.' With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.\n\n'Is that the man?' asked Mr. Bumble's good lady.\n\nMr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.\n\n'Then, mind what I told you,' said the matron: 'and be careful to say as little as you can, or you'll betray us at once.'\n\nMr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.\n\n'Come in!' he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground. 'Don't keep me here!'\n\nThe woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other invitation. Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed: obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.\n\n'What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?' said Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the door behind them.\n\n'We\u2014we were only cooling ourselves,' stammered Bumble, looking apprehensively about him.\n\n'Cooling yourselves!' retorted Monks. 'Not all the rain that ever fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell's fire out, as a man can carry about with him. You won't cool yourself so easily; don't think it!'\nWith this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.\n\n'This is the woman, is it?' demanded Monks.\n\n'Hem! That is the woman,' replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife's caution.\n\n'You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?' said the matron, interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.\n\n'I know they will always keep one till it's found out,' said Monks.\n\n'And what may that be?' asked the matron.\n\n'The loss of their own good name,' replied Monks. 'So, by the same rule, if a woman's a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I'm not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you understand, mistress?'\n\n'No,' rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.\n\n'Of course you don't!' said Monks. 'How should you?'\n\nBestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the roof. He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder, leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed, which shook the crazy building to its centre.\n\n'Hear it!' he cried, shrinking back. 'Hear it! Rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it. I hate the sound!'\n\nHe remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr. Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.\n\n'These fits come over me, now and then,' said Monks, observing his alarm; 'and thunder sometimes brings them on. Don't mind me now; it's all over for this once.'\nThus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it.\n\n'Now,' said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, 'the sooner we come to our business, the better for all. The woman know what it is, does she?'\n\nThe question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.\n\n'He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and that she told you something\u2014'\n\n'About the mother of the boy you named,' replied the matron interrupting him. 'Yes.'\n\n'The first question is, of what nature was her communication?' said Monks.\n\n'That's the second,' observed the woman with much deliberation. 'The first is, what may the communication be worth?'\n\n'Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?' asked Monks.\n\n'Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,' answered Mrs. Bumble: who did not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.\n\n'Humph!' said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry; 'there may be money's worth to get, eh?'\n\n'Perhaps there may,' was the composed reply.\n\n'Something that was taken from her,' said Monks. 'Something that she wore. Something that\u2014'\n\n'You had better bid,' interrupted Mrs. Bumble. 'I have heard enough, already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.'\n\nMr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded, what sum was required for the disclosure.\n\n'What's it worth to you?' asked the woman, as collectedly as before.\n\n'It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,' replied Monks. 'Speak out, and let me know which.'\n\n'Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty pounds in gold,' said the woman; 'and I'll tell you all I know. Not before.'\n\n'Five-and-twenty pounds!' exclaimed Monks, drawing back.\n\n'I spoke as plainly as I could,' replied Mrs. Bumble. 'It's not a large sum, either.'\n\n'Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it's told!' cried Monks impatiently; 'and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more!'\n\n'Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in course of time,' answered the matron, still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed. 'As to lying dead, there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!'\n\n'What if I pay it for nothing?' asked Monks, hesitating.\n\n'You can easily take it away again,' replied the matron. 'I am but a woman; alone here; and unprotected.'\n\n'Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,' submitted Mr. Bumble, in a voice tremulous with fear: 'I am here, my dear. And besides,' said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, 'Mr. Monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons. Mr. Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a little run to seed, as I may say; bu he has heerd: I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon strength, if I'm once roused. I only want a little rousing; that's all.'\n\nAs Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression of every feature, that he did want a little rousing, and not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose.\n\n'You are a fool,' said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; 'and had better hold your tongue.'\n\n'He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can't speak in a lower tone,' said Monks, grimly. 'So! He's your husband, eh?'\n\n'He my husband!' tittered the matron, parrying the question.\n\n'I thought as much, when you came in,' rejoined Monks, marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke. 'So much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find that there's only one will between them. I'm in earnest. See here!'\n\nHe thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the woman.\n\n'Now,' he said, 'gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder, which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let's hear your story.'\n\nThe thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say. The faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible. The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the extreme.\n\n'When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,' the matron began, 'she and I were alone.'\n\n'Was there no one by?' asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; 'No sick wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and might, by possibility, understand?'\n\n'Not a soul,' replied the woman; 'we were alone. I stood alone beside the body when death came over it.'\n\n'Good,' said Monks, regarding her attentively. 'Go on.'\n\n'She spoke of a young creature,' resumed the matron, 'who had brought a child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.'\n\n'Ay?' said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder, 'Blood! How things come about!'\n\n'The child was the one you named to him last night,' said the matron, nodding carelessly towards her husband; 'the mother this nurse had robbed.'\n\n'In life?' asked Monks.\n\n'In death,' replied the woman, with something like a shudder. 'She stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant's sake.'\n\n'She sold it,' cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; 'did she sell it? Where? When? To whom? How long before?'\n\n'As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,' said the matron, 'she fell back and died.'\n\n'Without saying more?' cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very suppression, seemed only the more furious. 'It's a lie! I'll not be played with. She said more. I'll tear the life out of you both, but I'll know what it was.'\n\n'She didn't utter another word,' said the woman, to all appearance unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man's violence; 'but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.'\n\n'Which contained\u2014' interposed Monks, stretching forward.\n\n'Nothing,' replied the woman; 'it was a pawnbroker's duplicate.'\n\n'For what?' demanded Monks.\n\n'In good time I'll tell you.' said the woman. 'I judge that she had kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbroker's interest year by year, and prevent its running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed. Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand. The time was out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.'\n\n'Where is it now?' asked Monks quickly.\n\n'There,' replied the woman. And, as if glad to be relieved of it, she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands. It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring.\n\n'It has the word \"Agnes\" engraved on the inside,' said the woman.\n\n'There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.'\n\n'And this is all?' said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet.\n\n'All,' replied the woman.\n\nMr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous dialogue.\n\n'I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,' said his wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; 'and I want to know nothing; for it's safer not. But I may ask you two questions, may I?'\n\n'You may ask,' said Monks, with some show of surprise; 'but whether I answer or not is another question.'\n\n'\u2014Which makes three,' observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of facetiousness.\n\n'Is that what you expected to get from me?' demanded the matron.\n\n'It is,' replied Monks. 'The other question?'\n\n'What do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?'\n\n'Never,' rejoined Monks; 'nor against me either. See here! But don't move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.'\n\nWith these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened close at Mr. Bumble's feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward, with great precipitation.\n\n'Look down,' said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. 'Don't fear me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over it, if that had been my game.'\n\nThus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles. There had once been a water-mill beneath; the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course.\n\n'If you flung a man's body down there, where would it be to-morrow morning?' said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.\n\n'Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,' replied Bumble, recoiling at the thought.\n\nMonks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible splash; and was gone.\n\nThe three looking into each other's faces, seemed to breathe more freely.\n\n'There!' said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back into its former position. 'If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it. We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.'\n\n'By all means,' observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.\n\n'You'll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?' said Monks, with a threatening look. 'I am not afraid of your wife.'\n\n'You may depend upon me, young man,' answered Mr. Bumble, bowing himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. 'On everybody's account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.'\n\n'I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,' remarked Monks. 'Light your lantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.'\n\nIt was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr. Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below. He lighted his lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in silence, followed by his wife. Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water.\n\nThey traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure: looking nervously about him for hidden trap-doors. The gate at which they had entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside.\n\nThey were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he returned to the chamber he had just quitted.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/865113", "artist_names": "Blue Cheer",

both will be old\nWe won't even notice the world turning cold\nAnd so, in this moment with sunlight above\nMy cup runneth over with love\n\n[Outro]\nMy cup runneth over with love\nWith loveYou might

you\nYou said you would always stay\nIt wasn't me who changed but you\nAnd now you've gone away\nDon't you see that now you've gone\nAnd I'm left here on my own\nThat I have to follow you\nAnd beg you to come home?\n\n[Chorus]\nYou don't have to say you love me\nJust be close at hand\nYou don't have to stay forever\nI will understand\nBelieve me, believe me\nI can't help but love you\nBut believe me\nI'll never tie you down\n[Verse 2]\nLeft alone with just a memory\nLife seems dead and so unreal\nAll that's left is loneliness\nThere's nothing left to feel\n\n[Chorus]\nYou don't have to say you love me\nJust be close at hand\nYou don't have to stay forever\nI will understand\nBelieve me, believe me\nYou don't have to say you love me\nJust be close at hand\nYou don't have to stay forever\nI will understand\n\n[Outro]\nBelieve me, believe me, believe meYou might also like2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4235490", "artist_names": "Pitchfork",

Era LyricsIn the 1960\u2019s, politics and music had a close relationship. Events like the Vietnam War and student protests coincided with a larger and more popular movement of political protest music. While it can be argued that protest music was caused by political events and ideas, it is equally valid to argue that protest music was a significant part of the culture that led to many of the political events seen in the 1960\u2019s. For this reason, it is impossible to conclude that one concretely caused the other. In addition, all protest songs can be used to argue either theory of causality. Because protest music and politics were so deeply intertwined during this time period, neither fully caused the other. However, both helped to influence the society that in turn resulted in political events and protest music.\n\nFor protest music to cause political events, or vice versa, the two must first be related. In society, politics and music have been related most fundamentally by songs that discuss politics, or political ideals. While this has existed in society since long before the Vietnam War, the 1960\u2019s was the first era when politically focused music expanded beyond a niche audience and had widespread popularity. In addition, during the 1960\u2019s protest musicians had a close relationship with the protest movement as a whole, which allowed them to reach a broader audience and have a greater effect.\n\nThe relationship between music and politics is most evidenced by the existence of songs dealing with political topics. Before the Vietnam War, this was most common is songs discussing unions and the labor movement. \u201cIs there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite, / who would lash us into serfdom and would crush us with his might? / Is there anything left to us but to organize and fight? / For the union makes us strong.\u201d This example comes from the song, \u201cSolidarity Forever,\u201d written in 1919, and performed by Pete Seeger in 1949. The song gives a direct political commentary on employers and unions, one that is not subtle or hidden. The song argues that unions must be formed to combat the greed of employers, a belief in line with the labor movements of the time. This shows that there had been a tradition of protest songs before the Vietnam War. Another protest song, from 1963, protests racism and societal injustice. \u201c[To show] that even a noble is properly handled. / And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom / stared at the person who killed for no reason\u2026 and handed out for penalty and repentance / William Zanzinger with a six month sentence.\u201d This song protests racism within the justice system by telling the story of a black woman killed by a white man who later receives only a six-month sentence for the murder. This song was released in 1963 and provides an example of a song from the mid-sixties using a specific event to protest a social problem, racism, and argue for reform. Both examples show how political beliefs were incorporated into music. Despite the popularity they gained during the 1960\u2019s, political and protest songs were not new occurrences.\n\nIn the 1960\u2019s, protest songs were more popular than the protest songs of previous decades. While political music existed before the 1960\u2019s, these protest songs often appealed to only small groups within society. For this reason, much of this protest music, especially that regarding the labor movement, did not reach the widespread popularity that protest songs enjoyed during the sixties. The example by Pete Seeger (shown above) was indicative of most political songs from the labor movement, in that it was designed to be a call to arms for union members, to be used during strikes and rallies. As a result, it had little appeal in other settings, or for nonunion members. This had the effect of limiting the applicability of the song, and decreasing its widespread popularity.\n\n\u00a0The limited popularity of protest music was reversed during the 1960\u2019s. This reversal was a result both of political events such as the Vietnam War and the draft, that were important to the entire nation (a contrast to the labor movement, which was only really important to industrial workers and factory owners), and of the modern system of music distribution. The Vietnam War gave protest music a greater importance to listeners, even if the songs did not explicitly discuss the war. In addition, music in the 1960\u2019s had a much more efficient distribution system than was previously available. Radio distributed songs throughout the entire country, and cheap vinyl records allowed listeners access to a greater variety of music. In addition, music charts, like the Billboard Top 100, and later the American Top 40, consolidated the songs played across the country into a single mainstream music culture. This allowed songs to be easily distributed across the entire country, giving them a huge audience and widespread radio play.\n\nThese factors let protest songs enter the primarily pop music charts and spread political commentaries and ideas. For example, in 1965, Barry McGuire\u2019s song \u201cEve of Destruction\u201d reached number one in the US Hot 100 music chart. This song gave a description of war and chaos in the atomic age, stating that modern society has not yet realized it is on the \u201ceve of destruction.\u201d Similarly, SSgt Barry Sadler\u2019s \u201cBallad of the Green Berets\u201d reached number one on the same chart, and remained there for six weeks. This song was a reaction to protest of the Vietnam War, and patriotically described the Green Berets with the intention of raising patriotic sentiment to support the war. While this does not prove that political protest songs were listened to and appreciated for their political meanings, this does show that songs with very political messages, both for and against the Vietnam War, had very wide radio play. This means that they would have been played across the country, and liked, at least musically, by many. Ultimately, this means that a very large number of people would have heard these songs and at least been exposed to their political messages.\nIn addition to its popularity, protest music had a very close relationship to the overall protest movement, especially those protesting the war and the draft, furthering the ties between politics and music. Evidence of this was shown in the construction of large music festivals. Woodstock and music festivals like it featured artists like Country Joe and the Fish, whose song \u201cI-Feel-Like-I\u2019m-Fixin\u2019-To-Die Rag\u201d directly protested the Vietnam War and the draft, and Jefferson Airplane, whose \u201cVolunteers\u201d advocated for a complete overthrow of the current social order. For a listener to pay to see a music festival, they would most likely be familiar with the music of the bands playing, would like the music, and would most likely agree with the ideas expressed in the music. In addition, many of the people attending these concerts were themselves student protesters. These music festivals were filled with the same young people who led student protests at universities, and featured the same artists that led the creation of protest music.\n\nThis support sometimes went beyond just having the same political views. For example, at the Monterey International Pop Festival, a 1967 music festival in California, \u201cnearly all of the performers would play for free, with the proceeds slated to go to youth-friendly causes.\u201d In this case the artists\u2019 support for the political protest movements goes beyond ideological support for the protesters, to monetarily supporting the same things. More broadly, protest musicians also wrote songs about student protests in which they firmly sided with the protesters, supporting their actions and condemning those trying to stop the protests. For example, Buffalo Springfield describes protests in their song \u201cFor What It\u2019s Worth\u201d saying, \u201cYoung people speakin\u2019 their minds\u2028/ and gettin\u2019 so much resistance from behind\u2026 Step out of line, the man come and take you away.\u201d This gives an example of a protest song that describes student protests, siding with the protesters that made up much of their musical audience.\n\nProtest music is defined as music that discusses or protests the current social and political state. During the 1960\u2019s, protest music and political music reached a wider popularity than if had enjoyed before that time. In addition, radio and vinyl allowed protest music to be distributed more widely than before. This emphasized its political effect. However, was the protest music caused by the politics of the time, or did protest music have its own effect in influencing and creating political events? This issue can be argued both ways, although the dominant theory is that the politics caused protest music, while the secondary theory argues that protest music caused political events. However, the relationship between music and politics in the Vietnam War era was so deeply intertwined that neither can be proven to have caused the other. The dominant view of the causality between protest music and politics is that protest music was caused by political events. At the base of this argument is the fact that a protest is by definition a reaction to an event. Protest music was caused by the politics because political events had to exist to be protested.\n\nFor protest music to be caused by politics, protest songs must protest against specific events and beliefs, which occurred previous to the music. This is evidenced by songs that provided commentary on specific events. For example, Bob Dylan reacted to the killing of Hattie Carroll with his song \u201cThe Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\u201d (quoted previously). In this case, the song was a direct reaction to the killing of Hattie Carroll, and her killer, who received only a six-month sentence. \u201cThe story came from a newspaper clipping Gordon Friesen gave Dylan\u2026 It was a report of the sentencing that sparked Dylan\u2019s song.\u201d Dylan wrote this song to protest not only the event, but also the larger problems of racism and corruption in the justice system. In this case, an event is used as an example of larger societal problems, but all of the things protested happened previous to the composition of the song, and were the direct causes of Dylan\u2019s writing the song. Another example of a song reacting to a specific event is The Byrd\u2019s \u201cHe Was a Friend of Mine.\u201d It commented on President Kennedy\u2019s assassination, saying \u201cHe was a friend of mine / his killing had no purpose nor reason nor rhyme\u2026 he was in Dallas town\u2026 a gunner shot him down.\u201d This song was a reaction to the death of JFK, and the slow, solemn tone of the song and its portrayal of the president as a friend make a sympathetic and mournful depiction of the president, which was in itself a political stance. In this case, the song is a direct reaction to an event, the assassination of president Kennedy, and would not have been written had the assassination not taken place.\n\nFor politics to have caused protest music, the protest music must not only protest a specific, previous event, but must also have been dependent on the existence of the political event. If the political event had not happened, then the protest song could not have been written. For example, after the Kent State Shootings, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young wrote the song \u201cOhio.\u201d It discussed the shootings, in which four students were killed by state troops in the culmination of nationwide student protests, by describing the fallout of the event from the protesters\u2019 point of view. \u201cTin soldiers and Nixon coming, \u2028/ We\u2019re finally on our own.\u2028/ This summer I hear the drumming,\u2028/ Four dead in Ohio. /\u2028Gotta get down to it\u2028/ Soldiers are cutting us down.\" The fact that state troopers had fired on protesters was profoundly shocking both to political protesters and to the creators of protest music. To them, this showed that the government was so firmly supportive of the things students were protesting that they were willing to kill to maintain the social order. This is reflected by the song, which declares that they are now \u201con their own\u201d because \u201csoldiers are cutting [them] down.\u201d Ultimately, the Kent State Shootings combined with the reelection of Richard Nixon to begin the decline of the protest movement. These events made clear that their protests would be met with armed resistance that could end in their own death. In addition, Nixon\u2019s reelection made it unlikely that the protesters would make much, if any progress politically. This shows how individual political events inspired protest songs that reacted to those specific events, and showed changes in belief that would not have occurred had the political events not happened.\n\nThe challenging view of the causality of politics and protest music is that protest music caused political events. This argues that protest music caused a shift in the political beliefs of its audience. This change in beliefs made the musical audience more opposed to later political events like the Vietnam War and the draft, which in turn led to political events like student protests and tensions over the war. This argument relies on three main points. First, that protest music voiced and argued for a change in political beliefs different from the beliefs held by the majority of society. Second, that protest music succeeded in persuading its audience of these beliefs. Third, that this change in belief led to disagreement with the political events that followed, and, that these tensions led to the political climate of the 1960\u2019s and political events like student protests.\n\nProtest music was unique among the forms of popular music of the time because its purpose was to voice political beliefs. More importantly, the political beliefs voiced by these songs were different from, and in opposition, to the primary political beliefs of the time. The political beliefs these songs protested were generally classified as those held by the older generation, most especially those of the people running the government or other societal institutions. Bob Dylan exemplifies this generational split in \u201cThe Times They Are A-Changin\u2019,\u201d saying, \u201cAnd don\u2019t criticize\u2028/ what you can\u2019t understand\u2028/ your sons and your daughters\u2028/ Are beyond your command\u2026 For the times they are a-changin.\u201d This song embodies the change in political beliefs by speaking directly to the older generation, warning that the changing times will affect everyone, from those in power to society as a whole. It also deepens the perceived difference in belief by going so far as to say that the older generation is not even capable of understanding the views of the younger generation. This song also uses an assumption that is used in most protest music- that the older generation is synonymous with those in power and with those who oppose the protests of the younger generation. This generational split was also shown by Jefferson Airplane in their \u201cVolunteers.\u201d This song is one of the most radical of those that advocate for social change, arguing for a violent overthrow of the older generation and those in power. \u201cOne generation got old / One generation got soul\u2026 Come on now we\u2019re marching to the sea / got a revolution, got to revolution / who will take it from you? / We will and who are we? / We are volunteers of America.\u201d This shows a split in political belief that is so broad as to require an overthrow of the current social order in order to promote their beliefs. This song also advocates for social change because its of connection with the beliefs set forth in Jefferson Airplane\u2019s other songs, like \u201cWhite Rabbit,\u201d which discussed drug use, and \u201cPlastic Fantastic Lover,\u201d which criticized the fake and plastic nature of society. Both of these songs exemplify the split in beliefs between those in power and those writing protest music, by arguing for a change in, or even overthrow of, those in power. This shows how protest music would have delivered a message advocating a change in political beliefs. However, this music would only have an effect on political events if the message they put forth affected the beliefs of listeners in some way.\n\nProtest music put forth views on politics and society that not only opposed the beliefs generally accepted by society, but also succeeded in persuading its audience of these beliefs. This is shown less by the songs themselves, but instead by their reception. For example, Barry McGuire\u2019s \u201cEve of Destruction\u201d (mentioned previously) protested against nuclear proliferation and the Vietnam War. \u201cYou\u2019re old enough to kill, but not for votin\u2019\u2028/ you don\u2019t believe in war, but what\u2019s that gun you\u2019re totin\u2019\u2026 you don\u2019t believe\u2028/ we\u2019re on the eve of destruction\u2026 If the button is pushed, there\u2019s no runnin\u2019 away\u2028/ There\u2019ll be no one to save, with the world in a grave.\u201d This song clearly and rather pessimistically declares that humanity is on the \u201ceve of destruction\u201d because of the threat of nuclear war. The song voices basic pacifist complaints regarding the post-atomic world, beliefs that were also shared by most members of political protest groups. This meant that the political message of the song would have been viewed favorably by its audience. In addition, in 1965 this song reached number one in the US, meaning that it would have had a very wide distribution, and a large amount of radio play, so its message would have been widely known. More importantly, the song presents the political message in a very obvious and clear way, meaning that it would have been harder to miss the meaning of the song when listening to it. This means that the song\u2019s message would have to have been favorable to many to reach that degree of popularity.\n\nAnother factor determining the effect of a protest song\u2019s political message would have been the degree to which the politics it discussed would have affected the lives of its audience members. This gave many songs discussing the war and pacifism a greater importance to their audience. As the Vietnam War progressed, more of the young people who made up the musical audience were drafted and sent to go fight. The majority of protest music argued that the war was unnecessary, and the draft unfair, a view that would have been sympathetic to most of the people being drafted. For example, Bob Dylan discusses war and those who control it in his \u201cMasters of War,\u201d saying, \u201cYou fasten the triggers\u2028/ for the others to fire\u2026 You hide in your mansion / as young people\u2019s blood\u2028/ Flows out of their bodies /\u2028And is buried in the mud.\u201d Dylan protests the \u201cmasters of war\u201d who engineer war for their own profit, disregarding the violence and death they cause. Although it protests more generally against the nature of war, its message would have become more important as the Vietnam War progressed. Because the song was released before the draft was widely instituted, this sentiment would become more important as the Vietnam War led to greater numbers of young people being drafted to fight in Vietnam. In this case, these ideas were put forth in songs released before the political event- the Vietnam War and the use of the draft- and sparked the political sentiments that fueled the protests against the war and the draft. This shows how protest songs helped to influence the political beliefs of their audience, and affected the way in which they reacted to subsequent political events.\n\nAs protest music succeeded in changing the political beliefs of its audience, listeners now had a greater disagreement with the political events that followed. This disagreement characterized the political climate as a whole, and led to events like the reaction to the draft and student protests. The tension between protest music and its audience was exemplified by songs like Jefferson Airplane\u2019s \u201cVolunteers\u201d (discussed above), or Tom Paxton\u2019s \u201cMr. Blue,\u201d a sinister song which gives a dystopic portrayal of those controlling society, painting a picture of a society that expects specific beliefs and actions, and is willing to resort to violent means to maintain those expectations. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a slot to fill, and fill that slot you will\u2028/ You\u2019ll learn to love it, or we\u2019ll break you.\u2028/ Oh, what will it take, to whip you into line?\u2028/ A broken heart? A broken head?\u2028/ It can be arranged. It can be arranged.\u201d This shows how the artists making protest music viewed society and government as coercive and despotic. These beliefs would have put them in direct opposition to everything that the government and society did, as well as the very existence of the current government. This view of society and government fueled much of the reactions on the part of protesters, especially the students protests seen at most universities during this time period. The views of the protesters were shown by many songs about the Vietnam War and the draft, especially Country Joe and the Fish\u2019s \u201cI-Feel-Like-I\u2019m-Fixin\u2019-To-Die Rag\u201d (discussed previously). \u201cWhat are we fighting for? / Don\u2019t ask me I don\u2019t give a damn / next stop it\u2019s Vietnam.\u201d This voices the protesters\u2019 belief that the war was meaningless and unnecessary, and opposes those in the government and in society who wanted them to go and fight in Vietnam. However, this song had a more nihilistic quality. \u201cCountry Joe also brought a spirit of protest to Woodstock\u2026 his \u2018I-Feel-Like-I\u2019m-Fixin\u2019-To-Die Rag,\u2019 more grimly pertinent than when it had been released two years ago\u2026 said a great deal about how the mood had changed from earlier periods: the hopefulness and sobriety of both Newport and the March on Washington had been replaced by bitter despair and ebullient self-indulgence.\" It protested the war, but still was not convinced that anything the protesters did would have an effect. Protest music succeeded in producing music that changed the political beliefs of its audience. This ideological change led to greater tensions between this audience and the actions of the government. This resulted in tensions, which were expressed in the widespread student protests. Protest music written about topics like war and pacifism successfully caused political events like the reaction to the draft, showing how protest music brought about the political climate of the time.\n\nDuring the 1960\u2019s, political events like the Vietnam War coincided with a large movement of protest music. Artists writing protest songs wrote music that was more popular than previous protest artists, and had a larger impact. Because political events like the Vietnam War and the draft, and protest music were so closely related, each must have had some role in causing or propagating the other. The two main arguments regarding this are either that political events caused protest music by giving musicians something to protest, or that protest music caused political events like student protests by influencing the political climate so that events like student protests happened. However, in this case the lines of causality are so blurred that it cannot be argued that music caused politics any more than political events caused protest music. For example, a song like Barry McGuire\u2019s \u201cEve of Destruction\u201d can be used to argue both theories. The song protests the threat of nuclear war, and its mention of how \u201cif the button is pushed, there\u2019s no runnin\u2019 away\u201d shows a direct protest to the existence of the nuclear bomb, and the threat of nuclear warfare. This supports the first theory, that political events, in this case the invention of the nuclear bomb, caused protest songs. However, the song was very successful, and its long stint in the Top 100 charts shows that the song would have been heard by many people. This song, and other like it, would have shifted public opinion toward pacifism, and would have heightened public awareness of the possibility of nuclear warfare. This had the effect of shifting public opinion against military ventures like the Vietnam War, and would have led to political events like student protests. In this way nearly every protest song can be used to argue both theories. In this case, protest music and political events were so closely tied that one cannot be determined to have solely caused the other. As a result, neither theory is applicable, so the exact causality cannot be determined.\n\nBibliography.15Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1234501",

shoes, I wouldn't worry none\nWhile you and your friends are worrying 'bout me\nI'm having lots of fun\n\n[Chorus]\nCounting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all\nPlaying solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one\nSmoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo\nNow don't tell me I've nothing to do\n[Verse 2]\nLast night I dressed in tails pretending I was on the town\nAs long as I can dream, it's hard to slow this swinger down\nSo please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doing fine\nYou can always find me here and having quite a time\n\n[Chorus]\nCounting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all\nPlaying solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one\nSmoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo\nNow don't tell me I've nothing to do\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright\nAnyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light\nAnd my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete\nSo I must go back to my room and make my day complete\n\n[Chorus]\nCounting flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all\nPlaying solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one\nSmoking cigarettes and watching Captain Kangaroo\nNow don't tell

He's got a singer to sell. What's the man he's introducing done with all that hard work? \"Man that sang, 'I Go CRAZY'!\" The snare smacks  as the  horn  section blares a G chord. It's  really \"I'll   Go   Crazy,\"  but Gonder's  determined  to out-country JB's  enunciation.   \"Try   ME!\" G-sharp. \"YOU've Got  the  Power!\" A. \"THINK!\" A-sharp. \"If You  Want Me!\"  B \u2013 except, oh  dear,  problem in  the trumpet section, either Teddy Washington or  Mack Johnson hits a bad note.  (What was this \"If You Want Me\"?   Not a  hit,  really-it had  been  the  flip-side   of \"Bewildered.\" What was it doing in the  list of hits? It sounded good.)  \"I Don't Mind!\" C. \"Be-WIL-dered!\u201d C-sharp. (At  this  point, there's what  sounds like  the first  bit we've  lost from  the  tape \u2013 just a tiny  dropout, but  perhaps  there  was  something edited out  there.) \"Million-dolla sella 'LOST Someone'!\" Not  just a million-seller, mind you, but a million-dollar seller, at a time when a single usually cost 79 cents. \"Lost Someone\" had been  a No. 2 R&B hit,  but  given  that  it only got  up to No.  48 on  the  pop  charts,  that  particular distinction is unlikely. The  band hits a D. \"The very latest  release, 'NIGHT Train'!\" Well, no \u2013 \"Shout and Shimmy\" and \"Mashed Potatoes U.S.A.\" had come out since \"Night Train\" \u2013 but it had  been his biggest hit  that  year. D-sharp.  \"It's  everybody  'Shout and SHIMMY'!\" We'll be hearing  more about  that in a minute. E.GOLD\"Brown has perhaps a dozen 'gold' records to his credit,\u201d the little unbylined puff piece in that week's New York Amsterdam News announced. That was pushing it \u2013 he'd only had 15 chart  singles by that  point. James  Brown didn't  have a certified gold single until 1972's \"Get  On the Good  Foot,\" although King evidently didn't  bother with RIAA gold and platinum  certification. Still, for an Apollo audience, Gonder had a lot of familiar song titles to mention.\n\nThere are an awful lot of citations of chart numbers and dates in this book. Live with them. They are an essential  part of James  Brown's  art.  His  genius is the genius of rolls of tickets tom  off one by one, of money handed  over  for  records,  of the hit. The great James Brown  songs  are  popular,  the  popular  James  Brown songs are great. As George W.S. Trow wrote in another, darker  context, \"It's  a Hit! Love it! It's a Hit.  It loves you because you love it because it's a Hit!\" \"You come to see my show,\" Brown sang. \"That's why James Brown loves you  so.\" \"This is a hit!,\" he  declared as the  tape rolled  for \"Papa's Got a Brand  New  Bag\"; he cut it out of the released  record, but persuaded some  of the other artists  whose  records he produced around that  time  to yell  the  same  thing, so  it  might work  its  magic  for them  too.\n\nLook  at his singles  discography, and  ignore the  instrumentals, the duets,  the reissues,  the  throwaways on King's subsidiary label  Bethlehem, the  Christmas and novelty records-just concentrate on the songs he threw his weight  behind. A pattern emerges, or rather an unbroken block:  between \"Money Won't  Change You\u201d in July  1966  and  \"Hot (I Need  To Be Loved, Loved, Loved,  Loved)\" nine years later, James Brown had over sixty consecutive chart  hits. On  his own terms, he was an unstoppable champion, and  those  terms  were  people paying  to hear  him sing, and being  reassured that  what they  were  paying  for  was popular.\n\nThat's why he wanted  to make Live at the Apollo so badly:  he  could  demonstrate that  being  James Brown was itself a hit.  All he had  to do was get it on  tape.THE CATALOGUE OF  HITSBack at  the  Apollo,  Gonder's speech  has  been  setting up a couple  of subliminal effects. Starting with \"You've Got  the  Power,\"  and  running  through  \"Bewildered,\u201d there's  a steady 6/8 rhythm to the words he accents and the band's stabs \u2013 a tick-tock swing that's at pretty much the  same  tempo  as  Brown's  ballads.  There's also a hidden message in those emphases-Crazy-Me- You-Think-Want-Mind-Be-WILL-Lost-Night-Shimmy! This  is a night  for  total  abandon,  the suggestion goes; for thoughts  to become desires and then to simple be, through  sheer will; a night to be lost to shimmying.\n\n(A young man named Danny Ray was waiting in the wings. He'd  just been hired, that week, as James Brown's valet; a few years later,  he'd  take over the emcee  job, which he still holds today, and his introductions to the James  Brown show  have been  patterned  on  Gonder's ever since.)\n\nGonder's still going. \"Mr.  Dynamite\"-Mr. Dynamite  had been the title of two movies, one from 1935, adapted from Dashiell Hammett's story \"On the Make,\u201d and  the  other   from  1941,  starring   Lloyd  Nolan   as Tommy N. Thornton (nice initials)-\"the amazing Mr. Please, Please himself, the star of the show\"-as if there could be any doubt, as Gonder is almost erupting with conviction-\"JAMES BROWN AND  the  FAMOUS FLAMES!\"THE SCRATCHThe horns buck--one, two, three, four, five, all on a G chord that's climbed  up an octave since Gonder started his litany.  It's  the  beginning of a fanfare  to announce the  Hardest Working Man  In Show  Business's  arrival: three  choruses of a perky  little  blues  riff. Brown  glides onto  stage  during the  third, and  probably does  some high-powered   footwork,  judging    by   the    screams. Twenty-nine years old and as flexible as a piece of yarn, he  can  dance  faster  and  harder than  anyone, rippling his body,  floating over  a wooden floor  as if it's  water-slicked  ice.\nThe perky  little  blues  riff has  a name,  although it was never  credited on  any  edition of Live at the Apollo until 2004: it's  \"The  Scratch.\" Brown   and  his  band (including Les Buie on guitar  and Hubert Perry on bass, still with  the  band  at the  Apollo) had  recorded it as an instrumental on October 4, 1960. (\"The Scratch\" is also a close cousin of Henry Mancini's \"Peter Gunn\" theme, which  had  been  a hit for  Ray Anthony in 1959;  Duane Eddy's version  charted for  the  first  time  on  October 10,  1960.)  Brown's version  appeared as the  B-side  of \"Hold It\"  in January 1961,  and  the  band  played  it  as his entrance music  at least  through mid-1963.\n\nAs the band bats down the last note again and again, you can almost see James Brown's feet slide frictionlessly into position behind the microphone.I'LL GO CRAZYJames Brown steps up to the front  of the Apollo stage, gazes out over 1500 thoroughly warmed-up faces, and assesses matters  with a huge  holler.  He  feels all right, and he wants to make sure everybody knows it. The third time he announces  it, he gives the \"all\" an enormous melismatic rush, swooping around  at least twelve notes just to prove he can; then, as he takes a breath, guitarist Les Buie whacks sharply at his strings,  and we're into \"I'll  Go  Crazy.\"THE MISSING SONGExcept we're  not: there's  almost certainly  at least one song missing from the set on Live at the Apollo. In those days, JB usually opened  his shows with his latest hit. In October  1962,  that  was \"Shout  and Shimmy,\"  which had made No. 16 on the R&B chart (No. 61 pop) back in August. Recorded  February  9, 1961 (the same day as \"Lost  Someone\"  and \"Night Train\"), it starts with the I-feel-all-right routine, and then proceeds to a truly shameless ripoff of the Isley Brothers' 1959 hit \"Shout.\u201d\n\n(Really,  truly  shameless. The \"I feel all right\" business  is derived  from  the  beginning of the  second half of the Isleys' record, and the rest of the record is basically the  fast  parts  of \"Shout,\" with  the  gospel  inflections removed and  the  word  \"shimmy\" added.  It wasn't  the last  time JB  would  appropriate the  Isleys'  work  as his own, either: \"It's My Thing,\" his protegee Marva Whitney's  1969  single,  credited to J. Brown/M. Whitney, could  be charitably described as an answer  song  to the Isleys'  \"It's Your  Thing.\" It  could   be  less  charitably described as a cover  that  changes the  pronouns.)\n\n...4Embed"},

only you\nWe both killed the fruit on the vine\nAnd when you try to put love back together\nThere's always a few little pieces you can't find\n\nYes, there's too many rivers to cross, dear\nAnd there's too many dreams that have been lost\nOh there's too many long nights\nThat I've turned and I've tossed\nThere's too many rivers to crossYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

she asked for my sweater\nAnd said that she was very, very cold\nI kissed her goodnight\nAt her door and started home\nThen thought about my sweater\nAnd went right back instead\nI knocked at her door and a man appeared\nI told why I'd come, then he said:\n\n\"You're wrong, son\nYou weren't with my daughter\nHow can you be so cruel\nTo come to me this way?\nMy Laurie left this world on her birthday -\nShe died a year ago today.\"\n\nA strange force drew me to the graveyard\nI stood in the dark\nI saw the shadows wave\nAnd then I looked and saw my sweater\nLyin' there upon her grave\n\nStrange

COMEDY CLUB \u2013 NIGHT\nJerry is on stage, performing.\n\nJERRY: The bad thing about television is that everybody you see on television is doing something better than what you\u2019re doing. You ever see anybody on TV like just sliding off the front of the sofa with potato chip crumbs on their face? Some people have a little too much fun on television. The soda commercial people. Where do they summon this enthusiasm? Have you seen them? \u201cWe have soda, we have soda, we have soda\u201d, jumping, laughing, flying through the air. It\u2019s a can of soda! Have you ever been standing there and you\u2019re watching TV and you\u2019re drinking the exact same product that they\u2019re advertising right there on TV, and it\u2019s like, you know, they\u2019re spiking volleyballs, jet-skiing, girls in bikinis and I\u2019m standing there, \u201cMaybe I\u2019m putting too much ice in mine.\u201d\n\nINT. MONK\u2019S DINER \u2013 DAY\nGeorge and Jerry enter.\n\nGEORGE: (excited) So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing there, and she was sort of smiling at me, and I wasn\u2019t sure if she wanted me to ask her out, because when women smile at me I don\u2019t know what it means. Sometimes I interpret it like they\u2019re psychotic or something and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m supposed to smile back, I don\u2019t know what to do. So I just stood there like \u2013 remember how Quayle looked when Benson gave him that Kennedy line? That\u2019s what I looked like.\nJERRY: So you didn\u2019t ask?\n\nGEORGE: No, I froze.\n\nJerry points to the coffee shop\u2019s counter.\n\nJERRY: Counter.\n\nJerry and George sit down at the counter.\n\nGEORGE: Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I\u2019m back in the office, I tell Lloyd the whole story. He says, \u201cSo why don\u2019t you call her?\u201d I says, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d I couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t do it right then. For me to ask a woman out I gotta get into a mental state like the karate guys before they break the bricks. So Lloyd calls me a wuss.\n\nJERRY: He said wuss?\n\nGEORGE: Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.\n\nJERRY: So you called.\n\nGEORGE: Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating an apple, because I think if they hear you chewing on the other end of the phone, it makes you sound casual.\n\nJERRY: Yeah. Like a farm boy.\n\nGEORGE: Right. So I call her up, I tell her it\u2019s me, she gives me an enthusiastic \u2018Hi!\u2019\n\nJERRY: Wow. The enthusiastic hi. That\u2019s beautiful.\nGEORGE: Oh, I don\u2019t get the enthusiastic hi, I\u2019m outta there.\n\nJERRY: All right, so you\u2019re chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic hi... Go ahead.\n\nGEORGE: So, we\u2019re talking, and I don\u2019t like to go too long before I ask them out, I wanna get it over with right away, so I just blurt out, \u201cWhat are you doing Saturday night?\u201d\n\nJERRY: And?\n\nGEORGE: She bought.\n\nJERRY: Great day in the morning.\n\nGEORGE: Then I got off the phone right away.\n\nJERRY: Sure, it\u2019s like robbing a bank. You don\u2019t loiter around in front of the teller holding that big bag of money. You come in, you hit and get out.\n\nGEORGE: It\u2019s amazing. We, we both have dates on the same night. I can\u2019t remember the last time that happened.\n\nINT. GEORGE\u2019S CAR \u2013 SATURDAY NIGHT\nGeorge and his date, Carol, are parked outside Carol\u2019s building.\n\nGEORGE: I can\u2019t stand doing laundry. That\u2019s why I have forty pairs of underwear.\n\nCAROL: You do not.\nGEORGE: Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep buying underwear. My goal is to have over three hundred and sixty pair. That way, I only have to do wash once a year.\n\nThey both laugh.\nINT. JERRY\u2019S CAR \u2013 SATURDAY NIGHT\nJerry and his date, DONNA are parked outside Donna\u2019s building.\n\nJERRY: (in an attempted Scottish accent) Come on, try it. Let me hear you try a Scottish accent.\n\nDONNA: That\u2019s Irish.\n\nJERRY: Irish, Scottish, what\u2019s the difference, lassie?\n\nDonna laughs.\nINT. GEORGE\u2019S CAR \u2013 CONTINUED\n\nCAROL: So, uh, thanks for dinner. It was great.\n\nGEORGE: Yeah. (clears his throat) We should do this again.\n\nCAROL: Would you like to come upstairs for some coffee?\n\nGEORGE: Oh, no, thanks. I can\u2019t drink coffee late at night, it keeps me up.\n\nCAROL: (confused by his response) So, um, okay.\n\nGEORGE: Okay.\n\nCAROL: Goodnight.\n\nGEORGE: Yeah, take it easy.\n\nCarol exits the car. George realizes what he has done and slaps his forehead in disgust.\nINT. JERRY\u2019S CAR \u2013 CONTINUED\n\nDONNA: Thanks again for the movie.\n\nJERRY: You\u2019re welcome.\n\nDONNA: I\u2019d invite you up, but the place is being painted.\n\nJERRY: Oh, that\u2019s okay.\n\nDONNA: Unless you want to go to your place.\n\nJERRY: Okay... but there\u2019s no cake or anything, if that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for.\n\nINT. GEORGE\u2019S CAR (MOVING) \u2013 CONTINUED\n\nGEORGE: (frustrated) Take it easy! Huh! Take it easy!\n\nINT. JERRY\u2019S APARTMENT\nJerry and Donna sit on the sofa.\n\nJERRY: I think if one\u2019s going to kill oneself, the least you could do is leave a note. It\u2019s common courtesy. I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s just the way I was brought up.\n\nDONNA: Values are very important.\n\nJERRY: Oh, so important. So what are you doing uh Thursday night? You wanna have dinner?\n\nDONNA: Thursday\u2019s great.\n\nPause. Jerry looks down at his pants.\n\nJERRY: Tan pants. Why do I buy tan pants, Donna? I don\u2019t feel comfortable in them.\n\nDONNA: Are those Cotton Dockers?\n\nJERRY: Oh, I can\u2019t begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.\n\nDONNA: Really? I like that commercial.\n\nDonna gets closer and more comfortable leaning on Jerry. Jerry Pauses thinking about what she said\n\nJERRY: You like that commercial?\n\nDONNA: Yeah, it\u2019s clever.\n\nJERRY: Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all standing around, supposedly being very casual and witty?\n\nDONNA: Yeah, that\u2019s the one.\n\nJERRY: What could you possibly like about that?\n\nDONNA: I don\u2019t know. I like the, guys.\n\nJERRY: Yeah, they\u2019re so funny and so comfortable with each other, and I could be comfortable too, if I had pants like that. I could sit on a porch and wrestle around, and maybe even be part of a real bull session.\n\nDONNA : Hey, I know guys like that. To me the dialogue rings true.\n\nAfter Jerry sits back again, Donna continues get more comfortable in Jerry's arms. Jerry pauses.\n\nJERRY: Even if the dialogue did ring true. (Donna starts to get annoyed that Jerry won't let the conversation go) Even if somehow somewhere men actually talk like that, what does that have to do with the pants? Doesn\u2019t that bother you?\n\nDONNA: (annoyed) That\u2019s the idea. That\u2019s what\u2019s clever about it, that they\u2019re not talking about the pants.\n\nJERRY: But they\u2019re talking about nothing.\n\nDONNA: That\u2019s the point.\n\nJERRY: I know the point.\n\nDONNA: No one is telling you to like it.\n\nJERRY: I mean, all those quick shots of the pants. Just pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants, pants. What is that supposed to be?\n\nDonna sighs, leans away from Jerry and looks at her watch.\nINT. COMEDY CLUB \u2013 NIGHT\nJerry is on stage, performing.\n\nJERRY: What\u2019s brutal about the date is the scrutiny that you put each other through. Because whenever you think about this person in terms of the future, you have to magnify everything about them. You know, like the guy\u2019ll be like, \u201cI don\u2019t think her eyebrows are even. Could I look at uneven eyebrows for the rest of my life?\u201d And of course the woman\u2019s looking at the guy, thinking, \u201cWhat is he looking at? Do I want somebody looking at me like this for the rest of my life?\u201d\n\nINT. JERRY\u2019S APARTMENT \u2013 DAY\nJerry and Elaine are talking.\n\nJERRY: I\u2019m supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go out with someone who actually likes this commercial?\n\nELAINE: I once broke up with a guy because he didn\u2019t keep his bathroom clean enough.\n\nJERRY: No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?\n\nELAINE: Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed his tub. Germs were building a town in there \u2013 they were constructing offices. Houses near the drain were going for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n\nGeorge enters, looking miserable, holding a brown paper bag.\n\nELAINE: Hi.\n\nGeorge produces a bottle of Pepto-Bismol and box of bicarb (sic) from bag, placing them on counter.\n\nJERRY: You\u2019re still thinking about this?\n\nGEORGE: She invites me up at twelve o\u2019clock at night, for coffee, and I don\u2019t go up. \u201cNo thank you. I don\u2019t want coffee. It keeps me up. Too late for me to drink coffee.\u201d I said this to her. People this stupid shouldn\u2019t be allowed to live. I can\u2019t imagine what she must think of me.\n\nJERRY: She thinks you\u2019re a guy that doesn\u2019t like coffee.\n\nGEORGE: She invited me up. Coffee\u2019s not coffee, coffee is sex.\n\nELAINE: Maybe coffee was coffee.\n\nGEORGE: Coffee\u2019s coffee in the morning. It\u2019s not coffee at twelve o\u2019clock at night.\n\nELAINE: Well some people drink coffee that late.\n\nGEORGE: Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who\u2019re on twenty-four hour missile watch. Everything was going along so great. She was laughing, I was funny... I kept saying to myself, \u201cKeep it up, don\u2019t blow it, you\u2019re doing great.\u201d\n\nELAINE: It\u2019s all in your head. All she knows is she had a good time. I think you should call her.\n\nGEORGE: I can\u2019t call her now. It\u2019s too soon. I\u2019m planning a Wednesday call.\n\nELAINE: Oh, why? I love it when guys call me the next day.\n\nGEORGE: Of course you do, but you\u2019re imagining a guy you like, not a guy who goes, \u201cOh no, I don\u2019t drink coffee late at night.\u201d If I call her now, she\u2019s gonna think I\u2019m too needy. Women don\u2019t wanna see need. They want a take-charge guy \u2013 a colonel, a Kaiser, a tsar.\n\nELAINE: All she\u2019ll think is that you like her.\n\nGEORGE: That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid!\n\nELAINE: Well, she wants you to like her.\n\nGEORGE: Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me. But she doesn\u2019t like me!\n\nELAINE: I don\u2019t know what your parents did to you.\n\nKramer enters and addresses Jerry.\n\nKRAMER: Hey, I just thought of a really funny thing for your act. All right, you\u2019re up there, you\u2019re on the stage and you go, \u201cHey, you ever notice how cars here in New York, they never get out of the way of ambulances anymore. Someone\u2019s in a life-and-death situation, and we\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, sorry buddy, you should\u2019ve thought of that when you were eating cheese omelettes and sauages for breakfast every morning for the last thirty years.\u201d\n\nElaine laughs. Jerry humors Kramer with a smile.\n\nKRAMER: So you gonna use it?\n\nJERRY : I don\u2019t think so.\n\nKRAMER: It\u2019s funny.\n\nELAINE: It is funny.\n\nJERRY: I like to use my own material.\n\nKRAMER: That\u2019s as good as anything you do.\n\nGEORGE: All right, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.\n\nJERRY: Why do we have to leave?\n\nGEORGE: Because I can\u2019t call a woman with other people in the room. Come on, let\u2019s go.\n\nELAINE: Oh, see, this is the problem.\n\nJERRY: You\u2019re kicking me out of my house?\n\nGEORGE: Yes.\n\nJerry exits. Elaine is in the doorway.\n\nELAINE: (encouraging) Don\u2019t forget.\n\nGEORGE: (to Elaine) Right, alright. (to Jerry) Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?\n\nJERRY: Don\u2019t do the apples. It\u2019s enough already with the apples.\n\nElaine, Kramer and Jerry exit. George removes his jacket and dials the phone.\n\nCAROL: (from the phone; a recorded message) Hi, it\u2019s Carol, I\u2019ll get back to you.\n\nA beep follows.\n\nGEORGE: Um, hi, it\u2019s George, George Costanza, remember me? The guy that didn\u2019t come up for coffee. You see, I didn\u2019t realise that coffee didn\u2019t really mean... well, whatever. Anyway, it was fun. It was... it was fun, so... oh boy, um, so... You call me back. If you want. It\u2019s up to you, you know, whatever you wanna do. Either way. The ball\u2019s in your court. So uh, take it easy.\n\nGeorge hangs up. Jerry enters.\n\nJERRY: I\u2019m just gonna get my jacket, I\u2019ll meet you downstairs. What\u2019s the matter, did you call?\n\nElaine enters.\n\nGEORGE: Got her machine. I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m a dead man. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m dead, I\u2019m a dead man. Dead man.\n\nJERRY: What did you say?\n\nGEORGE: I don\u2019t know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum and there\u2019s nothing I can do. It\u2019s a machine. The little light is blinking right now, \u201cCome and listen to the idiot. Hey everybody, the idiot\u2019s on!\u201d\n\nJERRY: After one date you try and improvise on her machine?\n\nGEORGE: Now I\u2019m in the worst position of all.\n\nELAINE: Y\u2019know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy\u2019s machine, and he blurted out some business information he wasn\u2019t supposed to, and it would have cost him fifteen thousand dollars, so he waited outside the guy\u2019s house and when the guy came home he went upstairs with him and he switched the tape.\n\nGEORGE: He did that?\n\nELAINE: Yeah.\n\nGEORGE: Somebody did that?\n\nJERRY: She\u2019ll call you back. You\u2019re overreacting.\n\nINT. JERRY\u2019S APARTMENT \u2013 NIGHT\nJerry is in the kitchen. Donna is on the other side of the counter.\n\nJERRY: Not once.\n\nDONNA: Never?\n\nJERRY: I have never seen one episode of I Love Lucy in my life, ever.\n\nDONNA: That\u2019s amazing.\n\nJERRY: Thank you.\n\nDONNA: Is there anything else about you I should know?\n\nJERRY: Yes, I\u2019m lactose intolerant.\n\nDONNA: Really?\n\nJERRY: I have no patience for lactose. And I won\u2019t stand for it. Um, I\u2019ll be right back.\n\nJerry goes to the bathroom. George bursts into the apartment.\n\nGEORGE: Wait till you hear this! (George sees Donna and no Jerry.) Whoa, ah, I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t, I had no idea.\n\nHe goes to leave.\n\nDONNA: Wait, wait. He\u2019s in the bathroom.\n\nGEORGE: I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I\u2019ll come back.\n\nDONNA: You don\u2019t have to leave.\n\nGEORGE: You sure?\n\nDONNA: Yes.\n\nGEORGE: Okay.\n\nDONNA: I\u2019m Donna.\n\nGEORGE: Donna. Oh, you\u2019re the one that likes that commercial!\n\nDONNA: He told you about that?\n\nGEORGE: (back-pedalling) No, he, he didn\u2019t actually tell me that, uh, we were talking about that commercial \u2013 in fact I think I brought it up because I like that commercial. No, he, he would never tell me anything. He never discusses anything. He\u2019s, he\u2019s like a clam. You\u2019re not gonna mention this, to him...\n\nJerry re-enters.\n\nDONNA: (to Jerry) So you go around telling your friends I\u2019m not hip because I like that commercial.\n\nJERRY: What? (to George) What did, what did you say?\n\nGEORGE: Say? What? Nothing, I...\n\nDONNA: You told him how I like the commercial.\n\nJERRY: Well, so what if I said that?\n\nDONNA: Well, so, you didn\u2019t have to tell your friends.\n\nJERRY: No, I had to tell my friends \u2013 my friends didn\u2019t have to tell you.\n\nGEORGE: (to Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?\n\nDONNA: I don\u2019t like you talking about me with your friends behind my back.\n\nGEORGE: Boy oh boy.\n\nJERRY: I said I couldn\u2019t believe you liked that commercial. So what?\n\nDONNA: I asked some friends of mine this week, and all of them liked the commercial.\n\nJERRY: Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.\n\nKramer enters.\n\nKRAMER: Hey.\n\nJERRY: Oh uh, Kramer, this is Donna.\n\nKRAMER: Oh. Cotton Dockers!\n\nGEORGE: Hello! All right, we should be going. Come on...\n\nGeorge grabs Kramer.\n\nKRAMER: What? Where are we going?\n\nGEORGE: Come on!\n\nDONNA: Don\u2019t bother, I\u2019m leaving.\n\nJERRY: Donna, really, you\u2019re making too much of this.\n\nKRAMER: \u201cOne hundred percent Cotton Dockers. If they\u2019re not Dockers, they\u2019re just pants\u201d\n\nJERRY: Please, Donna...\n\nDONNA: I don\u2019t wanna hear it.\n\nDonna leaves.\n\nGEORGE: I can\u2019t believe I said that. You know me, I\u2019m a vault.\n\nJERRY: Don\u2019t worry about it, it wasn\u2019t working anyway.\n\nKRAMER: What happened there?\n\nJERRY: I\u2019ll tell you later.\n\nGEORGE: You are not gonna believe what\u2019s going on with this woman.\n\nINT. MONK\u2019S DINER \u2013 DAY\nGeorge and Jerry sat at a booth.\n\nGEORGE: Okay, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she doesn\u2019t call back. I call again Monday, I leave another message. I call Tuesday, I get the machine again, \u201cI know you\u2019re there, I don\u2019t know what your story is.\u201d Yesterday, I\u2019m a volcano \u2013 I try one more call, the machine comes on, and I let fly like Mussolini from the balcony, \u201cWhere the hell do you get the nerve? You invite me up for coffee and then you don\u2019t call me back for four days? I don\u2019t like coffee, I don\u2019t have to come up. I\u2019d like to get one more shot at the coffee just so I could spit it in your face.\u201d\n\nJERRY: You said that?\n\nGEORGE: I lost it.\n\nJERRY: I can\u2019t blame you. I can\u2019t believe she never called you back.\n\nGEORGE: She did. Today.\n\nJERRY: What?\n\nGEORGE: She called my office. She said she\u2019s been in the Hamptons since Sunday. She didn\u2019t know if I was trying to get in touch with her. Her machine broke, and she\u2019s been using her old machine and she doesn\u2019t have the beeper for it.\n\nJERRY: So she didn\u2019t get the messages.\n\nGEORGE: Exactly, but they\u2019re on there \u2013 waiting. She said she can\u2019t wait to see me, we\u2019re having dinner tonight. She\u2019s supposed to call me as soon as she gets home.\n\nJERRY: But what about the messages?\n\nGeorge produces cassette tape from pocket.\n\nJERRY: Elaine\u2019s thing? How you gonna get in?\n\nGEORGE: I\u2019ll meet her outside the building.\n\nJERRY: But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she\u2019s going right for that machine.\n\nGEORGE: Unless she goes for the bathroom. That\u2019s my only chance. (George crumbles. He drops the cassette on the table.) Who am I kidding? I can\u2019t do this, I can\u2019t do this. I don\u2019t even know how to work those stupid machines.\n\nJERRY: There\u2019s nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right out.\n\nGEORGE: You do it for me.\n\nJERRY: What?\n\nGEORGE: Come on, it\u2019ll be so much easier.\n\nJERRY: How you gonna get me up there?\n\nGEORGE: I\u2019ll tell her I bumped into you, I\u2019m giving you a ride uptown.\n\nJERRY: And who makes the switch?\n\nGEORGE: You do.\n\nJERRY: I do.\n\nGEORGE : I can\u2019t do it. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll keep her busy.\n\nJERRY: I can\u2019t get involved in this.\n\nGEORGE: I think I may be in love with this woman.\n\nJERRY: What if she sees me?\n\nGEORGE: Oh, you are such a wuss.\n\nJERRY: A wuss?\n\nGEORGE: Yeah.\n\nJERRY: Did you call me a wuss?\n\nEXT. CAROL\u2019S BUILDING \u2013 NIGHT\nGeorge and Jerry are sitting on a low wall beside the door to the building.\n\nGEORGE: Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.\n\nJERRY: I got one problem. You\u2019re keeping her busy in the other room. Now, what if she somehow gets away from you and is coming in? You have to signal me that she\u2019s coming.\n\nGEORGE: A signal, right, um, okay, uh, okay, the signal is, I\u2019ll call out tippy-toe!\n\nJERRY: Tippy Toe? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nGEORGE: You don\u2019t like tippy toe?\n\nJERRY: No tippy toe.\n\nGEORGE: All right, uh, okay, I got it, um, I\u2019ll sing.\n\nJERRY: What song?\n\nGEORGE: \u201cHow Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?\u201d\n\nJERRY: What is that?\n\nGEORGE: Oh, it\u2019s a lovely song. (singing) \u201cHow do you solve a problem like Maria?...\u201d\n\nJERRY: Anything else?\n\nGEORGE: You pick it.\n\nJERRY: \u201cLemon Tree.\u201d\n\nGEORGE: Peter, Paul and Mary.\n\nJERRY: No, Trini Lopez.\n\nJERRY & GEORGE: (singing) \u201cLemon tree, very pretty and a lemon flower...\u201d\n\nGEORGE: Alright ok. You got the tape?\n\nJerry takes out two different sizes of cassettes.\n\nJERRY: Standard. Micro.\n\nGEORGE: How do you feel? Confident?\n\nJERRY: Feel good.\n\nGEORGE: You nervous?\n\nJERRY: Not at all.\n\nGEORGE: Get up, get up, it\u2019s her! Oh, the hell with this, I\u2019m scared to death, just walk away, it\u2019s off, cancel everything, go!\n\nCarol enters.\n\nCAROL: Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed to call you when I got home.\n\nGEORGE: I, I couldn\u2019t wait. I was too anxious to see you.\n\nCAROL: Oh, that\u2019s so sweet.\n\nGEORGE: Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into him around the corner. Isn\u2019t that a coincidence? The funny thing is, I see him all the time.\n\nJERRY: All the time.\n\nCAROL: It\u2019s nice to meet you.\n\nJERRY: Hi.\n\nCAROL: So, I\u2019m starving. Where are we gonna eat?\n\nGEORGE: You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give Jerry a ride home.\n\nCAROL: Okay. Let\u2019s go, I\u2019m ready, where\u2019d you park?\n\nGEORGE: Don\u2019t you wanna go upstairs first?\n\nCAROL: No, what for? I\u2019ll just give my bag to the doorman.\n\nJERRY: You know, I really need to use the bathroom.\n\nCAROL: Oh well there\u2019s a bathroom in the coffee shop just next door.\n\nGEORGE: Yes, yes, but uh, I have to make a call, so...\n\nCAROL: Well they have a phone.\n\nGeorge takes Carol aside.\n\nGEORGE: I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets. I think we really should go upstairs.\n\nCAROL: (aloud) You know, I think I will go upstairs. I can check my machine.\n\nGEORGE: Right, right.\n\nThey enter her building.\nINT. CAROL\u2019S APARTMENT \u2013 CONTINUING\nCarol, Jerry and George enter.\n\nCAROL: The bathroom\u2019s on the hall to the right.\n\nJERRY: Uh, you know, why don\u2019t you go first, you just had a long trip.\n\nCAROL: No, I\u2019m fine.\n\nJERRY: Um, you know, it\u2019s the damnedest thing. It went away.\n\nCAROL: Oh, that\u2019s weird.\n\nGEORGE: No, no that can happen. I\u2019ve, uh, I\u2019ve read about that in medical journals. It\u2019s a freak thing, but...\n\nCAROL: Well, let me just check my messages, and we\u2019ll go.\n\nGEORGE: Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now?\n\nCAROL: Sure.\n\nGEORGE: Please, this is very, very important.\n\nGeorge leads her to another room. Jerry goes over and lifts the lid of the machine.\n\nGEORGE: (from other room) Uh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon tree!\n\nCarol reappears, followed by George.\n\nCAROL: (to Jerry) Now I know who you are! You\u2019re a comedian. I\u2019ve seen you, it\u2019s driving me crazy.\n\nJERRY: Right. I am.\n\nGEORGE: Carol, that\u2019s so rude. Please, I\u2019m serious, just for a moment, if you wouldn\u2019t mind. And then we\u2019ll talk to Jerry.\n\nGeorge leads Carol back out. Jerry switches the tapes.\n\nJERRY: (calls) Hey you two. I\u2019m ready to go.\n\nGeorge and Carol return.\n\nCAROL: That\u2019s what you had to tell me? Your father wears sneakers in the pool?\n\nGEORGE: (to Jerry) Don\u2019t you find that strange?\n\nJERRY: Yes.\n\nCAROL: Well, I\u2019ll just check my machine and we\u2019ll go.\n\nShe lifts the lid of the machine, and drops it.\n\nCAROL: No, nothing here, let\u2019s go. (Carol, George and Jerry head for the door. Carol opens it.) Oh, I forgot to tell you. After I talked to you today my neighbour called me and played my messages to me over the phone.\n\nGEORGE: Oh, uh...\n\nCAROL: Yours were hilarious, we were both cracking up. I just love jokes like that.\n\nCarol exits. Jerry laughs acidly while looking at George. They exit as well.\nINT. COMEDY CLUB \u2013 NIGHT\nJerry in on stage, performing.\n\nJERRY: I love my phone machine. I wish I was a phone machine. I wish if I saw somebody on the street I didn\u2019t want to talk to, I could go, \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m not in right now. If you would just leave a message, I could walk away.\u201d I also have a cordless phone, but I don\u2019t like that as much, because you can\u2019t slam down a cordless phone. You get mad at somebody on a real phone \u2013 \u201cYou can\u2019t talk to me like that!\u201d Bang! You know. You get mad at somebody on a cordless phone \u2013 \u201cYou can\u2019t talk to me like that!\u201d\n(Jerry searches for the \u2018off\u2019 button on his mimed phone, and presses it feebly.) \u201cI told him!\u201dEmbed"}]
