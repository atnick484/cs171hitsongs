baby\nI said you're everything I ever hoped for in a woman\nAnd as long as I may live\nOoh, you're...\n\n[Verse 1: Big Pun]\nYo, I ain't a player, I just fuck a lot\nJump on top of my dick and work them hips until I bust a shot\nIt doesn't stop, I'm only beginnin', I'm bonin' your women\nWhile you home all alone, I'm blowin' up in 'em\nSendin' them back to you, mad at you\nDon't catch a motherfuckin' attitude\nI'm just showin' you how this rapper do\nCapital Punishment, when I'm up in it, suckin' it\nBustin' it out\u2014nice blouse, let me unbutton it\nYou're fuckin' with King Papi Chulo when knockin' culo\nPop your mulos out the socket tryin' to ride with the sumo\nYou know my rise is high, word, I be drillin' 'em\nBitches be tryin' to ride, but the curve be killin' 'em\nFillin' 'em with the cash, my cheese premium unleaded\nCome get it, first work the tongue, then let the Pun hit it\nSplit it in half, watch the gat, baby, take a bath\nBe good, I might put away the wood and give you the mustache\n[Chorus: The O'Jays & Big Punisher]\nYou're my darlin' darlin' baby\nI ain't a player, I just fuck a lot\nYou're my darlin' darlin' love\nI'm not a player, I just fuck a lot\nYou're my darlin' darlin' baby..\"\nI ain't a player, I just fuck a lot\nYou're my darlin' darlin' love\nI'm not a player, I just fuck a lot\n\n[Verse 2: Big Pun]\nI bang a stranger in my torture chamber\nFeed the locas chocha pinga\nWhile I force my finger where my bolas linger\nI bring the pain like Method when I flex and flip the coochie\nPuerto Rican to the core, but no Boriquas eat the pussy\n'Scuse me for bein' blunt, but I've been eatin' cunts\nSince pimps was pushin' pink Caddies with the fish tank pumps\nBumpin' and grindin', simultaneously grindin'\nClimbin' up the walls, with my balls bangin' off your hymen\nI'm a diamond in the rough, (ugh) bustin' in your face\nTaste the sweetness of my dick, rip your fetus out of place\nYo, bitches already know the repertoire\nStep in my car, let's start the m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, like Escobar\nBy far, I'm the best at all sex positions, forget the kissin'\nI'm skippin' the tongue-twistin', TS Tradition\nYou might also like[Chorus: The O'Jays & Big Punisher]\nYou're my darlin' darlin' baby\nI ain't a player, I just fuck a lot\nYou're my darlin' darlin' love\nI'm not a player, I just fuck a lot\nYou're my darlin' darlin' baby..\"\nI ain't a player, I just fuck a lot\nYou're my darlin' darlin' love\nI'm not a player, I just fuck a lot\n\n[Verse 3: Big Punisher]\nSome chick in back of me, bought me a daiquiri\nTold me meet her in back of Zachary's\n'Cause she heard I was packin' meat\nI bagged the freak and hit the telly\nGot the Phillies, lifted her belly\nAnd \"Put it in Her Mouth,\" like Akinyele\nFar from ugly but they used to say I'm too chubby\nBut since the money the honeys got nothin' but love for me\nSo rub my tummy and make a wish, I'll make you rich\nTake your kids to the

come\nYou just had to hold me like nobody else\nNow look what you've gone and done\nYou had to love me, till I just can't get enough\n\nPlease, help me girl...\n\nSo help me girl, you've gone too

mine\nBut now those days are memories in time\nLife's empty\nWithout you\nBy my side\nMy heart belongs to you\nNo matter what I try\n[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]\nWhen I get the courage up to love somebody new\nIt always falls apart 'cause they just can't compare to you\nYour love won't release me, I'm bound under ball and chain\nReminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change\n\n[Chorus]\nIn comes the winter breeze\nThat chills the air and drifts the snow\nAnd I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe\nWhen springtime makes its way here\nLilac blooms reminds me of\nThe scent of your perfume\nWhen summer burns with heat\nI always get the hots for you\nGo skinny dippin' in the ocean\nWhere we used to do\nWhen autumn sheds the leaves\nThe trees are bare when you're not here\nIt doesn't feel the same\n(It doesn't feel the same, oh)\n\n[Verse 2: Nathan & (Mike)]\nRemember\nThe nights when (remember the night)\nWe closed our eyes (when we closed our eyes)\nAnd vowed that you and I\nWould be in love for all time\nSee Boyz II Men LiveGet tickets as low as $79You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]\nEverytime I think about these things I shared with you\nI break down and cry 'cause I get so emotional\nUntil you release me I'm bound under ball and chain\nReminiscing our love as I watch four seasons change\n\n[Chorus]\nIn comes the winter breeze\nThat chills the air and drifts the snow\nAnd I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe\nWhen springtime makes its way here\nLilac blooms reminds me of\nThe scent of your perfume\nWhen summer burns with heat\nI always get the hots for you\nGo skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do\nWhen autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare\nWhen you're not here\nIt doesn't feel the same\n\n[Bridge: Wanya & (Mike)]\nThis loneliness has crushed my heart (it's killing me, baby)\nPlease let me love again (I just wanna know if I can fix this)\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Shawn]\n'Cause I need your love to comfort me and ease my pain\nOr four seasons will bring the loneliness again\n[Chorus]\nIn comes the winter breeze\nThat chills the air and drifts the snow\nAnd I imagine kissing you under the mistletoe\nWhen springtime makes its way here\nLilac blooms reminds me of\nThe scent of your perfume\nWhen summer burns with heat\nI always get the hots for you\nGo skinny dippin' in the ocean where we used to do\nWhen autumn sheds the leaves the trees are bare\nWhen you're not here\nIt doesn't feel the same\n(It doesn't feel the same)\n\n[Outro: Nate]\nRemember\nThe warmth of\nDays gone byEmbed"}, {"_type": "song",

Boy\nWe don't stop\n(We rock, we rock, yo)\nYo\n\n[Verse 1: Ma$e]\nI hit you with the sound that the world can't take\nCame straight out the gate playing 2.8\nEars studded jewel flooded, Got to love it\nFirst rap cat with the R&B budget\nEvery day on the TV me and PD\nGirl's so pretty, make their man break the CD\nWhy y'all forever rowdy\nI be out here somewhere in Maui\nTill I go back to Cali\n[Verse 1: Brian McKnight]\nCan't understand\nHow he can treat you the way that he does\nGive me the chance to show you, baby\nYou're better off with me\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Brian McKnight, (Kelly Price)]\n(Ohh ohh ohh, so will you let me try)\n(I wanna make you smile)\nI wanna love you like you need to be loved\n(I'll never let you down)\n(I'll always be around)\nAnd you should be mine\n\n[Chorus: Brian McKnight, (Kelly Price), ((all))]\n((If he don't love you right))\n((Don't waste your time))\n(Don't waste your time)\nDon't baby\n((If he don't treat you like he should))\nNo, baby\n((Then you should be mine))\nYou should be mine, baby\n\n[Verse 2: Brian McKnight]\nWhy can't you see\nYou should be happy\nAnd I don't know why\nYou don't believe a man can love you\nFor the rest of your life\nSee Brian McKnight LiveGet tickets as low as $56You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Brian McKnight, (Kelly Price)]\n(Ohh ohh ohh, so will you let me try)\n(I wanna make you smile)\nI wanna love you like you need to be loved\n(I'll never let you down)\n(I'll always be around)\nAnd you should be mine\n\n[Chorus: Brian McKnight, (Kelly Price), ((all))]\n((If he don't love you right))\n((Don't waste your time))\n(Don't waste your time)\n((If he don't treat you like he should)) no, no, no, no, no\n((Then you should be mine))\nYou should be mine, ohh ohh\n\n[Verse 3: Ma$e (Brian McKnight)]\nYo!\nWhat the deal, honey?\nInsecure feel funny\nI know you're used to dealin' with cats with real money\nPlus I know you're like Ma$e in a lot of ways\nBut it's hard to go on when you're lonely in the holidays\nWhen you shopping\nDid you shop for 2?\nUh!\nTake you where the waters aqua blue\nLet you fall back\nTreat you like you're all that\nUnder umbrellas with your shades and your straw hat\nYou ain't the one out clubbing all day and all night\nJust to save a fight\nOr say he's right\nAnd I know he ain't the cat that'll stay in you life\nEven though he gave you ice now make'm your wife (yeah)\nHow a man deserve you if he hurt you?\nThen he give a woman 25 a curfew\nBetween me and you\nYou ain't heard that from me\nCuz Ma$e ain't the player with the PhD\n\n[Bridge: Brian McKnight, ((all))]\nGirl, come into my world\n((I love you the way that you need to be loved))\nNo worries, no more ((ooh ooh))\nGirl, open the door\n((And don't waste your time))\nCuz you should be mine\n\n[Chorus: Brian McKnight, (Kelly Price), ((all))]\n((If he don't love you right))\n((Don't waste your time))\n(Don't waste your time)\n((If he don't treat you like he should))\n((Then you should be mine))\n(You should be mine)\n((If he don't love you right))\n((Don't waste your time)) don't waste your time\n(Don't waste your time)\n((If he don't treat you like he should))\n((Then you should be mine))Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 27, "api_path": "/songs/30663", "artist_names": "Master P (Ft.

for lettin' me open my eyes\nIt's a whole new game for me like T-Lee\nIt's nine-seven now and I'ma stay sucka free\nThinkin' about all my homeboys behind bars\nAs I crease up my khakis and lace up my stars\nAnd everythang is straight I'm in the full zone\nGettin' paper every day, it's all I'm trippin' on\n'Cause ain't nothin' like a rag in Californ-i-a\nWith the top back, rollin' on a hot sunny day\nIt's one-oh, fo'-sho', and I'm clownin' all the rookies\nWith a pocket full of cookies\nAnd mashi'n to the backyard boogie\n[Ice Cube]\nGet yo' boogie on [repeat 3X]\n\nChorus:\n\nAnd then we comin' wit that\nBackyard boogie oogie oogie (yeah)\nBackyard boogie oogie oogie (it's all about that)\nBackyard boogie oogie oogie (unh)\nBackyard boogie oogie oogie (it's the backyard boogie) [repeat 3X]\nBackyard boogie oogie oogie [repeat 2X]\n\nVerse Two:\nNow just throw yo hands up high in the sky\nRepresentin' where you from cause it's West till I die\nPut it down anywhere, take thangs for what they worth\nBeen a rider since birth, and the earth is my turf\nSo I bails in the party, everythang is cool\nIt's niggas in the hood I ain't seen since high school\nAnd everybody gots stripes cause we all paid dues\nCrips, Damus, and other clicks and crews\nJust gettin' they boogie on, hoochie bitches gettin' loose\nIt kinda remind me of the truce in nine-deuce\nI'm even kickin' back, and I'm usually chicken hawkin\nThe Bloods shootin' dice, and the Crips are C-walkin\nNow the party is jumpin', and the crowd's gettin' bigger\nLooked up and saw four hoes to every nigga\nAnd it's off the hook, got ya grindin' and humpin'\n'Cause the backyard boogie be bumpin'\nYou might also like(Unh, straight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good\nYou can put that on yo' hood, everyday\nAnd we comin with that)\n\nChorus\n\nVerse Three\n\nNow it's out of control, and everywhere you look\nAin't nothin' but real niggas, the bustas got shook\nAnd everybody left with the whole hustla bang\nAnd Daisy Dukes and khakis do seem to be the thang\nYou choose or you lose while you conversatin'\nEnough cock to go around, so ain't no playa hatin'\nI want homegirl over there in red\nCause Baby Got Backs like Mix-a-Lot said\nWhen I keep my composure, kick back like a pro\nCause Mack one-oh just refuse to save a ho\nBut it's a done deal, locked up throw away the key\n'Cause she gonna leave a backyard boogie with me\n\n[Ice Cube]\n(Get yo' boogie on, yeah\nGet yo' boogie on, Inglewood\nGet yo' boogie on, Inglewood, pause\nGet yo' backyard boogie on)\nOutro-Chorus\n\nStraight from Inglewood, and you know that it's all good\nYou can put that on yo' hood, everyday\nMackness, mackness, unh!\nGet yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on\nGet yo' boogie on, nigga get yo' boogie on\nGet yo' boogie on, get yo' boogie on baby, pause\nGet yo' backyard boogie on\nGangstas don't dance we boogie\nNiggas run out and get yo' cookies\nGangstas don't dance we boogie\nMack 10 ain't no motherfucker rookie\nBackyard boogie oogie oofie [repeat 8X]2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/113119", "artist_names": "Daft Punk",

like gay niggas in butt\nI'm Black with Indian, my race should be mutt\nI cut with razor blades, play spades with Aunt Venus\nEvaluate this rap, take heed a fuckin' genius\nUp in the sky, up high don't puff lye\nDo you smoke crack Sam, prepare to fuckin' die\nFuck Crazy Joe, my name is Crazy Flow\nYou thought I had eight but I got ten more\nOff beat and on beat, old school like Beat Street\nI stink like Pop's feet, make sweat with no heat\n[Verse 2: Timbaland]\nI'm up on this track, like Pam Grier in movies\nI heats up the beat, like water in a jacuzzi\nI fly to L.A., then come back to Virginia\nThen call Maganoo to see if he's got some indo\nThen back to the crib to pick up my brother, G\nG don't forget to bring the house keys\nHops in the eight, five-oh now here we go\nPlease, please brother don't slam my car door\nIt costs too much money to get that shit fixed\nI need all my money to pay my bills with\nDon't have no time for the shucking and jiving\nPeep my rhyme cause that shit's off-timing\n\n[Verse 3: Missy Elliott]\nI'm in the Marriott, the place to get got\nAfter I smoke pot, he sticks me like shots\nFunky like farts, connect tongues like dots\nLick his

Powers and Laws of Thought\n\nI HAVE used such opportunity as I have had, and lately in London and Paris, to attend scientific lectures; and in listening to Richard Owen's masterly enumeration of the parts and laws of the human body, or Michael Faraday's explanation of magnetic powers, or the botanist's descriptions, one could not help admiring the irresponsible security and happiness of the attitude of the naturalist; sure of admiration for his facts, sure of their sufficiency. They ought to interest you; if they do not, the fault lies with you.        Then I thought - could not a similar enumeration be made of the laws and powers of the Intellect, and possess the same claims on the student? Could we have, that is, the exhaustive accuracy of distribution which chemists use in their nomenclature and anatomists in their descriptions, applied to a higher class of facts; to those laws, namely, which are common to chemistry, anatomy, astronomy geometry, intellect, morals, and social life ; - laws of the world ? Why not? These powers and laws are also facts in a Natural History. They also are objects of science, and may be numbered and recorded, like stamens and vertebrae. At the same time they have a deeper interest, as in the order of nature they lie higher and are nearer to the mysterious seat of power and creation.       For at last, it is only that exceeding and universal part which interests us, when we shall read in a true history what befalls in that kingdom where a thousand years is as one day, and see that what is set down is true through all the sciences; in the laws of thought as well as of chemistry.     In all sciences the student is discovering that nature, as he calls it, is always working, in wholes and in every detail, after the laws of the human mind. Every creation, in parts or in particles, is on the method and by the means which our mind approves as soon as it is thoroughly acquainted with the facts; hence the delight. No matter how far or how high science explores, it adopts the method of the universe as fast as it appears; and this discloses that the mind as it opens, the mind as it shall be, comprehends and works thus ; that is to say, the Intellect builds the universe and is the key to all it contains. It is not then cities or mountains, or animals, or globes that any longer command us, but only man ; not the fact but so much of man as is in the fact.\n\nIn astronomy, vast distance, but we never go into a foreign system. In geology, vast duration, but we are never strangers. Our metaphysic should be able to follow the flying force through all transformations, and name the pair identical through all variety.      I believe in the existence of the material world as the expression of the spiritual or the real, and in the impenetrable mystery which hides  (and hides through absolute transparency)  the mental nature, I await the insight which our advancing knowledge of material laws shall furnish.      Every object in nature is a word to signify some fact in the mind. But when that fact is not yet put into English words, when I look at the tree or the river and have not yet definitely made out what they would say to me, they are by no means unimpressive. I wait for them, I enjoy them be-fore they yet speak. I feel as if I stood by an ambassador charged with the message of his king, which he does not deliver because the hour when he should say it is not yet arrived.\n\nWhilst we converse with truths as thoughts, they exist also as plastic forces; as the soul of a man, the soul of a plant, the genius or constitution of any part of nature, which makes it what it is. The thought which was in the world, part and parcel of the world, has disengaged itself and taken an independent existence.\n\nMy belief in the use of a course on philosophy is that the student shall learn to appreciate the miracle of the mind; shall learn its subtle but immense power, or shall begin to learn it; shall come to know that in seeing and in no tradition he must find what truth is; that he shall see in it the source of all traditions, and shall see each one of them as better or worse statement of its revelations; shall come to trust it entirely, as the only true; to cleave to God against the name of God. When he has once known the oracle he will need no priest. And if he finds at first with some alarm how impossible it is to accept many things that the hot or the mild sectarian may insist on his believing, he will be armed by his insight and brave to meet all inconvenience and all resistance it may cost him. He from whose hand it came will guide and direct it.\n\nYet these questions that really interest men, how few can answer. Here are learned faculties of law and divinity, but would questions like these come into mind when I see them? Here are learned academies and universities, yet they have not propounded these for any prize.\nSeek the literary circles, the stars of fame, the men of splendor, of bon-mots, will they afford me satisfaction? I think you could not find a club of men acute and liberal enough in the world. Bring the best wits together, and they are so impatient of each other, so vulgar, there is so much more than their wit, - such follies, gluttonies, partialities, age, care, and sleep, that you shall have no academy.\n\nThere is really a grievous amount of unavailableness about men of wit. A plain man finds them so heavy, dull and oppressive, with bad jokes and conceit and stupefying individualism, that he comes to write in his tablets, Avoid the great man as one who is privileged to be an unprofitable companion. For the course of things makes the scholars either egotists or worldly and jocose. In so many hundreds of superior men hardly ten or five or two from whom one can hope for a reasonable word.\n\nGo into the scientific; club and hearken. Each savant proves in his admirable discourse that he and he only knows now or ever did know anything on the subject: \" Does the gentleman speak of anatomy? Who peeped into a box at the Custom House and then published a drawing of my rat ? \" Or is it pretended discoveries of new strata that are before the meeting? This professor hastens to inform us that he knew it all twenty years ago, and is ready to prove that he knew so much then that all further investigation was quite superfluous; - and poor nature and the sublime law, which is all that our student cares to hear of, are quite omitted in this triumphant vindication.\n\nWas it better when we came to the philosophers, who found everybody wrong; acute and ingenious to lampoon and degrade mankind? And then was there ever prophet burdened with a message to his people who did not cloud our gratitude by a strange confounding in his own mind of private folly with his public wisdom?\n\nBut if you like to run away from this besetting sin of sedentary men, you can escape all this insane egotism by running into society, where the manners and estimate of the world have corrected this folly, and effectually suppressed this overweening self-conceit. Here each is to make room for others, and the solidest merits must exist only for the entertainment of all. We are not in the smallest degree helped. Great is the dazzle, but the gain is small. Here they play the game of conversation, as they play billiards, for pastime and credit.\n\nYes,'t is a great vice in all countries, the sacrifice of scholars to be courtiers and diners-out, to talk for the amusement of those who wish to be amused, though the stars of heaven must be plucked down and packed into rockets to this end. What with egotism on one side and levity on the other we shall have no Olympus.\n\nBut there is still another hindrance, namely, practicality. We must have a special talent, and bring something to pass. Ever since the Norse heaven made the stern terms of admission that a man must do something excellent with his hands or feet, or with his voice, eyes, ears, or with his whole body, the same demand has been made in Norse earth.\n\nYet what we really want is not a haste to act, but a certain piety toward the source of action and knowledge. In fact we have to say that there is a certain beatitude, - I can call it nothing less, - to which all men are entitled, tasted by them in different degrees, which is a perfection of their nature, and to which their entrance must be in every way forwarded. Practical men, though they could lift the globe, cannot arrive at this. Something very different has to be done, - the availing our-selves of every impulse of genius, an emanation of the heaven it tells of, and the resisting this conspiracy of men and material things against the sanitary and legitimate inspirations of the intellectual nature.\n\nWhat is life but the angle of vision? A man is measured by the angle at which he looks at objects. What is life but what a man is thinking of all day? This is his fate and his employer. Knowing is the measure of the man. By how much we know, so much we are.     The laws and powers of the Intellect have, however, a stupendous peculiarity, of being at once observers and observed. So that it is difficult to hold them fast, as objects of examination, or hinder them from turning the professor out of his chair. The wonder of the science of Intellect is that the sub-stance with which we deal is of that subtle and active quality that it intoxicates all who approach it. Gloves on the hands, glass guards over the eyes, wire-gauze masks over the face, volatile salts in the \"nostrils, are no defence against this virus, which comes in as secretly as gravitation into and through all barriers.     Let me have your attention to this dangerous subject, which we will cautiously approach on different sides of this dim and perilous lake, so attractive, so delusive. We have had so many guides and so many failures. And now the world is still uncertain whether the pool has been sounded or not.     My contribution will be simply historical. I write anecdotes of the intellect; a sort of Farmer's Almanac of mental moods. I confine my ambition to true reporting of its play in natural action, though I should get only one new fact in a year.      I cannot myself use that systematic form which is reckoned essential in treating the science of the mind. But if one can say so without arrogance, I might suggest that he who contents himself with dotting a fragmentary curve, recording only what facts he has observed, without attempting to arrange them within one outline, follows a system also, - a system as grand as any other, though he does not interfere with its vast curves by prematurely forcing them into a circle or ellipse, but only draws that arc which he clearly sees, or perhaps at a later observation a remote curve of the same orbit, and waits for a new opportunity, well-assured that these observed arcs will consist with each other.\n\nI confess to a little distrust of that completeness of system which metaphysicians are apt to affect. 'T is the gnat grasping the world. All these exhaustive theories appear indeed a false and vain attempt to introvert and analyze the Primal Thought. That is up-stream, and what a stream! Can you swim up Niagara Falls?     We have invincible repugnance to introversion, to study of the eyes instead of that which the eyes see; and the belief of men is that the attempt is unnatural and is punished by loss of faculty. I share the belief that the natural direction of the intellectual powers is from within outward, and that just in proportion to the activity of thoughts on the study of outward objects, as architecture, or farming, or natural history, ships, animals, chemistry, - in that proportion the faculties of the mind had a healthy growth ; but a study in the opposite direction had a damaging effect on the mind.     Metaphysic is dangerous as a single pursuit. We should feel more confidence in the same results from the mouth of a man of the world. The in-ward analysis must be corrected by rough experience. Metaphysics must be perpetually reinforced by life; must be the observations of a working-man on working-men; must be biography, - the record of some law whose working was surprised by the observer in natural action.      I think metaphysics a grammar to which, once read, we seldom return. 'T is a Manila full of pepper, and I want only a teaspoonful in a year. I admire the Dutch, who burned half the harvest to enhance the price of the remainder.    I want not the logic but the power, if any, which it brings into science and literature; the man who can humanize this logic, these syllogisms, and give me the results. The adepts value only the pure geometry, the aerial bridge ascending from earth to heaven with arches and abutments of pure reason. I am fully contented if you tell me where are the two termini.    My metaphysics are to the end of use. I wish to know the laws of this wonderful power, that I may domesticate it. I observe with curiosity its risings and settings, illumination and eclipse; its obstructions and its provocations, that I may learn to live with it wisely, court its aid, catch sight of its splendor, feel its approach, hear and save its oracles and obey them. But this watching of the mind, in season and out of season, to see the mechanics of the thing, is a little of the detective. The analytic process is cold and bereaving and, shall I say it? somewhat mean, as spying. There is something surgical in metaphysics as we treat it. Were not an ode a better form? The poet sees wholes and avoids analysis; the metaphysician, dealing as it were with the mathematics of the mind, puts himself out of the way of the inspiration; loses that which is the miracle and creates the worship.      I think that philosophy is still rude and elementary. It will one day be taught by poets. The poet is in the natural attitude; he is believing; the philosopher, after some struggle, having only reasons for believing.     What I am now to attempt is simply some sketches or studies for such a picture ; Memoires pour servir toward a Natural History of Intellect.\n\nFirst I wish to speak of the excellence of that element, and the great auguries that come from it, notwithstanding the impediments which our sensual civilization puts in the way.\n\nNext I treat of the identity of the thought with Nature; and I add a rude list of some by-laws of the mind.\n\nThirdly I proceed to the fountains of thought in Instinct and Inspiration, and I also attempt to show the relation of men of thought to the existing religion and civility of the present time.\nI. We figure to ourselves Intellect as an ethereal sea, which ebbs and flows, which surges and washes hither and thither, carrying its whole virtue into every creek and inlet which it bathes. To this sea every human house has a water front. But this force, creating nature, visiting whom it will and withdrawing from whom it will, making day where it comes and leaving night when it departs, is no fee or property of man or angel. It is as the light, public and entire to each, and on the same terms.\n\nWhat but thought deepens life, and makes us better than cow or cat? The grandeur of the impression the stars and heavenly bodies make on us is surely more valuable than our exact perception of a tub or a table on the ground.\n\nTo Be is the unsolved, unsolvable wonder. To Be, in its two connections of inward and outward, the mind and nature. The wonder subsists, and age, though of eternity, could not approach a solution. But the suggestion is always returning, that hidden source publishing at once our being and that it is the source of outward nature. Who are we and what is Nature have one answer in the life that rushes into us.\n\nIn my thought I seem to stand on the bank of a river and watch the endless flow of the stream, floating objects of all shapes, colors and natures; nor can I much detain them as they pass, except by running beside them a little way along the bank. But whence they come or whither they go is not told me. Only I have a suspicion that, as geologists say every river makes its own valley, so does this mystic stream. It makes its valley, makes its banks and makes perhaps the observer too. Who has found the boundaries of human intelligence? Who has made a chart of its channel or approached the fountain of this wonderful Nile ?\n\nI am of the oldest religion. Leaving aside the question which was prior, egg or bird, I believe the mind is the creator of the world, and is ever creating ; - that at last Matter is dead Mind ; that mind makes the senses it sees with ; that the genius of man is a continuation of the power that made him and that has not done making him.\n\nI dare not deal with this element in its pure essence. It is too rare for the wings of words. Yet I see that Intellect is a science of degrees, and that as man is conscious of the law of vegetable and animal nature, so he is aware of an Intellect which overhangs his consciousness like a sky, of degree above degree, of heaven within heaven.\n\nEvery just thinker has attempted to indicate these degrees, these steps on the heavenly stair, until he comes to light where language fails him. Above the thought is the higher truth, - truth as yet undomesticated and therefore unformulated.\n\nIt is a steep stair down from the essence of Intellect pure to thoughts and intellections. As the sun is conceived to have made our system by hurling out from itself the outer rings of diffuse ether which slowly condensed into earths and moons, by a higher force of the same law the mind detaches minds, and a mind detaches thoughts or intellections. These again all mimic in their sphericity the first mind, and share its power.\n\nLife is incessant parturition. There are viviparous and oviparous minds; minds that produce their thoughts complete men, like armed soldiers, ready and swift to go out to resist and conquer all the armies of error, and others that deposit their dangerous unripe thoughts here and there to he still for a time and be brooded in other minds, and the shell not be broken until the next age, for them to begin, as new individuals, their career.\n\nThe perceptions of a soul, its wondrous progeny, are born by the conversation, the marriage of souls ; so nourished, so enlarged. They are detached from their parent, they pass into other minds; ripened and unfolded by many they hasten to incarnate themselves in action, to take body, only to carry forward the will which sent them out. They take to themselves wood and stone and iron; ships and cities and nations and armies of men and ages of duration; the pomps of religion, the armaments of war, the codes and heraldry of states; agriculture, trade, commerce; - these are the ponderous instrumentalities into which the nimble thoughts pass, and which they animate and alter, and presently, antagonized by other thoughts which they first aroused, or by thoughts which are sons and daughters of these, the thought buries it-self in the new thought of larger scope, whilst the old instrumentalities and incarnations are decomposed and recomposed into new.     Our eating, trading, marrying, and learning are mistaken by us for ends and realities, whilst they are properly symbols only ; when we have come, by a divine leading, into the inner firmament, we are apprised of the unreality or representative character of what we esteemed final.     So works the poor little blockhead manikin. He must arrange and dignify his shop or farm the best he can. At last he must be able to tell you it, or write it, translate it all clumsily enough into the new sky-language he calls thought. He cannot help it, the irresistible meliorations bear him forward.    II. Whilst we consider this appetite of the mind to arrange its phenomena, there is another fact which makes this useful. There is in nature a parallel unity which corresponds to the unity in the mind and makes it available. This methodizing mind meets no resistance in its attempts. The scattered blocks, with which it strives to form a symmetrical structure, fit. This design following after finds with joy that like design went before. Not only man puts things in a row, but things belong in a row.     It is certain that however we may conceive of the wonderful little bricks of which the world is builded, we must suppose a similarity and fitting and identity in their frame. It is necessary to suppose that every hose in nature fits every hydrant; so only is combination, chemistry, vegetation, animation, intellection possible. Without identity at base, chaos must be forever.     And as mind, our mind or mind like ours reappears to us in our study of nature, nature being everywhere formed after a method which we can well understand, and all the parts, to the most remote, allied or explicable, - therefore our own organization is a perpetual key, and a well-ordered mind brings to the study of every new fact or class of facts a certain divination of that which it shall find.      This reduction to a few laws, to one law, is not a choice of the individual, it is the tyrannical instinct of the mind. There is no solitary flower and no solitary thought. It comes single like a foreign traveller, - but find out its name and it is related to a powerful and numerous family. Wonderful is their working and relation each to each. We hold them as lanterns to light each other and our present design. Every new thought modifies, interprets old problems. The retrospective value of each new thought is immense, like a torch applied to a long train of gunpowder. To be isolated is to be sick, and in so far, dead. The life of the All must stream through us to make the man and the moment great.      Well, having accepted this law of identity pervading the universe, we next perceive that whilst every creature represents and obeys it, there is diversity, there is more or less of power; that the lowest only means incipient form, and over it is a higher class in which its rudiments are opened, raised to higher powers; that there is development from less to more, from lower to superior function, steadily ascending to man.\n\nIf man has organs for breathing, for sight, for locomotion, for taking food, for digesting, for protection by house-building, by attack and defence, for reproduction and love and care of his young, you shall find all the same in the muskrat. There is a perfect correspondence; or 't is only man modified to live in a mud-bank. A fish in like manner is man furnished to live in the sea; a thrush, to fly in the air; and a mollusk is a cheap edition with a suppression of the costlier illustrations, designed for dingy circulation, for shelving in an oyster-bank or among the sea-weed.\n\nIf we go through the British Museum or the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, or any cabinet where is some representation of all the kingdoms of nature, we are surprised with occult sympathies; we feel as if looking at our own bone and flesh through coloring and distorting glasses. Is it not a little startling to see with what genius some people take to hunting, with what genius some people fish, - what knowledge they still have of the creature they hunt? The robber, as the police-reports say, must have been intimately acquainted with the premises. How lately the hunter was the poor creature's organic enemy; a presumption inflamed, as the lawyers say, by observing how many faces in the street still remind us of visages in the forest, - the escape from the quadruped type not yet perfectly accomplished.\n\nFrom whatever side we look at Nature we seem to be exploring the figure of a disguised man. How obvious is the momentum in our mental history! The momentum, which increases by exact laws in falling bodies, increases by the same rate in the intellectual action. Every scholar knows that he applies himself coldly and slowly at first to his task, but, with the progress of the work, the mind itself becomes heated, and sees far and wide as it approaches the end, so that it is the common remark of the student, Could I only have begun with the same fire which I had on the last day, I should have done something.\nThe affinity of particles accurately translates the affinity of thoughts, and what a modern experimenter calls \" the contagious influence of chemical action \" is so true of mind that I have only to read the law that its application may be evident : \" A body in the act of combination or decomposition enables another body, with which it may be in contact, to enter into the same state.\" And if one remembers how contagious are the moral states of men, how much we are braced by the presence and actions of any Spartan soul; it does not need vigor of our own kind, but the spectacle of vigor of any kind, any prodigious power of performance wonderfully arms and recruits us. There are those who disputing will make you dispute, and the nervous and hysterical and animalized will pro-duce a like series of symptoms in you, though no other persons ever evoke the like phenomena, and though you are conscious that they do not properly belong to you, but are a sort of extension of the diseases of this particular person into you.\n\nThe idea of vegetation is irresistible in considering mental activity. Man seems a higher plant. What happens here in mankind is matched by what happens out there in the history of grass and wheat. This curious resemblance repeats, in the mental function, the germination, growth, state of melioration, crossings, blight, parasites, and in short all the accidents of the plant. Under every leaf is the bud of a new leaf, and not less under every thought is a newer thought. The plant absorbs much nourishment from the ground in order to repair its own waste by exhalation, and keep itself good. Increase its food and it becomes fertile. The mind is first only receptive. Surcharge it with thoughts in which it delights and it becomes active. The moment a man begins not to be convinced, that moment he begins to convince.\n\nIn the orchard many trees send out a moderate shoot in the first summer heat, and stop. They look all summer as if they would presently burst into bud again, but they do not. The fine tree continues to grow. The same thing happens in the man. Every man has material enough in his experience to exhaust the sagacity of Newton in working it out. We have more than we use. I never hear a good speech at caucus or at cattle-show but it helps me, not so much by adding to my knowledge as by apprising me of admirable uses to which what I know can be turned. The commonest remark, if the man could only extend it a little, would make him a genius; but the thought is prematurely checked, and grows no more. All great masters are chiefly distinguished by the power of adding a second, a third, and perhaps a fourth step in a continuous line. Many a man had taken their first step. With every additional step you enhance immensely the value of your first.\n\nThe botanist discovered long ago that Nature loves mixtures, and that nothing grows well on the crab-stock, but the blood of two trees being mixed a new and excellent fruit is produced. And not less in human history aboriginal races are in-capable of improvement; the dull, melancholy Pelasgi arrive at no civility until the Phoenicians and Ionians come in. The Briton, the Pict, is nothing until the Roman, the Saxon, the Norman, arrives.\n\nIt is observed that our mental processes go for-ward even when they seem suspended. Scholars say that if they return to the study of a new language after some intermission, the intelligence of it is more and not less. A subject of thought to which we return from month to month, from year to year, has always some ripeness of which we can give no account. We say the book grew in the author's mind.\n\nIn unfit company the finest powers are paralyzed. No ambition, no opposition, no friendly attention and fostering kindness, no wine, music or exhilarating aids, neither warm fireside nor fresh air, walking or riding, avail at all to resist the palsy of mis-association. Genius is mute, is dull ; there is no genius. Ask of your flowers to open when you have let in on them a freezing wind.\n\nThe mechanical laws might as easily be shown pervading the kingdom of mind as the vegetative. A man has been in Spain. The facts and thoughts which the traveller has found in that country gradually settle themselves into a determinate heap of one size and form and not another. That is what he knows and has to say of Spain; he cannot say it truly until a sufficient time for the arrangement of the particles has elapsed.\n\nThese views of the source of thought and the mode of its communication lead us to a whole system of ethics, strict as any department of human duty, and open to us the tendencies and duties of men of thought in the present time.\n\nWisdom is like electricity. There is no permanent wise man, but men capable of wisdom, who being put into certain company or other favorable conditions become wise, as glasses rubbed acquire power for a time.\n\nAn individual body is the momentary arrest or fixation of certain atoms, which, after performing compulsory duty to this enchanted statue, are re-leased again to flow in the currents of the world. An individual mind in like manner is a fixation or momentary eddy in which certain services and powers are taken up and minister in petty niches and localities, and then, being released, return to the unbounded soul of the world.\n\nIn this eternal resurrection and rehabilitation of transitory persons, who and what are they ? 'T is only the source that we can see; - the eternal mind, careless of its channels, omnipotent in it-self, and continually ejaculating its torrent into every artery and vein and veinlet of humanity. Wherever there is health, that is, consent to the cause and constitution of the universe, there is perception and power.\n\nEach man is a new power in Nature. He holds the keys of the world in his hands. No quality in Nature's vast magazines he cannot touch, no truth he cannot see. Silent, passive, even sulkily Nature offers every morning her wealth to man. She is immensely rich; he is welcome to her entire goods, but she speaks no word, will not so much as beckon or cough; only this, she is careful to leave all her doors ajar, - towers, hall, storeroom and cellar. If he takes her hint and uses her goods she speaks no word; if he blunders and starves she says no-thing. To the idle blockhead Nature is poor, sterile, inhospitable. To the gardener her loam is all strawberries, pears, pineapples. To the miller her rivers whirl the wheel and weave carpets and broad-cloth. To the sculptor her stone is soft; to the painter her plumbago and marl are pencils and chromes. To the poet all sounds and words are melodies and rhythms. In her hundred-gated Thebes every chamber is a new door.\n\nBut he enters the world by one key. Herein is the wealth of each. His equipment, though new, is complete; his prudence is his own; his courage, his charity, are his own. He has his own defences and his own fangs; his perception and his own mode of reply to sophistries. Whilst he draws on his own he cannot be overshadowed or supplanted.\n\nThere are two mischievous superstitions, I know not which does the most harm, one, that \" I am wiser than you,\" and the other that \" You are wiser than I.\" The truth is that every man is furnished, if he will heed it, with wisdom necessary to steer his own boat, - if he will not look away from his own to see how his neighbor steers his.\n\nEvery man is a new method and distributes things anew. If he could attain full size he would take up, first or last, atom by atom, all the world into a new form. And our deep conviction of the riches proper to every mind does not allow us to admit of much looking over into one another's virtues. Let me whisper a secret; nobody ever for-gives any admiration in you of them, any overestimate of what they do or have. I acquiesce to be that I am, but I wish no one to be civil to me.\n\nStrong men understand this very well. Power fraternizes with power, and wishes you not to be like him but like yourself. Echo the leaders and they will fast enough see that you have nothing for them. They came to you for something they had not.\n\nThere is always a loss of truth and power when a man leaves working for himself to work for another. Absolutely speaking I can only work for myself. All my good is magnetic, and I educate not by lessons but by going about my business. When, moved by love, a man teaches his child or joins with his neighbor in any act of common benefit, or spends himself for his friend, or rushes at immense personal sacrifice on some public, self-immolating act, it is not done for others, but to fulfil a high necessity of his proper character. The benefit to others is contingent and not contemplated by the doer.\n\nThe one thing not to be forgiven to intellectual persons is that they believe in the ideas of others. From this deference comes the imbecility and fatigue of their society, for of course they cannot affirm these from the deep life; they say what they would have you believe, but what they do not quite know. Profound sincerity is the only basis of talent as of character. The temptation is to patronize Providence, to fall into the accepted ways of talking and acting of the good sort of people.\n\nEach has a certain aptitude for knowing or doing somewhat which, when it appears, is so adapted and aimed on that, that it seems a sort of obtuseness to everything else. Well, this aptitude, if he would obey it, would prove a telescope to bring under his clear vision what was blur to everybody else. 'T is a wonderful instrument, an organic sympathy with the whole frame of things. There is no property or relation in that immense arsenal of forces which the earth is, but some man is at last found who affects this, delights to unfold and work it, as if he were the born publisher and demonstrator of it.      As a dog has a sense that you have not, to find the track of his master or of a fox, and as each tree can secrete from the soil the elements that form a peach, a lemon, or a cocoa-nut, according to its kind, so individual men have secret senses, each some incommunicable sagacity. And men are primary or secondary as their opinions and actions are organic or not.      I know well what a sieve every ear is. Teach me never so much and I bear or retain only that which I wish to hear, what comports with my experience and my desire. Many eyes go through the meadow, but few see the flowers. A hunter finds plenty of game on the ground you have sauntered over with idle gun. White huckleberries are so rare that in miles of pasture you: shall not find a dozen. But a girl who understands it will find you a pint in a quarter of an hour.      Though the world is full of food we can take only the crumbs fit for us. The air rings with sounds, but only a few vibrations can reach our tympanum. Perhaps creatures live with us which we never see, because their motion is too swift for our vision. The sun may shine, or a galaxy of suns; you will get no more light than your eye will hold. What can Plato or Newton teach, if you are deaf or incapable? A mind does not receive truth as a chest receives jewels that are put into it, but as the stomach takes up food into the system. It is no longer food, but flesh, and is assimilated. The appetite and the power of digestion measure our right to knowledge. He has it who can use it. As soon as our accumulation overruns our invention or power to use, the evils of intellectual gluttony begin, - congestion of the brain, apoplexy and strangulation.\n\nIII. In reckoning the sources of our mental power it were fatal to omit that one which pours all the others into its mould; - that unknown country in which all the rivers of our knowledge have their fountains, and which, by its qualities and structure, determines both the nature of the waters and the direction in which they flow.\n\nThe healthy mind lies parallel to the currents of nature and sees things in place, or makes discoveries. Newton did not exercise more ingenuity but less than another to see the world. Right thought comes spontaneously, comes like the morning wind ; comes daily, like our daily bread, to humble service ; comes duly to those who look for it. It does not need to pump your brains and force thought to think rightly. 0 no, the ingenious person is warped by his ingenuity and mis-sees.\n\nInstinct is our name for the potential wit. Each man has a feeling that what is done anywhere is done by the same wit as his. All men are his representatives, and he is glad to see that his wit can work at this or that problem as it ought to be done, and better than he could do it. We feel as if one man wrote all the books, painted, built, in dark ages ; and we are sure that it can do more than ever was done. It was the same mind that built the world. That is Instinct.\n\nAsk what the Instinct declares, and we have little to say. He is no newsmonger, no disputant, no talker. 'T is a taper, a spark in the great night. Yet a spark at which all the illuminations of human arts and sciences were kindled. This is that glimpse of inextinguishable light by which men are guided; though it does not show objects, yet it shows the way. This is that sense by which men feel when they are wronged, though they do not see how. This is that source of thought and feeling which acts on masses of men, on all men at certain times, with resistless power. Ever at intervals leaps a word or fact to light which is no man's invention, but the common instinct, making the revolutions that never go back.\n\nThis is Instinct, and Inspiration is only this power excited, breaking its silence; the spark bursting into flame.\n\nInstinct is a shapeless giant in the cave, massive, without hands or fingers or articulating lips or teeth or tongue; Behemoth, disdaining speech, disdaining particulars, lurking, surly, invincible, disdaining thoughts, always whole, never distributed, aboriginal, old as nature, and saying, like poor Topsy, \"never was born, growed.\" Indifferent to the dignity of its function, it plays the god in animal nature as in human or as in the angelic, and spends its omniscience on the lowest wants. The old Hindoo Gautama says, \"Like the approach of the iron to the loadstone is the approach of the new-born child to the breast.\" There is somewhat awful in that first approach.      The Instinct begins at this low point, at the surface of the earth, and works for the necessities of the human being; then ascends step by step to suggestions which are when expressed the intellectual and moral laws.        The mythology cleaves close to nature; and what else was it they represented in Pan, god of shepherds, who was not yet completely finished in god-like form, blocked rather, and wanting the extremities ; had emblematic horns and feet ? Pan, that is, All. His habit was to dwell in mountains, lying on the ground, tooting like a cricket in the sun, refusing to speak, clinging to his behemoth ways. He could intoxicate by the strain of his shepherd's pipe, - silent yet to most, for his pipes make the music of the spheres, which because it sounds eternally is not heard at all by the dull, but only by the mind. He wears a coat of leopard spots or stars. He could terrify by earth-born fears called panics. Yet was he in the secret of nature and could look both before and after. He was only seen under disguises, and was not represented by any outward image; a terror sometimes, at others a placid omnipotence.      Such homage did the Greek, delighting in accurate form, not fond of the extravagant and unbounded, pay to the inscrutable force we call Instinct, or nature when it first becomes intelligent.       The action of the Instinct is for the most part negative, regulative, rather than initiative or impulsive. But it has a range as wide as human nature, running over all the ground of morals, of intellect, and of sense. In its lower function, when it deals with the apparent world, it is common-sense. It requires the performance of all that is needful to the animal life and health. Then it re-quires a proportion between a man's acts and his condition, requires all that is called humanity ; that symmetry and connection which is imperative in all healthily constituted men, and the want of which the rare and brilliant sallies of irregular genius cannot excuse.\n\nIf we could retain our early innocence we might trust our feet uncommanded to take the right path to our friend in the woods. But we have interfered too often; the feet have lost, by our distrust, their proper virtue, and we take the wrong path and miss him. 'T is the barbarian instinct within us which culture deadens.\n\nWe find ourselves expressed in nature, but we cannot translate it into words. But Perception is the armed eye. A civilization has tamed and ripened this savage wit, and he is a Greek. His Aye and No have become nouns and verbs and adverbs. Perception differs from Instinct by adding the Will. Simple percipiency is the virtue of space, not of man.\n\nThe senses minister to a mind they do not know. At a moment in our history the mind's eye opens and we become aware of spiritual facts, of rights, of duties, of thoughts, - a thousand faces of one essence. We call the essence Truth; the particular aspects of it we call thoughts. These facts, this essence, are not new; they are old and eternal, but our seeing of them is new. Having seen them we are no longer brute lumps whirled by Fate, but we pass into the council-chamber and government of nature. In so far as we see them we share their life and sovereignty.\n\nThe point of interest is here, that these gates, once opened, never swing back. The observers may come at their leisure, and do at last satisfy themselves of the fact. The thought, the doctrine, the right hitherto not affirmed is published in set propositions, in conversation of scholars and philosophers, of men of the world, and at last in the very choruses of songs. The young hear it, and as they have never fought it, never known it other-wise, they accept it, vote for it at the polls, embody it in the laws. And the perception thus satisfied reacts on the senses, to clarify them, so that it becomes more indisputable.\n\nThis is the first property of the Intellect I am to point out; the mind detaches. A man is intellectual in proportion as he can make an object of every sensation, perception and intuition; so long as he has no engagement in any thought or feeling which can hinder him from looking at it as somewhat foreign.\n\nA man of talent has only to name any form or fact with which we are most familiar, and the strong light which he throws on it enhances it to all eyes. People wonder they never saw it before. The detachment consists in seeing it under a new order, not under a personal but under a universal light. To us it had economic, but to the universe it has poetic relations, and it is as good as sun and star now. Indeed this is the measure of all intellectual power among men, the power to complete this detachment, the power of genius to hurl a new individual into the world.\n\nAn intellectual man has the power to go out of himself and see himself as an object ; therefore his defects and delusions interest him as much as his successes. He not only wishes to succeed in life, but he wishes in thought to know the history and destiny of a man; whilst the cloud of egotists drifting about are only interested in a success to their egotism.       The senses report the new fact or change; the mind discovers some essential copula binding this fact or change to a class of facts or changes, and enjoys the discovery as if coming to its own again. A perception is always a generalization. It lifts the object, whether in material or moral nature, into a type. The animal, the low degrees of intellect, know only individuals. The philosopher knows only laws. That is, he considers a purely mental fact, part of the soul itself. We say with Kenelm Digby, \" All things that she knoweth are herself, and she is all that she knoweth.\" Insight assimilates the thing seen. Is it only another way of affirming and illustrating this to say that it sees nothing alone, but sees each particular object in just connections, - sees all in God? In all healthy souls is an inborn necessity of presupposing for each particular fact a prior Being which compels it to a harmony with all other natures. The game of Intellect is the perception that whatever befalls or can be stated is a universal proposition; and contrariwise, that every general statement is poetical again by being particularized or impersonated.    A single thought has no limit to its value; a thought, properly speaking, - that is a truth held not from any man's saying so, or any accidental benefit or recommendation it has in our trade or circumstance, but because we have perceived it is a fact in the nature of things, and in all times and places will and must be the same thing, - is of inestimable value. Every new impression on the mind is not to be derided, but is to be accounted for, and, until accounted for, registered as an in-disputable addition to our catalogue of natural facts.      The first fact is the fate in every mental perception, - that my seeing this or that, and that I see it so or so, is as much a fact in the natural history of the world as is the freezing of water at thirty-two degrees of Fahrenheit. My percipiency affirms the presence and perfection of law, as much as all the martyrs. A perception, it is of a necessity older than the sun and moon, and the Father of the Gods. It is there with all its destinies. It is its nature to rush to expression, to rush to embody itself. It is impatient to put on its sandals and be gone on its errand, which is to lead to a larger perception, and so to new action. For thought exists to be expressed. That which cannot externize itself is not thought.      Do not trifle with your perceptions, or hold them cheap. They are your door to the seven heavens, and if you pass it by you will miss your way: Say, what impresses me ought to impress me. I am bewildered by the immense variety of attractions and cannot take a step ; but this one thread, fine as gossamer, is yet real; and I hear a whisper, which I dare trust, that it is the thread on which the earth and the heaven of heavens are strung.     The universe is traversed by paths or bridges or stepping-stones across the gulfs of space in every direction. To every soul that is created is its path, invisible to all but itself. Each soul, there-fore, walking in its own path walks firmly; and to the astonishment of all other souls, who see not its path, it goes as softly and playfully on its way as if, instead of being a line, narrow as the edge of a sword, over terrific pits right and left, it were a wide prairie.     Genius is a delicate sensibility to the laws of the world, adding the power to express them again in some new form. The highest measure of poetic power is such insight and faculty to fuse the circumstances of to-day as shall make transparent the whole web of circumstance and opinion in which the man finds himself, so that he releases himself from the traditions in which he grew, - no longer looks back to Hebrew or Greek or English use or tradition in religion, laws, or life, but sees so truly the omnipresence of eternal cause that he can convert the daily and hourly event of New York, of Boston, into universal symbols. I owe to genius always the same debt, of lifting the curtain from the common and showing me that gods are sitting disguised in every company.     The conduct of Intellect must respect nothing so much as preserving the sensibility. My measure for all subjects of science as of events is their impression on the soul. That mind is best which is most impressionable. There are times when the cawing of a crow, a weed, a snow-flake, a boy's willow whistle, or a farmer planting in his field is more suggestive to the mind than the Yosemite gorge or the Vatican would be in another hour. In like mood an old verse, or certain words, gleam with rare significance.     But sensibility does not exhaust our idea of it. That is only half. Genius is not a lazy angel contemplating itself and things. It is insatiable for expression. Thought must take the stupendous step of passing into realization. A master can formulate his thought. Our thoughts at first possess us. Later, if we have good heads, we come to possess them. We believe that certain persons add to the common vision a certain degree of control over these states of mind; that the true scholar is one who has the power to stand beside his thoughts or to hold off his thoughts at arm's length and give them perspective.\n\nIt is not to be concealed that the gods have guarded this privilege with costly penalty. This slight discontinuity which perception effects between the mind and the object paralyzes the will. If you cut or break in two a block or stone and press the two parts closely together, you can indeed bring the particles very near, but never again so near that they shall attract each other so that you can take up the block as one. That indescribably small interval is as good as a thousand miles, and has forever severed the practical unity. Such is the immense deduction from power by discontinuity.\n\nThe intellect that sees the interval partakes of it, and the fact of intellectual perception severs once for all the man from the things with which he converses. Affection blends, intellect disjoins subject and object. For weal or woe we clear our-selves from the thing we contemplate. We grieve but are not the grief; we love but are not love. If we converse with low things, with crimes, with mischances, we are not compromised. And if with high things, with heroic actions, with virtues, the interval becomes a gulf and we cannot enter into the highest good. Artist natures do not weep. Goethe, the surpassing intellect of modern times, apprehends the spiritual but is not spiritual.\n\nThere is indeed this vice about men of thought, that you cannot quite trust them; not as much as other men of the same natural probity, without intellect ; because they have a hankering to play Providence and make a distinction in favor of themselves from the rules they apply to the human race.\n\nThe primary rule for the conduct of Intellect is to have control of the thoughts without losing their natural attitudes and action. They are the oracle; we are not to poke and drill and force, but to follow them. Yet the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. You must formulate your thought or 't is all sky and no stars. There are men of great apprehension, discursive minds, who easily entertain ideas, but are not exact, severe with themselves, cannot connect or arrange their thoughts so as effectively to report them. A blending of these two - the intellectual perception of truth and the moral sentiment of right - is wisdom. All thought is practical. Wishing is one thing; will another. Wishing is castle-building; the dreaming about things agreeable to the senses, but to which we have no right. Will is the advance to that which rightly belongs to us, to which the inward magnet ever points, and which we dare to make ours. The revelation of thought takes us out of servitude into freedom. So does the sense of right.\n\nWill is the measure of power. To a great genius there must be a great will. If the thought is not a lamp to the will, does not proceed to an act, the wise are imbecile. He alone is strong and happy who has a will. The rest are herds. He uses; they are used. He is of the Maker; they are of the Made.\n\nWill is always miraculous, being the presence of God to men. When it appears in a man he is a hero, and all metaphysics are at fault. Heaven is the exercise of the faculties, the added sense of power.\n\nAll men know the truth, but what of that? It is rare to find one who knows how to speak it. A man tries to speak it and his voice is like the hiss of a snake, or rude and chiding. The truth is not spoken but injured. The same thing happens in power to do the right. His rectitude is ridiculous. His organs do not play him true.      There is a meter which determines the constructive power of man, - this, namely, the question whether the mind possesses the control of its thoughts, or they of it. The new sect stands for certain thoughts. We go to individual members for an exposition of them. Vain expectation. They are possessed by the ideas but do not possess them. One meets contemplative men who dwell in a certain feeling and delight which are intellectual but wholly above their expression. They cannot formulate. They impress those who know them by their loyalty to the truth they worship but cannot impart. Sometimes the patience and love are rewarded by the chamber of power being at last opened; but sometimes they pass away dumb, to find it where all obstruction is removed.      By and by comes a facility ; some one that can move the mountain and build of it a causeway through the Dismal Swamp, as easily as he carries the hair on his head. Talent is habitual facility of execution. We like people who can do things. The various talents are organic, or each related to that part of nature it is to explore and utilize. Somewhat is to come to the light, and one was created to fetch it,- a vessel of honor or of dishonor. 'T is of instant use in the economy of the Cosmos, and the more armed and biassed for the work the better.      Each of these talents is born to be unfolded and set at work for the use and delight of men, and, in the last result, the man with the talent is the need of mankind; the whole ponderous machinery of the state has really for its aim just to place this skill of each.\n\nBut idea and execution are not often entrusted to the same head. There is some incompatibility of good speculation and practice, for example, the failure of monasteries and Brook Farms. To hammer out phalanxes must be done by smiths; as soon as the scholar attempts it he is half a charlatan.\n\nThe grasp is the main thing. Most men's minds do not grasp anything. All slips through their fingers, like the paltry brass grooves that in most country houses are used to raise or drop the curtain, but are made to sell, and will not hold any curtain but cobwebs. I have heard that idiot children are known from their birth by the circumstance that their hands do not close round anything. Webster naturally and always grasps, and therefore retains something from every company and circumstance.\n\nAs a talent Dante's imagination is the nearest to hands and feet that we have seen. He clasps the thought as if it were a tree or a stone, and describes as mathematically. I once found Page the painter modelling his figures in clay, Ruth and Naomi, before he painted them on canvas. Dante, one would say, did the same thing before he wrote the verses.\n\nI have spoken of Intellect constructive. But it is in degrees. How it moves when its pace is accelerated! The pace of Nature is so slow. Why not from strength to strength, from miracle to miracle, and not as now with this retardation - as if Nature bad sprained her foot - and plenteous stopping at little stations?\n\nThe difference is obvious enough in Talent between the speed of one man's action above another's. In debate, in legislature, not less in action; in war or in affairs, alike daring and effective. But I speak of it in quite another sense, namely, in the habitual speed of combination of thought.\n\nThe same functions which are perfect in our quadrupeds are seen slower performed in palaeontology. Many races it cost them to achieve the completion that is now in the life of one. Life had not yet so fierce a glow.  Shakespeare astonishes by his equality in every play, act, scene or line. One would say he must have been a thousand years old when he wrote his first line, so thoroughly is his thought familiar to him, and has such scope and so solidly worded, as if it were already a proverb and not hereafter to become one. Well, that millenium in effect is really only a little acceleration in his process of thought.\n\nBut each power is commonly at the expense of some other. When pace is increased it will happen that the control is in a degree lost. Reason does not keep her firm seat. The Delphian prophetess, when the spirit possesses her, is herself a victim. The excess of individualism, when it is not corrected or subordinated to the Supreme Reason, makes that vice which we stigmatize as monotones, men of one idea, or, as the French say, enfant perdu d'une conviction isol\u00e9e, which give such a comic tinge to all society. Every man has his theory, true, but ridiculously overstated. We are forced to treat a great part of mankind as if they were a little deranged. We detect their mania and humor it, so that conversation soon becomes a tiresome effort.\n\nYou laugh at the monotones, at the men of one idea, but if we look nearly at heroes we may find the same poverty; and perhaps it is not poverty, but power. The secret of power, intellectual or physical, is concentration, and all concentration involves of necessity a certain narrowness. It is a law of nature that he who looks at one thing must turn his eyes from every other thing in the universe. The horse goes better with blinders, and the man for dedication to his task. If you ask what compensation is made for the inevitable narrowness, why, this, that in learning one thing well you learn all things.\n\nImmense is the patience of Nature. You say thought is a penurious rill. Well, we can wait. Nature is immortal, and can wait. Nature having for capital this rill, drop by drop, as it trickles from the rock of ages, - this rill and her patience, - she husbands and hives, she forms reservoirs, were it only a phial or a hair-tube that will hold as it were a drop of attar. Not having enough to sup-port all the powers of a race, she thins her stock and raises a few individuals, or only a pair. Not sufficing to feed all the faculties synchronously, she feeds one faculty and starves all the rest. I am familiar with cases, we meet them daily, wherein the vital force being insufficient for the constitution, everything is neglected that can be spared ; some one power fed, all the rest pine. 'T is like a withered hand or leg on a Hercules. It makes inconvenience in society, for we presume symmetry, and because they know one thing we defer to them in another, and find them really contemptible. We can't make half a bow and say, I honor and despise you. But Nature can; she whistles with all her winds, and does as she pleases.\n\nIt is much to write sentences; it is more to add method and write out the spirit of your life symmetrically. But to arrange general reflections in their natural order, so that I shall have one homogeneous piece, - a Lycidas, an Allegro, a Hamlet, a Midsummer Night's Dream, - this continuity is for the great. The wonderful men are wonderful hereby. Such concentration of experiences is in every great work, which, though successive in the mind of the master, were primarily combined in his piece.\n\nBut what we want is consecutiveness. 'T is with us a flash of light, then a long darkness, then a flash again. Ah! could we turn these fugitive sparkles into an astronomy of Copernican worlds.\n\nI must think this keen sympathy, this thrill of awe with which we watch the performance of genius, a sign of our own readiness to exert the like power. I must think we are entitled to powers far transcending any that we possess ; that we have in the race the sketch of a man which no individual comes up to.\n\nEvery sincere man is right, or, to make him right, only needs a little larger dose of his own personality. Excellent in his own way by means of not apprehending the gift of another. When he speaks out of another's mind, we detect it. He can't make any paint stick but his own. No man passes for that with another which he passes for with himself. The respect and the censure of his brother are alike injurious and irrelevant. We see ourselves; we lack organs to see others, and only squint at them.\n\nDon't fear to push these individualities to their farthest divergence. Characters and talents are complemental and suppletory. The world stands by balanced antagonisms. The more the peculiarities are pressed the better the result. The air would rot without lightning; and without the violence of direction that men have, without bigots, without men of fixed idea, no excitement, no efficiency.\n\nThe novelist should not make any character act absurdly, but only absurdly as seen by others. For it is so in life. Nonsense will not keep its unreason if you come into the humorist's point of view, but unhappily we find it is fast becoming sense, and we must flee again into the distance if we would laugh.\n\nWhat strength belongs to every plant and animal in nature. The tree or the brook has no duplicity, no pretentiousness, no show. It is, with all its might and main, what it is, and makes one and the same impression and effect at all times. All the thoughts of a turtle are turtles, and of a rabbit, rabbits. But a man is broken and dissipated by the giddiness of his will ; he does not throw himself into his judgments ; his genius leads him one way but 't is likely his trade or politics in quite another. He rows with one hand and with the other backs water, and does not give to any manner of life the strength of his constitution. Hence the perpetual loss of power and waste of human life.\n\nThe natural remedy against this miscellany of knowledge and aim, this desultory universality of ours, this immense ground-juniper falling abroad and not gathered up into any columnar tree, is to substitute realism for sentimentalism; a certain recognition of the simple and terrible laws which, seen or unseen, pervade and govern.\n\nYou will say this is quite axiomatic and a little too true. I do not find it an agreed point. Literary men for the most part have a settled despair as to the realization of ideas in their own time. There is in all students a distrust of truth, a timidity about affirming it; a wish to patronize Providence.\n\nWe disown our debt to moral evil. To science there is no poison; to botany no weed ; to chemistry no dirt. The curses of malignity and despair are important criticism, which must be heeded until he can explain and rightly silence them.\n\n\"Croyez moi, l'erreur ausi a son m\u00e9rite,\" said Voltaire. We see those who surmount by dint of egotism or infatuation obstacles from which the prudent recoil. The right partisan is a heady man, who, because he does not see many things, sees some one thing with heat and exaggeration ; and if he falls among other narrow men, or objects which have a brief importance, prefers it to the universe, and seems inspired and a godsend to those who wish to magnify the matter and carry a point. 'T is the difference between progress by railroad and by walking across the broken country. Immense speed, but only in one direction.\n\nThere are two theories of life; one for the demonstration of our talent, the other for the education of the man. One is activity, the busy-body, the following of that practical talent which we have, in the belief that what is so natural, easy and pleasant to us and desirable to others will surely lead us out safely ; in this direction lie usefulness, comfort, society, low power of all sorts. The other is trust, religion, consent to be nothing for eternity, entranced waiting, the worship of ideas. This is solitary, grand, secular. They are in perpetual balance and strife. One is talent, the other genius. One is skill, the other character.\n\nWe are continually tempted to sacrifice genius to talent, the hope and promise of insight to the lust of a freer demonstration of those gifts we have; and we buy this freedom to glitter by the loss of general health.\n\nIt is the levity of this country to forgive every-thing to talent. If a man show cleverness, rhetorical skill, bold front in the forum or the senate, people clap their hands without asking more. We have a juvenile love of smartness, of showy speech. We like faculty that can rapidly be coined into money, and society seems to be in conspiracy to utilize every gift prematurely, and pull down genius to lucrative talent. Every kind of meanness and mischief is forgiven to intellect. All is condoned if I can write a good song or novel.\n\nWide is the gulf between genius and talent. The men we know, poets, wits, writers, deal with their thoughts as jewellers with jewels, which they sell but must not wear. Like the carpenter, who gives up the key of the fine house he has built, and never enters it again.\n\nThere is a conflict between a man's private dexterity or talent and his access to the free air and light which wisdom is; between wisdom and the habit and necessity of repeating itself which be-longs to every mind. Peter is the mould into which everything is poured like warm wax, and be it astronomy or railroads or French revolution or theology or botany, it comes out Peter. But there are quick limits to our interest in the personality of people. They are as much alike as their barns and pantries, and are as soon musty and dreary. They entertain us for a time, but at the second or third encounter we have nothing more to learn.\n\nThe daily history of the Intellect is this alternating of expansions and concentrations. The expansions are the invitations from heaven to try a larger sweep, a higher pitch than we have yet climbed, and to leave all our past for this enlarged scope. Present power, on the other hand, requires concentration on the moment and the thing to be done.\n\nThe condition of sanity is to respect the order of the intellectual world; to keep down talent in its place, to enthrone the instinct. There must be perpetual rallying and self-recovery. Each talent is ambitious and self-asserting; it works for show and for the shop, and the greater it grows the more is the mischief and the misleading, so that presently all is wrong.\n\nNo wonder the children love masks and costumes, and play horse, play soldier, play school, play bear, and delight in theatricals. The children have only the instinct of the universe, in which becoming somewhat else is the perpetual game of nature, and death the penalty of standing still. 'T is not less in thought. I cannot conceive any good in a thought which confines and stagnates. The universe exists only in transit, or we behold it shooting the gulf from the past to the future. We are passing into new heavens in fact by the movement of our solar system, and in thought by our better knowledge. Transition is the attitude of power. A fact is only a fulcrum of the spirit. It is the terminus of a past thought, but only a means now to new sallies of the imagination and new progress of wisdom. The habit of saliency, of not pausing but proceeding, is a sort of importation and domestication of the divine effort into a man. Routine, the rut, is the path of indolence, of cows, of sluggish animal life ; as near gravitation as it can go. But wit sees the short way, puts together what belongs together, custom or no custom; in that is organization.\n\nInspiration is the continuation of the divine effort that built the man. The same course continues itself in the mind which we have witnessed in nature, namely the carrying-on and completion of the metamorphosis from grub to worm, from worm to fly. In human thought this process is often arrested for years and ages. The history of man-kind is the history of arrested growth. This premature stop, I know not how, befalls most of us in early youth; as if the growth of high powers, the access to rare truths, closed at two or three years in the child, while all the pagan faculties went ripening on to sixty.\n\nSo long as you are capable of advance, so long you have not abdicated the hope and future of a divine soul. That wonderful oracle will reply when it is consulted, and there is no history or tradition, no rule of life or art or science, on which it is not a competent and the only competent judge.\n\nMan was made for conflict, not for rest. In action is his power; not in his goals but in his transitions man is great. Instantly he is dwarfed by self-indulgence. The truest state of mind rested in becomes false.\n\nThe spiritual power of man is twofold, mind and heart, Intellect and morals; one respecting truth, the other the will. One is the man, the other the woman in spiritual nature. One is power, the other is love. These elements always coexist in every normal individual, but one predominates. And as each is easily exalted in our thoughts till it serves to fill the universe and become the synonym of God, the soul in which one predominates is ever watchful and jealous when such immense claims are made for one as seem injurious to the other. Ideal and practical, like ecliptic and equator, are never parallel. Each has its vices, its proper dangers, obvious enough when the opposite element is deficient.\n\nIntellect is skeptical, runs down into talent, selfish working for private ends, conceited, ostentatious and malignant. On the other side the clear headed thinker complains of souls led hither and thither by affections which, alone, are blind guides and thriftless workmen, and in the confusion asks the polarity of intellect. But all great minds and all great hearts have mutually allowed the absolute necessity of the twain.\n\nIf the first rule is to obey your genius, in the second place the good mind is known by the choice of what is positive, of what is advancing. We must embrace the affirmative. But the affirmative of affirmatives is love. Quantus amor tantus animus. Strength enters as the moral element enters. Lovers of men are as safe as the sun. Goodwill makes insight. Sensibility is the secret readiness to believe in all kinds of power, and the contempt of any experience we have not is the opposite pole. The measure of mental health is the disposition to find good everywhere, good and order, analogy, health and benefit, - the love of truth, tendency to be in the right, no fighter for victory, no cockerel.\n\nWe have all of us by nature a certain divination and parturient vaticination in our minds of some higher good and perfection than either power or knowledge. Knowledge is plainly to be preferred before power, as being that which guides and directs its blind force and impetus; but Aristotle declares that the origin of reason is not reason but something better.\n\nThe height of culture, the highest behavior, consists in the identification of the Ego with the universe; so that when a man says I hope, I find, I think, he might properly say, The human race thinks or finds or hopes. And meantime he shall be able continually to keep sight of his biographical Ego, - I have a desk, I have an office, I am hungry, I had an ague, - as rhetoric or offset to his grand spiritual Ego, without impertinence, or ever confounding them.     I may well say this is divine, the continuation of the divine effort. Alas! it seems not to be ours, to be quite independent of us. Often there is so. little affinity between the man and his works that we think the wind must have writ them. Also its communication from one to another follows its own law and refuses our intrusion. It is in one, it be-longs to all; yet how to impart it?\n\nWe need all our resources to live in the world which is to be used and decorated by us. Socrates kept all his virtues as well as his faculties well in hand. He was sincerely humble, but he utilized his humanity chiefly as a better eyeglass to penetrate the vapors that baffled the vision of other men.\n\nThe superiority of the man is in the simplicity of his thought, that he has no obstruction, but looks straight at the pure fact, with no color of option. Profound sincerity is the only basis of talent as of character. The virtue of the Intellect is its own, its courage is of its own kind, and at last it will be justified, though for the moment it seem hostile to what it most reveres.\n\nWe wish to sum up the conflicting impressions by saying that all point at last to a unity which inspires all. Our poetry, our religion are its skirts and penumbrae. Yet the charm of life is the hints we derive from this. They overcome us like per-fumes from a far-off shore of sweetness, and their meaning is that no tongue shall syllable it without leave; that only itself can name it ; that by casting ourselves on it and being its voice it rushes each moment to positive commands, creating men and methods, and ties the will of a child to the love of the First Cause.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 4, "api_path": "/songs/1055722", "artist_names": "Bee Gees", "full_title": "Alone by\u00a0Bee\u00a0Gees", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a5a6a895c6caf071181e4db41d174c6a.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a5a6a895c6caf071181e4db41d174c6a.1000x999x1.jpg", "id": 1055722, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1444974869, "path": "/Bee-gees-alone-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Bee-gees-alone-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1997, "month": 2, "day": 17}, "release_date_for_display": "February 17, 1997", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Feb. 17, 1997", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a5a6a895c6caf071181e4db41d174c6a.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.rapgenius.com/a5a6a895c6caf071181e4db41d174c6a.1000x999x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 19301}, "title": "Alone", "title_with_featured": "Alone", "updated_by_human_at": 1643575026, "url": "https://genius.com/Bee-gees-alone-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/800", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/6ddd7a354324d544be7a8d65cadbcec7.1000x165x1.jpg", "id": 800, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/edd1e5e880fc50602c4c3c54ea726e6b.485x485x1.jpg", "index_character": "b", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Bee Gees", "slug": "Bee-gees", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Bee-gees"}, "artist": "Bee Gees", "lyrics": "Alone Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI was a midnight rider on a cloud of smoke\nI could make a woman hang on every single stroke\nI was an iron man, I had a master plan\nBut I was alone\n\n[Verse 2]\nI could hear you breathing with a sigh of the wind\nI remember how your body started trembling\nOh, what a night it's been and for the state I'm in\nI'm still alone\n[Bridge]\nAnd all the wonders made for the earth\nAnd all the hearts in all creation\nSomehow I always end up alone (always end up alone)\nAlways end up alone\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I play, I'll wait\nCause you know that love takes time\nWe came so far\nJust the beat of a lonely heart\nAnd it's mine\nAnd I don't want to be alone\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, since I got no message on your answer phone\nSince you're busy every minute I just stay at home\nI make believe you care, I feel you everywhere\nBut I'm still alone\n\n[Verse 4]\nI'm on a wheel of fortune with a twist of fate\nCause I know it isn't heaven, is it love or hate?\nAm I the subject of the pain?

drama\nTryin' to find a real one, baby\n\n[Chorus: SNL]\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nThen show me who you really are\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nTurn in your player card\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nThen show me who you really are\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nTurn in your player card\n[Verse 1: Too $hort]\nThere comes a time in every player's life\nWhen you think about a family and havin' a wife\nYou had enough, you can't take this shit\nPut a end to all the meaningless relationships\nAnd find one that means everything\nI'm talkin' 'bout white dresses and wedding rings\nUsed to be strip clubs and the Bunny Room\nBut now you're in love on a honeymoon\nYou used to keep a extra chick\nJust for booty calls and sexy trips\nBut now you at the grocery sto'\nTarget, Wal-Mart, and Home Depot\nIf you break out of prison, and jump the wall\nYou couldn't even get a date, you wouldn't know who to call\nYou had a lot of women and you played 'em hard\nBut you retired now, give up that player card\n\n[Chorus: SNL]\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nThen show me who you really are\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nTurn in your player card\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nThen show me who you really are\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nTurn in your player card\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Too $hort]\nA lot of players called it quits\nCome across the love pit and fall in it\nAin't nothin' wrong with love\nEarly in the morning you just want a hug\nI've been there a million times\nAsk me how I'm doin', I'm feelin' fine\nBut really what I feel inside\nIs the need to have somethin' real in my life\nI had it before\nBut I'm like Cameo, I go \"Back and Forth\"\nLike Big Pun and Joe\nSometimes \"I don't wanna be a player no more\"\nAnd when the time comes around, you know what's next\nThrow away my phone and my Rolodex\nIt's gone, and I didn't even notice it\nMy player card expired and I'm stuck with my old bitch\n\n[Chorus: SNL]\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nThen show me who you really are\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nTurn in your player card\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nThen show me who you really are\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nTurn in your player card\n[Verse 3: Too $hort]\nYour player card got revoked\nAnd it can't be renewed - no, it's not a joke\nOnce you give it up, it's hard to get it back\n'Cause fallin' in love is like hittin' crack\nOne hit and you a junkie\nAll day and night you'll be lickin' that monkey\nYou love the way it's sticky and funky\nYou said, \"I don't wanna live, if she don't want me\"\nI never had days like that\n'Cause I came up in Oakland, raised by macks\nI gotta get that scratch\nI get it from a batch, or from my raps\nIt's gon' happen, 'cause the game is here\nAsk Bishop Don Juan, I'm a famous player\nYou know when love'll happen for me?\nWhen I start buyin' hookers, and rappin' for free\nNever!\n\n[Chorus: SNL]\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nThen show me who you really are\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nTurn in your player card\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nThen show me who you really are\nIf you don't wanna be a player no more\nTurn in your player card\n\n[Outro: Too $hort]\nIt ain't expired yet, baby\nI'm thinkin' 'bout renewin' it\nShort Dog in the house\nPFL - Player For Life\nPlayer For Life, baby\nSometimes I feel like I don't wanna be a player\nBut I am...\n\nSmoke one wit'cha potna, mayne\nYou in the mix with Too $hort, \"Still Blowin'\"\nNew album comin soon, baby\nWhat's my favorite word?Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 38, "api_path": "/songs/1517", "artist_names": "The Notorious B.I.G.", "full_title":

Hennigan, U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, 1974\n\nTHE SEEK BUTTON on the Ford's radio is working. The downtown recedes. Miles of neighborhoods fill the windshield. The SEEK function locks on someplace in stereo, college FM probably. \"Yeah,\" a new friend says, \"Whas up. Whas goin on.\" The radio has another button, VOL, which gets jacked repeatedly while the Ford hurtles, happily, to the source of the noise. Not to the station's broadcast booth on a campus across the river, nor to its transmission towers in the suburbs, but rather to RJam Productions in North Dorchester, where black kids from Boston's now-integrated high schools-Latin, Madison Park, Jeremiah Burke, Mattapan-cut demos and dream of being bigger than even the radio's new friend, a young man named Schoolly D who right now, at speaker-damaging volume, sounds darn big. \"Before we start this next record\u2026,\" Schooly's saying. The record in question is called \"Signifying Rapper,\" a brief, bloody tale of ghetto retribution from Side 2 of Schoolly's Smoke Some Kill.\nThe black areas are cut away from the white areas a federal judge ruled in '74, and evidence is everywhere that nothing's changed since then. On the southbound left of the Fitzgerald Expressway pass 20 blocks of grim Irish-Catholic housing projects, the western border of Belfast, complete with Sinn Fein graffiti and murals depicting a glorious United Ireland, a neighborhood where the gadfly will get his fibula busted for praising the '74 court order that bused \"Them\" from wherever it is \"They\" live-the Third World fer crissakes--into 97-percent-white South Boston. On the Expressway's right is the place the fibula-busters are talking about: the simultaneous northern border of Haiti, Jamaica and Georgia; a territory that maps of Boston call North Dorchester.\n\nUniting the two sides of the Expressway is just about nothing. Both neighborhoods are tough and poor. Both hate the college world across the river, which, because of Boston's rotten public schools, they will never see as freshmen. And kids from both neighborhoods can do this hating to the beat of undergraduate radio, which this fine morning features suburban kids with student debt broadcasting the art of a ghetto Philadelphian roughly their age, once much poorer than they, but now, on royalties from Smoke Some Kill, very much richer.\n\nNot that the shared digging of black street music is news, or even new: twenty years ago, when Morgan v. Hennigan, Boston's own Brown v. Board of Education, was inching through the courts, and even dark-complected Italians were sometimes unwelcome in the Irish precincts east of the Expressway, kids in Boston's Little Belfast sang along with James Brown over the radio.\n\"Say it loud\nI'm black and I'm proud\nSay it loud\nI'm black and I'm proud!\"\n\nExcept that halfway through the infectious funk, the crewcuts realize what they're saying: Jesus christ, \"I'm proud to be black\" fer chrissakes, like when you're in the porno store, you know, and you get lost or something and you find yourself in the men's part, you know? not the part for men in the part that's about men, Jesus, and you get the hell outta there. And so they hum/mumble the suppressed parts.\n\n\"Say it loud\nI'm mmm hum proud\nSay it loud\nMum hum hum proud!\"\n\nBut rap isn't funk, rock or jazz, and the vast crossover move, broadcasting \"ghetto\" music over college radios to ghettos of a different color, is no simple reenactment of past crossovers. How, for example, does the sing-along fan of Smoke Some Kill mumble his way through these lines:\n\n\"Black is beautiful\nBrown is sick? slick? stiff?\nYellow's OK\nBut white ain't shit.\"\n\nRjam Productions, modestly headquartered in a mixed black/Hispanic Field, Corner section of North Dorchester, is as follows:\n\n* One (1) four-car garage fitted with dubbing and remastering gear worth more than most of the rest of the real estate on the block;\n* One (1) touch-tone telephone (leased);\n* Two (2) Chevy Blazers, vanity-plated RJAM1 and RJAM2, each equipped with cellular phones and slick tape decks (also leased);\n* One (1) VCR with Kathleen Turner's Body Heat cued up on the morning in question;\n* Most importantly, eight (8) promising acts under binding contract\nIf, as has happened to many local labels, Rjam were liquidated to satisfy creditors, these would be the pieces. But there are stores of value in the converted garage beyond the reach of the auctioneer's gavel. Schoolly D, the original Signifying Rapper, looms irresistibly from the pages of rap \"fanzines\" Hip-Hop and The Source; and Rjam's prime, unauctionable asset is the consuming ambition of the artists in its stable to be the next Schoolly D. Or the next Ice T, or Kool Moe Dee, or L. L. Cool J., or whoever's the special hero of the kid cutting the demo. On this particular morning, the dream is to be the next MC Lyte--a hard-rapping woman known for jams like \"MC Lyte vs. Vanna Whyte\" and \"10% Dis\"--since today is Tam-Tam's day and Tam-Tam is, at 16, a tough girl in the MC Lyte mold who, like MC Lyte, can dance, look good, and tell men to beat it, all at once.\n\nOr so claims Tam-Tam's producer, promoter, and dutch uncle, Gary Smith, who opened RJam on Martin Luther King's birthday, '89, with his older brother Nate. Nate, the elder statesman, is 25. Gary, 22, runs the company while Nate travels with his boyhood-friend-turned-boss, quadruple-platinum, Prince-derived rapper/singer, Bobby Brown. RJam was founded in part with an investment from the 23-year-old multi-millionaire Brown, a native of Roxbury. Brown now lives in Los Angeles.\n\nNate and Gary Smith turn a healthy profit making demos at $500/tape, but the brothers aren't in the health business. Their aim: to follow in the corporate footsteps of Def Jam, a once similarly tiny production company run from a basement in Hollis, Queens, which since its basement days, has given America Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J., the Beastie Boys, and much of the rest of that culture-quake called rap. Gary Smith doesn't compare RJam to Def Jam, and, unlike Def Jam's Russell Simmons, Gary produces pop, soul, and R&B as well as straight rap, and actually prefers R&B. But how many sophomores at nearby Jeremiah Burke can afford to dream in R&B, to front music lessons and $500 for an nth-hand sound set-up, find three friends to learn drums, bass and keyboards, and then raise another $500 to make a demo at RJam? Anybody with a larynx can rap, however, and Rjam's brisk business in rap demos pays the taxman, Boston Edison and the Chevrolet Motor Credit Corp.\n\nTwenty minutes farther south on the Fitzgerald Expressway, across the Neponset River and into the pricey suburbs, is the scene of John Cheever's boyhood, more recently celebrated as Massachusetts Miracle country, where technology ventures are started at the rate of five per week, four of which will fail within 12 months. RJam's Gary Smith is secret brother to the men of the suburban Chambers of Commerce, sharing their worries about cash flow, overhead, and the enforceability of his contracts; but Gary's world and theirs are as far apart as those of Ward and Eldridge Cleaver. Worriers in suburbia fear that ballooning property values will hike taxes on computer executives' seaside homes. In Gary's neighborhood, property values are actually falling.\n\nWaiting less than patiently for Tam-Tam, Gary honks twice. A tall, grave girl with an angel's heart-shaped face crosses the ghetto street and climbs into the back seat of RJAM1. She has, apparently, at least two voices, the cynical, sexy rant heard on tape this morning telling Pebbles men ain't worth it, and the whisper in which she now says hello.\n\nAs RJAM1 re-crosses North Dorchester, heading back to the soundproof studios to get the day's work started, Gary and DJ Reese hash out production details. Tam-Tam's a dignified island in the back seat, and a shiver accompanies the thought that this could be the Motor City in '63 with Berry Gordy and an eighty-pound teenage Diana Ross, just voted Best Dressed at Cass Technical High School, driving crosstown to record a little number called \"Where Did Our Love Go.\"\n\nAsk Tam-Tam about Diana Ross, and she gives a beatific smile. She's 16; she can remember only with difficulty the first rap she ever listened to, when rap was new and she was 8; Run-DMC or somebody, she mumbles in response to what suddenly seems a foolish question about her influences. Like most of rap's black audience (as distinct from rap's white audience, which is usually a decade older), Tam-Tam has no first-hand recollection of James Brown except as a source for rap. She is too young to have attended segregated schools. She was in diapers during the violent first few months of desegregation in Boston and can't remember the awful day in '74 when \"pro-neighborhood\" marchers from Irish South Boston came upon a black pedestrian at City Hall and beat him with pole-mounted American flags.\n\nTam-Tam has star presence, and like many who do, she seems to see very little of what goes on around her, the price of the star's intense focus on self. She reminds you of Senator Gary Hart. He, too, had star presence. In front of a crowd, Hart was riveting; in the elevator riding up to the auditorium, he was barely there. Being barely there in the neighborhood Tam-Tam calls home is probably not such a bad thing, and perhaps her drive to be star someday is an elaborate way to wall out the now and here. Ambition is, finally, a form of hope, a scarce commodity in North Dorchester.\n\nBack in Rjam's control booth, Dj Reese and producer Ralph Stacey are programming the rhythm track for what will be \"Ho, You're Guilty.\" Drum parts are taken from a Roland TR-909 Rhythm Composer, a synth which electronically reproduces programmed beats on the user's choice of drum-matrix. The TR-909's keys, on a console designed to resemble, vaguely, the familiar piano, are named after the sound each creates-bass, snare, mid-tom, hi-tom--and the sounds are named after the actual drums which, until the TR-909, were required to make those sounds. The TR-909 even sports a key named HAND CLAP, making it possible for the first time ever to clap hands with a single finger, rendering obsolete the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping. The finished \"Ho, You're Guilty\" will sound lush with percussion, melody, and instrumental breaks. Not one human musician will be employed in the recording process.\n\nEach percussion line is programmed onto the mixing board as a separate track: a snare track, a bass track, a clap track, etc. Reese has been studying the classics lately, too, viz: James Brown's Dead on the Heavy Funk from '75ish, including the ageless groove, \"Funky President,\" in which James announces his third-party candidacy. Some of Bobby Byrd's Dead guitar, and a holy moment when James exhales rhythmically, have been isolated from a store-bought cassette of Dead, re-recorded on clean tape, then re-re-recorded onto a computer-readable memory diskette from which the sample is retrieved and altered by Ralph Stacey using a Roland D-50 linear synth. The guitar and the exhalation then go, as altered, from the synth to yet another of the 24 tracks on the big mixing board. Reese, the DJ, will weave a seamless rhythm track out of these 24 strands.\n\nAs Reese and Ralph Stacey mix the 24 tracks onto one master tape, Tam-Tam sips lemonade in the corner of the booth. You ask her if she is interested someday in learning about the obscure digital technology the two men manipulate on her behalf. She doesn't seem to register the question. \"The other career besides rap I'd like to pursue is modelling,\" she says. \"I'm five-seven. That's the perfect height for a model.\"\n\nMixing takes the rest of the day. Producer Ralph Stacey at one late point corners you with a flinty stare and an uncomfortable question: \"Why do you want to write about rap, anyway?\" It is lucky that at that minute Reese is done mixing. Tomorrow the RJam staff will tape Tam-Tam's vocal track and lay this over Reese's rhythm track. Then the sound will be \"fattened\" with stacks of horns, guitar hooks, bells, canned applause, and whatever else they decide to take from other tapes or work up on the Rolands. The final demo tape of \"Ho, You're Guilty\" will then be shopped to the 20 major, minor, and tiny labels who might release the demo as a 12-inch single.\n\nEveryone's ready to call it a day. Gary Smith's already huddled with some new wanna-be stars in RJam's reception area. Reese plays the mixed rhythm track once through over the big speakers in the control booth, and Tam-Tam immediately stands, modelling forgotten, utterly alert. Reese gestures to her with maestro hands. She raps at an absent Antoinette in the hard, sexy voice you haven't heard since this morning, extemporaneous but on beat:\n\"I'm a female\nYou're just a fairytale.\"\n\nThe small-w we here are two white Boston males: one native, one oft-transplanted; both residing in Somerbridge, a dim, ethnic-Portuguese neighborhood whose gentrification we abet. M. is an attorney with a taste for jazz, Blues, funk; D. a grad student and would-be drifter who watches TV instead of sleeping. Our cultural tastes and interests are day and night. They converged only lately, when D's stereo arrived UPS and we discovered we shared an uncomfortable, somewhat furtive, and distinctively white enthusiasm for a certain music called rap/hip-hop.* About our passions and discomforts we could determine only that they were vague & distinct contexts and cathexes brought to bear across the same ethnic distance on the same thing. For instance, we agreed that real or serious rap is not JJ FAD or Tone Loc or Beasties, Egyptian Lover or Fat Boys, not experiments or freakshows or current commercial crossover slush. \"Serious\" rap--a unique U.S. inner-city fusion of funk, technified reggae, teen-to-teen \"hardcore\" rock, and the early 70s \"poetry of the black experience\" of Nikki Giavonni, the Last Poets, etc.--has, since its late-70s delivery at the record-scratching hands of Afrika Bambaataa and his Zulu Nation, Sugarhill Gang, Kool Herc and his automated Herculords, and Grandmaster Flash, always had its real roots in the Neighborhood, the black gang-banger Underground. Black music, of and for blacks.\n\nWe concurred as to the wheres and whens of rap's begetting--mid-to-late 70s' South Bronx house parties; then, by decade's end, block parties, with municipal electric lights tapped for a power source, literal dancing in the streets; by '82, regular rap-houses and then \"floating clubs\"--the Roxy every Sunday, The Bronx's Disco Fever TWTh--everybody Breaking to a new musical antimusic being fashioned from records and turntables and an amateur DJs ad-lib banter; a very heavy reggae influence at the beginning; the more rhythmic pure rap an offshoot, its brisker, sparer, backbeat designed for Breakdance, and the smooth-rapping partygoer who just didn't want to shut up when others' music was on. We agreed, too, on rough chronology: amateur house-partiers giving way to professional DJs, pioneers; they, too, then overshadowed by new art-entrepreneurs, former Breakers, failed singers, gag-majorettes; then the rise of \"Indies,\" the tiny independent labels that keep most new music on life-support--Sugar Hill, Jive, Tommy Boy, Wild Pitch, Profile Records, Enjoy--then, after King Tim III's \"Personality Jock\" and Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight,\" an entree into urban black radio; then to underground \"Mix\" radio; then corporate levels, digital technology, very big money, the early-80s talent that became an early Scene's cream--Spoonie G. and Sequence, Eric Fresh, Unknown DJ, Egyptian Lover and Run-DMC. Then, Spring '84, the extraordinary Midas touch of Rick Rubin and Russell Simmons' Def Jam label (now under contract to CBS) from which sprang a mid-80s stable of true stars, in the Underground--Public Enemy, L. L. Cool J, Slick Rick, the still-unparalleled Eric B. and Rakim--and L.A.'s alternatives: Kool Moe Dee, L.A. Dream Team, and others. And now, at decade's end, an absolute explosion of rap-as-pop, big business, MTV, special fashions, posters, merchandise, with only a few big, new, cutting-edge acts--L.A.'s N.W.A., Philadelphia's Schoolly D, Miami's 2 Live Crew, De La Soul's House-blend of rap/funk/jazz--remaining too esoteric or threatening or downright obscene to cross all the way over and cash in with big labels. By '89 rap is finally proving as \"important\" (read also lucrative) to an anemic shock-and rebellion-music industry as Punk was an exact decade ago. This was all just data. We agreed on it, and on how it was curious that we both had such strange, distant facts down cold.\n\nOur point of departure, essay-wise, was always less what we know than what we felt, listening: less what we liked than why. For this attempt at an outside sampler we plunked down and listened to thousands of hours of rap, trying to summon a kind of objective, critical, purely \"aesthetic\" passion that the music itself made impossible. For outsiders, rap's easy to move to, hard to dissect. The more we listened and thought and drank beers and argued, the more we felt that the stuff's appeal for two highbrow, upscale whites was just plain incongruous. Because serious rap has, right from the start, presented itself as a closed show. Usually critical questions of culture, context, background and audience reduce quickly to vexed questions about prepositions. Not here. No question that serious rap is, and is very self-consciously, music by urban blacks about same to and for same. To mainstream whites it's a tight cohesion that can't but look, from outside the cultural window, like occlusion, clannishness (sic) and inbreeding, a kind of reverse snobbery about what's \"def\" and \"fresh\" and in-the-Scene that eerily recalls the exclusionary codes of college Societies and WASP-only country clubs. Serious rap is a musical movement that seems to revile whites as a group or Establishment, and simply to ignore their possibility as distinct individuals--the Great White Male is rap's Grand Inquisitor, its idiot questioner--its Alien Other no less than Reds were for McCarthy. The music's paranoia, together with its hermetic racial context, helps explain why from the outside it appears to us just as vibrant and impassioned as it does alien and scary.\n\nOther incongruities. Rap is a \"music\" essentially without melody, built instead around a digitally synthesized drum- and back-beat often about as complex as five idle fingers on a waiting-room table, enhanced by \"sampled\" (pirated) \"krush grooves\" (licks or repetitive chord-series) conceived and recorded by pre-rap rock icons, the whole affair characterized by a distinctive, spare, noisy, clattering \"style\" whose obsessive if limited thematics revolve with the speed of low-I amperage around the performative circuit of the MC/rapper and his record-scratching, sound-mixing Sancho Panza, the DJ.\n\nThe rapper (the guy in the cameo cut or Kangol hat, pricey warm-up, unlaced Adidas, extra thick gold chain or oversized medallion) offers lyrics that are spoken or bellowed in straight, stressed, rhymed verse, the verse's syntax and meter often tortured for rhythmic gain or the kind of limboing-for-rhyme we tend to associate with doggerel about men from Nantucket. The lyrics, nearly always self-referential, tend to be variations on about half a dozen basic themes, themes that at first listen can seem less alien or shocking than downright dull. Eg: just how bad/cool/fresh/def the rapper and his lyrics are; just how equally un-all-these his music rivals are; how troublesome, vacuous and acquisitive women are; how wonderful it is to be \"paid in full\" for rapping instead of stealing or dealing; how gangs are really families, 'caine's constant bad news. And, in particular, how sex and violence and yuppie toys represent perfectly the urban black lifedrive to late-80s American glory.\n\nThe masks are many, too many for anything really but direct aural inspection: rap personae can change frequently even within single albums, the rapper delivering Hard, violent Black Nationalist communique on one cut, dubbing against Trinidadian steel drums on another, basking in big label eclat on a third, cracking a head and then defly outwitting someone muscled and dumb, cooing to his \"bitch\" and then on the flip side, threatening to go get his gun again if she can't learn who's boss. Though any crew naturally wants its own distinctive game and face, the quintessential rap group is unquintessential, chameleonesque. This is either by weird design, or it's a symptom and symbol of 80s facelessness\u2026or most likely, it's just a good old venerable synecdoche of rap's genre itself, one that's now moving so fast it can't quite fix on its own identity -- much less hold still for anything like cool, critical classification or assessment, from outside.\n\nThe MC's Alice Toklas-esque DJ hovers ever nearby over his buffet of connected turntables and the black Germanness of a whole lot of digital editing & playback equipment. His responsibility is the song behind and around the rap -- the backbeat, krush groove, and the \"sound carpet,\" i.e. a kind of electric aural environment, a chaos behind the rapper's rhymed order, a digitalized blend of snippets, squeaks, screams, sirens, snatches from pop media, all mixed and splattered so that the listener cannot really listen but only feel the resultant mash of \"samples\" that results. The most recognizable of these samples range from staccato record-scratches to James Brown and Funkadelic licks, to M.L.K.'s public Dream, to quotidian pop pap like \"The Theme from Shaft,\" Brady Bunch dialogue, and '50s detergent commercials.\n\nWe have now read every review and essay to do with serious underground hip-hop available in every single on-line periodical ... xcept for one or two underground newsletters (viz. The City Sun, Fresh-Est) circulated in parts of the Bronx demimonde where learning about rap is as hard for white outsiders as scoring fine China White or AKs. From the kind of sedulous bibliomaniacal research to be expected of conscientious lawyers and PhDs, the following has become clear. Outside England, where the Punk-weaned audience has developed a taste for spectacle-through-windows, for vicarious Rage and Protest against circumstances that have exactly 0% to do with them, most of what Rolling Stone calls \"devoted rock consumers\" (meaning we post-baby-boomers), plus almost all established rock critics, tend to regard non-crossover rap as essentially boring and simplistic, or swaggering and bellicose and dangerous--at all events, basically vapid and empty because of its obsessive self-referentiality\u2026in short, as closed to them, to us, as a music. Unrecognizable as what we've been trained and adverted to buy as pop.... Great to dance to, of course, but then what might the white audience for today's mainstream expect? Rap, whether fecund or sterile, is today's pop music's lone cutting edge, the new, the unfamiliar, the brain-resisted-while-body-boogies. And that resisted, alien, exhilarating cutting edge has always been black.\n\n\"What have you left me? what have I got?\nLast night in cold blood my young brother got shot\nMy homey got jacked\nMy mother's on crack\nMy sister can't work cause her arms show tracks\nMadness, insanity\nLive in profanity\nThen some punk claim that they understandin' me?\nGive me a break--what world do you live in?\nDeath is my sex--guess my religion.\"**\n\nWhat makes this stuff so much more disturbing, more real to outsiders than the Punk Rock even those of us who remember it could never quite take seriously? Maybe even a closed music has to have some kind of detente with received custom: I always found it tough to listen straight-faced to a nihilist lecture from someone with a chartreuse mohawk and an earring in his eyelid who punctuates his delivery with vomit and spit. All doctrine and pronouncement, exclusively anti-, this Punk of a decade past afforded even willing mainstream listeners no easement across cultural void, nothing human to grab onto. I have no idea what a Punk performer thinks, feels, is, day-to-day... in fact I always suspected he had no day, but just retreated to his plush coffin at cockcrow. Can you imagine a Punk with four-foot hair and spiked jacket and nose-ring, say, eating a bologna sandwich? Replacing a light bulb? Putting a quarter in a meter? Not me, boy. And even Barnum, who knew fear sells, also knew that freakshows aren't frightening when the freakishness supplants all resemblance. 0% affinity = 0% empathy. And fear requires empathy as much as it does menace or threat.\n\nPublic Enemy and N.W.A., Ice T and Schoolly D discomfit us, our friends, the critics we read and cornered, because the Hard rappers' lyrics are conscientious about being of/for the real lives and attitudes of recognizable, if alien, persons. Here's where it's a level up from mere spectacle: ideology in Hard rap is always informed by incident or named condition. This makes rap not only better than Punk, but way scarier. Serious Hard raps afford white listeners genuine, horse's-mouth access to the life-and-death plight and mood of an American community on the genuine edge of im-/explosion, an ugly new sub-nation we've been heretofore conditioned to avoid, remand to the margins, not even see except through certain carefully abstract, attenuating filters.\n\nFor outsiders, rap is hard to dissect, easy to move to. The command is: dance, don't understand; participate, don't manipulate. Rap is a fortress protected by the twin moats of talk and technology. The first is that nu style of speak--the \"dialect drug,\" De La Soul calls it--that rappers fashion from jive and disseminate through record stores to all of us. Some in-words, like \"fly,\" meaning \"finelooking,\" have been in coin since the beginning, now venerable as Old English because they turn up on Grandmaster Flash cuts from '82. Others, like \"dead presidents,\" rap for $$, are either coming into or going out of currency, depending on when you read this. Rap, a club language, has myriad ways to describe one's own or others' looks. \"Fly\" is how a man digs a woman. One would never describe oneself as \"fly,\" even when cataloguing one's own attractions (done more in rap than anyplace except perhaps Village Voice personals). \"Fresh\" means irresistibly stylish, oft-modified by \"funky,\" \"crazy,\" or \"stoopid,\" predominantly used to convey the fly-ness of things other than women, including oneself or one's rap, which two concepts rappers, like schizophrenics, can't always keep separate in their heads. \"Dope\" means \"def,\" and \"def\" means crazy funky stoopid fresh. Synonyms include: the shit, the It, the cool, the thang, the word, the grooviest, the categorical imperative, die weltanschung, the that-which-Potter-Stewart-would-know-if-he-saw. A def rapper is so style-defining as to make the stylish mere copycats. To be def is to rap to the beat of a different drum machine--not seeking solitude, but rather confident that others will follow. The def rapper MC's a def rap, which rap def-ly tells of its own (and the rapper's) def-ness--so def, as MC/manager, entrepreneur Russell Rush Simmons brags, that it had to be on a label called Def Jam.\n\nRap celebrates power, equating strength with style, and style with the \"I\" in \"Individuality.\" Rappers \"dis\"--dismiss--the styleless, faceless. To \"ill\" is to be weak or wrong; to \"bite\" is to thieve another's dope beat. And only the ill would bite.\n\nEarly remastered pop was the first fake music ever, since what the record buyer of '63 experienced as Aural Event on his turntable couldn't happen live. Rock began to become an Illusion of Event which technology made possible; rock became more like the movies, starting down a long road at the end of which was MTV.\n\nNot that this kept Phil Spector up nights. The gurus of the studio had fatter fish to clean, for the new freedom to shape sound had come at a price. With each magnetic jump from live, as tape was made of tapes which were themselves tapes of tapes, the hiss and crackle of interference multiplied. Dual high-bias media with 2 units each of sonic garbage per 10,000 units of Elvis Presley, retaped on similar 2-units-per-10,000 tape, became 4 units of hiss; retaped, 8; then 16; then 32. As the sound got fuller, it decayed.\n\nThe solution was a breakthrough called multi-tracking--using recorders that could capture and play back on 2 (as in stereo), 4 (as in '67's then-ear-shattering Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band), 12, 16, and today 24 parallel tracks, eliminating the hiss of transference from one machine to the next. Rhythms, melodies, harmonies could all be captured on separate tracks, allowing the performer or producer to mix and listen and re-mix, adding vocals or lead instrument on yet another track. Rap Edisons like Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash and Afrika Bambaataa began as party DJs, not musicians. Their wiring of twin turntables to a mixer, allowing them to \"stack\" the sound of two different records while rapping into a mike, was a kind of crude, extemporaneous multitracking. Technological loops like those in the NASA-esque studios of CBS and Polygram were now in the hands of the homeboys. Carter was President. The Bee Gees, with five Top-Ten hits in twelve months, were king.\n\nDigital recording, the science dividing Rjam's Tam-Tam on tape from Tam-Tam as heard \"live\" is a technology that converts music to codes or \"digits.\" The codes are \"read\" by a computer, one combining sophisticated sound-to-code translation hardware with a number-crunching COS and a high-response synthesizer, at speeds of 40,000 digits per second and up. The recorded sounds, reduced to numbers, can be shaped, mangled, muffled, amplified, and even canonized.*** Hardware then translates the digits, as read and altered, back into sound, which can itself be recorded on multitrack and combined with yet more sounds. The result: hiss-free reproduction on an infinity of tracks, each of which can itself be manipulated infinitely.\n\nDigital recording, part of the 80s sea-change in how pop gets made, divides the responsibility for the final song more or less equally between the performer, the engineer at the mixing board, the producer who coordinates the multi-tracking and mixing process, and the electronic hardware that actually \"makes\" the music we buy. The latest synthesizers**** produce notes from pure electric current instead of electronically amplified vibrations, with voltage-meters rather than hands or feet determining everything from key to pitch to timbre to \"attack-delay envelope\" (another non-rap term, denoting the microtimed, counterpoised quality of a note's duration, how a note's sound/quaver-structure as it builds is different from its sound and structure as it fades--the manipulation of a piano's foot-pedals, for example, affects the delay component of each note and chord's envelope). The Kurzweil 250, a state-of-the-art system, is a 1-?track/12,018-note synthesizer linked by software to an Apple MacIntosh Plus, which serves as an exhaustive library of digitized sound. The Kurzweil could put all of culture in a blender--take Janet Leigh's Cremora-curdling scream from Psycho, store it in the Mac, program the synth such that an F# will be reproduced as Janet Leigh's F# scream, then play \"We Shall Overcome\" as if screamed by Janet Leigh; store this; treat similarly Bach's St. Matthew's Passion, except with vast choruses of screaming Janet Leighs, then \"Mary Had a Little Lamb,\" then \"Twist and Shout\" (by the Isleys, not the Beatles), all as screams; then replay the four as one horrific jumble, or select amidst the jumble; and then whatever you came up with in the final, painstakingly re-mixed mix you could play backwards. And call that \"finished.\" Or never finish. It's like holding music at gunpoint. You can make it do--or do to you --whatever you can think of. Whim is the only limit.\n\nBasically we decided we were into rap because, even media-hype aside, this music had some kind of hard edge to it. Date of composition here is July '89. Think back. This last has been a fiscal year in which Madonna's \"back on top,\" in which covers of classic covers of classic tunes are themselves covered and then climb corporate charts, in which Rod Stewart's out of cryogenics and back on top.... MTV's ceased to be anything but a long commercial for itself and the interests of corporate labels; Bobby McFerrin makes a platinum mint and then several commercial jingles out of a burbled synth-reggae invitation to \"Be Happy,\" a song that has the same verbal-pre-packaging feel as \"Where's the Beef?\"\n\nThis last year heavy metal's fake-Satanist male models accounted for 1/2 of total U.S. record sales; U2 filmed a $20,000,000 homage to their own self-righteousness and Bono's ever more ill-disguised megalomania. A year when even good old REM finally went corporate-pop with Green, when good old Springsteen trashed his bride, when as modest and nascent a talent as Tracy Chapman earned cymbal-crashing critical raves for her competent, updated frappe of Baez and Armatrading, so desperate were pop critics and consumers for any voice at once comprehensible and even remotely fresh. Just not a notable pop year at all. Except in rap. Rap appears in the famished late 80s as potentially a genuine musical Scene the way early jazz, rock, the Summer of Love, folk/protest, god even the way New Wave and Punk were \"Scenes\"--the S-word here simultaneously meaning: something new to look at; something loud and upsetting (\"Oh please, Veronica, let's not have a Scene!\"); and, best, an identifiable set of places in time where large forces meet, marry and beget. Whether by virtue or default, rap is pretty much what there is to like right now, if you want to regard today's pop as anything more than covert jingles in 4/4-time. In our opinion.\n\nBut so the point is we enjoy it. Plus we've developed some theses about why serious rap is important, both as art-for-own-sake and as a kind of metaphor-with-larynx for a subbed-culture unique in its distillation of the energy and horror of the American present.\n\nRap is expanding gas-like through the 80s' dry time, growing from house party schtick, gang anthem, a small-label fad with the sort of pop lifespan you measure with eggtimers--then somehow, when we weren't looking, into Scene, movement, On The Air--finally, in the last 24 months, assuming the fecund role of genuine Genre. Exploding into subspecies now faster than you can track. There's now Dub's mix of rap and reggae, House's mix of rap and 70s-, huge-afro'd funk, Acid House's psychedelic hip-hop. There is black rap for white mass-consumption (Tone Loc, Run?DMC), black rap for local set and -house consumption (countless local stars and wanna-be's in every large city), ultra-black rap superstars for the whole marginal Nation inside (Heavy D, Public Enemy, Big Daddy Kane), white rap for white masses (the execrable Beastie Boys). There is Hispanic, Salsa-influenced rap out of different West Coast barrios, rap fused with West Indian or Islamic traditional music in Digital Underground, Eric B. and Rakim, and others, or fused with oh-so-danceable R&B in the new \"jack swing\" offshoot (Bobby Brown, MC Hammer); even gay and bohemian young urban Bs have their trendsetters in Teddy Riley and Guy, De La Soul, Kwabe. Etc. etc.***** A major impediment to sampling this Scene is the kaleidoscopic fury with which the Scene itself is changing. If you're reading this in print it's already dated.\n\nAnd the rap world's vitality is one of replacement as well as variety, allowing the genre to remain fresh, as band after band is seduced into the \"real\" music biz. This Scene is hydra-like. Almost the moment a rap artist like Run-DMC or L. L. Cool J \"breaks through\" into major-market mix appeal, MTV's land of corporate bankability, certain reactions within the urban underground that spawned them can almost always be observed. The breakthrough band's B-boys themselves are without qualms about the pop bigtime: after all, they've been rapping all along about their entitlement to money and status, about the inevitable rewards of their freshness and unbiteable voice. Their postbreakthrough raps tend all often to become celebrations of their new wealth and fame, of the now-enhanced authority of their \"Message\"--though it's hard to feature Public Enemy rapping about a Black-Militant renaissance, about revolution and American apocalypse, while lily-white CBS Records pays them millions for the distribution rights to just such exhortations to cut corporate throats.\n\nNevertheless, back in the underground Scene, the breakthrough band's tight set of original fans tends to hang loyal, to await feverishly \"their\" crew's spots on the same music TV they love to dis. In short, there are comparatively few of the accusations of selling out that accompanied a similarly oxymoronic coopting phenomenon in late-60s protest rock. Which if you think about it, is passing strange. The white mainstream Other against which serious rap aligns and defines itself makes the 60s \"Establishment\" too look downright benign.\n\nOur opinion, then, from a distance: not only is a serious rap serious poetry, but, in terms of the size of its audience, its potency in the Great 80s Market, its power to spur and to authorize the artistic endeavor of a discouraged and malschooled young urban culture we've been encouraged sadly to write off,6 it's quite possibly the most important stuff happening in American poetry today. \"Real\" (viz. academic) U.S. poetry, a world no less insular than rap, no less strange or stringent about vocab, manner, and the contexts it works off, has today become so inbred and (against its professed wishes) inaccessible that it just doesn't get to share its creative products with more than a couple thousand fanatical, sandal-shod readers, doesn't get to move or inform more than a fraction of that readership (most of the moved being poets themselves), doesn't generate revenue for much of anyone save the universities to whom the best PhD-poets rent their names and time ... and especially does not inspire a whole culture's youth to try to follow in their Connecticut-catalogue brogans' prints. Because of rap's meteoric rise, though, you've got poor kids, tough kids, \"underachievers,\" a \"lost generation\"... more young people--ostensibly forever turned off \"language\" by TV, video games and low U.S.D.E. budgets--more of these kids hunched over notebooks on their own time, trying to put words together in striking and creative ways, than the U.S.A. has probably ever had at one time. That few of these will become \"stars\" matters far less than the grim stats about, say, the tiny percentage of playground basketball phenoms who actually ride sports out and up from subclass status: the same verbal skills and enthusiasms rap values (and values enough to let rap-dissing stand symbolically for fighting or killing) can obviously be applied in mainstream-approved, \"productive\" ways--G.E.D.'s college, Standard Written English ...perhaps someday even ad-copywriting!\n\nBut is this wildfire of urban rap ambition raging around converted four-car garages like North Dorchester's RJam's in spite of the genre's near-disciplinary prosodic restrictions, or because of them? Can't really tell. Probably doesn't matter. The fact remains that, were \"important poetry\" presently defined in terms of what makes important art important in a Supply-Side democracy (popularity, effect, the separation of fan from his cash), staid journals like Poetry and American Poetry Review would be featuring some number of fade-cut, multiple-earring'd authors' photos in each issue; and highbrow public readings would always carry their back row fraction of bangers ready to \"listen rude\" to Wilbur and Levertov and Ashbery, just as e.g Rimbaud and Pound did to their own contemporaries ... to the delight and invigoration of a time's poetry...\n\n... And even just the prospected fantasy of seeing Public Enemy's be-clocked Flavor Fav and like a Jorie Graham or Amy Clampitt sitting down over beer and Celestial Seasonings to hash out the debate over line-breaks in dactylic pentameter, a very serious young homeboy in Italian silk and pentagonal shades serving as interpreter is enough to make us hereby officially lobby for the admission of rhyme's renaissance--at least under the stringent rhythmic demands rap has forced on rhyme-as-form--to the cold corridors of Serious Appreciation.\n\nUnlike the mostly docile poetry and fiction of the late 80s, though, rap's own quality, the def freshness of the MC's bit, is set up to be judged primarily in the context of what it is against. In case you thought we forgot, rap is first of all a movement in rock music, and thus the time-honored requirement is that the rap Scene set itself very consciously athwart those circumstances and forces whose enormity is required by all rock 'n roll to justify one of its essential roles, rebellion-against. Except now watch the objects of the rebellion alter, spread, grow in urgency--from the 50s' parents and principals, homework, hot rods, the sweet hurt of teen love, to the urban 80s, police, violent death, homelessness, the lure of ecstatic drugs that dehumanize weaponry, fatherlessness, the animal emptiness of sex w/o love, the almost Trilaterally sinister White Establishment (\"THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSIBLE THE GOVERNMENT'S. . . \"), Everyone Else: life as a series of interruptions from an angry slumber about what the electric voices say you must have and the human voices say you may not, about the betrayal of the past, of the promises exacted by Carmichael, X, and the now-formal martyrdom of King.\n\nSegregation may affect their hearts and minds, Earl Warren warned, as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan, both alumni of Boston's old separate-but-awful schools, bear loud witness. Now, 40 years after X disgustedly quit a racist high school and began a career as a kind of be-bop gang-banger, 35 years after Brown v. Board of Education invented integration, 15 years after Morgan v. Hennigan brought Brown to Boston, North Dorchester is worse and its schools aren't better. A former United States Secretary of Education converts to Drug Czar, symbolizing a national change of mind: now drugs, not poor schools (and certainly not the American apartheid of which segregated schools were but one facet), is our root \"innercity\" problem. Tam-Tam's Boston is strangely less hopeful than the notoriously segregated pre-Hennigan city, perhaps because before Hennigan reformers could promise that segregation was why things were so bad. Segregation was blame's bullseye: abolish the bullseye, and blame for the estrangement of the races flies everywhere, hitting the cops, or the courts, or the teachers, or the taught, or what's taught. There's even a rap--B.D.P.'s \"Why is That?\"--blaming our miseries on the failure of the schools to \"teach black kids to be black.\"\n\nBut everything the white rock listener pays to enjoy is black-begotten. If today's Top?40 environment seems bleak or befouled, imagine the present mainstream without its sweetest sourcewaters, without the King-Waters-King Blues trinity, the Brownian soul, the backbeat, cut time, blue notes, funky French curves of sax and brass, the guitar solo, call-and-response, the Cold Medina or Lucky Powder, those lithely syncopated quintets in pomade and linen suits, the single hand in the white glove holding Pepsi aloft in the shadow of accidental flames.... Black music is American pop's breath and bread; and we, as both born audience and born salesmen, know it.\n\nSo maybe it's them. Them. Maybe we're approaching an enforced fork in the musical road where the white-run entertainment industry will have to pack up what it's taken and go seek its fortune on the backs of new minorities. Maybe, in serious rap, the extreme new insulation of the black sound is not only intentional but preplanned, part of a neo-Nationalist agenda, the hermetic new Scene's tight circle more like something large and coiled than something small and flat.\n\nYou may now be getting some hazy idea of the sorts of really quite scary possibilities with which the rap we like is replete. And, hazier, of how complicated this stuff of sampler-from-outside can be. What's remained passing strange, for use, is the vague threat's appeal. The unease and ambivalence with which the rare white at the window loves rap renders that love no less love. Whence the fear, though, is really no matter. For look at the world, at the masses we're part of. At what you look at closest. The plain 80s data is that, whereas love, devotion, passion seem only to divide, it's fear and strangeness that bind crowds, fill halls, unite Us, somehow, as audience, under the great tent.\n\n*'Hip-hop' is an older synonym, coined by Rap pioneer, Kool Herc, to describe the heavily danceable Jamaican scatting he introduced between records at the huge South Bronx block parties he and other new-Scene celebrities, like Jazzy Five and former Black Spades leader, Afrika Bambaataa, could turn into late-70s frenzies of Breakdance (both music and dance a self-conscious reaction against the glittered unreality of downtown Disco).\n\n**Except but now hey kids! thanks to AT&T you can now speak directly to Ice T and hear his philosophy of life by phone! 1-900-907-9111. \"Chill out with Ice T,\" the rapper adrape in military hardware and ammunition says on MTV, \"I'm just waiting on you to call me,\" pointing at the camera and then himself lest the audience get at all confused. \"Don't forget to ask your parent's permission first\" (white corporate voice-over)--$2.00 first minute, etc. etc.\n\n***\"Canon\" being another non-jive rap term, meaning the division of a single sequence of sound into two or more repeating sound-sequences, like a vocal round.\n\n**** ... themselves the heirs of a long, 20th-century evolutionary process, from the playe-?piano to the 20s Oncles Martenot and Theremin and Trautonium (crude electronic instruments big in France), to Pierre Schaeffer's musique concrete in '48, to the first Electronic Music Synthesizer invented by engineers at RCA in the 50s to the inauguration of the Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center in '59, to Robert Moog's '64 development of the Moog 55, the first emitter of amplified \"blurps, fwipps, simps, twings, and schlonks\" to be commercially produceable. Walter/Wendy Carlos used a Moog 55 for his/her '68 Switched-On Bach, an album that did more than anything to popularize synthesized sound.\n\n***** Note how the ecstatic force's movement extends beyond sound into dance-Chicago-based house-dancing is very different from Coast-based rap-dancing, while both are distinct from the Quaalude sway a De La Soul's lazy complexity invites--and beyond dance into urban haute couture itself. The \"cameo\" or \"fade,\" that troubling cyberpunk flat-top haircut favored by Carl Lewis and Grace Jones but popularized by the group Cameo's rapping Larry Blackmon, has now become less a haircut than a sculptural statement: words, logos, slogans and complex signs razored into the rigid anvil of hair that is, according to the Voice, \"the most culturally conscious unisex hairstyle since the afro.\" The standard 80s-rap uniform--sideways baseball cap or Kangol, ropey chains, acetate warmup and unlaced hightops--\"...now symbolizes a cruder, more casual era,\" and is diffracting into a rap-House-gay-jackswing look replete with polka-dot ties, loose pleated twills, and expensive dance-loafers or British \"moon boots,\" a combination Ricky Ricardo-Frank Sinatra dapper that now befits a Scene with the dignity, silliness and pull of real Genre. Plus don't forget that just one big change in street and school fashions means millions and millions in garment revenue--even more $$ once the white mainstream, as is its won't, follows in the cutting edge's media-delayed wake.\n\n****** \"We've lost a whole generation to their own culture out here,\" rues an LAPD Assistant Commissioner in a 14 May '89 Boston TV news special on the national Wa-?On gangs, drugs, crime, Others\u20269Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1076785", "artist_names": "Richard Marx", "full_title": "Until I Find You Again by\u00a0Richard\u00a0Marx", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bfcbdf37eadd75e05000955601e9eab1.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bfcbdf37eadd75e05000955601e9eab1.300x300x1.jpg", "id": 1076785, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429622606, "path": "/Richard-marx-until-i-find-you-again-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Richard-marx-until-i-find-you-again-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/bfcbdf37eadd75e05000955601e9eab1.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/bfcbdf37eadd75e05000955601e9eab1.300x300x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Until I Find You Again", "title_with_featured": "Until I Find You Again", "updated_by_human_at": 1666917209, "url": "https://genius.com/Richard-marx-until-i-find-you-again-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/188653", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/077e8b3f5fb16affbf19661d1e603a71.1000x661x1.jpg", "id": 188653, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/92b137c47be154665d2da5797c9b3585.638x638x1.jpg", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Richard Marx", "slug": "Richard-marx", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Richard-marx"}, "artist": "Richard Marx", "lyrics": "Until I Find You Again LyricsLately I've been trying\nTo fill up my days since you're gone\nThe speed of love is blinding\nAnd I didn't know how to hold on\n\nMy mind won't clear\nI'm out of tears\nMy heart's got no room left inside\n\nHow many dreams will end\nHow long can I pretend\nHow many times will love pass me by\nUntil I find you again\nWill the arms of hope surround me\nWill time be a fair weather friend\nShould I call out to angels\nOr just drink myself sober again\n\nCan't hide it, it's true\nI still burn for you\nYour memory just won't let me go\n\nHow many dreams will end\nHow long can I pretend\nHow many times will love pass me by\nUntil I find you again\n\nI'd hold you tighter\nCloser than ever before\nYeah\nNo flame would burn brighter\nIf I could touch you once more\nHold you once more\n\nHow many dreams will end\nHow long can I pretend\nHow many times will love pass me by\nUntil I find you again\nSee Richard Marx LiveGet tickets as low as $74You might also likeUntil I find you\n\nAgainEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 2, "api_path": "/songs/17322", "artist_names": "DJ Taz (Ft.

got the Antichrist in the kitchen yelling at me again\nYeah, I can hear that\nBeen saved again by the garbage truck\nI got something to say, you know but nothing comes\nYes I know what you think of me, you never shut up\nYeah, I can hear that\n\n[Chorus]\nBut what if I'm a mermaid\nIn these jeans of his with her name still on it\nHey, but I don't care cause sometimes\nI said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been\nHere, silent all these years\n[Verse 2]\nSo you found a girl who thinks really deep thoughts\nWhat's so amazing about really deep thoughts?\nBoy, you best pray that I bleed real soon\nHow's that thought for you?\nMy scream got lost in a paper cup\nYou think there's a heaven where some screams have gone\nI got 25 bucks and a cracker, do you think it's enough\nTo get us there?\n\n[Chorus]\nBut what if I'm a mermaid\nIn these jeans of his with her name still on it\nHey, but I don't care cause sometimes\nI said sometimes I hear my voice, and it's been\nHere, silent all these\n\n[Bridge]\nYears go by, will I still be waiting\nFor somebody else to understand?\nYears go by if I'm stripped of my beauty\nAnd the orange clouds raining in my head\nYears go by, will I choke on my tears\nTill finally, there is nothing left?\nOne more casualty, you know\nWe're too easy, easy, easy\nSee Tori Amos LiveGet tickets as low as $78You might also like[Verse 3]\nWell, I love the way we communicate\nYour eyes focus on my funny lip shape\nLet's hear what you think of me now, but baby don't look up\nThe sky is falling\nYour mother shows up in a nasty dress\nAnd it's your turn now to stand where I stand\nEverybody looking at you, here, take hold of my hand\nYeah, I can hear them\n\n[Chorus]\nBut what if I'm a mermaid\nIn these jeans of yours with her name still on it\nHey, but I don't care cause sometimes\nI said sometimes I hear my voice, I hear my voice\nI hear my voice and it's been\nHere, silent all these years\n\n[Outro]\nI've been here\nSilent all these

back\nRespect the format\nY'all ain't welcome here\nI never liked them stupid door mats\nGot strats upon strats to take the earth prime\nLyrics without gimmicks to wake minds up like snorting coke lines\nI rhyme crimes divine, personalities intertwine\nSwing guillotines smoke amphetamines drink turpentine\nThe world's mine no rebuttals retorts better check the reports\nYou face the dark side of the force\nMe and panic on nega-mode Negatron\nVandalize Cybertron\nStar scream Decepticon\nGive me 5 epsilon\nOff the grid movie Tron\nPile piles on your pylon\nNo more voltage for Voltron\nYea yea, either you with it or with it\nYou ain't with it you get it\nWhen you get it you deaded\nYour whole crew catch the edit\nHenchmen spraying the leaded\nGas your block with unleaded\nAnd watch Queen Latifah set it off\nDon't want to get physical like turn your head and cough\nThere'll be side effects like you using the drug Zoloft\nI zone out but in zones I touch down\nA confounded criminal my pros is I know cons\nThat do jobs for minimal and split wigs with no salons\nFreeze\nIce beams wild schemes dreams of treason\nGet green weather machine change the seasons\nDon't need a reason just want to see the world burn\nYou're allies get it first so next its gonn' be your turn\nI'm earnest your whole squad they earned this\nIncinerating bodies putting ashes into urns quick\nThe furnace\nHave them pushing up daisies and turnips\nY'all worthless\nAin't nobody alive here to murder me\nYa'll wasting time tryin' to box against eternity\nHold it down my method call it gravity\nHit tracks with alkaline that's assault and battery\nNiggas\n[Bridge: sNo]\n\nThey never learn, They never do\nRespect is earned\nAnd thats the truth\nFall back\nYou don't want the drama\nJust stay at home\nKick it with ya baby mama\nWhat you wanna (What you wanna)\nWhat you wanna (What you wanna)\nWhat you wanna (What you wanna)\nWhat you wanna do?\nHit em with the Wu - Xi\nFinger hold, finger hold\nAll those young garden gnomes\nPlaying, think we old?\nDo what you\u2019re told\nCi-fu\n\n[Verse 2: sNo]\n\nThis is the part where I talk my shit\nAbout how we walk that shit\nAdd some bark with it\nGot fire tracks that spark visions\nHigher than the atmos or the stratus\n0.C., we on some Mars missions\nAnd ya'll rap cats is all kittens\nAnd your women's pussy we doggy style\nOn Morse code we tap it up\nSo let's wrap it up go head shorty back it up\nIf the niggas actin up they faces we smackin up\nCracking up while we jacking these fools at melee\nWorkin' hard to get moms packed up on a vacay\nAnother niggas wack staying relevant like Ray J\nTrying to up they pay grade ain't joking with y\u2019all jay kay\nWe could give a damn what he, she, or they say\nWe been outcrowd since the heyday\nSo make way\nAnd mayday\nKamikaze competition\nCall me kami\nGot ya wishing\nThat we finally\nGot diminished\nNext dimension\nFor ya'll minions\nCrew of degenerates but we been a threat\nKilling the game and winning the fame\nAnd reassemble rap\nTil we get to the ranks of Shabba Ranks\nThis think tank ain't tanking\nAnd history is formulating\nThey say when pigs fly\nWell, I see soaring bacon flow been on swine flu\nDo I need to remind you my girls sweet as some hai chu\nGod blessed me with vibes dude\nThe red barons in flight school\nAn empires our eyes view\nYour hearings impaired and your visions a lie too\nRadio ain't prepared they hide too\nSo how do I devise to take over each side through\nPretending I\u2019m high intending to slide through\nOr inventing a guide these niggas can live to\nBeat maker is side one and the emcee is side two\nBoth can kick you from the head to caboose\nBreakin' ya down two times\nSquare to the root, call us the truth and

what I'm facin'\nBut give me 7 seas and 11 G's\nI make enough cheese to bring Wall Street to its knees\nNigga please I got enough guns\nTo fill the Empire State Building full of 1's\nGo to school is what you tell us\nBut niggas in school is scared of the Goodfellas\nWe got the Yayo you can just say no\nBut nobody makes a fuckin' move until I say so\nThat's how it is and that's how it's gonna be\nKids when you grow up who the fuck you wanna be?\nLike me ya black superhero\nGot enough zeros to hire Bob Shapiro\nYa Honor I'mma have to get rid of ya\nBecause it ain't no trivia about my flat

wavin' my flag and\nNever will I ease up nigga, so stop askin'\nSee I was taught as a tiny locin' on the set\nIt's all about the pussy and money fuck the rest\nNigga what tech is quicker to collect when I'm seekin'\nAll the jewelry and the money, so miss me with that preachin' teachin'\nFuck all that bullshit I want to slang yay like Noriega\nSit back watch my paper\nCollect like the I.R.S\nAs I kick it with 50 bitches all on my dick just like the President\nAnd like the police I want a gang of killers all on my Side\nThat's down to lie more crooked that St. Ides rip ride\nOn my behalf as I call shots, as if I was Saddam Hussein\nJackin' motherfuckers for Dana Danes\nHated by many but I don't care because I rather be feared than loved\nWith a pocket full of dubs\n'Cause gangsta gangsta's, make the world go round\nAnd if you want a piece then you best to be down\nSo quit, chastisin' me, analyzin' me\nAnd like the escorts look over your shoulder nigga what's plain to

their words\nNailed by shame\nShe stares into the sun\nSelf-inflicted pain\nShe sees that they're blind\nWhy does she take all the blame?\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThe rhyme has changed, compulsion rules\nMary's little lambs are now raised by wolves\nA voyeur with wings flashes a cure\nShe knows forbidden things, they have a lovely lure\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's alright, it's okay\nWelcome to this life\nKillin' time\nJust watchin' the grass grow\n\nIt's alright, it's okay\nWelcome to this life\nDon't worry sweet baby\n'Cause it's over before you know\n\n[Verse 2]\nPersecuted she's not normal\nI envy her strange ways\nSeven deadly sins\nSeize the hour seize the day\nHer ideas need expression\nHer wounds never bleed\nHer beauty lives in my eyes\nToo bad she can't see\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nShe doesn't try, I watch her spirits die\nBut giving up the ghost would feel so good\nA voyeur with wings flashes a cure\nShe knows forbidden things they have a lovely lure\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's alright, it's okay\nWelcome to this life\nKillin' time\nJust watchin' the grass grow\n\nIt's alright, it's okay\nWelcome to this life\nDon't worry sweet baby\n'Cause it's

(Why?)\n\u2018Cause my OG younger than me\nThis nigga be tellin\u2019 me what the fuck to do\u2026\nAfter I drop him off to fuckin\u2019 school\nTime\nLet\u2019s go, Mexico\n\n[Round 3: Don Marino]\nHonestly, I feel disrespected\nYou went from Staxx Rilla to Gunpowder Patt, tryna get detected\nI went from Don Dollaz to Don Marino, we both got rejected\nNow we both got accepted\nIt\u2019s inspiration\nIt\u2019s like immigration: we both had to change our names to cross over to get accepted!\nBut check it\nEver since Cortez, there hasn\u2019t been a Spanish battler on the scene\nI gotta ask about\nI mean, I\u2019m the first Miami battler to get a PG\nBut I\u2019m always gonna back this out\nThe irony: Chino plugged me in with Powder so I could produce for SMACK\nSee how the trappers out?\nNo wonder they booked a Mexican\nWe good with numbers, but we known to pack the house!\nSo watch your mouth!\nI came a long way from the tomato fields to the lime trees!\nNow it\u2019s bars, performance, them lines mean\nSo you right, it\u2019s that pen shit, wreck shit with the rhyme schemes\nIt is forensics, \u2018cause if I go ballistic and dust Gunpowder, it\u2019s \u2018bout to be a crime scene!\nSo just know I\u2019m with the drama!\nNapoleon Dynamite: I was out back, feeding the Llama!\nIt was a must, so trust\nWe was holding up signs, waiting for the ratchet to get off the bus\nSo don\u2019t fuss!\nI hold the pound for the clowns\nYou battled Skates, right?\nMy brother, you had to use that to get around!\nI hold it down for my amigos, it\u2019s lethal\nMy uncle got caught throwing bullets on cam\u2019: he got hit with the Rico!\nSo mira, mijo, they say I\u2019m next up\nWell, that\u2019s what they say, so I need the pesos\nThey tryna push a chico in front of the class: Vote For Pedro!\nMexican bars!\nTrump finna get his sooner or later!\nBut until then, we keep looking over that fence like nosy neighbors\nI heard you had to push that mary with the ratchet and get some papers\nIronic: I had to push to get married with the ratchet and get some papers!\nMexican bars!\nThey keep throwing dirt on my name, but I dug out the hope\nSaw I.C.E. run in, get slugs from the chrome\nThat shit hurt my heart when I seen \u2018em get drug from their homes\nNow they\u2019re back in Mexico, they\u2019re smugglers\nYou wouldn\u2019t believe what they drug out of holmes!\nMexican bars!\nSee, if they raid your crib, they\u2019ll probably find everything illegal in the home\nIf they raid my crib, they\u2019ll find everyone illegal in the home!\nThey send us back, it\u2019s a danger zone\nGrip the chrome\nYou might think I have a light point\nBut trust me, E.T. was the only alien that wanted to go home!\nMexican bars!\nThey had me losing to Chess, Prez, even you, and I hate the odds\nI put on for my city, now I paid the squad\nAnd we do got other work: landscaping, painting, construction\nBut you better pray to God\n\u2018Cause if they let this Mexican into battle rap-\n\n[Gunpowder Patt]\nWhat you doin\u2019?\n\n[Don Marino]\nThen we all taking all y\u2019all jobs!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 91, "api_path":

It was a wooden house of one story, and there were no lodgers in it. On the pretext of Virginsky's-name-day party, about fifteen guests were assembled; but the entertainment was not in the least like an ordinary provincial name-day party. From the very beginning of their married life the husband and wife had agreed once for all that it was utterly stupid to invite friends to celebrate name-days, and that \"there is nothing to rejoice about in fact.\" In a few years they had succeeded in completely cutting themselves off from all society. Though he was a man of some ability, and by no means very poor, he somehow seemed to every one an eccentric fellow who was fond of solitude, and, what's more, \"stuck up in conversation.\" Madame Virginsky was a midwife by profession\u2014and by that very fact was on the lowest rung of the social ladder, lower even than the priest's wife in spite of her husband's rank as an officer. But she was conspicuously lacking in the humility befitting her position. And after her very stupid and unpardonably open liaison on principle with Captain Lebyadkin, a notorious rogue, even the most indulgent of our ladies turned away from her with marked contempt. But Madame Virginsky accepted all this as though it were what she wanted. It is remarkable that those very ladies applied to Arina Prohorovna (that is, Madame Virginsky) when they were in an interesting condition, rather than to any one of the other three accoucheuses of the town. She was sent for even by country families living in the neighbourhood, so great was the belief in her knowledge, luck, and skill in critical cases. It ended in her practising only among the wealthiest ladies; she was greedy of money. Feeling her power to the full, she ended by not putting herself out for anyone. Possibly on purpose, indeed, in her practice in the best houses she used to scare nervous patients by the most incredible and nihilistic disregard of good manners, or by jeering at \"everything holy,\" at the very time when \"everything holy\" might have come in most useful. Our town doctor, Rozanov\u2014he too was an accoucheur\u2014asserted most positively that on one occasion when a patient in labour was crying out and calling on the name of the Almighty, a free-thinking sally from Arina Prohorovna, fired off like a pistol-shot, had so terrifying an effect on the patient that it greatly accelerated her delivery.\n\nBut though she was a nihilist, Madame Virginsky did not, when occasion arose, disdain social or even old-fashioned superstitions and customs if they could be of any advantage to herself. She would never, for instance, have stayed away from a baby's christening, and always put on a green silk dress with a train and adorned her chignon with curls and ringlets for such events, though at other times she positively revelled in slovenliness. And though during the ceremony she always maintained \"the most insolent air,\" so that she put the clergy to confusion, yet when it was over she invariably handed champagne to the guests (it was for that that she came and dressed up), and it was no use trying to take the glass without a contribution to her \"porridge bowl.\"\n\nThe guests who assembled that evening at Virginsky's (mostly men) had a casual and exceptional air. There was no supper nor cards. In the middle of the large drawing-room, which was papered with extremely old blue paper, two tables had been put together and covered with a large though not quite clean table-cloth, and on them two samovars were boiling. The end of the table was taken up by a huge tray with twenty-five glasses on it and a basket with ordinary French bread cut into a number of slices, as one sees it in genteel boarding-schools for boys or girls. The tea was poured out by a maiden lady of thirty, Arina Prohorovna's sister, a silent and malevolent creature, with flaxen hair and no eyebrows, who shared her sister's progressive ideas and was an object of terror to Virginsky himself in domestic life. There were only three ladies in the room: the lady of the house, her eyebrowless sister, and Virginsky's sister, a girl who had just arrived from Petersburg. Arina Prohorovna, a good-looking and buxom woman of seven-and-twenty, rather dishevelled, in an everyday greenish woollen dress, was sitting scanning the guests with her bold eyes, and her look seemed in haste to say, \"You see I am not in the least afraid of anything.\" Miss Virginsky, a rosy-cheeked student and a nihilist, who was also good-looking, short, plump and round as a little ball, had settled herself beside Arina Prohorovna, almost in her travelling clothes. She held a roll of paper in her hand, and scrutinised the guests with impatient and roving eyes. Virginsky himself was rather unwell that evening, but he came in and sat in an easy chair by the tea-table. All the guests were sitting down too, and the orderly way in which they were ranged on chairs suggested a meeting. Evidently all were expecting something and were filling up the interval with loud but irrelevant conversation. When Stavrogin and Verhovensky appeared there was a sudden hush.\n\nBut I must be allowed to give a few explanations to make things clear.\n\nI believe that all these people had come together in the agreeable expectation of hearing something particularly interesting, and had notice of it beforehand. They were the flower of the reddest Radicalism of our ancient town, and had been carefully picked out by Virginsky for this \"meeting.\" I may remark, too, that some of them (though not very many) had never visited him before. Of course most of the guests had no clear idea why they had been summoned. It was true that at that time all took Pyotr Stepanovitch for a fully authorised emissary from abroad; this idea had somehow taken root among them at once and naturally flattered them. And yet among the citizens assembled ostensibly to keep a name-day, there were some who had been approached with definite proposals. Pyotr Verhovensky had succeeded in getting together a \"quintet\" amongst us like the one he had already formed in Moscow and, as appeared later, in our province among the officers. It was said that he had another in X province. This quintet of the elect were sitting now at the general table, and very skilfully succeeded in giving themselves the air of being quite ordinary people, so that no one could have known them. They were\u2014since it is no longer a secret\u2014first Liputin, then Virginsky himself, then Shigalov (a gentleman with long ears, the brother of Madame Virginsky), Lyamshin, and lastly a strange person called Tolkatchenko, a man of forty, who was famed for his vast knowledge of the people, especially of thieves and robbers. He used to frequent the taverns on purpose (though not only with the object of studying the people), and plumed himself on his shabby clothes, tarred boots, and crafty wink and a flourish of peasant phrases. Lyamshin had once or twice brought him to Stepan Trofimovitch's gatherings, where, however, he did not make a great sensation. He used to make his appearance in the town from time to time, chiefly when he was out of a job; he was employed on the railway.\nEvery one of these fine champions had formed this first group in the fervent conviction that their quintet was only one of hundreds and thousands of similar groups scattered all over Russia, and that they all depended on some immense central but secret power, which in its turn was intimately connected with the revolutionary movement all over Europe. But I regret to say that even at that time there was beginning to be dissension among them. Though they had ever since the spring been expecting Pyotr Verhovensky, whose coming had been heralded first by Tolkatchenko and then by the arrival of Shigalov, though they had expected extraordinary miracles from him, and though they had responded to his first summons without the slightest criticism, yet they had no sooner formed the quintet than they all somehow seemed to feel insulted; and I really believe it was owing to the promptitude with which they consented to join. They had joined, of course, from a not ignoble feeling of shame, for fear people might say afterwards that they had not dared to join; still they felt Pyotr Verhovensky ought to have appreciated their heroism and have rewarded it by telling them some really important bits of news at least. But Verhovensky was not at all inclined to satisfy their legitimate curiosity, and told them nothing but what was necessary; he treated them in general with great sternness and even rather casually. This was positively irritating, and Comrade Shigalov was already egging the others on to insist on his \"explaining himself,\" though, of course, not at Virginsky's, where so many outsiders were present.\n\nI have an idea that the above-mentioned members of the first quintet were disposed to suspect that among the guests of Virginsky's that evening some were members of other groups, unknown to them, belonging to the same secret organisation and founded in the town by the same Verhovensky; so that in fact all present were suspecting one another, and posed in various ways to one another, which gave the whole party a very perplexing and even romantic air. Yet there were persons present who were beyond all suspicion. For instance, a major in the service, a near relation of Virginsky, a perfectly innocent person who had not been invited but had come of himself for the name-day celebration, so that it was impossible not to receive him. But Virginsky was quite unperturbed, as the major was \"incapable of betraying them\"; for in spite of his stupidity he had all his life been fond of dropping in wherever extreme Radicals met; he did not sympathise with their ideas himself, but was very fond of listening to them. What's more, he had even been compromised indeed. It had happened in his youth that whole bundles of manifestoes and of numbers of The Bell had passed through his hands, and although he had been afraid even to open them, yet he would have considered it absolutely contemptible to refuse to distribute them\u2014and there are such people in Russia even to this day.\n\nThe rest of the guests were either types of honourable amour-propre crushed and embittered, or types of the generous impulsiveness of ardent youth. There were two or three teachers, of whom one, a lame man of forty-five, a master in the high school, was a very malicious and strikingly vain person; and two or three officers. Of the latter, one very young artillery officer who had only just come from a military training school, a silent lad who had not yet made friends with anyone, turned up now at Virginsky's with a pencil in his hand, and, scarcely taking any part in the conversation, continually made notes in his notebook. Everybody saw this, but every one pretended not to. There was, too, an idle divinity student who had helped Lyamshin to put indecent photographs into the gospel-woman's pack. He was a solid youth with a free-and-easy though mistrustful manner, with an unchangeably satirical smile, together with a calm air of triumphant faith in his own perfection. There was also present, I don't know why, the mayor's son, that unpleasant and prematurely exhausted youth to whom I have referred already in telling the story of the lieutenant's little wife. He was silent the whole evening. Finally there was a very enthusiastic and tousle-headed schoolboy of eighteen, who sat with the gloomy air of a young man whose dignity has been wounded, evidently distressed by his eighteen years. This infant was already the head of an independent group of conspirators which had been formed in the highest class of the gymnasium, as it came out afterwards to the surprise of every one.\n\nI haven't mentioned Shatov. He was there at the farthest corner of the table, his chair pushed back a little out of the row. He gazed at the ground, was gloomily silent, refused tea and bread, and did not for one instant let his cap go out of his hand, as though to show that he was not a visitor, but had come on business, and when he liked would get up and go away. Kirillov was not far from him. He, too, was very silent, but he did not look at the ground; on the contrary, he scrutinised intently every speaker with his fixed, lustreless eyes, and listened to everything without the slightest emotion or surprise. Some of the visitors who had never seen him before stole thoughtful glances at him. I can't say whether Madame Virginsky knew anything about the existence of the quintet. I imagine she knew everything and from her husband. The girl-student, of course, took no part in anything; but she had an anxiety of her own: she intended to stay only a day or two and then to go on farther and farther from one university town to another \"to show active sympathy with the sufferings of poor students and to rouse them to protest.\" She was taking with her some hundreds of copies of a lithographed appeal, I believe of her own composition. It is remarkable that the schoolboy conceived an almost murderous hatred for her from the first moment, though he saw her for the first time in his life; and she felt the same for him. The major was her uncle, and met her to-day for the first time after ten years. When Stavrogin and Verhovensky came in, her cheeks were as red as cranberries: she had just quarrelled with her uncle over his views on the woman question.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbsp\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0&nbspII\n\nWith conspicuous nonchalance Verhovensky lounged in the chair at the upper end of the table, almost without greeting anyone. His expression was disdainful and even haughty. Stavrogin bowed politely, but in spite of the fact that they were all only waiting for them, everybody, as though acting on instruction, appeared scarcely to notice them. The lady of the house turned severely to Stavrogin as soon as he was seated.\n\n\"Stavrogin, will you have tea?\"\n\n\"Please,\" he answered.\n\n\"Tea for Stavrogin,\" she commanded her sister at the samovar. \"And you, will you?\" (This was to Verhovensky.)\n\n\"Of course. What a question to ask a visitor! And give me cream too; you always give one such filthy stuff by way of tea, and with a name-day party in the house!\"\n\n\"What, you believe in keeping name-days too!\" the girl-student laughed suddenly. \"We were just talking of that.\"\n\n\"That's stale,\" muttered the schoolboy at the other end of the table.\n\n\"What's stale? To disregard conventions, even the most innocent is not stale; on the contrary, to the disgrace of every one, so far it's a novelty,\" the girl-student answered instantly, darting forward on her chair. \"Besides, there are no innocent conventions,\" she added with intensity.\n\"I only meant,\" cried the schoolboy with tremendous excitement, \"to say that though conventions of course are stale and must be eradicated, yet about name-days everybody knows that they are stupid and very stale to waste precious time upon, which has been wasted already all over the world, so that it would be as well to sharpen one's wits on something more useful....\"\n\n\"You drag it out so, one can't understand what you mean,\" shouted the girl.\n\n\"I think that every one has a right to express an opinion as well as every one else, and if I want to express my opinion like anybody else...\"\n\n\"No one is attacking your right to give an opinion,\" the lady of the house herself cut in sharply. \"You were only asked not to ramble because no one can make out what you mean.\"\n\n\"But allow me to remark that you are not treating me with respect. If I couldn't fully express my thought, it's not from want of thought but from too much thought,\" the schoolboy muttered, almost in despair, losing his thread completely.\n\n\"If you don't know how to talk, you'd better keep quiet,\" blurted out the girl.\n\nThe schoolboy positively jumped from his chair.\n\n\"I only wanted to state,\" he shouted, crimson with shame and afraid to look about him, \"that you only wanted to show off your cleverness because Mr. Stavrogin came in\u2014so there!\"\n\n\"That's a nasty and immoral idea and shows the worthlessness of your development. I beg you not to address me again,\" the girl rattled off.\n\n\"Stavrogin,\" began the lady of the house, \"they've been discussing the rights of the family before you came\u2014this officer here\"\u2014she nodded towards her relation, the major\u2014\"and, of course, I am not going to worry you with such stale nonsense, which has been dealt with long ago. But how have the rights and duties of the family come about in the superstitious form in which they exist at present? That's the question. What's your opinion?\"\n\n\"What do you mean by 'come about'?\" Stavrogin asked in his turn.\n\n\"We know, for instance, that the superstition about God came from thunder and lightning.\" The girl-student rushed into the fray again, staring at Stavrogin with her eyes almost jumping out of her head. \"It's well known that primitive man, scared by thunder and lightning, made a god of the unseen enemy, feeling their weakness before it. But how did the superstition of the family arise? How did the family itself arise?\"\n\n\"That's not quite the same thing....\" Madame Virginsky tried to check her.\n\"I think the answer to this question wouldn't be quite discreet,\" answered Stavrogin.\n\n\"How so?\" said the girl-student, craning forward suddenly. But there was an audible titter in the group of teachers, which was at once caught up at the other end by Lyamshin and the schoolboy and followed by a hoarse chuckle from the major.\n\n\"You ought to write vaudevilles,\" Madame Virginsky observed to Stavrogin.\n\n\"It does you no credit, I don't know what your name is,\" the girl rapped out with positive indignation.\n\n\"And don't you be too forward,\" boomed the major. \"You are a young lady and you ought to behave modestly, and you keep jumping about as though you were sitting on a needle.\"\n\n\"Kindly hold your tongue and don't address me familiarly with your nasty comparisons. I've never seen you before and I don't recognise the relationship.\"\n\n\"But I am your uncle; I used to carry you about when you were a baby!\"\n\n\"I don't care what babies you used to carry about. I didn't ask you to carry me. It must have been a pleasure to you to do so, you rude officer. And allow me to observe, don't dare to address me so familiarly, unless it's as a fellow-citizen. I forbid you to do it, once for all.\"\n\n\"There, they are all like that!\" cried the major, banging the table with his fist and addressing Stavrogin, who was sitting opposite. \"But, allow me, I am fond of Liberalism and modern ideas, and I am fond of listening to clever conversation; masculine conversation, though, I warn you. But to listen to these women, these nightly windmills\u2014no, that makes me ache all over! Don't wriggle about!\" he shouted to the girl, who was leaping up from her chair. \"No, it's my turn to speak, I've been insulted.\"\n\n\"You can't say anything yourself, and only hinder other people talking,\" the lady of the house grumbled indignantly.\n\n\"No, I will have my say,\" said the major hotly, addressing Stavrogin. \"I reckon on you, Mr. Stavrogin, as a fresh person who has only just come on the scene, though I haven't the honour of knowing you. Without men they'll perish like flies\u2014that's what I think. All their woman question is only lack of originality. I assure you that all this woman question has been invented for them by men in foolishness and to their own hurt. I only thank God I am not married. There's not the slightest variety in them, they can't even invent a simple pattern; they have to get men to invent them for them! Here I used to carry her in my arms, used to dance the mazurka with her when she was ten years old; to-day she's come, naturally I fly to embrace her, and at the second word she tells me there's no God. She might have waited a little, she was in too great a hurry! Clever people don't believe, I dare say; but that's from their cleverness. But you, chicken, what do you know about God, I said to her. 'Some student taught you, and if he'd taught you to light the lamp before the ikons you would have lighted it.'\"\n\n\"You keep telling lies, you are a very spiteful person. I proved to you just now the untenability of your position,\" the girl answered contemptuously, as though disdaining further explanations with such a man. \"I told you just now that we've all been taught in the Catechism if you honour your father and your parents you will live long and have wealth. That's in the Ten Commandments. If God thought it necessary to offer rewards for love, your God must be immoral. That's how I proved it to you. It wasn't the second word, and it was because you asserted your rights. It's not my fault if you are stupid and don't understand even now. You are offended and you are spiteful\u2014and that's what explains all your generation.\"\n\n\"You're a goose!\" said the major.\n\n\"And you are a fool!\"\n\n\"You can call me names!\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Kapiton Maximitch, you told me yourself you don't believe in God,\" Liputin piped from the other end of the table.\n\n\"What if I did say so\u2014that's a different matter. I believe, perhaps, only not altogether. Even if I don't believe altogether, still I don't say God ought to be shot. I used to think about God before I left the hussars. From all the poems you would think that hussars do nothing but carouse and drink. Yes, I did drink, maybe, but would you believe it, I used to jump out of bed at night and stood crossing myself before the images with nothing but my socks on, praying to God to give me faith; for even then I couldn't be at peace as to whether there was a God or not. It used to fret me so! In the morning, of course, one would amuse oneself and one's faith would seem to be lost again; and in fact I've noticed that faith always seems to be less in the daytime.\"\n\n\"Haven't you any cards?\" asked Verhovensky, with a mighty yawn, addressing Madame Virginsky.\n\n\"I sympathise with your question, I sympathise entirely,\" the girl-student broke in hotly, flushed with indignation at the major's words.\n\n\"We are wasting precious time listening to silly talk,\" snapped out the lady of the house, and she looked reprovingly at her husband.\n\nThe girl pulled herself together.\n\n\"I wanted to make a statement to the meeting concerning the sufferings of the students and their protest, but as time is being wasted in immoral conversation...\"\n\n\"There's no such thing as moral or immoral,\" the schoolboy brought out, unable to restrain himself as soon as the girl began.\n\n\"I knew that, Mr. Schoolboy, long before you were taught it.\"\n\n\"And I maintain,\" he answered savagely, \"that you are a child come from Petersburg to enlighten us all, though we know for ourselves the commandment 'honour thy father and thy mother,' which you could not repeat correctly; and the fact that it's immoral every one in Russia knows from Byelinsky.\"\n\n\"Are we ever to have an end of this?\" Madame Virginsky said resolutely to her husband. As the hostess, she blushed for the ineptitude of the conversation, especially as she noticed smiles and even astonishment among the guests who had been invited for the first time.\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Virginsky, suddenly lifting up his voice, \"if anyone wishes to say anything more nearly connected with our business, or has any statement to make, I call upon him to do so without wasting time.\"\n\n\"I'll venture to ask one question,\" said the lame teacher suavely. He had been sitting particularly decorously and had not spoken till then. \"I should like to know, are we some sort of meeting, or are we simply a gathering of ordinary mortals paying a visit? I ask simply for the sake of order and so as not to remain in ignorance.\"\n\nThis \"sly\" question made an impression. People looked at each other, every one expecting some one else to answer, and suddenly all, as though at a word of command, turned their eyes to Verhovensky and Stavrogin.\n\n\"I suggest our voting on the answer to the question whether we are a meeting or not,\" said Madame Virginsky.\n\n\"I entirely agree with the suggestion,\" Liputin chimed in, \"though the question is rather vague.\"\n\n\"I agree too.\"\n\n\"And so do I,\" cried voices. \"I too think it would make our proceedings more in order,\" confirmed Virginsky.\n\n\"To the vote then,\" said his wife. \"Lyamshin, please sit down to the piano; you can give your vote from there when the voting begins.\"\n\n\"Again!\" cried Lyamshin. \"I've strummed enough for you.\"\n\n\"I beg you most particularly, sit down and play. Don't you care to do anything for the cause?\"\n\n\"But I assure you, Arina Prohorovna, nobody is eavesdropping. It's only your fancy. Besides, the windows are high, and people would not understand if they did hear.\"\n\n\"We don't understand ourselves,\" some one muttered. \"But I tell you one must always be on one's guard. I mean in case there should be spies,\" she explained to Verhovensky. \"Let them hear from the street that we have music and a name-day party.\"\n\n\"Hang it all!\" Lyamshin swore, and sitting down to the piano, began strumming a valse, banging on the keys almost with his fists, at random.\n\n\"I propose that those who want it to be a meeting should put up their right hands,\" Madame Virginsky proposed.\n\nSome put them up, others did not. Some held them up and then put them down again and then held them up again. \"Foo! I don't understand it at all,\" one officer shouted. \"I don't either,\" cried the other.\n\n\"Oh, I understand,\" cried a third. \"If it's yes, you hold your hand up.\"\n\n\"But what does 'yes' mean?\"\n\n\"Means a meeting.\"\n\n\"No, it means not a meeting.\"\n\n\"I voted for a meeting,\" cried the schoolboy to Madame Virginsky.\n\n\"Then why didn't you hold up your hand?\"\n\n\"I was looking at you. You didn't hold up yours, so I didn't hold up mine.\"\n\n\"How stupid! I didn't hold up my hand because I proposed it. Gentlemen, now I propose the contrary. Those who want a meeting, sit still and do nothing; those who don't, hold up their right hands.\"\n\n\"Those who don't want it?\" inquired the schoolboy. \"Are you doing it on purpose?\" cried Madame Virginsky wrathfully.\n\n\"No. Excuse me, those who want it, or those who don't want it? For one must know that definitely,\" cried two or three voices.\n\n\"Those who don't want it\u2014those who don't want it.\"\n\n\"Yes, but what is one to do, hold up one's hand or not hold it up if one doesn't want it?\" cried an officer.\n\n\"Ech, we are not accustomed to constitutional methods yet!\" remarked the major.\n\n\"Mr. Lyamshin, excuse me, but you are thumping so that no one can hear anything,\" observed the lame teacher.\n\n\"But, upon my word, Arina Prohorovna, nobody is listening, really!\" cried Lyamshin, jumping up. \"I won't play! I've come to you as a visitor, not as a drummer!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen,\" Virginsky went on, \"answer verbally, are we a meeting or not?\"\n\n\"We are! We are!\" was heard on all sides. \"If so, there's no need to vote, that's enough. Are you satisfied, gentlemen? Is there any need to put it to the vote?\"\n\n\"No need\u2014no need, we understand.\"\n\n\"Perhaps some one doesn't want it to be a meeting?\"\n\n\"No, no; we all want it.\"\n\n\"But what does 'meeting' mean?\" cried a voice. No one answered.\n\n\"We must choose a chairman,\" people cried from different parts of the room.\n\n\"Our host, of course, our host!\"\n\n\"Gentlemen, if so,\" Virginsky, the chosen chairman, began, \"I propose my original motion. If anyone wants to say anything more relevant to the subject, or has some statement to make, let him bring it forward without loss of time.\"\n\nThere was a general silence. The eyes of all were turned again on Verhovensky and Stavrogin.\n\n\"Verhovensky, have you no statement to make?\" Madame Virginsky asked him directly.\n\n\"Nothing whatever,\" he answered, yawning and stretching on his chair. \"But I should like a glass of brandy.\"\n\n\"Stavrogin, don't you want to?\"\n\n\"Thank you, I don't drink.\"\n\n\"I mean don't you want to speak, not don't you want brandy.\"\n\n\"To speak, what about? No, I don't want to.\"\n\n\"They'll bring you some brandy,\" she answered Verhovensky.\n\nThe girl-student got up. She had darted up several times already.\n\n\"I have come to make a statement about the sufferings of poor students and the means of rousing them to protest.\"\n\nBut she broke off. At the other end of the table a rival had risen, and all eyes turned to him. Shigalov, the man with the long ears, slowly rose from his seat with a gloomy and sullen air and mournfully laid on the table a thick notebook filled with extremely small handwriting. He remained standing in silence. Many people looked at the notebook in consternation, but Liputin, Virginsky, and the lame teacher seemed pleased.\n\n\"I ask leave to address the meeting,\" Shigalov pronounced sullenly but resolutely.\n\n\"You have leave.\" Virginsky gave his sanction.\n\nThe orator sat down, was silent for half a minute, and pronounced in a solemn voice,\n\n\"Gentlemen!\"\n\n\"Here's the brandy,\" the sister who had been pouring out tea and had gone to fetch brandy rapped out, contemptuously and disdainfully putting the bottle before Verhovensky, together with the wineglass which she brought in her fingers without a tray or a plate.\n\nThe interrupted orator made a dignified pause.\n\n\"Never mind, go on, I am not listening,\" cried Verhovensky, pouring himself out a glass.\n\n\"Gentlemen, asking your attention and, as you will see later, soliciting your aid in a matter of the first importance,\" Shigalov began again, \"I must make some prefatory remarks.\"\n\n\"Arina Prohorovna, haven't you some scissors?\" Pyotr Stepanovitch asked suddenly.\n\n\"What do you want scissors for?\" she asked, with wide-open eyes.\n\n\"I've forgotten to cut my nails; I've been meaning to for the last three days,\" he observed, scrutinising his long and dirty nails with unruffled composure.\n\nArina Prohorovna crimsoned, but Miss Virginsky seemed pleased.\n\n\"I believe I saw them just now on the window.\" She got up from the table, went and found the scissors, and at once brought them. Pyotr Stepanovitch did not even look at her, took the scissors, and set to work with them. Arina Prohorovna grasped that these were realistic manners, and was ashamed of her sensitiveness. People looked at one another in silence. The lame teacher looked vindictively and enviously at Verhovensky. Shigalov went on.\n\n\"Dedicating my energies to the study of the social organisation which is in the future to replace the present condition of things, I've come to the conviction that all makers of social systems from ancient times up to the present year, 187-, have been dreamers, tellers of fairy-tales, fools who contradicted themselves, who understood nothing of natural science and the strange animal called man. Plato, Rousseau, Fourier, columns of aluminium, are only fit for sparrows and not for human society. But, now that we are all at last preparing to act, a new form of social organisation is essential. In order to avoid further uncertainty, I propose my own system of world-organisation. Here it is.\" He tapped the notebook. \"I wanted to expound my views to the meeting in the most concise form possible, but I see that I should need to add a great many verbal explanations, and so the whole exposition would occupy at least ten evenings, one for each of my chapters.\" (There was the sound of laughter.) \"I must add, besides, that my system is not yet complete.\" (Laughter again.) \"I am perplexed by my own data and my conclusion is a direct contradiction of the original idea with which I start. Starting from unlimited freedom, I arrive at unlimited despotism. I will add, however, that there can be no solution of the social problem but mine.\"\n\nThe laughter grew louder and louder, but it came chiefly from the younger and less initiated visitors. There was an expression of some annoyance on the faces of Madame Virginsky, Liputin, and the lame teacher.\n\n\"If you've been unsuccessful in making your system consistent, and have been reduced to despair yourself, what could we do with it?\" one officer observed warily.\n\n\"You are right, Mr. Officer\"\u2014Shigalov turned sharply to him\u2014\"especially in using the word despair. Yes, I am reduced to despair. Nevertheless, nothing can take the place of the system set forth in my book, and there is no other way out of it; no one can invent anything else. And so I hasten without loss of time to invite the whole society to listen for ten evenings to my book and then give their opinions of it. If the members are unwilling to listen to me, let us break up from the start\u2014the men to take up service under government, the women to their cooking; for if you reject my solution you'll find no other, none whatever! If they let the opportunity slip, it will simply be their loss, for they will be bound to come back to it again.\"\n\nThere was a stir in the company. \"Is he mad, or what?\" voices asked.\n\n\"So the whole point lies in Shigalov's despair,\" Lyamshin commented, \"and the essential question is whether he must despair or not?\"\n\n\"Shigalov's being on the brink of despair is a personal question,\" declared the schoolboy.\n\n\"I propose we put it to the vote how far Shigalov's despair affects the common cause, and at the same time whether it's worth while listening to him or not,\" an officer suggested gaily.\n\n\"That's not right.\" The lame teacher put in his spoke at last. As a rule he spoke with a rather mocking smile, so that it was difficult to make out whether he was in earnest or joking. \"That's not right, gentlemen. Mr. Shigalov is too much devoted to his task and is also too modest. I know his book. He suggests as a final solution of the question the division of mankind into two unequal parts. One-tenth enjoys absolute liberty and unbounded power over the other nine-tenths. The others have to give up all individuality and become, so to speak, a herd, and, through boundless submission, will by a series of regenerations attain prim\u00e6val innocence, something like the Garden of Eden. They'll have to work, however. The measures proposed by the author for depriving nine-tenths of mankind of their freedom and transforming them into a herd through the education of whole generations are very remarkable, founded on the facts of nature and highly logical. One may not agree with some of the deductions, but it would be difficult to doubt the intelligence and knowledge of the author. It's a pity that the time required\u2014ten evenings\u2014is impossible to arrange for, or we might hear a great deal that's interesting.\"\n\n\"Can you be in earnest?\" Madame Virginsky addressed the lame gentleman with a shade of positive uneasiness in her voice, \"when that man doesn't know what to do with people and so turns nine-tenths of them into slaves? I've suspected him for a long time.\"\n\n\"You say that of your own brother?\" asked the lame man.\n\n\"Relationship? Are you laughing at me?\"\n\n\"And besides, to work for aristocrats and to obey them as though they were gods is contemptible!\" observed the girl-student fiercely.\n\n\"What I propose is not contemptible; it's paradise, an earthly paradise, and there can be no other on earth,\" Shigalov pronounced authoritatively.\n\n\"For my part,\" said Lyamshin, \"if I didn't know what to do with nine-tenths of mankind, I'd take them and blow them up into the air instead of putting them in paradise. I'd only leave a handful of educated people, who would live happily ever afterwards on scientific principles.\"\n\n\"No one but a buffoon can talk like that!\" cried the girl, flaring up.\n\n\"He is a buffoon, but he is of use,\" Madame Virginsky whispered to her.\n\n\"And possibly that would be the best solution of the problem,\" said Shigalov, turning hotly to Lyamshin. \"You certainly don't know what a profound thing you've succeeded in saying, my merry friend. But as it's hardly possible to carry out your idea, we must confine ourselves to an earthly paradise, since that's what they call it.\"\n\n\"This is pretty thorough rot,\" broke, as though involuntarily, from Verhovensky. Without even raising his eyes, however, he went on cutting his nails with perfect nonchalance.\n\n\"Why is it rot?\" The lame man took it up instantly, as though he had been lying in wait for his first words to catch at them. \"Why is it rot? Mr. Shigalov is somewhat fanatical in his love for humanity, but remember that Fourier, still more Cabet and even Proudhon himself, advocated a number of the most despotic and even fantastic measures. Mr. Shigalov is perhaps far more sober in his suggestions than they are. I assure you that when one reads his book it's almost impossible not to agree with some things. He is perhaps less far from realism than anyone and his earthly paradise is almost the real one\u2014if it ever existed\u2014for the loss of which man is always sighing.\"\n\n\"I knew I was in for something,\" Verhovensky muttered again.\n\n\"Allow me,\" said the lame man, getting more and more excited. \"Conversations and arguments about the future organisation of society are almost an actual necessity for all thinking people nowadays. Herzen was occupied with nothing else all his life. Byelinsky, as I know on very good authority, used to spend whole evenings with his friends debating and settling beforehand even the minutest, so to speak, domestic, details of the social organisation of the future.\"\n\n\"Some people go crazy over it,\" the major observed suddenly.\n\n\"We are more likely to arrive at something by talking, anyway, than by sitting silent and posing as dictators,\" Liputin hissed, as though at last venturing to begin the attack.\n\n\"I didn't mean Shigalov when I said it was rot,\" Verhovensky mumbled. \"You see, gentlemen,\"\u2014he raised his eyes a trifle\u2014\"to my mind all these books, Fourier, Cabet, all this talk about the right to work, and Shigalov's theories\u2014are all like novels of which one can write a hundred thousand\u2014an \u00e6sthetic entertainment. I can understand that in this little town you are bored, so you rush to ink and paper.\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" said the lame man, wriggling on his chair, \"though we are provincials and of course objects of commiseration on that ground, yet we know that so far nothing has happened in the world new enough to be worth our weeping at having missed it. It is suggested to us in various pamphlets made abroad and secretly distributed that we should unite and form groups with the sole object of bringing about universal destruction. It's urged that, however much you tinker with the world, you can't make a good job of it, but that by cutting off a hundred million heads and so lightening one's burden, one can jump over the ditch more safely. A fine idea, no doubt, but quite as impracticable as Shigalov's theories, which you referred to just now so contemptuously.\"\n\n\"Well, but I haven't come here for discussion.\" Verhovensky let drop this significant phrase, and, as though quite unaware of his blunder, drew the candle nearer to him that he might see better.\n\n\"It's a pity, a great pity, that you haven't come for discussion, and it's a great pity that you are so taken up just now with your toilet.\"\n\n\"What's my toilet to you?\"\n\n\"To remove a hundred million heads is as difficult as to transform the world by propaganda. Possibly more difficult, especially in Russia,\" Liputin ventured again.\n\n\"It's Russia they rest their hopes on now,\" said an officer.\n\n\"We've heard they are resting their hopes on it,\" interposed the lame man. \"We know that a mysterious finger is pointing to our delightful country as the land most fitted to accomplish the great task. But there's this: by the gradual solution of the problem by propaganda I shall gain something, anyway\u2014I shall have some pleasant talk, at least, and shall even get some recognition from government for my services to the cause of society. But in the second way, by the rapid method of cutting off a hundred million heads, what benefit shall I get personally? If you began advocating that, your tongue might be cut out.\"\n\n\"Yours certainly would be,\" observed Verhovensky.\n\n\"You see. And as under the most favourable circumstances you would not get through such a massacre in less than fifty or at the best thirty years\u2014for they are not sheep, you know, and perhaps they would not let themselves be slaughtered\u2014wouldn't it be better to pack one's bundle and migrate to some quiet island beyond calm seas and there close one's eyes tranquilly? Believe me\"\u2014he tapped the table significantly with his finger\u2014\"you will only promote emigration by such propaganda and nothing else!\"\n\nHe finished evidently triumphant. He was one of the intellects of the province. Liputin smiled slyly, Virginsky listened rather dejectedly, the others followed the discussion with great attention, especially the ladies and officers. They all realised that the advocate of the hundred million heads theory had been driven into a corner, and waited to see what would come of it.\n\n\"That was a good saying of yours, though,\" Verhovensky mumbled more carelessly than ever, in fact with an air of positive boredom. \"Emigration is a good idea. But all the same, if in spite of all the obvious disadvantages you foresee, more and more come forward every day ready to fight for the common cause, it will be able to do without you. It's a new religion, my good friend, coming to take the place of the old one. That's why so many fighters come forward, and it's a big movement. You'd better emigrate! And, you know, I should advise Dresden, not 'the calm islands.' To begin with, it's a town that has never been visited by an epidemic, and as you are a man of culture, no doubt you are afraid of death. Another thing, it's near the Russian frontier, so you can more easily receive your income from your beloved Fatherland. Thirdly, it contains what are called treasures of art, and you are a man of \u00e6sthetic tastes, formerly a teacher of literature, I believe. And, finally, it has a miniature Switzerland of its own\u2014to provide you with poetic inspiration, for no doubt you write verse. In fact it's a treasure in a nutshell!\" There was a general movement, especially among the officers. In another instant they would have all begun talking at once. But the lame man rose irritably to the bait.\n\n\"No, perhaps I am not going to give up the common cause. You must understand that...\"\n\n\"What, would you join the quintet if I proposed it to you?\" Verhovensky boomed suddenly, and he laid down the scissors.\n\nEvery one seemed startled. The mysterious man had revealed himself too freely. He had even spoken openly of the \"quintet.\"\n\n\"Every one feels himself to be an honest man and will not shirk his part in the common cause\"\u2014the lame man tried to wriggle out of it\u2014\"but...\"\n\n\"No, this is not a question which allows of a but,\" Verhovensky interrupted harshly and peremptorily. \"I tell you, gentlemen, I must have a direct answer. I quite understand that, having come here and having called you together myself, I am bound to give you explanations\" (again an unexpected revelation), \"but I can give you none till I know what is your attitude to the subject. To cut the matter short\u2014for we can't go on talking for another thirty years as people have done for the last thirty\u2014I ask you which you prefer: the slow way, which consists in the composition of socialistic romances and the academic ordering of the destinies of humanity a thousand years hence, while despotism will swallow the savoury morsels which would almost fly into your mouths of themselves if you'd take a little trouble; or do you, whatever it may imply, prefer a quicker way which will at last untie your hands, and will let humanity make its own social organisation in freedom and in action, not on paper? They shout 'a hundred million heads'; that may be only a metaphor; but why be afraid of it if, with the slow day-dream on paper, despotism in the course of some hundred years will devour not a hundred but five hundred million heads? Take note too that an incurable invalid will not be cured whatever prescriptions are written for him on paper. On the contrary, if there is delay, he will grow so corrupt that he will infect us too and contaminate all the fresh forces which one might still reckon upon now, so that we shall all at last come to grief together. I thoroughly agree that it's extremely agreeable to chatter liberally and eloquently, but action is a little trying.... However, I am no hand at talking; I came here with communications, and so I beg all the honourable company not to vote, but simply and directly to state which you prefer: walking at a snail's pace in the marsh, or putting on full steam to get across it?\"\n\n\"I am certainly for crossing at full steam!\" cried the schoolboy in an ecstasy.\n\n\"So am I,\" Lyamshin chimed in.\n\n\"There can be no doubt about the choice,\" muttered an officer, followed by another, then by some one else. What struck them all most was that Verhovensky had come \"with communications\" and had himself just promised to speak.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I see that almost all decide for the policy of the manifestoes,\" he said, looking round at the company.\n\n\"All, all!\" cried the majority of voices.\n\n\"I confess I am rather in favour of a more humane policy,\" said the major, \"but as all are on the other side, I go with all the rest.\"\n\n\"It appears, then, that even you are not opposed to it,\" said Verhovensky, addressing the lame man.\n\n\"I am not exactly...\" said the latter, turning rather red, \"but if I do agree with the rest now, it's simply not to break up\u2014\"\n\n\"You are all like that! Ready to argue for six months to practise your Liberal eloquence and in the end you vote the same as the rest! Gentlemen, consider though, is it true that you are all ready?\"\n\n(Ready for what? The question was vague, but very alluring.)\n\n\"All are, of course!\" voices were heard. But all were looking at one another.\n\n\"But afterwards perhaps you will resent having agreed so quickly? That's almost always the way with you.\"\n\nThe company was excited in various ways, greatly excited. The lame man flew at him.\n\n\"Allow me to observe, however, that answers to such questions are conditional. Even if we have given our decision, you must note that questions put in such a strange way...\"\n\n\"In what strange way?\"\n\n\"In a way such questions are not asked.\"\n\n\"Teach me how, please. But do you know, I felt sure you'd be the first to take offence.\"\n\n\"You've extracted from us an answer as to our readiness for immediate action; but what right had you to do so? By what authority do you ask such questions?\"\n\n\"You should have thought of asking that question sooner! Why did you answer? You agree and then you go back on it!\"\n\n\"But to my mind the irresponsibility of your principal question suggests to me that you have no authority, no right, and only asked from personal curiosity.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? What do you mean?\" cried Verhovensky, apparently beginning to be much alarmed.\n\n\"Why, that the initiation of new members into anything you like is done, anyway, t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate and not in the company of twenty people one doesn't know!\" blurted out the lame man. He had said all that was in his mind because he was too irritated to restrain himself. Verhovensky turned to the general company with a capitally simulated look of alarm.\n\n\"Gentlemen, I deem it my duty to declare that all this is folly, and that our conversation has gone too far. I have so far initiated no one, and no one has the right to say of me that I initiate members. We were simply discussing our opinions. That's so, isn't it? But whether that's so or not, you alarm me very much.\" He turned to the lame man again. \"I had no idea that it was unsafe here to speak of such practically innocent matters except t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. Are you afraid of informers? Can there possibly be an informer among us here?\"\n\nThe excitement became tremendous; all began talking.\n\n\"Gentlemen, if that is so,\" Verhovensky went on, \"I have compromised myself more than anyone, and so I will ask you to answer one question, if you care to, of course. You are all perfectly free.\"\n\n\"What question? What question?\" every one clamoured.\n\n\"A question that will make it clear whether we are to remain together, or take up our hats and go our several ways without speaking.\"\n\n\"The question! The question!\"\n\n\"If any one of us knew of a proposed political murder, would he, in view of all the consequences, go to give information, or would he stay at home and await events? Opinions may differ on this point. The answer to the question will tell us clearly whether we are to separate, or to remain together and for far longer than this one evening. Let me appeal to you first.\" He turned to the lame man.\n\n\"Why to me first?\"\n\n\"Because you began it all. Be so good as not to prevaricate; it won't help you to be cunning. But please yourself, it's for you to decide.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, but such a question is positively insulting.\"\n\n\"No, can't you be more exact than that?\"\n\n\"I've never been an agent of the Secret Police,\" replied the latter, wriggling more than ever.\n\n\"Be so good as to be more definite, don't keep us waiting.\"\n\nThe lame man was so furious that he left off answering. Without a word he glared wrathfully from under his spectacles at his tormentor.\n\n\"Yes or no? Would you inform or not?\" cried Verhovensky.\n\n\"Of course I wouldn't,\" the lame man shouted twice as loudly.\n\n\"And no one would, of course not!\" cried many voices.\n\n\"Allow me to appeal to you, Mr. Major. Would you inform or not?\" Verhovensky went on. \"And note that I appeal to you on purpose.\"\n\n\"I won't inform.\"\n\n\"But if you knew that some one meant to rob and murder some one else, an ordinary mortal, then you would inform and give warning?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course; but that's a private affair, while the other would be a political treachery. I've never been an agent of the Secret Police.\"\n\n\"And no one here has,\" voices cried again. \"It's an unnecessary question. Every one will make the same answer. There are no informers here.\"\n\n\"What is that gentleman getting up for?\" cried the girl-student.\n\n\"That's Shatov. What are you getting up for?\" cried the lady of the house.\n\nShatov did, in fact, stand up. He was holding his cap in his hand and looking at Verhovensky. Apparently he wanted to say something to him, but was hesitating. His face was pale and wrathful, but he controlled himself. He did not say one word, but in silence walked towards the door.\n\n\"Shatov, this won't make things better for you!\" Verhovensky called after him enigmatically.\n\n\"But it will for you, since you are a spy and a scoundrel!\" Shatov shouted to him from the door, and he went out.\n\nShouts and exclamations again.\n\n\"That's what comes of a test,\" cried a voice.\n\n\"It's been of use,\" cried another.\n\n\"Hasn't it been of use too late?\" observed a third.\n\n\"Who invited him? Who let him in? Who is he? Who is Shatov? Will he inform, or won't he?\" There was a shower of questions.\n\n\"If he were an informer he would have kept up appearances instead of cursing it all and going away,\" observed some one.\n\n\"See, Stavrogin is getting up too. Stavrogin has not answered the question either,\" cried the girl-student.\n\nStavrogin did actually stand up, and at the other end of the table Kirillov rose at the same time.\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Stavrogin,\" Madame Virginsky addressed him sharply, \"we all answered the question, while you are going away without a word.\"\n\n\"I see no necessity to answer the question which interests you,\" muttered Stavrogin.\n\n\"But we've compromised ourselves and you won't,\" shouted several voices.\n\n\"What business is it of mine if you have compromised yourselves?\" laughed Stavrogin, but his eyes flashed.\n\n\"What business? What business?\" voices exclaimed.\n\nMany people got up from their chairs.\n\n\"Allow me, gentlemen, allow me,\" cried the lame man. \"Mr. Verhovensky hasn't answered the question either; he has only asked it.\"\n\nThe remark produced a striking effect. All looked at one another. Stavrogin laughed aloud in the lame man's face and went out; Kirillov followed him; Verhovensky ran after them into the passage.\n\n\"What are you doing?\" he faltered, seizing Stavrogin's hand and gripping it with all his might in his. Stavrogin pulled away his hand without a word.\n\nBe at Kirillov's directly, I'll come.... It's absolutely necessary for me to see you!...\"\n\n\"It isn't necessary for me,\" Stavrogin cut him short.\n\n\"Stavrogin will be there,\" Kirillov said finally. \"Stavrogin, it is necessary for you. I will show you that there.\"\n\nThey went out.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/876138", "artist_names": "Rod Stewart", "full_title": "If We Fall in Love Tonight

to the phone with a slow limp\nIn a trip that shitted with 3-1-2-7-6-2-10\nThree-line connection\nAs the rest of them wanted affection\nJust bring the weed, we got the drinks you need\nAnd, plus, we strapped with two protections\nI put the phone in the hook, then I pause for a minute\n'Cause I forgot where I met the ho\nAnd the feeling I've forgotten if the hoes wanna snap\nI straight up check

A jet-black vintage sports car sails down Sunset, cruising through the adult Disneyland that is nighttime Los Angeles. Neon and billboards reflected on the windshield.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Turn the music down, sir. ... Hey, cut the music.\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckling) I'm sorry.\n\nMusic volume decreases.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: You know why I pulled you over?\n\nLUCIFER: Well, obviously, you felt the need to exercise your limited powers and punish me for ignoring the speed limit. It's okay. I understand. I-I like to punish peopl\u0435, too. Or at least I used to.\nPOLICE OFFICER: Licens\u0435 and registration.\n\nLUCIFER: (sighs) Coming right up.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Are you trying to bribe me, sir?\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, of course. Is that not enough? Take more. It's only money.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: It's against the law, sir.\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) You people are funny about your laws, aren't you? You break the law sometimes, don't you?\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Sometimes... I put my siren on and drive really fast for no reason at all, just 'cause I can.\n\nLUCIFER: Right? And why wouldn't you? It's fun. It feels good to get away with something, doesn't it?\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Yeah.\n\nLUCIFER: Uh, it's okay, Officer. People like to tell me things, those deep, dark, naughty little desires that are on their mind. It's a gift. Must be something about this face. You're tempted to keep that, aren't you? Well, what are you waiting for, permission? Go on, take it, buy yourself something pretty. You deserve it. But if you don't mind, I really must be on my way.\n\nPOLICE OFFICER: Oh, yeah, of course. Hey, have a nice evening.\n\nLUCIFER: You, too, Officer. You, too.\n\nMusic volume increases. Lucifer pulls up in front of his bar, Lux.\nVALET PARKER: Hey, boss.\n\n\"Fame\" by David Bowie playing. Lucifer glides through... soaking up the sights and sounds of elegant debauchery like a proud, modern-day Gatsby. His eyes land on the exotic, dark-haired beauty tending bar over yonder. Mazikeen. She leans seductively with her back against the bar, doesn\u2019t turn around as Lucifer approaches...\n\nMAZE: Where have you been?\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, holed up in a ch\u00e2teau, copulating with a young woman named Faith. It's ironic, isn't it?\n\nMAZE: Thank you, Patrick. You can go.\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) You little devil.\n\nMAZE: What? I dropped something.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I'm sure you did.\n\nMAZE: Now, Lucifer, I am a big fan of sex.\n\nLUCIFER: Obviously.\n\nMAZE: But I didn't leave Hell to be a bartender. Shouldn't you be spending your valuable time doing something more significant? (Lucifer scoffs.) You're the lord of Hell, for crying out loud.\n\nLUCIFER: I am retired, Maze. I've got nothing but time. Thank you.\n\nMusic plays in slow motion.\nMAZE: I think you have a visitor.\n\nLucifer sighs. Through the slow-motion crowd, Lucifer sees Amenadiel. The man is a study in grim intensity. He\u2019s Lucifer\u2019s brother and an angel. But Amenadiel\u2019s also a badass. Last thing he radiates is angelic goodness.\n\nLUCIFER: Amenadiel, how's it hanging, big guy? Huh?\n\nAMENADIEL: Your return to the Underworld has been requested.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, right, okay. Let me just, uh, check my calendar. Yeah, here it is. Uh, the seventh of never through to the 15th of ain't-gonna-happen. How does that work for you guys?\n\nAmenadiel just stares at him... grim, not amused.\n\nLUCIFER: (sighs) Look, remind Dad that I quit Hell because I was sick and tired of playing a part in his play.\n\nAMENADIEL: I'm gonna warn you against disrespecting our father, Lucifer.\n\nLUCIFER: Yeah, well, our father's been disrespecting me since the beginning of time, so pot-kettle, don't you think?\n\nAMENADIEL: You are a mockery of everything divine.\n\nLUCIFER: Thank you. Thank you, but lately I've been doing a fair amount of thinking. Now, do you think I'm the Devil because I'm inherently evil, just because dear old Dad decided I was?\n\nAMENADIEL: What exactly do you think happens when the Devil leaves Hell? (Lucifer scoffs.) All of those demons, all of those tormented and tortured souls, where do you think they go?\n\nLUCIFER: Don't know, don't care. Not my problem, brother. So consider the position officially open. And you, my feathered friend, can go to Hell. (In a blink, Amenadiel's wing-tip is at Lucifer's throat. Ancient steel fused at its tips. But Lucifer doesn't flinch, chuckles.) Yeah, try it. You think Father's upset now. (chuckles)\n\nAMENADIEL: You know, he will not be merciful for much longer.\n\nThreat planted, Amenadiel withdraws, and exits... and the club now slips back into regular motion. Lucifer only now deflates. Amenadiel clearly rattles him.\nLucifer stands outside, spinning a coin in his hand, still thinking about his conversation with Amenadiel... when a taxi slows to a stop in front of Lux. The rear window rolls down. A beautiful, hot mess appears. This is Delilah.\n\nDELILAH: Hey, you. Remember me?\n\nLUCIFER: (smiles... of course he does but teases...) You're famous, aren't you?\n\nGIRL: Delilah!\n\nLUCIFER: Delilah, isn't it?\n\nGIRL: I love you, Delilah!\n\nLUCIFER: Can I have your autograph?\n\nDELILAH: (chuckles) If I can have a drink.\n\nLux. Lucifer and Delilah sit at a booth.\n\nLUCIFER: So are you gonna tell me why you really came back?\n\nDELILAH: There's something I need to know.\n\nLUCIFER: And what's that?\n\nDELILAH: Did I... sell my soul to the Devil?\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) Well, that would imply the Devil's actually interested in your soul. Look, all I did was introduce you to a few key people who owed me favors, that's all.\n\nDELILAH: I mean, with all the good came a hell of a lot of bad.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, right, so the Devil made you do it, did he? The alcohol and the drugs, the topless selfies. The choices are on you, my dear. I mean, Jimmy Barnes? I can't believe you almost married that sweaty little imp.\n\nDELILAH: He produced my album. You introduced me to him.\n\nLUCIFER: I suggested you work with him, not sleep with him.\n\nDELILAH: Well, I got confused.\n\nLUCIFER: And then you left him at the altar.\n\nDELILAH: Yeah, that was rude of me.\n\nLUCIFER: No, actually, I quite enjoyed that bit. (both chuckle)\n\nDELILAH: You know, he trapped me in the bathroom at the Grammys, said he wanted to get back together. Then I hear he's marrying a supermodel... this weekend. And I'm jealous. Oh, God, I'm a mess.\n\nLUCIFER: God has nothing to do with your mess. Look... You didn't sell your soul, Delilah. You do owe me a favor.\n\nDELILAH: I'm scared.\n\nLUCIFER: You should be. Because what I'm about to ask you is gonna be quite difficult for you. Pull yourself together. That's it, that's all I'm asking. 'Cause you're wasting your talent, your life.\n\nDELILAH: Hmm?\n\nLUCIFER: You're human, darling. (chuckles)\nLucifer and Delilah walk out... saying goodbye...\n\nDELILAH: I'm gonna do as you asked. I'm gonna get it together. Promise, Lucifer.\n\nLUCIFER: Look, it's not about me. What happens now, that's up to you. Okay?\n\nDELILAH: Yeah.\n\nLUCIFER: Come here, you.\n\nTires squealing. Gunshots. A car accident.\n\nLUCIFER: (gasps) Oh, no, no, no, not yet.\n\nThe shooter in the car wreck gasps.\n\nLUCIFER: What did you do?\n\nSHOOTER: I'm sorry.\n\nLUCIFER: \"Sorry.\" Why did you end her life?\n\nSHOOTER: Why else? Money.\n\nLUCIFER: \"Money.\" Oh, it's times like this I wish I was still in Hell. All the fun activities I'd have planned for you.\n\nSHOOTER: Hey, man, I just pulled the trigger. (gasps, exhales weakly)\nSiren wails in distance. Helicopter whirring. \u0410 full-blown crime scene. Cherry tops spin. Police swarm. Coronor\u2019s put Delilah\u2019s body in a bag and into the back of their van as an unmarked cop car pulls up. Out hops LAPD homicide detective Chloe Decker. Beautiful, but downplays it on purpose. She\u2019s smart, cold and direct. Another plain-clothed detective walks up from the other direction. He\u2019s Daniel Espinoza.\n\nMAN: Want to hear what I've got so far?\n\nCHLOE: Lieutenant said this is my case.\n\nDAN: Yeah, Chloe, it is your case, but try not to take too much time. It's an easy one. That's our bad guy. Eddie Deacon, he's a low-level drug dealer. I found these in his pocket, and I found this in Delilah's purse, so obviously drug-related. She probably owed him a bunch of cash or something. She's not exactly selling out stadiums these days.\n\nCHLOE: How do you know he's low-level?\n\nDAN: Look at his car.\n\nCHLOE: Did you look at his watch? That thing ain't cheap.\n\nDAN: It's probably fake. Look... there's gonna be a lot of attention on this one, Chloe. I wouldn't pick at it too hard. Not after Palmetto Street.\n\nCHLOE: I asked for this case because of Palmetto Street, Dan. So, anyway, any witnesses?\n\nLUCIFER: Lucifer Morningstar.\n\nCHLOE: \"Lucifer Morningstar\"? Is that, uh, a stage name or something?\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) God-given, I'm afraid. You know, you look familiar. Have we met before?\n\nCHLOE: Yeah, five minutes ago. And I'm asking the questions. Talk to me about your relationship with the victim.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, she used to work here a few years back. I would occasionally accompany her while she sang. Then she became a big star and someone decided to end her life.\n\nCHLOE: Do you know the shooter?\n\nLUCIFER: No, but we did have an interesting little chat just before he kicked off. I asked him why he did it.\n\nCHLOE: Huh, like to play cop, do you?\n\nLUCIFER: (laughs) No, I just like to play in general, Detective. What about you?\n\nCHLOE: So, you had a conversation with a dead guy?\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, no, he wasn't quite dead. His soul hadn't crossed the threshold.\n\nCHLOE: I see. Did he tell you why he did it?\n\nLUCIFER: Why, money, of course. You humans, you love your money, don't you?\n\nCHLOE: Yes. Yes, we do. And, uh, what planet are you from... London? (laughs)\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, he also said, \"I just pulled the trigger.\" Now, don't you think that's interesting?\n\nCHLOE: Delilah was shot to death by a drug dealer. And looks like Delilah herself kept the guy pretty busy. You know, it's sad, it's ugly, but it's not rocket science. Something probably went south between them. She gets riddled with bullets, and a nice little act of God takes him out.\n\nLUCIFER: You know, it doesn't work like that, Detective. It's quite a neatly wrapped little present for the LAPD, don't you think?\n\nCHLOE: Why don't you tell me something? How does she end up dying in a hailstorm of bullets, and you get away without a scratch? I think that's interesting. Don't you?\n\nLUCIFER: The benefits of immortality.\n\nCHLOE: \"Immortality.\" Mm, of course, uh, you spell that with one or two M's? I always forget.\n\nLUCIFER: What will your corrupt little organization do about this?\n\nCHLOE: Excuse me?\n\nLUCIFER: Will you find the person responsible? Will they be punished? Will this be a priority for you? Because it is for me.\n\nCHLOE: You got some balls on you, pal.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, thank you very much, but they're really quite average.\n\nCHLOE: I bet.\n\nLUCIFER: Now, are you sure that we haven't met? I could swear I've seen you naked. Have we had sex?\n\nCHLOE: We're done here.\n\nLUCIFER: Uh, Detective, wait! Someone out there needs to be punished. We're not done.\n\nCHLOE: Yeah. Yeah, we are.\n\nREVEREND: If there is anyone here that would oppose this holy union, speak now or forever hold your peace.\n\nLUCIFER: Excuse me. Yeah, I have a problem. Has-has anyone else noticed how incredibly, jaw-droppingly, loin-stirringly beautiful this young woman is and how short, sweaty and altogether fugly this homunculus is? I mean, what is this... a wedding or a kidnapping? Do you know what I mean? Yeah, good luck with that, Padre. Ooh, why you're at it, say hey for me. It's been a while. (chuckles) Jimmy Barnes! Remember me?\n\nJIMMY: Hey, man, this is a private event. How did you get in here?\n\nLUCIFER: Yeah, and quite a lavish one for a record producer on the outs. You do remember me, don't you?\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, yeah, I remember you. Now, what do you want? I'm a little busy.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I can't believe that you're getting married the day after your ex-fianc\u00e9e and once brightest star was murdered in cold blood.\n\nJIMMY: Yeah, that's very sad. But you know what, she ruined my wedding once. I'm not about to let that happen again.\n\nLUCIFER: It's hard to be rejected, isn't it, Jimmy? Twice. (chuckles)\n\nJIMMY: What?\n\nLUCIFER: Well, you tried to get her back recently. I mean, I'd kill someone if they denied me once. Not that that's possible. So, come on, what do you say, Jimbo, huh? Did you want her dead?\n\nJIMMY: Look, stop looking at me that way, you freak. I am not playing that mind game with you. No, of course not! I was furious and I was humiliated when she dumped me, but I think, I-I think I've rebounded pretty well.\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, clearly. Respect.\n\nJIMMY: Should go play your mind games with 2Vile.\n\nLUCIFER: The rapper?\n\nJIMMY: Come on. Delilah dumped me for that lunatic. They were always fighting. He slapped her around a bunch. He surrounds himself with gun-toting morons 24-7. He is the real deal.\n\nLUCIFER: Right. (to the bride)Sorry, how rude. Allow me to introduce myself. Lucifer Morningstar.\n\nBRIDE: I really don't want to have sex with him tonight. (congregation gasping) Oh, my... I'm sorry, I... I can't believe I just said that.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, no, no, no. Let's be honest here. I mean, you're not marrying this human stain 'cause you're actually in love with him, right?\n\nBRIDE: God no.\n\nLUCIFER: No. Right. (claps) Well, I should get going. Ooh! Best of luck with you crazy kids, all right?\n\n\"Devil's Haircut\" by Beck playing. Doorbell rings.\n\nBUTLER: Good afternoon, sir.\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, I'm here to see the man sadly known as 2Vile... is he in?\n\nBUTLER: I'm sorry, sir. He's unavailable. He's in mourning, I'm afraid.\n\nLUCIFER: Right. I have narcotics for him.\n\nBUTLER: Right this way, sir.\n\nLucifer follows the Butler into the den. Furniture from MOMA. Killer city views. The ultimate in tacky Hollywood living.\n\nWOMAN: Here you go, baby.\n\nLUCIFER: Can someone please turn down this god-awful music! Hello, disc jockey! Thank you.\n\nTattooed hip-hop thug 2Vile appears through a thick haze of pot smoke.\n\n2VILE: Who's this clown?\n\nBUTLER: He has narcotics for you, sir.\n\nLUCIFER: My name is Lucifer Morningstar.\n\n2VILE: \"Lucifer Morningstar\"? (laughs) Now, that's a good hip-hop name.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, that offends me.\n\n2VILE: What, you don't like hip-hop?\n\nLUCIFER: No, I most certainly do not.\n\n2VILE: Well, that offends me. You have a problem with black people?\n\nLUCIFER: No, not in the slightest. I just hate your music. (laughs) And when I say \"your music,\" I mean your music. Not the music made by other black people. Without the blues, there'd be no devil's music whatsoever. There are, of course, many giants in the field. Just not you... am I being clear?\n\n2VILE: (chuckles) Yeah, you're being clear all right. Good. If you're looking to get yourself killed. (guns clicking)\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, well, don't waste your munitions... I'm immortal. Tell me about Delilah.\n\n2VILE: You ain't seen the news? Bitch is dead.\n\nThat ignites Lucifer. He violently shoves 2Vile, sending him shattering through a glass door, toppling over the balcony to certain death just as Lucifer grabs him by his blinged-out chains. Suspending him high above the hillside. Gunshots.\n\n2VILE: Don't shoot, you idiot! I didn't kill her.\n\nLUCIFER: Why should I believe you?\n\n2VILE: Because I loved the girl.\n\nLUCIFER: People sometimes kill people with whom they're in love. The heart's mysterious. So I'm told.\n\n2VILE: Ain't like that. Girl made me crazy!\n\nLUCIFER: Women can do that. Doesn't mean you should beat them up, does it?\n\n2VILE: We worked that out a long time ago. I hit her once 'cause I found out she was cheating on me.\n\nLUCIFER: All right. With whom?\n\n2VILE: I don't know. I don't know. She wouldn't tell me, all right? Said it was a big secret, some-some, uh, rich married guy.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, does she have a friend that she might've confided in?\n\n2VILE: She didn't trust no one, man. Uh, uh, her therapist. Her therapist is probably the only one who knows. She-she's some, uh, uh, Dr. Linda in-in Beverly Hills. Saw her, like, five times a week on the DL. Used a fake name, everything.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, did she now? Well, thank you for your time.\n\nCHLOE: LAPD! Guns down. On the floor, down! You two against the wall.\n\nLUCIFER: Detective, welcome to the party.\n\nCHLOE: Grab the bucket, collect the guns. Now!\n\nLUCIFER: You sly dog, you did listen to me.\n\nCHLOE: I ran the dead guy's cell phone. 2Vile was the last person he called.\n\n2VILE: Come on, man.\n\nCHLOE: What I find highly interesting is how you made the connection on your own.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I've been busy, my dear.\n\nCHLOE: Talk to me about Delilah.\n\nLUCIFER: We've been over that one, Detective.\n\nCHLOE: And why you called the shooter two days before she was murdered.\n\n2VILE: Fine. Yeah, I called Eddie 'cause he hooks me up sometimes. He met Delilah through me. Whatever. Don't make me a killer, do it?\n\nCHLOE: No, but it does make you a suspect.\n\n2VILE: What, so everyone on Eddie's phone's a suspect? Are you joking? You gonna drag half of Hollywood downtown. Be like the Oscars or something.\n\nMAN: Wait, aren't you that chick from that film?\n\nLUCIFER: Hmm, what's this? What film?\n\nMAN: You used to be an actress or something, right? Yeah. That teen movie... I forget what it's called.\n\nLUCIFER: Of course. Hot Tub High School. That's where I know you from.\n\nCHLOE: Let's just stick to my questions, shall we? So...\n\nLUCIFER: The one with the famous nude scene, coming out of the hot tub! It was, like, a complete Fast Times rip-off. She was, like, the new Phoebe Cates!\n\nCHLOE: Thanks, I appreciate that.\n\nLUCIFER: That was quite a nude scene.\n\nCHLOE: I have far too many bullets in this thing for you to still be talking. You, we need to have a conversation right now.\n\nLUCIFER: That's a waste of time, Detective. I've just threatened his life... he's not our guy. He would've said, trust me.\n\nCHLOE: You did what?\n\n2VILE: Yeah, isn't that illegal?\n\nCHLOE: Uh, little bit, yeah. You stay put. You, you're coming with me.\n\nLUCIFER: What? Ooh. (laughs) With pleasure. At least, perhaps now, you'll listen to me. Although, I'm not quite sure why I'm being arrested.\n\nCHLOE: Because you're interfering with a police investigation. You've broken I can't even count how many laws. And you pissed me off.\n\nLUCIFER: Right, I can get out of these, you know?\n\nCHLOE: Funny. How'd you do that?\n\nLUCIFER: (sighs) Come on, we're wasting time. We should be out there solving a homicide and punishing those responsible.\n\nCHLOE: \"We\"? You're insane. I'm taking you in. Get in the car.\n\nLUCIFER: No, that's boring. Not to mention pointless. Come on, I'll help you. It'll be fun.\n\nCHLOE: How could you possibly help me?\n\nLUCIFER: I have a certain skill set. I can be very persuasive with people and tend to see things that others cannot.\n\nCHLOE: So, you're psychic or something?\n\nLUCIFER: No, I can't read people's minds. I'm not a Jedi. People just like to tell me things.\n\nCHLOE: Hmm, just-just tell you things? Just confess their sins, just like that?\n\nLUCIFER: No, not their sins. I have no power over people's sins. I actually get a bad rap for that. I have the ability to draw out people's forbidden desires. The more simple the human, the easier it is. The more complex, the more challenging and exciting, really. But no, the actual sins, the sins are on you people.\n\nCHLOE: \"You people\"? I got it. I got it! The name? The whole Lucifer thing? And desire's, like, your superpower.\n\nLUCIFER: Mm, it's more like a gift from God really. Okay, look. Tell me, Detective, what do you desire more than anything else in this life?\n\nCHLOE: This is it? This is your big trick? (sighs) I guess, when I was a little girl, I... always wanted to be a cop like my daddy, so that... that one day I could help people and... and be taken seriously... ...when I say to shut up and get in the damn car.\n\nLUCIFER: You're not, like, a Jedi or something, are you?\n\nCHLOE: Get in the car.\n\nLUCIFER: No, no, no, no, no. Look. I know something you don't know.\n\nCHLOE: Really? What's that?\n\nLUCIFER: Won't say unless you take me with you on this. Please, come on. I got to 2Vile, didn't I?\n\nCHLOE: Why do you care about this so much? About Delilah?\n\nLUCIFER: Look, I just... I just do. Look, if I hadn't meddled with her career, maybe she wouldn't have died.\n\nCHLOE: Okay. Okay, fine... but if this little clue thing of yours doesn't pan out, these are going back on, and they're gonna stay on.\n\nLUCIFER: Is that a promise?\n\nCHLOE: Yeah, therapist in Beverly Hills with the first name Linda. See if Delilah was a client.\n\nLUCIFER: Ah-ah, actually, she had a pseudonym, which I also happen to know. I'm quite good at this, aren't I? Uh, Penny Lane.\n\nCHLOE: Okay. Delilah may have gone by Penny Lane. Thanks. Don't look so smug. Nothing's panned out yet.\n\nLUCIFER: No, no, no, it's not that. It's just that I knew that I recognized you.\n\nCHLOE: Right. Right, you've seen my boobies. It's exciting. What, are you 12?\n\nLUCIFER: So is the, uh... is the movie why you've got such a chip on your shoulder?\n\nCHLOE: Uh, it's low on the list of things I have to live down, I guess.\n\nLUCIFER: Right. Attractive female cop struggling to be taken seriously in a man's man's world... that it?\n\nCHLOE: Yeah, something like that.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, they're threatened. You're clearly smart and have notable instincts. Ignore them. Trust yourself.\n\nCell phone rings.\n\nCHLOE: Detective Decker. All right, text it to me. Thanks.\n\nLUCIFER: What's that?\n\nCHLOE: (sighs) What you were saying stands up. There's a Penny Lane who sees a Dr. Linda Martin in Beverly Hills.\n\nLUCIFER: Excellent. I'll clear my schedule. (cell phone rings) Ooh, someone's popular.\n\nCHLOE: Please stop talking. Hello. What? You're kidding me. Is she okay? Oh, of course, he's not there. Thanks. We got to make a pit stop.\n\nLUCIFER: What? No, absolutely not.\n\nCHLOE: My kid got into a fight. I got to pick her up.\n\nLUCIFER: What, can't she get herself home?\n\nCHLOE: She's seven.\n\nLUCIFER: Look, I'm not here to help you run errands. I'm here to help you solve a homicide.\n\nCHLOE: Really?\n\n(\"Sinister Kid\" by the Black Keys playing.)\n\nCHLOE: All right. Wait here.\n\nLUCIFER: With pleasure. Despise children.\n\nTRIXIE: I don't think you're allowed to smoke in here.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, dear, what will become of me?\n\nTRIXIE: My mother is a police officer. She could arrest you.\n\nLighter snaps shut.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, I think I might know your mother.\n\nTRIXIE: What's your name?\n\nLUCIFER: Lucifer.\n\nTRIXIE: (whispering) Like the Devil?\n\nLUCIFER: Exactly.\n\nTRIXIE: My name's Beatrice, but everybody calls me Trixie.\n\nLUCIFER: That's a hooker's name.\n\nTRIXIE: What's a hooker?\n\nLUCIFER: Ask your mother. So... why are you in trouble?\n\nTRIXIE: See that girl over there? She was bullying me. She created a fake Snapchat account and used it to make fun of me. So... I kicked her in the no-no-touch-touch square.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh. Oh, I see. Well played. Well played, indeed. (to the bully) Hello, mean girl. Did you know there's a special section of Hell reserved for bullies? So have fun.\n\nThe girl screams.\n\nCHLOE: What did you do?\n\nLUCIFER: Oh... I just think someone's feeling a little guilty.\n\nSchool bell rings.\n\nTRIXIE: Hi, Daddy.\n\nDAN: Hi, munchkin.\n\nCHLOE: Wow, shocker, you're late.\n\nDAN: Come on, give me a break. I'm putting a case to bed.\n\nCHLOE: Right, like I'm not working a case, too. Oh, yeah, the one you tried to steal from me.\n\nDAN: You mean the open and shut one. You did open and shut it, right?\n\nCHLOE: I'm being diligent, Dan. It's a high-profile case.\n\nDAN: Exactly, which is why you need to be smart about it.\n\nLUCIFER: She is smart. You're the dimwit. Perhaps you should refrain from arguing in front of the child. It's unbecoming.\n\nDAN: I don't know whether to laugh or to shoot you.\n\nLUCIFER: Surprise me.\n\nTRIXIE: Isn't he funny, Daddy?\n\nCHLOE: Hey, can you, uh, drop Trix at my mom's? We got to go. Thank you. Trixella, give Mommy a kiss. I love you so much. Good job standing up to the mean girl.\n\nTRIXIE: Thanks, Mommy. What's a hooker?\n\nCHLOE: Daddy will tell you.\n\nTRIXIE: Bye, Lucifer. It was nice meeting you.\n\nCHLOE: Hmm. Think she likes you.\n\nLUCIFER: Of course she does... what's not to like? Was your offspring planned or a mistake?\n\nCHLOE: Planned, sort of.\n\nLUCIFER: Really? 'Cause I've never understood the human desire to procreate.\n\nCHLOE: That's probably a good thing.\n\nLUCIFER: I mean, children are hideous little creatures, terrible, taxing burdens.\n\nCHLOE: Mmm. Mmm.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, um, yours is fine. I mean, you know, nothing to crow about, but nothing to be too embarrassed about, either, so that's quite good, isn't it?\n\nCHLOE: Are you at all aware of how dickish you sound?\n\nLUCIFER: No. Speaking of dicks... why was that ex-husband of yours pressuring you to close the case?\n\nCHLOE: No reason.\n\nLUCIFER: Strange.\n\nCHLOE: Yes, you are.\n\nLUCIFER: Did my father send you? (door opens)\n\nLINDA: Okay, Detectives, I'll see you now.\n\nCHLOE: Thank you.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh. \"Detectives.\"\n\nCHLOE: Dr. Martin, I'd like to ask you a few questions about Delilah.\n\nLUCIFER: You're thinking about it, aren't you?\n\nLINDA: What?\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, I wouldn't recommend it. I'm like walking heroin. Very habit-forming. It never ends well.\n\nLinda sighs.\n\nCHLOE: I'm sorry, do... do you two know each other? No, no, but I know that look.\n\nLINDA: I don't know what you're talking about.\n\nLUCIFER: That is interesting 'cause... you don't look at me that way.\n\nCHLOE: What way?\n\nLUCIFER: With carnal fascination.\n\nCHLOE: That's 'cause it doesn't exist.\n\nLUCIFER: No, you see, that's just it... with most women, it does. I tend to appeal to the dark, mischievous hearts in all of you, but you, Detective, you seem oddly immune to my charms.\n\nCHLOE: Referring to them as \"charms,\" I think, is a bit of a stretch. Truth be told, I find you repulsive. Like, on a chemical level.\n\nLUCIFER: That's fascinating. Now, tell me, Linda...\n\nLINDA: You say it's fascinating, and yet I can see that it disturbs you, doesn't it? Deeply.\n\nCHLOE: Dr. Martin, we know that, um, Delilah was having a clandestine affair with a wealthy married man, so if you just tell us his name, we will be on our way.\n\nLINDA: I'm sorry, I can't do that.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, she's one of the complex ones. Linda, darling, why don't you tell me? Hmm?\n\nLINDA: Well, I can't.\n\nLucifer chuckles.\n\nLINDA: I want to, but I can't. (laughs) Oh, you're the devil.\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) Correct. Now, come on, Dr. Martin. I know you want to.\n\nLINDA: Oh, man, and it's really, really juicy, too.\n\nLUCIFER: Ooh, I bet it is.\n\nLINDA: No, I can't.\n\nCHLOE: What did you do to her? Did you roofie her?\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, no, it's not her fault. She's just reacting to me. Just watch and learn, okay? Right, the answer is yes, we can take a trip to pound town if we must, but first, you're gonna have to tell us, Linda, okay?\n\nLINDA: (moaning) Um... (chuckles) Okay... (chuckles) it's Grey Cooper.\n\nCHLOE: Grey Cooper? Seriously? That is juicy.\n\nLUCIFER: Grey Cooper, the actor? The one who's married to Amanda what's-her-chops?\n\nCHLOE: Yeah, yeah.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, no, he's horrible. So square-jawed, so handsome, so vanilla. Oh, I'm really quite disappointed in Delilah. That's truly terrible taste in the opposite sex.\n\nCHLOE: Thank you very much, Dr. Martin. We'll be in touch. All right, we got to go.\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, of course, but I... I made a deal, so I'm gonna have to hold up my end of the bargain. You wouldn't mind waiting outside?\n\nCHLOE: Are you seriously talking about having sex with her right now?\n\nLUCIFER: Well, it won't take long.\n\nLINDA: I do yoga. Hot... yoga. I'm freakishly flexible. Want to see? Wow! (chuckles) I really tried to keep that one in.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, you tried... that's what matters. Uh, look, I'm really sorry, but I'm gonna have to take a rain check. I will be back, okay?\n\nLINDA: I certainly hope so.\n\nLUCIFER: My word is my bond.\n\nLUCIFER: Excuse me! Excuse me. Ah, excuse me. Thank you.\n\nGUARD: Hey, hey, sir.\n\nTires squealing, gunfire.\n\nCREW MEMBER: Who the (bell rings) is this guy? What the hell are you doing?\n\nCHLOE: Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry, he's with me.\n\nLUCIFER: That's not Grey Cooper.\n\nCREW MEMBER: No, of course not. What the hell is this?\n\nCHLOE: We need to speak with Mr. Cooper.\n\nGREY: God, Delilah, yeah, heard about that this morning. I can't believe it. We did a movie together last year. Got pretty close.\n\nCHLOE: Lovers?\n\nGREY: Friends.\n\nLUCIFER: Friends who were lovers?\n\nCHLOE: Settle down. I'll handle the questions. Mr. Cooper, when did you last have contact with Delilah?\n\nLUCIFER: Well, actually, I just have one more question before you proceed with the boring ones. Tell me, Mr. Cooper, what do you want more than anything in this world? What's your deepest, darkest desire? You close your eyes, what do you see?\n\nGREY: I'm the president of the United States of America.\n\nLUCIFER: Ha! Well, who's the Devil now, eh?\n\nCHLOE: Those are some pretty big aspirations there, Mr. Cooper.\n\nGREY: (chuckles) Well, after the acting and stuff.\n\nCHLOE: No need to be embarrassed. Hell, if Arnold can do it, right? (chuckles) Now, you wouldn't want any nasty secrets screwing that up for you, though, would you?\n\nGREY: Is there a point to this?\n\nCHLOE: Mr. Cooper, were you having an affair with Delilah?\n\nAMANDA: Honey! Have you been getting my texts? I thought they were breaking you for lunch like a half hour ago. What's going on?\n\nGREY: These people are detectives.\n\nAMANDA: Real ones?\n\nCHLOE: We have some questions about Delilah.\n\nAMANDA: Oh. Oh. Yes, it's so sad.\n\nGREY: Yeah. Very sad.\n\nCHLOE: Your watch, where'd you get that?\n\nGREY: Oh, it's a prop.\n\nAMANDA: No, that's the one Delilah gave you, isn't it? For Time Will Tell?\n\nGREY: Right. That's the movie that we did. It was a wrap gift. (chuckles)\n\nCHLOE: Yeah. She buy a $10,000 watch for the whole crew?\n\nGREY: Uh, no. Just me, as far as I know. 'Cause we were, you know, costars and everything.\n\nLUCIFER: You know, you're gonna have to get much better at lying if you want to be president.\n\nGREY: I know, right?\n\nLUCIFER: So you were sleeping with her, then, yeah?\n\nGREY: Oh, yeah. (chuckles) (laughing) Crap. I just said that in front of people.\n\nAMANDA: Whatever. It's not like I didn't know. God, you are a terrible liar. And actor, by the way.\n\nGREY: You knew?\n\nAMANDA: Of course. Why else do you think I've been sleeping with Bobby?\n\nGREY: Are you serious?\n\nAMANDA: Oh, yeah. And it is good. Mmm. I climb that man like a tree. Right, Bobby?\n\nGREY: My bodyguard? What a clich\u00e9.\n\nAMANDA: Oh, I'm a clich\u00e9? Well, you're a dick.\n\nCHLOE: Oh, boy. Hey, guys... Come on! Hey, guys. Arrest them.\n\nAMANDA: Seriously? (grunting)\n\nCHLOE: One of them's got to be guilty.\n\nCHLOE: Thanks. (sighs) So, Grey and Amanda have zero connection to the shooter. (sighs) But the shooter had the same watch as Grey. That can't be a coincidence. Maybe Delilah gave him one, too, like kind of a go-to gift. I...\n\nLUCIFER: Well, that would imply she was actually sleeping with that maggot.\n\nCHLOE: Really? Jimmy, 2Vile, Grey Cooper. That's three other maggots she's sleeping with. I don't think there's a lot of discretion going on with her.\n\nLUCIFER: Yeah. I suppose you got a point.\n\nCHLOE: (chuckles softly) God, what am I doing here?\n\nLUCIFER: Wrong deity, but, yes, that is the eternal question.\n\nCHLOE: (chuckles) No. I mean here, in a bar, with you.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I don't know. You tell me, Detective. I mean, despite your proclaimed revulsion, you can't deny that there's a connection between us. Tell me, what do you actually want?\n\nCHLOE: You mean what do I desire more than anything else in this life?\n\nLUCIFER: Yes.\n\nCHLOE: Mm-hmm.\n\nLUCIFER: No tricks. Not that they work on you, you freak. (Chloe chuckles.) Seriously. I'm curious.\n\nCHLOE: I don't know. What-what I told you's true. I-I really do want to help people. My father was a cop. He was a great cop. My mother was an actress. Really cheesy one. (chuckles) I tried the acting thing. I took off my top. Wasn't really contributing to the betterment of society.\n\nLUCIFER: I disagree. I love that movie.\n\nCHLOE: (chuckles) So I quit. Decided to become a cop like my dad and, uh, dealt with the whole Hot Tub High School thing, until, um, I became a detective and found a whole new way to ostracize myself.\n\nLUCIFER: Ah, the... reason your ex-maggot was pressuring you to close this?\n\nCHLOE: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. There was a case, a shooting on Palmetto Street where a cop was shot, and I saw it differently than pretty much everyone in my department, including my ex. And I stuck my neck out, and it backfired. And, uh, now... (chuckles) no one wants to work with me.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I'm available.\n\nMAZE: Too bad your little prot\u00e9g\u00e9 isn't around to collect the check.\n\nREPORTER: The soundtrack album for the movie Time Will Tell has reached number 15 on the Billboard charts and is still climbing. Song and record sales...\n\nCHLOE: Oh, wow.\n\nLUCIFER: What?\n\nCHLOE: Delilah didn't give that watch to the drug dealer.\n\nJIMMY: Stop, stop, stop! (music stops) What is it? You got a gerbil in your throat? What's going on?\n\nLUCIFER: Hello, Jimmy.\n\nJIMMY: Really?\n\nLUCIFER: How's the album sales doing?\n\nJIMMY: What album?\n\nCHLOE: Soundtrack to Time Will Tell, which you produced. Whitney Houston hit the top ten for album sales after her death. Michael Jackson hit the stratosphere. Not sure you'll achieve such heights having Delilah killed, but that sure is a boatload of royalty checks headed your way. Guess you really needed the cash, huh? Which is why you had to pay the shooter with your watch.\n\nLUCIFER: The watch Delilah gave you. Now, that's just sick. But then you are, so...\n\nGun clicks.\n\nCHLOE: Hey, Jimmy?\n\nJIMMY: I made her, and she ruined me. She humiliated me. She owes me.\n\nLUCIFER: You're not God, Jimmy. You didn't make her. But you did destroy her. So I'm gonna punish you.\n\nJIMMY: You back off, you freak. I mean it. I am not going to jail for that bitch. No chance.\n\nCHLOE: Listen to him, Lucifer. Back off.\n\nLUCIFER: I told you, it's fine. I'm immortal. Why did you do that?\n\nCHLOE: He was gonna kill you.\n\nLUCIFER: No, no, no, no, no, no. You just... you just let him off too easy. He needs to pay! He needs to suffer! He needs to feel the pain, not escape it!\n\nCHLOE: Don't worry. I'm sure where he's going, the pain's coming.\n\nLUCIFER: No. No, it's not, actually. And you know why? Because I'm here and he's...\n\nGunshots. Chloe gasps.\n\nLUCIFER: Chloe... (gasping)\n\nCHLOE: (weakly) I don't want to die.\n\nLUCIFER: I won't let you. Your father will just have to wait for you. (gunshots) (groaning) Just... give me one second. (gunshots)\n\nJIMMY: (grunts) No, please! No, no, please! Please. Please don't kill me.\n\nLUCIFER: Oh, Jimmy. You're gonna wish that's all I did to you.\n\nScreaming.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, look who's back.\n\nCHLOE: (groans) How long have I been out?\n\nLUCIFER: (sighs) Three years.\n\nCHLOE: What? (Lucifer chuckling) You're such an ass.\n\nLUCIFER: Thank you.\n\nCHLOE: Oh, God. He was firing at you. Why aren't you... more dead?\n\nLUCIFER: You're having a very hard time with the immortal thing, aren't you?\n\nCHLOE: (sighs) What happened with Jimmy?\n\nLUCIFER: Jimmy? Jimmy got what he deserved.\n\nCHLOE: Hmm? Well, I'm pretty sure I'd be dead if you hadn't helped me, so... thank you.\n\nLUCIFER: Sorry, what was that? That last bit. I didn't quite get that.\n\nCHLOE: Thank you.\n\nLUCIFER: You're welcome. And, besides, you know, you're far too interesting to let die.\n\nCHLOE: You saved my life because I'm interesting?\n\nLUCIFER: Wildly irritating as well, but yes.\n\nCHLOE: (chuckles softly) So what now?\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I mean, I've obviously proven myself to be an invaluable crime-fighting tool. You're a pariah in the department. I think this could be the start of a beautiful friendship. Don't you?\n\nCHLOE: Who the hell are you?\n\nLUCIFER: I told you, I'm...\n\nTRIXIE: Lucifer!\n\nLUCIFER: Uh, yes. Hello, child. Um, just... Why don't you save some of this unpleasantness for your mother, yeah? (Chloe groans) Ooh. Sorry. Oh. God.\n\nTRIXIE: Are you hurt?\n\nCHLOE: I'm okay.\n\nLUCIFER: Right. Well, I'd stay for the family reunion, but it's giving me terrible IBS. So, look forward to seeing you soon, Chloe.\n\nCHLOE: I don't.\n\nLUCIFER: Bye, now. Glad you're not dead.\n\nLUCIFER: (groans) Bloody hell. What do you want from me?\n\nAMENADIEL: I've been watching you, Lucifer.\n\nLUCIFER: You perv.\n\nAMENADIEL: And I'm not sure I like what I see. You're showing restraint, mercy.\n\nLUCIFER: You scared I'm turning my back on the dark side, bro?\n\nAMENADIEL: Lucifer, there is a balance here that we must maintain. I strongly suggest you do what I told you to do and go back to Hell.\n\nLUCIFER: Don't threaten me, Amenadiel. I mean, you don't want to start a war.\n\nAMENADIEL: I would love a war. (Lucifer chuckling) Oh, Luci. My hatred for you grows stronger with every visit.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, I wouldn't have it any other way, pal. I look forward to eating your heart one day. Peace. (wings flapping) Ugh.\n\nLUCIFER: I sense your disapproval, Maze. What is it?\n\nMAZE: I just can't understand why you would save a human life.\n\nLUCIFER: Well, there's... something different about her that I don't quite understand, and it vexes me.\n\nMAZE: Maybe it's not her that's different.\n\nLUCIFER: (chuckles) Is this where I'm supposed to ask, \"Whatever do you mean?\"\n\nMAZE: I'm worried the humans are rubbing off on you. Stop caring. You're the Devil.\n\nLUCIFER: Yes, I am.\n\nLUCIFER: Okay. Right. Uh... Here's the deal. We can have as much naked cuddle time as you desire, but... you're gonna have to listen to me, too. There's a few things that I'd like to discuss with you. You know, just a... an existential dilemma or two. Deal?\n\nLINDA: Yes.\n\nLUCIFER: Lovely.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 11, "api_path": "/songs/359249", "artist_names": "Garbage", "full_title": "Stupid Girl by\u00a0Garbage",

Headland and Delowe\nWas the start of something good\nWhere me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood\nJust tryna find that hookup\nNow, every day, we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)\nWatching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals\nHad my pencil, and plus, my paper\nWe caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur\nWriting rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light\nLight off in that spot, knowing that we could rock\nDoing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop\nLike, \"Freeze!\" We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's, and that's a no-no\n[Verse 2: Big Boi]\nCheck it, a-one-two, a-one\n\"Two dope niggas in the Cadillac,\" they call us\nWent from \"Player's Ball\" to ballers\nPutting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging\nNiggas say, \"Motherfuck that playin',\" they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals\nLocales done made it with them big boys up in this industry\n\"OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise\"\nOver a million sold to this day; niggas, they take it lightly\n'96 gon' be that year that all y'all player-haters can bite me\nI'm out this bitch\n\n[Hook]\nMe and you\nYour momma and your

stoned like them white boys\nSmoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk\nChunky asses, passes getting throwed like Hail Marys\nAnd they looking like Halle Berrys\nSo, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine\nWe's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high\nSmoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug\nAnd my little brother, James, things changed in the hood\nWhere I live at, them rats know, \"Momma, I want to sing\nBut, momma, I want to trick (Trick), and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now\"\nWe moving on up in the world like elevators\nMe and the crew, we pimps like
