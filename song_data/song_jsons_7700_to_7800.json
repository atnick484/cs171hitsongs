Let Me Go Ch1 LyricsMy name is Kathy H. I'm thirty-one years old, and I've been a carer now for over eleven years. That sounds long enough, I know, but actually they want me to go on for another eight months, until the end of this year. That'll make it almost exactly twelve years. Now I know my being a carer so long isn't necessarily because they think I'm fantastic at what I do. There are some really good carers who've been told to stop after just two or three years. And I can think of one carer at least who went on for all of fourteen years despite being a complete waste of space. So I'm not trying to boast. But then I do know for a fact they've been pleased with my work, and by and large, I have too. My donors have always tended to do much better than expected. Their recovery times have been impressive, and hardly any of them have been classified as \u201cagitated,\u201d even before fourth donation. Okay, maybe I am boasting now. But it means a lot to me, being able to do my work well, especially that bit about my donors staying \u201ccalm.\u201d I've developed a kind of instinct around donors. I know when to hang around and comfort them, when to leave them to themselves; when to listen to everything they have to say, and when just to shrug and tell them to snap out of it.\nAnyway, I'm not making any big claims for myself. I know carers, working now, who are just as good and don't get half the credit. If you're one of them, I can understand how you might get resentful\u2013about my bedsit, my car, above all, the way I get to pick and choose who I look after. And I'm a Hailsham student\u2013which is enough by itself sometimes to get people's backs up. Kathy H., they say, she gets to pick and choose, and she always chooses her own kind: people from Hailsham, or one of the other privileged estates. No wonder she has a great record. I've heard it said enough, so I'm sure\n\ufffcyou've heard it plenty more, and maybe there's something in it. But I'm not the first to be allowed to pick and choose, and I doubt if I'll be the last. And anyway, I've done my share of looking after donors brought up in every kind of place. By the time I finish, remember, I'll have done twelve years of this, and it's only for the last six they've let me choose.\nAnd why shouldn't they? Carers aren't machines. You try and do your best for every donor, but in the end, it wears you down. You don't have unlimited patience and energy. So when you get a chance to choose, of course, you choose your own kind. That's natural. There's no way I could have gone on for as long as I have if I'd stopped feeling for my donors every step of the way. And anyway, if I'd never started choosing, how would I ever have got close again to Ruth and Tommy after all those years?\nBut these days, of course, there are fewer and fewer donors left who I remember, and so in practice, I haven't been choosing that much. As I say, the work gets a lot harder when you don't have that deeper link with the donor, and though I'll miss being a carer, it feels just about right to be finishing at last come the end of the year.\nRuth, incidentally, was only the third or fourth donor I got to choose. She already had a carer assigned to her at the time, and I remember it taking a bit of nerve on my part. But in the end I managed it, and the instant I saw her again, at that recovery centre in Dover, all our differences\u2013while they didn't exactly vanish\u2013seemed not nearly as important as all the other things: like the fact that we'd grown up together at Hailsham, the fact that we knew and remembered things no one else did. It's ever since then, I suppose, I started seeking out for my donors people from the past, and whenever I could, people from Hailsham.\nThere have been times over the years when I've tried to leave Hailsham behind, when I've told myself I shouldn't look back so much. But then there came a point when I just stopped resisting. It had to do with this particular donor I had once, in my third year as a carer; it was his reaction when I mentioned I was from Hailsham. He'd just come through his third donation, it hadn't gone well, and he must have known he wasn't going to make it. He could hardly breathe, but he looked towards me and said: \u201cHailsham. I bet that was a beautiful place.\u201d Then the next morning, when I was making conversation to keep his mind off it all, and I asked where he'd grown up, he mentioned some place in Dorset and his face beneath the blotches went into a completely new kind of grimace. And I realised then how desperately he didn't want reminded. Instead, he wanted to hear about Hailsham.\nSo over the next five or six days, I told him whatever he wanted to know, and\n\ufffche'd lie there, all hooked up, a gentle smile breaking through. He'd ask me about the big things and the little things. About our guardians, about how we each had our own collection chests under our beds, the football, the rounders, the little path that took you all round the outside of the main house, round all its nooks and crannies, the duck pond, the food, the view from the Art Room over the fields on a foggy morning. Sometimes he'd make me say things over and over; things I'd told him only the day before, he'd ask about like I'd never told him. \u201cDid you have a sports pavilion?\u201d \u201cWhich guardian was your special favourite?\u201d At first I thought this was just the drugs, but then I realised his mind was clear enough. What he wanted was not just to hear about Hailsham, but to remember Hailsham, just like it had been his own childhood. He knew he was close to completing and so that's what he was doing: getting me to describe things to him, so they'd really sink in, so that maybe during those sleepless nights, with the drugs and the pain and the exhaustion, the line would blur between what were my memories and what were his. That was when I first understood, really understood, just how lucky we'd been\u2013Tommy, Ruth, me, all the rest of us.\nDriving around the country now, I still see things that will remind me of Hailsham. I might pass the corner of a misty field, or see part of a large house in the distance as I come down the side of a valley, even a particular arrangement of poplar trees up on a hillside, and I'll think: \u201cMaybe that's it! I've found it! This actually is Hailsham!\u201d Then I see it's impossible and I go on driving, my thoughts drifting on elsewhere. In particular, there are those pavilions. I spot them all over the country, standing on the far side of playing fields, little white prefab buildings with a row of windows unnaturally high up, tucked almost under the eaves. I think they built a whole lot like that in the fifties and sixties, which is probably when ours was put up. If I drive past one I keep looking over to it for as long as possible, and one day I'll crash the car like that, but I keep doing it. Not long ago I was driving through an empty stretch of Worcestershire and saw one beside a cricket ground so like ours at Hailsham I actually turned the car and went back for a second look.\nWe loved our sports pavilion, maybe because it reminded us of those sweet little cottages people always had in picture books when we were young. I can remember us back in the Juniors, pleading with guardians to hold the next lesson in the pavilion instead of the usual room. Then by the time we were in Senior 2\u2013when we were twelve, going on thirteen\u2013the pavilion had become the place to hide out with your best friends when you wanted to get away from the rest of Hailsham.\nThe pavilion was big enough to take two separate groups without them\n\ufffcbothering each other\u2013in the summer, a third group could hang about out on the veranda. But ideally you and your friends wanted the place just to yourselves, so there was often jockeying and arguing. The guardians were always telling us to be civilised about it, but in practice, you needed to have some strong personalities in your group to stand a chance of getting the pavilion during a break or free period. I wasn't exactly the wilting type myself, but I suppose it was really because of Ruth we got in there as often as we did.\nUsually we just spread ourselves around the chairs and benches\u2013there'd be five of us, six if Jenny B. came along\u2013and had a good gossip. There was a kind of conversation that could only happen when you were hidden away in the pavilion; we might discuss something that was worrying us, or we might end up screaming with laughter, or in a furious row. Mostly, it was a way to unwind for a while with your closest friends.\nOn the particular afternoon I'm now thinking of, we were standing up on stools and benches, crowding around the high windows. That gave us a clear view of the North Playing Field where about a dozen boys from our year and Senior 3 had gathered to play football. There was bright sunshine, but it must have been raining earlier that day because I can remember how the sun was glinting on the muddy surface of the grass.\nSomeone said we shouldn't be so obvious about watching, but we hardly moved back at all. Then Ruth said: \u201cHe doesn't suspect a thing. Look at him. He really doesn't suspect a thing.\u201d\nWhen she said this, I looked at her and searched for signs of disapproval about what the boys were going to do to Tommy. But the next second Ruth gave a little laugh and said: \u201cThe idiot!\u201d\nAnd I realised that for Ruth and the others, whatever the boys chose to do was pretty remote from us; whether we approved or not didn't come into it. We were gathered around the windows at that moment not because we relished the prospect of seeing Tommy get humiliated yet again, but just because we'd heard about this latest plot and were vaguely curious to watch it unfold. In those days, I don't think what the boys did amongst themselves went much deeper than that. For Ruth, for the others, it was that detached, and the chances are that's how it was for me too.\nOr maybe I'm remembering it wrong. Maybe even then, when I saw Tommy rushing about that field, undisguised delight on his face to be accepted back in the fold again, about to play the game at which he so excelled, maybe I did feel a little stab of pain. What I do remember is that I noticed Tommy was wearing the light blue polo shirt he'd got in the Sales the previous month\u2013the\n\ufffcone he was so proud of. I remember thinking: \u201cHe's really stupid, playing football in that. It'll get ruined, then how's he going to feel?\u201d Out loud, I said, to no one in particular: \u201cTommy's got his shirt on. His favourite polo shirt.\u201d\nI don't think anyone heard me, because they were all laughing at Laura\u2013the big clown in our group\u2013mimicking one after the other the expressions that appeared on Tommy's face as he ran, waved, called, tackled. The other boys were all moving around the field in that deliberately languorous way they have when they're warming up, but Tommy, in his excitement, seemed already to be going full pelt. I said, louder this time: \u201cHe's going to be so sick if he ruins that shirt.\u201d This time Ruth heard me, but she must have thought I'd meant it as some kind of joke, because she laughed half-heartedly, then made some quip of her own.\nThen the boys had stopped kicking the ball about, and were standing in a pack in the mud, their chests gently rising and falling as they waited for the team picking to start. The two captains who emerged were from Senior 3, though everyone knew Tommy was a better player than any of that year. They tossed for first pick, then the one who'd won stared at the group.\n\u201cLook at him,\u201d someone behind me said. \u201cHe's completely convinced he's going to be first pick. Just look at him!\u201d\nThere was something comical about Tommy at that moment, something that made you think, well, yes, if he's going to be that daft, he deserves what's coming. The other boys were all pretending to ignore the picking process, pretending they didn't care where they came in the order. Some were talking quietly to each other, some re-tying their laces, others just staring down at their feet as they trammelled the mud. But Tommy was looking eagerly at the Senior 3 boy, as though his name had already been called.\nLaura kept up her performance all through the team-picking, doing all the different expressions that went across Tommy's face: the bright eager one at the start; the puzzled concern when four picks had gone by and he still hadn't been chosen; the hurt and panic as it began to dawn on him what was really going on. I didn't keep glancing round at Laura, though, because I was watching Tommy; I only knew what she was doing because the others kept laughing and egging her on. Then when Tommy was left standing alone, and the boys all began sniggering, I heard Ruth say:\n\u201cIt's coming. Hold it. Seven seconds. Seven, six, five...\u201d\nShe never got there. Tommy burst into thunderous bellowing, and the boys, now laughing openly, started to run off towards the South Playing Field.\n\ufffcTommy took a few strides after them\u2013it was hard to say whether his instinct was to give angry chase or if he was panicked at being left behind. In any case he soon stopped and stood there, glaring after them, his face scarlet. Then he began to scream and shout, a nonsensical jumble of swear words and insults.\nWe'd all seen plenty of Tommy's tantrums by then, so we came down off our stools and spread ourselves around the room. We tried to start up a conversation about something else, but there was Tommy going on and on in the background, and although at first we just rolled our eyes and tried to ignore it, in the end\u2013probably a full ten minutes after we'd first moved away\u2013we were back up at the windows again.\nThe other boys were now completely out of view, and Tommy was no longer trying to direct his comments in any particular direction. He was just raving, flinging his limbs about, at the sky, at the wind, at the nearest fence post. Laura said he was maybe \u201crehearsing his Shakespeare.\u201d Someone else pointed out how each time he screamed something he'd raise one foot off the ground, pointing it outwards, \u201clike a dog doing a pee.\u201d Actually, I'd noticed the same foot movement myself, but what had struck me was that each time he stamped the foot back down again, flecks of mud flew up around his shins. I thought again about his precious shirt, but he was too far away for me to see if he'd got much mud on it.\n\u201cI suppose it is a bit cruel,\u201d Ruth said, \u201cthe way they always work him up like that. But it's his own fault. If he learnt to keep his cool, they'd leave him alone.\u201d\n\u201cThey'd still keep on at him,\u201d Hannah said. \u201cGraham K.'s temper's just as bad, but that only makes them all the more careful with him. The reason they go for Tommy's because he's a layabout.\u201d\nThen everyone was talking at once, about how Tommy never even tried to be creative, about how he hadn't even put anything in for the Spring Exchange. I suppose the truth was, by that stage, each of us was secretly wishing a guardian would come from the house and take him away. And although we hadn't had any part in this latest plan to rile Tommy, we had taken out ringside seats, and we were starting to feel guilty. But there was no sign of a guardian, so we just kept swapping reasons why Tommy deserved everything he got. Then when Ruth looked at her watch and said even though we still had time, we should get back to the main house, nobody argued.\nTommy was still going strong as we came out of the pavilion. The house was over to our left, and since Tommy was standing in the field straight ahead of\n\ufffcus, there was no need to go anywhere near him. In any case, he was facing the other way and didn't seem to register us at all. All the same, as my friends set off along the edge of the field, I started to drift over towards him. I knew this would puzzle the others, but I kept going\u2013even when I heard Ruth's urgent whisper to me to come back.\nI suppose Tommy wasn't used to being disturbed during his rages, because his first response when I came up to him was to stare at me for a second, then carry on as before. It was like he was doing Shakespeare and I'd come up onto the stage in the middle of his performance. Even when I said: \u201cTommy, your nice shirt. You'll get it all messed up,\u201d there was no sign of him having heard me.\nSo I reached forward and put a hand on his arm. Afterwards, the others thought he'd meant to do it, but I was pretty sure it was unintentional. His arms were still flailing about, and he wasn't to know I was about to put out my hand. Anyway, as he threw up his arm, he knocked my hand aside and hit the side of my face. It didn't hurt at all, but I let out a gasp, and so did most of the girls behind me.\nThat's when at last Tommy seemed to become aware of me, of the others, of himself, of the fact that he was there in that field, behaving the way he had been, and stared at me a bit stupidly.\n\u201cTommy,\u201d I said, quite sternly. \u201cThere's mud all over your shirt.\u201d\n\u201cSo what?\u201d he mumbled. But even as he said this, he looked down and noticed the brown specks, and only just stopped himself crying out in alarm. Then I saw the surprise register on his face that I should know about his feelings for the polo shirt.\n\u201cIt's nothing to worry about,\u201d I said, before the silence got humiliating for him. \u201cIt'll come off. If you can't get it off yourself, just take it to Miss Jody.\u201d\nHe went on examining his shirt, then said grumpily: \u201cIt's nothing to do with you anyway.\u201d\nHe seemed to regret immediately this last remark and looked at me sheepishly, as though expecting me to say something comforting back to him. But I'd had enough of him by now, particularly with the girls watching\u2013and for all I knew, any number of others from the windows of the main house. So I turned away with a shrug and rejoined my friends.\nRuth put an arm around my shoulders as we walked away. \u201cAt least you got\nhim to pipe down,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you okay? Mad animal.\u201dEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/969882", "artist_names": "John Mellencamp", "full_title": "Crumblin\u2019 Down by\u00a0John\u00a0Mellencamp", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c9ffaf9bd23c7c9dc4ffd0142e8947bb.180x171x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c9ffaf9bd23c7c9dc4ffd0142e8947bb.180x171x1.jpg", "id": 969882, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 13517274, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1639938265, "path": "/John-mellencamp-crumblin-down-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/John-mellencamp-crumblin-down-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1983, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1983", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1983", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c9ffaf9bd23c7c9dc4ffd0142e8947bb.180x171x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c9ffaf9bd23c7c9dc4ffd0142e8947bb.180x171x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Crumblin\u2019 Down", "title_with_featured": "Crumblin\u2019 Down", "updated_by_human_at": 1642508860, "url": "https://genius.com/John-mellencamp-crumblin-down-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/8140", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/2f6322480701645d2ca1d8b79422408a.1000x738x1.jpg", "id": 8140, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/8209f82b84e8dd0cad0c75f45985354d.1000x1000x1.jpg", "index_character": "j", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "John Mellencamp", "slug": "John-mellencamp", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/John-mellencamp"}, "artist": "John Mellencamp", "lyrics": "Crumblin\u2019 Down Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWell some people ain't no damn good\nYou can't trust 'em you can't love 'em\nNo good deed goes unpunished\nAnd I don't mind bein' their whippin' boy\nI've had that pleasure for years and years\nNo no I never was a sinner\u2014tell me what else can I do\nSecond best is what you get 'til you learn to bend the rules\nAnd time respects no person\u2014and what you lift up must fall\nThey're waiting outside to claim my tumblin' walls\n[Pre-Chorus]\nSaw my picture in the paper\nRead the news around my face\nAnd now some people don't want to treat me the same\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the walls come tumblin' down\nWhen the walls come crumblin' crumblin'\nWhen the walls come tumblin' tumblin' down\nDown, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell some people say I'm obnoxious and lazy\nI'm uneducated\u2014my opinion means nothin'\nBut I know I'm a real good dancer\nDon't need to look over my shoulder to see what I'm after\nEverybody's got their problems\u2014ain't no new news here\nI'm the same old trouble you've been havin' for years\nDon't confuse the problem with the issue girl\nIt's perfectly clear\nJust a human desire to have you come near\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWanna put my arms around you\nFeel your breath in my ear\nYou can bend me you can break me\nBut you'd better stand clear\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nWhen the walls come tumblin' down\nWhen the walls come crumblin' crumblin'\nWhen the walls come tumblin' tumblin'\nCrumblin' tumblin' down\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the walls come tumblin' down\nWhen the walls come rumblin' rumblin'\nWhen the walls (When the walls) come tumblin' tumblin' down\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYeah wanna put my arms around you\nFeel your breath in my ear\nYou can bend me you can break me\nBut you'd better stand clear\n\n[Chorus]\nWhen the walls come tumblin' down\nWhen the walls come crumblin' crumblin'\nWhen the walls come tumblin' tumblin'\nCrumblin' tumblin'\nWhen the walls (When the walls) come tumblin' down\nWhen the walls (When the walls) come crumblin' crumblin'\nWhen the walls come tumblin' tumblin'\nCrumblin' tumblin'\nWhen the walls (When the walls) come tumblin' down\nWhen the walls come crumblin' crumblin'\nWhen the walls come tumblin' tumblin'\nCrumblin' tumblin'\n[Outro]\nWhen the walls come tumblin' down\nWhen the wallsEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/3763", "artist_names": "Michael Jackson", "full_title": "P.Y.T.

black hat caught in a high tree top\nThere's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop\n\n[Chorus]\nI have stood here before inside the pouring rain\nWith the world turning circles running 'round my brain\nI guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign\nBut it's my destiny to be the king of pain\n[Verse 2]\nThere's a little black spot on the sun today\n(That's my soul up there)\nIt's the same old thing as yesterday\n(That's my soul up there)\nThere's a black hat caught in a high treetop\n(That's my soul up there)\nThere's a flag pole rag and the wind won't stop\n(That's my soul up there)\n\n[Chorus]\nI have stood here before inside the pouring rain\nWith the world turning circles running 'round my brain\nI guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign\nBut it's my destiny to be the king of pain\n\n[Verse 3]\nThere's a fossil that's trapped in a high cliff wall\n(That's my soul up there)\nThere's a dead salmon frozen in a waterfall\n(That's my soul up there)\nThere's a blue whale beached by a spring tide's ebb\n(That's my soul up there)\nThere's a butterfly trapped in a spider's web\n(That's my soul up there)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI have stood here before inside the pouring rain\nWith the world turning circles running 'round my brain\nI guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign\nBut it's my destiny to be the king of pain\n\n[Bridge]\nThere's a king on a throne with his eyes torn out\nThere's a blind man looking for a shadow of doubt\nThere's a rich man sleeping on a golden bed\nThere's a skeleton choking on a crust of bread\n(King of pain)\n\n[Verse 4]\nThere's a red fox torn by a huntsman's pack\n(That's my soul up there)\nThere's a black-winged gull with a broken back\n(That's my soul up there)\nThere's a little black spot on the sun today\nIt's the same old thing as yesterday\n\n[Chorus]\nI have stood here before inside the pouring rain\nWith the world turning circles running 'round my brain\nI guess I'm always hoping that you'll end this reign\nBut it's my destiny to be the king of pain\n[Outro]\nKing of pain, king of pain\nKing of pain, I'll always be\nKing of pain, I'll always be\nKing of pain, I'll always

rest for a while at the side?\n\nYour love is cradled in knowing\nEyes in the mirror, still expecting they'll come\nSensing too well when the journey is done\nThere is no turning back, no\nThere is no

the road ain't no place to start a family\nRight down the line, it's been you and me\nAnd lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be\nOh, girl, you stand by me\nI'm forever yours\nFaithfully\n[Verse 2]\nCircus life under the big top world\nWe all need the clowns to make us smile\nThrough space and time, always another show\nWonderin' where I am, lost without

alright\nShe never has too much to say\nIs it somebody we both know?\nOr somebody she just met?\nIs she loving him in her mind\nWhile she's lying here in my bed?\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a stranger in my

questions to alibis\nIs it just my imagination?\nOr has her love turned into lies?\n\n[Chorus]\nThere's a stranger in my house\nSomebody here that I can't see\nA stranger in my house\nSomebody here

breaking out just one day on your own?\nWhy does what I'm saying hurt you?\nI didn't say that we were through\nAlways something breaking us in two\n[Chorus]\nThey say two hearts should beat as one for us\nWe'll fight it out to see it through\nI say that won't be too much fun for us\nThough it's oh so nice to get advice\nIt's oh so hard to do\n\n[Verse 3]\nCould we be much closer if we tried?\nWe could stay at home and stare into each other's eyes\nMaybe we could last an hour\nMaybe then we'd see right through\nAlways something breaking us in two\n\n[Instrumental Break]\n\n[Chorus]\nThey say

little man\nWe got to do our best to whip that inflation down\nMaybe you got a job for me just driving you around\n\n(I'm out of work)\nThese tough times, they're enough\nTo make a man lose his

last time I lied\nI was holding you and telling you\nWe could still be friends\n\nTried to let you go\nBut I can't, you know\nAnd even though I'm not with you\nI need you so\nBut you don't belong to me\n\nChorus:\nComin' in and out of your life\nIsn't easy\nWhen there are so many nights\nI can't hold you and I've told you\nThese feelings are so hard to find\nComin' in and out of your life\nWill never free me\n'cause I don't need to touch you\nTo feel you, it's so real with you\n\nI just can't get you out of my mind\nBut I can remember the last time we tried\nEach needing more than we could

to break the news about Uncle Joe?\nYou remember Uncle Joe\nHe was the one afraid to cut the cake\nWho wants to tell poor Aunt Sarah?\nJoe's run off to Fire Lake\nJoe's run off to Fire Lake\n[Bridge]\nWho wants to brave those bronzed beauties\nLyin' in the sun?\nWith their long soft hair fallin'\nFlyin' as they run\nAh they smile so shy\nAnd they flirt so well\nAnd they lay you down so fast\n'Til you look straight up and say\nOh Lord\nAm I really here at last?\n\n[Verse 3]\nWho wants to play those eights and aces?\nWho wants a raise?\nWho needs a stake?\nWho wants to take that long-shot gamble\nAnd head out for Fire Lake?\n\n[Chorus]\nHead out\n(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)\nAnd head out\n(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)\nAnd head out, head out\n(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)\nHead out\n(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)\nOut to Fire Lake\nYou might also like[Outro]\nWho's gonna do it?\n(Who wants to go to Fire Lake?)\nWho's gonna do it?\n(Who wants to go to Fire

resist you\nStarvin' just to feed the feel\nBut lust just to make a deal\nWillpower disappears\nYou become the music in my ears\n\nI want you tonight\nI feel like getting crazy\nOh, I know it's not right\nBut who is gonna save me?\nNow and then I stop\nAnd wonder what I'm doin'\nAnd sometimes when I talk\nI don't know who I'm foolin'\nAs the demon livin' deep inside\nIt's really me all right\nTemptations doin' it to me\nGot me in the mood I can't get free, no\n\nI want you tonight man I'm thinkin' maybe\nOh, I know it ain't right but who is gonna save me?\n\nIs there no way of fighting this feeling inside\nWhere ecstasy lives but sanity dies?\nWe all need more of each other\n\nI want you tonight\nI feel like getting crazy, yeah\nOh, I know its not right\nBut who is gonna save me?\nI want you tonight man I'm thinkin' maybe\nOh, I know it ain't right but who is gonna save me?\n\nOh!\nI want you tonight\nI want you tonight\nI want you tonight\nI want you, I want you tonight\nYou might also likeI want you tonight\nI feel like gettin' crazy\nOh-oh I know it's not right\nBut who is gonna save me?\nI want you, I want you tonight\nWon't you baby, won't you

the Way Lyrics[Verse 1]\nHalf of your love is just not what I'm after\nPart of your world is just not what I need\nSome of your time is like one glass of water\nJust keeps me thirsty for wine\n\n[Chorus]\nSo fill me up to the top\nOh, don't you stop\n'Til I'm overflowin'\nLove is the seed\nAnd, babe, I need\nYou to keep it growin' stronger every day\nOh, love\nDon't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)\nDon't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)\n[Verse 2]\nNever before have I settled for second\nAll of my life I have hungered for more\nNow, I can see where your sweet love can lead me\nThis is what I have waited for\n\n[Chorus]\nSo fill me up to the top\nOh, don't you stop\n'Til I'm overflowin'\nLove is the seed\nAnd, babe, I need\nYou to keep it growin' stronger every day\nOh, love\nDon't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)\nDon't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)\n\n[Bridge]\n(Don't take me half the way)\n(Don't take me half the way)\n\n[Verse 3]\nHalf of your love is just not what I'm after, no\nPart of your world is just not what I need\nNow, I can see where your sweet love can lead me\nThis is what I have waited for\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSo fill me up to the top\nOh, don't you stop\n'Til I'm overflowin'\nLove, love is the seed\nAnd, babe, I need\nYou to keep it growin' stronger every day\nOh,

half the way (Don't take me half the way)\nDon't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)\nGive me all your love (Don't take me half the way)\nDon't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)\nDon't take me half the way (Don't take me half the way)\nGive me all your love (Don't take me half the way)Embed"}]
