dying for more\nThe streets are on fire, never seen it before\nIt's like the sound of electric guitars\nWorlds collide and hearts will be broken\nOver and over it's the same every day-\nHow can I say what has never concerned me\nThe secret of my success is I'm living 25 hours a day\n\nIt's amazing to me, what a fool will believe to get by\nWith a change of your mind, I can live, I can fly\nThe harder they come, the harder they fall\nI never say maybe and I go for it all\nJust like the sound of electric guitars\n\nWorlds collide and hearts will be broken\nOver and over it's the same every

goes again\nThe slamming of the door\nSometimes the river calls me\nAnd at night it calls my name\nSays, ''Put your troubles down beside me''\nThings have always been the same\nAnd rock 'n' roll won't teach me\nWhat the river said that night\nI jumped into this beauty\nAnd drifted out of sight\nWhere did your heart go?\nDid you put it on a train?\nDid you leave it in the rain\nOr down in

"https://genius.com/artists/Ted-wheeler"}, "artist": "Ted Wheeler", "lyrics": "2018 State of the City Address LyricsThank you, Faith, for that tremendous introduction. I know I speak for everyone here when I say this:\n\nWe are inspired by your leadership,\n\nAnd we are inspired by the work being done by your generation to transform your government and your country.\n\nWe were very intentional in our decision to move today\u2019s address from its traditional downtown location, here to East Portland at a place where young people are preparing for successful futures.\n\nThank you to Portland Community College, President Mark Mitsui, and Campus President Dr. Jessica Howard for hosting us today.\n\nTo those here and those watching or listening\u2026 my colleagues in government, honored guests, residents of the great City of Portland:\nAs I address you today on the State of our City, I ask you to join me in an examination of our current moment, the bigger picture, if you will.\n\nAt a time when young people like Faith are pushing society forward, government consistently finds itself two or three steps behind the public that it is supposed to serve.\n\nFor example, overwhelming majorities of Americans say they want common sense gun legislation. Yet Congress does nothing.\n\nMost Americans believe immigrants strengthen our country. And yet the rhetoric from Washington DC only serves to divide us.\n\nLarge majorities of Americans know climate change is real, that it is a threat to our planet and to humanity. And yet this administration is retreating from our global commitments.\n\nCities like Portland cannot wait on others. We must take this moment into our own hands. We must seize this opportunity and secure our own future according to our own vision and our own values.\n\nWe\u2019re lucky to be represented by a great City Council who understand the stakes of this moment. I am privileged to serve alongside Dan Saltzman, Nick Fish, Amanda Fritz, and Chloe Eudaly.\n\nThank you to our bureau directors and city employees who dedicate their working lives to the success of our city.\n\nAnd thank you to City Auditor Mary Hull Caballero, who works with us effectively to keep our government transparent and accountable.\n\nPortland is a global leader on many issues, among them is combatting climate change.\n\nI was recently in Chicago with Rahm Emanuel, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, the Mayors of Vancouver, BC, Montreal, and the late Mayor Ed Lee of San Francisco. Together we recommitted our cities, along with more than 300 others, to the principles of the Paris Climate Accord, even as Donald Trump walks away from our nation\u2019s promises.\n\nI was proud to talk to these local leaders about Portland\u2019s successful Climate Action Plan, and I was proud to tell them how our entire region is working together to get us on the path to 100% renewable energy by 2050.\n\nPortland is also demonstrating to the world how to be a city that is welcoming to everyone, regardless of immigration status.\nWe have consistently reaffirmed our status as a sanctuary city, and have challenged the Trump administration in court to protect our ability to do so.\n\nSome in the White House think that I, along with other like-minded mayors, should be arrested for our principled support of our immigrant communities.\n\nI will continue to fight for our right to be an inclusive, welcoming city \u2013 yes, even if it means going to jail.\n\nWe are a pluralistic society. Immigrants have always been, and will always be, central to the fabric of America.\n\nMoreover, we are abiding by the law. We\u2019re upholding the US constitution. Virtually every single federal court that has weighed in on this issue agrees with us and disagrees with the White House.\n\nPortland, and other cities across America, are leading.\n\nAnd that\u2019s a good thing. Most Americans live in cities. In fact, the last census found that more than 80% of all Americans live in urban areas\u2026 80%. That\u2019s more than ever.\n\nAnd as the trend toward growing cities unfolds, Portland is among the fastest growing cities in the United States. More than 100 people move to Portland every day.\n\nThere is a good narrative to be told. Again, this week, Portland made the short list as one of the most desirable places in America to live.\n\nThat\u2019s no surprise to any of us. People are moving here because, along with our natural beauty, they love our beer, our coffee, our donuts. They love the creative, entrepreneurial feel of the city, our maker culture.\n\nThey are coming here for economic reasons, too. The Seattle Times recently called Portland\u2019s economy \u201ctransformational.\u201d Forbes called Portland the best place in America for careers and business. The list goes on and on.\n\nI think it\u2019s important that we be reminded now and then that a lot of things are right with Portland. These are things for which we are rightly proud, and things for which people are rightly drawn to Portland.\n\nBut there is, of course, another side to the story. The challenges associated with rapid growth. Where are we all going to live? Where are we going to work? How are we going to get around with increasing traffic congestion? And, as we continue to grow as a city, how do we keep Portland affordable for those who have lived here for generations?\nI have complete confidence that Portlanders are ready to take on the critical challenges we face right now. It won\u2019t be exclusively the work of government, but the efforts of our people that will cement our progress.\n\nWe know the key challenges that confront us in the present \u2013 homelessness, housing, policing, economic development \u2013 but we also recognize these challenges as opportunities to live our values, put them into action, and let them serve as an example to others.\n\nI believe that every one of us is entitled to a warm, dry place to sleep at night.\n\nWe can\u2019t continue to call ourselves a progressive city as so many of our neighbors live, and too often die, on our streets. Homelessness represents nothing short of a humanitarian crisis. It is unacceptable to me, and I hope to you, and I expect us to continue to lead and innovate to find humane solutions to significantly reduce this problem.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just a Portland problem, we all know that. But when I recently convened the West Coast Mayors in Washington, DC at our Annual US Conference of Mayors, my colleagues made it clear that they look to us for ideas and inspiration. Again, we have an opportunity to lead.\n\nThat\u2019s why the first dollars allocated in my proposed budget will be dedicated to preventing homelessness, providing shelter for those living outside in the elements, and \u2013 most importantly \u2013 guiding people into permanent housing while connecting them to the services they need to get off and stay off the streets.\n\nThe City of Portland has a challenging budget and I\u2019ve asked all bureaus to show me what 5% reductions in service would look like. My commitment to you is this: we will maintain the record investments we\u2019ve made in the Joint Office of Homeless Services.\n\nI would like to thank Chair Deborah Kafoury, for sharing a vision with me and for seeing it through. The Joint Office of Homeless Services is perhaps the greatest collaboration between the City of Portland and Multnomah County ever conceived and I\u2019m energized to help lead it to greater successes in partnership with the Chair.\n\nJust look what those record investments have accomplished.\n\nThe total shelter capacity in our community has doubled during the last couple of years, and during the last winter numbered over 2,300 beds. That\u2019s significantly more capacity last winter than I committed to reaching by next winter.\n\nThere has been a payback in results: We were one of the only cities in America that saw a reduction in the unsheltered population over the last two years\u2014which we decreased by 11%. Don\u2019t get me wrong \u2013 the problem of homelessness is very serious and it continues to grow, but having fewer people living outside, exposed to the elements is proof that we can make progress.\n\nWe reduced our unsheltered population by increasing shelter capacity, placing more people into permanent housing, and by reducing the number of people who become homelessness in the first place.\n\nAlmost 5,000 people obtained housing last year, hundreds more than the goals our partners in A Home for Everyone set before the year began, and more than twice the number placed before the coalition was created. That is 5,000 people who are no longer living outside, and no longer living in shelter. They have a place to call home. 5,000.\n\nIn addition, more than 6,000 people started receiving prevention services last year, almost 2,000 more than the year before. That is 6,000 who are right on the edge that we are preventing from becoming homeless in our community.\n\nWe know that homelessness is a challenge for our entire community. I get hundreds of calls, cards, emails, related to homelessness. Government cannot address it alone. I have called on the community repeatedly to give us all the ideas, the resources, and the expertise our community has to offer, on this problem and others.\n\nJust this week, we announced a partnership between the private sector, government, academia, and philanthropic organizations that will get people experiencing homelessness off the streets, into a warm dry place with water and sanitation, and connect them with the help they need to stay off the streets.\n\nThe private sector is taking the lead with government as the partner. A generous contribution of $1.5 million has been made by Tim Boyle to Harbor of Hope to get this project off the ground.\n\nThe plan is to create a shelter and service navigation center adjacent to the Broadway Bridge on the West side of the river. It will have room for more than one hundred people; access to showers, laundry and bathroom facilities; and, most importantly, will connect people to the specific services they need for their individual circumstances.\n\nThere is a real need for this type of programming in nearly every Portland neighborhood, and Downtown specifically. And this project will serve as proof-of-concept that public/private partnerships in Portland can work.\n\nI know so many around this city agree with me about the need. However, we cannot only support shelter if it\u2019s not in our own back yards. We cannot only support more affordable housing as long as it\u2019s not in our neighborhood.\n\nAs we make progress on homelessness, we must also address the factors that lead people to homelessness in the first place. We must ensure that Portland remains a city that is accessible and affordable for everyone.\n\nI don\u2019t want millionaires to be the only people who can afford to live downtown. I don\u2019t want service industry workers to have a two-hour commute.\n\nI want a city where we actively create housing options at every income level and for people of all ages.\n\nAnd I am confident saying that the City Council is united on this. Some may confuse the inherently complicated and messy decision-making process with the decisions that are ultimately made, but your City Council has consistently voted in favor of more housing despite otherwise important and competing values.\n\nHousing is important. People are highly engaged on the issue. Everyone has an opinion. But I want to be clear about our results.\n\nAnnual production and permitting levels are higher than at any point in the last 15 years. In 2017, there were 14,000 units in the production pipeline, including permits.\n\nMore than 600 affordable housing units came online in 2017\u2014more than double the number of units in the prior year.\n\nAnd this year will be another record year. There are currently more than 700 newly affordable units under construction and slated to open in 2018. This will be the largest number of affordable units ever produced by the City of Portland in a single year in modern history. An additional 1300 units are beginning construction and will open their doors in 2019.\n\nCity Council will soon approve a plan to allow for greater height and density in the Central City to create more housing, all of which will be subject to the Council\u2019s inclusionary housing program. That alone has the potential to create thousands of units of workforce housing.\n\nWe passed the MULTE program, incentivizing those with market rate developments in the pipeline to include affordable housing units in their projects, so we can more quickly put more affordable housing units on the ground. I urge our County colleagues to join the City Council in taking this up and passing the program at the levels that the city has put forward.\n\nWe passed major tenant protections this year, including making permanent an existing policy requiring landlords to provide relocation assistance to tenants they evict without cause or who cannot afford a double digit rent increase. We expanded the pool of tenants who are eligible for this greatly needed protection.\n\nAnd we are investing the housing bond dollars approved by Portland voters. Proponents of the housing bond promised that 1,300 units of permanent affordable housing would be created at a variety of affordability levels within 5 \u2013 7 years. And, we are on track to accomplish that.\n\nAs of today, in the first 18 months, we have nearly half of the units promised to voters in process, in both new developments and acquisitions of existing buildings \u2013 providing new housing opportunities and preventing displacement.\n\nBut I think we have an opportunity to do even better. I went to the legislature to seek passage of a referral to the ballot of a constitutional amendment that would allow us to invest in affordable housing in partnership with private sector and institutional partners.\n\nIf voters approve it in November, our bond dollars will go much farther. We might be able to double, or even triple, the number of units created by the affordable housing bond. If metro moves forward with their housing bond, this would allow us to leverage those dollars, too.\n\nThese kinds of state-wide and region-wide efforts are essential to solving our housing emergency.\n\nI\u2019m asking you to vote for the constitutional amendment when it comes to the ballot in November. Will you do that? Can I count on you?\n\nWhile we address access and affordability in the rental market, we must also provide more opportunities for home ownership. A home represents the ability to create wealth, not just for your family today but for generations to come.\n\nOur current efforts are falling behind. I was very disappointed in the findings of the recent N/NE Housing Report. The program, created four years ago, has not had the kind of results that meet my expectations.\n\n\u201cWe have come some of the way, not near all of it. There is much yet to do.\u201d\n\nThese were the words shared by President Lyndon B. Johnson fifty years ago. And these words still ring true, as we recognize and celebrate the passing of the 1968 civil rights act, most commonly known as the Fair Housing Act.\n\nTo the housing experts here today, to the employees of the council offices and bureaus, and to our community activists, your tireless work and unsung heroics both past and present have helped craft the guiding narrative to increase housing choices for the most vulnerable residents. Thank you. Your energy and creativity have always called to question whether our best actions meet the best of our intentions. As the Mayor of Portland, this is what I define as the Portland spirit.\n\nAs I mentioned before, there is much left to do. Yet I am convinced, we can get there, I know we can, but we can only do that together. It will take a recommitment from all of us, to the next fifty years and beyond to ensure equal and fair housing accessibility to all Portlanders.\n\nIn mentioning this, I want to be clear here; Portland has a very storied history of discriminatory practices that eliminated housing opportunity for many of our brothers and sisters of color; we know how de-facto and de-jure segregation and restrictive covenant practices eliminated the choices of many Portland families.\n\nWe know that some of the very neighborhoods we live in are the result of those same housing practices that lasted generations.\n\nWe know that the involuntary displacement and the discrimination of entire communities resulted in a legacy of lost opportunity, of lost wealth creation, and created an environment for a lack of trust.\n\nThis gap in trust, can only be addressed if we honestly recognize these actions of the past, some of which are still playing out in many ways in our present, and are willing to discuss them, and take alternative actions to the best of our abilities, to right these wrongs.\n\nThe spirit of Portland is that of solutions. That pioneering spirit that runs through the veins of all those who call Portland home.\n\nJoin me in reaffirming our commitment to fair housing for all. To locking hand in hand and arm in arm and moving towards a reality that affirms our commitment to the intent of the Fair Housing Act both in spirit and in practice.\n\nThat intentionality around equity in housing has also been my goal in ensuring public safety.\n\nWhen I ran for Mayor, I promised that I would conduct a national search for a new police chief. One who would lead us to a more effective, accountable 21st century police bureau. One who would build trust with the community. One who would put increased emphasis on professionalism, training and de-escalation strategies. One who understood the tension many in our community feel about policing and police tactics. One who would help us live up to our commitments under the DOJ settlement agreement.\n\nWe conducted the search. We included community voices every step of the way. And our search reflected the community\u2019s voice. Through surveys and focus groups, we not only learned what the community wants in a police chief; we also homed in on what the community expects of law enforcement in this city.\n\nA national debate ensued because right there in a job posting that went out across America, I stated that the successful police chief in our city had to understand and be prepared to address our own racist history, and the implications it has had for policing today.\n\nBecause, just like policing in America is experiencing a transformation, policing in Portland is experiencing a transformation too.\n\nYou told me that you wanted a police chief who is community and people-oriented, who values diversity, and understands the importance of community policing. You also told me that you wanted the next police chief to prioritize community engagement. In fact, throughout the survey, the community made it abundantly clear that its primary expectation of the Portland Police Bureau was community policing. The community made this demand.\n\nA few months ago, I welcomed new Portland Police Chief Danielle Outlaw.\n\nShe and I share a vision for community policing in Portland. You should know your neighborhood officer by their first name. Your neighborhood officer should partner with you in building your community. Our officers should be engaging youth through after-school activities and youth-based programs. Community policing and engagement can\u2019t be limited to just showing up for events. The Police Bureau can and should do a better job informing you all about their policies and practices. But it doesn\u2019t stop with the simple sharing of information \u2013 the Police Bureau needs to collaborate with you. You need to have a say in what community policing in Portland really means.\n\nThat is why the Portland Committee on Community-Engaged Policing \u2013 PCCEP \u2013 will be so important. For the first time, there will be formal and direct collaboration between the Police Bureau and a citizen body on policy development. This goes beyond the Settlement Agreement, and straight to the heart of what Portlanders have been demanding for years. It\u2019s long overdue. So, I\u2019ll announce here today, that the application for the PCCEP will be made available next Friday, April 20. If you care about this city, and believe in the changes that need to be made, I encourage you to apply. Portland needs you.\n\nHow the Portland Police Bureau carries out their duties matters. Earlier I mentioned Portland\u2019s racist history, and the implications for policing in 2018. I expect our officers to be culturally competent and aware of their biases when interacting with community members who do not look like them. Implicit bias training for officers is scheduled to begin in May, and will include direct conversations with invited community members on their perceptions and experiences.\n\nI expect recruitment and hiring to be equitable to ensure that we are working towards an inclusive police force. In short, I expect equity to radiate through every part of the Portland Police Bureau. That is why I am including in my proposed budget funds that will support PPB\u2019s Office of Equity and Diversity in hiring an analyst to move the Police Bureau forward in analyzing its data \u2013 particularly stops data \u2013 and making hiring decisions with an equity lens.\n\nChief Outlaw leads a bureau with fewer officers today than a decade ago, despite a 10 percent increase in Portland\u2019s population.\n\nDispatched calls for service increased by 25 percent in the last five years\u2014including a 97 percent increase in stolen vehicle calls.\n\nOver the past five years, the trend for total response time for all calls has increased significantly.\n\nThat\u2019s why, when I release my proposed budget at the end of this month, I will ask my council colleagues to allow the Police Bureau to hire more officers. Here\u2019s the truth: person crimes \u2013 so, that includes assaults, homicides, sex offenses, etc. \u2013 have increased and are rising at a higher rate than last year; property crimes have also increased and are rising at a higher rate than last year. We are seeing more fatal traffic collisions, in addition to more injury collisions and hit and runs. Portland\u2019s population is exploding, crime is in fact rising, and it is irresponsible for any elected official to pretend otherwise.\n\nWhen anyone in the community calls 911, at a minimum, they expect the police to show up on a timely basis. Chronic understaffing of our police bureau has made it difficult, and sometimes impossible, to live up to this basic expectation.\n\nWe are reaching the tipping point. Not only are there more emergencies, but there are more concurrent emergencies which result in situations where the victim of a crime is forced to wait an hour because there are literally no officers available to help them.\n\nThe police are compensating for this lack of authorized personnel by working the ones they have longer and harder using overtime funds. This is very cost-ineffective and leads to burnout.\n\nAs police bounce from call to call, they cannot take the time they need to get to know the community, build trust, or hear from the people they serve in the ways they want.\n\nThe vision is to return to a full community policing model. Where officers are out of cars and walking in every neighborhood, meeting residents and business owners, attending neighborhood meetings and events, and interacting with and building trust with the people they serve.\n\nThis is the vision I promoted when I ran for office. I asked Chief Outlaw, who shares that vision, to put together a long-term plan \u2013 not for one year or one budget cycle \u2013 to achieve this vision. But we\u2019ve got to start right now.\n\nI ask you to support this plan. Getting back to a full community policing model will improve public safety in Portland and build community trust.\n\nAs we think about that foundation of trust, it allows us to think about the future city that we will give to the next generation, like Faith. I believe that every young person should have the opportunity to connect to a job, and eventually to a career, to support their economic prosperity as well as that our community\u2019s residents and businesses.\n\nYet there are over 30,000 young people ages 16 \u2013 24 in the Portland Metro area who are not connected to school or work. This is a huge opportunity lost for our residents and our businesses.\n\nMy council of economic advisors, representing many small and large Portland businesses across industries, along with Worksystems and Prosper Portland, identified having access to a diverse, qualified pipeline of talent as their number one priority for a prosperous growth outlook.\n\nTogether, we will launch Connect 2 Careers, a new program that connects young people to job opportunities, and Portland area employers to a diverse young talent pool. It\u2019s a smart solution that support individual prosperity as well as business competitiveness.\n\nTomorrow, April 13th, over 40 employers, 30 community organizations and 100s of volunteers will join together for the Inaugural Opportunity Youth Job Fair. The City is proud to be a major sponsor of this event which strives to bring opportunities to those who will define our economic and future growth, young people.\n\nI\u2019m calling on businesses to hire through this program and join the Connect2 Careers partnership.\n\nThe city is supporting, through our 25X25 Jobs plan, the education and career training that is essential to qualify for the jobs that will grow here in technology, health care, construction and other fields.\n\nI\u2019m so proud of the work we did this year on the CEIP Community Equity and Inclusion Plan to ensure that as the city builds, minority contractors and women will get their fair share of the work, and that their workers will get the training they need to build good careers.\n\nWe are a changing city. And the question before us is this: Do we want to lead this transformation or do we want it to take place \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 without us?\n\nI say we lead the transformation together!\n\nI sought the office of Mayor of Portland because I believe Portland can lead while others have stagnated. I believe Portland can create partnerships while others sow divisions. I believe Portland can take the void created by empty rhetoric, and fill it with tangible results.\n\nDespite declining federal and state funding, we are leading a revitalization of our crumbling infrastructure. The plan, called Build Portland, will invest to $600 million over 20 years to maintain our roads, parks, and other civic infrastructure.\n\nThe current infrastructure gap represents a significant long-term liability for the city and threatens to deprive future residents of the services that make Portland one of the world's most livable cities.\n\nCity Council recently approved the first seven projects selected for Build Portland. These investments will improve the safety of our roads, the accessibility of our amenities, and will strengthen our economy.\n\nTogether, we are not merely building a city. We have a chance to build a community.\n\nImagine what we can accomplish together.\n\nWe will be a city of complete neighborhoods, that include housing, jobs, active transit, good schools, and a wealth of food options.\n\nTransportation infrastructure will respond both to the needs of today and the challenges of the future.\n\nWe will leverage our understanding that housing, education, and economic prosperity are all linked, and that prosperity will be shared by all.\n\nWe will be a city where all women \u2013 including women of color who make less than their white peers \u2013 make the same amount as men who do the same work.\n\nWe will be a community for people of all ages. Age-friendly cities recognize we must strive to engage people of all ages socially, civically and economically. I believe that age-friendly cities will be more desirable, successful, and economically viable than those that are not.\n\nOur skyline will be redefined. The Broadway Corridor and the Post Office site in Northwest, Zidell to the South, OMSI and the Rose Quarter in the Central Eastside, and Gateway in the East.\n\nThese developments are exciting and will catalyze housing, jobs, greenspaces, urban habitat, river access, active transportation, and many other exciting opportunities.\n\nI am optimistic about our future, I am optimistic about our people, and I know that together we will succeed. Together, working in partnership, Portland won\u2019t just be a city that works, but a city that works for everyone.\n\nThank you!Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/840377", "artist_names": "Katrina and the Waves", "full_title": "Is That It? by\u00a0Katrina\u00a0and the Waves", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c8b9ae7e77f8a28bd92f677161b2dd2b.300x297x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c8b9ae7e77f8a28bd92f677161b2dd2b.1000x991x1.jpg", "id": 840377, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1549345, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1429279897, "path": "/Katrina-and-the-waves-is-that-it-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Katrina-and-the-waves-is-that-it-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1986, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1986", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1986", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c8b9ae7e77f8a28bd92f677161b2dd2b.300x297x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c8b9ae7e77f8a28bd92f677161b2dd2b.1000x991x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Is That It?", "title_with_featured": "Is That It?", "updated_by_human_at": 1582779174, "url": "https://genius.com/Katrina-and-the-waves-is-that-it-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/105726", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/41c4fcd1b57003747d6e70df3a9a7539.397x417x1.jpg", "id": 105726, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/52022f8df73214ce0926770a728b21dd.479x479x1.jpg", "index_character": "k", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Katrina and the Waves", "slug": "Katrina-and-the-waves", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Katrina-and-the-waves"}, "artist": "Katrina and the Waves", "lyrics": "Is That It?

floor\n[Chorus]\nDon't you know the men all pause?\nWhen I walk into the room, the men all pause\nThe men all pause when I walk into the room\nThe men all pause, and the brides held their grooms\nAnd they all sang the same old tune\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nCheck me out\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\n\n[Verse 2]\nStaring faces starting to get tired\nI wanted to get out and go for a ride\nMaybe this boredom created my hunger\nSo I said, \"Pull over at the local Fatburger\"\nI tried to walk in shy, very unnoticed\nBut the men turned away from their burgers and sodas\nThe focus was on me, I guess admiring good taste\nI tried to play it off, but assurance was all over my face\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you know the men all pause?\nWhen I walk into the room, the men all pause\nThe men all pause when I walk into the room\nThe men all pause, and the brides held their grooms\nAnd they all sang the same old tune\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nCheck me out\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nThe men all pause when I hit the door\nAttention came from the dance floor\nWhen I went to the burger stand\nI had my claim on any man\n'Cause they all loved me\nSlap me, no, somebody slap me\n'Cause I know I'm looking good\nI'm giving attitude all over the room, people are staring at me\nAnd I just look too good for these people\nDon't you know the men all pause?\nYeah, just look at them (Woof)\nThe dog is coming out of them, a natural dog radar (Woof)\nRadar, kitty girl\nI think I'm gonna leave right now because I have some things to do\nCall my chauffeur, I love you\nI love you all, but I got to go\nOh, turn me on\nThe men all pause, the men all pause\nThe men all pause, the men all pause\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't you know the men all pause?\nWhen I walk into the room, the men all pause\nThe men all pause when I walk into the room\nThe men all pause, and the brides held their grooms\nAnd they all sang the same old tune\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nCheck me out\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nWhoa, whoa, whoaEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count":

mend\nAnd maybe tonight you'll fall in love again\nYeah, maybe tonight you'l fall in love again\n[Chorus]\nBut I know, I know that you're down on love\nBut you're wrong, so wrong\nTo be down on love\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow love seems so far away\nYour skies are so cloudy\nAnd the tears come like falling rain\nFace up to it and don't pretend\nAnd maybe tonight you'll fall in love again\nYeah, maybe tonight you'll fall in love again\nJust once in a life you'll realize\nWhen love takes two, only one heart cries\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nIn matters of the heart\nYou better know before you start\nYou can't get down on love\nSo always be prepared\nTo be alone and a little scared\nBut never down on love\n\n[Outro]\nYou see you can't stay down forever, girl\nDown on love\nCome on,

delightful occupation was, to set all matters right that had strayed in any way wrong, or that might, could, would, or should, have strayed in any way wrong, while their name was in abeyance. In tracing out affairs for which John's fictitious death was to be considered in any way responsible, they used a very broad and free construction; regarding, for instance, the dolls' dressmaker as having a claim on their protection, because of her association with Mrs Eugene Wrayburn, and because of Mrs Eugene's old association, in her turn, with the dark side of the story. It followed that the old man, Riah, as a good and serviceable friend to both, was not to be disclaimed. Nor even Mr Inspector, as having been trepanned into an industrious hunt on a false scent. It may be remarked, in connexion with that worthy officer, that a rumour shortly afterwards pervaded the Force, to the effect that he had confided to Miss Abbey Potterson, over a jug of mellow flip in the bar of the Six Jolly Fellowship Porters, that he 'didn't stand to lose a farthing' through Mr Harmon's coming to life, but was quite as well satisfied as if that gentleman had been barbarously murdered, and he (Mr Inspector) had pocketed the government reward.\n\nIn all their arrangements of such nature, Mr and Mrs John Harmon derived much assistance from their eminent solicitor, Mr Mortimer Lightwood; who laid about him professionally with such unwonted despatch and intention, that a piece of work was vigorously pursued as soon as cut out; whereby Young Blight was acted on as by that transatlantic dram which is poetically named An Eye-Opener, and found himself staring at real clients instead of out of window. The accessibility of Riah proving very useful as to a few hints towards the disentanglement of Eugene's affairs, Lightwood applied himself with infinite zest to attacking and harassing Mr Fledgeby: who, discovering himself in danger of being blown into the air by certain explosive transactions in which he had been engaged, and having been sufficiently flayed under his beating, came to a parley and asked for quarter. The harmless Twemlow profited by the conditions entered into, though he little thought it. Mr Riah unaccountably melted; waited in person on him over the stable yard in Duke Street, St James's, no longer ravening but mild, to inform him that payment of interest as heretofore, but henceforth at Mr Lightwood's offices, would appease his Jewish rancour; and departed with the secret that Mr John Harmon had advanced the money and become the creditor. Thus, was the sublime Snigsworth's wrath averted, and thus did he snort no larger amount of moral grandeur at the Corinthian column in the print over the fireplace, than was normally in his (and the British) constitution.\n\nMrs Wilfer's first visit to the Mendicant's bride at the new abode of Mendicancy, was a grand event. Pa had been sent for into the City, on the very day of taking possession, and had been stunned with astonishment, and brought-to, and led about the house by one ear, to behold its various treasures, and had been enraptured and enchanted. Pa had also been appointed Secretary, and had been enjoined to give instant notice of resignation to Chicksey, Veneering, and Stobbles, for ever and ever. But Ma came later, and came, as was her due, in state.\n\nThe carriage was sent for Ma, who entered it with a bearing worthy of the occasion, accompanied, rather than supported, by Miss Lavinia, who altogether declined to recognize the maternal majesty. Mr George Sampson meekly followed. He was received in the vehicle, by Mrs Wilfer, as if admitted to the honour of assisting at a funeral in the family, and she then issued the order, 'Onward!' to the Mendicant's menial.\n'I wish to goodness, Ma,' said Lavvy, throwing herself back among the cushions, with her arms crossed, 'that you'd loll a little.'\n'How!' repeated Mrs Wilfer. 'Loll!'\n\n'Yes, Ma.'\n\n'I hope,' said the impressive lady, 'I am incapable of it.'\n\n'I am sure you look so, Ma. But why one should go out to dine with one's own daughter or sister, as if one's under-petticoat was a blackboard, I do NOT understand.'\n\n'Neither do I understand,' retorted Mrs Wilfer, with deep scorn, 'how a young lady can mention the garment in the name of which you have indulged. I blush for you.'\n\n'Thank you, Ma,' said Lavvy, yawning, 'but I can do it for myself, I am obliged to you, when there's any occasion.'\n\nHere, Mr Sampson, with the view of establishing harmony, which he never under any circumstances succeeded in doing, said with an agreeable smile: 'After all, you know, ma'am, we know it's there.' And immediately felt that he had committed himself.\n\n'We know it's there!' said Mrs Wilfer, glaring.\n\n'Really, George,' remonstrated Miss Lavinia, 'I must say that I don't understand your allusions, and that I think you might be more delicate and less personal.'\n\n'Go it!' cried Mr Sampson, becoming, on the shortest notice, a prey to despair. 'Oh yes! Go it, Miss Lavinia Wilfer!'\n\n'What you may mean, George Sampson, by your omnibus-driving expressions, I cannot pretend to imagine. Neither,' said Miss Lavinia, 'Mr George Sampson, do I wish to imagine. It is enough for me to know in my own heart that I am not going to\u2014' having imprudently got into a sentence without providing a way out of it, Miss Lavinia was constrained to close with 'going to it'. A weak conclusion which, however, derived some appearance of strength from disdain.\n\n'Oh yes!' cried Mr Sampson, with bitterness. 'Thus it ever is. I never\u2014'\n\n'If you mean to say,' Miss Lavvy cut him short, that you never brought up a young gazelle, you may save yourself the trouble, because nobody in this carriage supposes that you ever did. We know you better.' (As if this were a home-thrust.)\n'Lavinia,' returned Mr Sampson, in a dismal vein, 'I did not mean to say so. What I did mean to say, was, that I never expected to retain my favoured place in this family, after Fortune shed her beams upon it. Why do you take me,' said Mr Sampson, 'to the glittering halls with which I can never compete, and then taunt me with my moderate salary? Is it generous? Is it kind?'\n\nThe stately lady, Mrs Wilfer, perceiving her opportunity of delivering a few remarks from the throne, here took up the altercation.\n'Mr Sampson,' she began, 'I cannot permit you to misrepresent the intentions of a child of mine.'\n\n'Let him alone, Ma,' Miss Lavvy interposed with haughtiness. 'It is indifferent to me what he says or does.'\n\n'Nay, Lavinia,' quoth Mrs Wilfer, 'this touches the blood of the family. If Mr George Sampson attributes, even to my youngest daughter\u2014'\n('I don't see why you should use the word \"even\", Ma,' Miss Lavvy interposed, 'because I am quite as important as any of the others.')\n'Peace!' said Mrs Wilfer, solemnly. 'I repeat, if Mr George Sampson attributes, to my youngest daughter, grovelling motives, he attributes them equally to the mother of my youngest daughter. That mother repudiates them, and demands of Mr George Sampson, as a youth of honour, what he WOULD have? I may be mistaken\u2014nothing is more likely\u2014but Mr George Sampson,' proceeded Mrs Wilfer, majestically waving her gloves, 'appears to me to be seated in a first-class equipage. Mr George Sampson appears to me to be on his way, by his own admission, to a residence that may be termed Palatial. Mr George Sampson appears to me to be invited to participate in the\u2014shall I say the\u2014Elevation which has descended on the family with which he is ambitious, shall I say to Mingle? Whence, then, this tone on Mr Sampson's part?'\n\n'It is only, ma'am,' Mr Sampson explained, in exceedingly low spirits, 'because, in a pecuniary sense, I am painfully conscious of my unworthiness. Lavinia is now highly connected. Can I hope that she will still remain the same Lavinia as of old? And is it not pardonable if I feel sensitive, when I see a disposition on her part to take me up short?'\n\n'If you are not satisfied with your position, sir,' observed Miss Lavinia, with much politeness, 'we can set you down at any turning you may please to indicate to my sister's coachman.'\n\n'Dearest Lavinia,' urged Mr Sampson, pathetically, 'I adore you.'\n\n'Then if you can't do it in a more agreeable manner,' returned the young lady, 'I wish you wouldn't.'\n\n'I also,' pursued Mr Sampson, 'respect you, ma'am, to an extent which must ever be below your merits, I am well aware, but still up to an uncommon mark. Bear with a wretch, Lavinia, bear with a wretch, ma'am, who feels the noble sacrifices you make for him, but is goaded almost to madness,' Mr Sampson slapped his forehead, 'when he thinks of competing with the rich and influential.'\n\n'When you have to compete with the rich and influential, it will probably be mentioned to you,' said Miss Lavvy, 'in good time. At least, it will if the case is MY case.'\n\nMr Sampson immediately expressed his fervent Opinion that this was 'more than human', and was brought upon his knees at Miss Lavinia's feet.\nIt was the crowning addition indispensable to the full enjoyment of both mother and daughter, to bear Mr Sampson, a grateful captive, into the glittering halls he had mentioned, and to parade him through the same, at once a living witness of their glory, and a bright instance of their condescension. Ascending the staircase, Miss Lavinia permitted him to walk at her side, with the air of saying: 'Notwithstanding all these surroundings, I am yours as yet, George. How long it may last is another question, but I am yours as yet.' She also benignantly intimated to him, aloud, the nature of the objects upon which he looked, and to which he was unaccustomed: as, 'Exotics, George,' 'An aviary, George,' 'An ormolu clock, George,' and the like. While, through the whole of the decorations, Mrs Wilfer led the way with the bearing of a Savage Chief, who would feel himself compromised by manifesting the slightest token of surprise or admiration.\nIndeed, the bearing of this impressive woman, throughout the day, was a pattern to all impressive women under similar circumstances. She renewed the acquaintance of Mr and Mrs Boffin, as if Mr and Mrs Boffin had said of her what she had said of them, and as if Time alone could quite wear her injury out. She regarded every servant who approached her, as her sworn enemy, expressly intending to offer her affronts with the dishes, and to pour forth outrages on her moral feelings from the decanters. She sat erect at table, on the right hand of her son-in-law, as half suspecting poison in the viands, and as bearing up with native force of character against other deadly ambushes. Her carriage towards Bella was as a carriage towards a young lady of good position, whom she had met in society a few years ago. Even when, slightly thawing under the influence of sparkling champagne, she related to her son-in-law some passages of domestic interest concerning her papa, she infused into the narrative such Arctic suggestions of her having been an unappreciated blessing to mankind, since her papa's days, and also of that gentleman's having been a frosty impersonation of a frosty race, as struck cold to the very soles of the feet of the hearers. The Inexhaustible being produced, staring, and evidently intending a weak and washy smile shortly, no sooner beheld her, than it was stricken spasmodic and inconsolable. When she took her leave at last, it would have been hard to say whether it was with the air of going to the scaffold herself, or of leaving the inmates of the house for immediate execution. Yet, John Harmon enjoyed it all merrily, and told his wife, when he and she were alone, that her natural ways had never seemed so dearly natural as beside this foil, and that although he did not dispute her being her father's daughter, he should ever remain stedfast in the faith that she could not be her mother's.\n\nThis visit was, as has been said, a grand event. Another event, not grand but deemed in the house a special one, occurred at about the same period; and this was, the first interview between Mr Sloppy and Miss Wren.\n\nThe dolls' dressmaker, being at work for the Inexhaustible upon a full-dressed doll some two sizes larger than that young person, Mr Sloppy undertook to call for it, and did so.\n\n'Come in, sir,' said Miss Wren, who was working at her bench. 'And who may you be?'\n\nMr Sloppy introduced himself by name and buttons.\n\n'Oh indeed!' cried Jenny. 'Ah! I have been looking forward to knowing you. I heard of your distinguishing yourself.'\n'Did you, Miss?' grinned Sloppy. 'I am sure I am glad to hear it, but I don't know how.'\n\n'Pitching somebody into a mud-cart,' said Miss Wren.\n\n'Oh! That way!' cried Sloppy. 'Yes, Miss.' And threw back his head and laughed.\n\n'Bless us!' exclaimed Miss Wren, with a start. 'Don't open your mouth as wide as that, young man, or it'll catch so, and not shut again some day.'\n\nMr Sloppy opened it, if possible, wider, and kept it open until his laugh was out.\n\n'Why, you're like the giant,' said Miss Wren, 'when he came home in the land of Beanstalk, and wanted Jack for supper.'\n\n'Was he good-looking, Miss?' asked Sloppy.\n\n'No,' said Miss Wren. 'Ugly.'\n\nHer visitor glanced round the room\u2014which had many comforts in it now, that had not been in it before\u2014and said: 'This is a pretty place, Miss.'\n'Glad you think so, sir,' returned Miss Wren. 'And what do you think of Me?'\n\nThe honesty of Mr Sloppy being severely taxed by the question, he twisted a button, grinned, and faltered.\n\n'Out with it!' said Miss Wren, with an arch look. 'Don't you think me a queer little comicality?' In shaking her head at him after asking the question, she shook her hair down.\n\n'Oh!' cried Sloppy, in a burst of admiration. 'What a lot, and what a colour!'\n\nMiss Wren, with her usual expressive hitch, went on with her work. But, left her hair as it was; not displeased by the effect it had made.\n'You don't live here alone; do you, Miss?' asked Sloppy.\n\n'No,' said Miss Wren, with a chop. 'Live here with my fairy godmother.'\n\n'With;' Mr Sloppy couldn't make it out; 'with who did you say, Miss?'\n\n'Well!' replied Miss Wren, more seriously. 'With my second father. Or with my first, for that matter.' And she shook her head, and drew a sigh. 'If you had known a poor child I used to have here,' she added, 'you'd have understood me. But you didn't, and you can't. All the better!'\n\n'You must have been taught a long time,' said Sloppy, glancing at the array of dolls in hand, 'before you came to work so neatly, Miss, and with such a pretty taste.'\n\n'Never was taught a stitch, young man!' returned the dress-maker, tossing her head. 'Just gobbled and gobbled, till I found out how to do it. Badly enough at first, but better now.'\n\n'And here have I,' said Sloppy, in something of a self-reproachful tone, 'been a learning and a learning, and here has Mr Boffin been a paying and a paying, ever so long!'\n\n'I have heard what your trade is,' observed Miss Wren; 'it's cabinet-making.'\n\nMr Sloppy nodded. 'Now that the Mounds is done with, it is. I'll tell you what, Miss. I should like to make you something.'\n'Much obliged. But what?'\n\n'I could make you,' said Sloppy, surveying the room, 'I could make you a handy set of nests to lay the dolls in. Or I could make you a handy little set of drawers, to keep your silks and threads and scraps in. Or I could turn you a rare handle for that crutch-stick, if it belongs to him you call your father.'\n\n'It belongs to me,' returned the little creature, with a quick flush of her face and neck. 'I am lame.'\n\nPoor Sloppy flushed too, for there was an instinctive delicacy behind his buttons, and his own hand had struck it. He said, perhaps, the best thing in the way of amends that could be said. 'I am very glad it's yours, because I'd rather ornament it for you than for any one else. Please may I look at it?'\n\nMiss Wren was in the act of handing it to him over her bench, when she paused. 'But you had better see me use it,' she said, sharply. 'This is the way. Hoppetty, Kicketty, Pep-peg-peg. Not pretty; is it?'\n\n'It seems to me that you hardly want it at all,' said Sloppy.\n\nThe little dressmaker sat down again, and gave it into his hand, saying, with that better look upon her, and with a smile: 'Thank you!'\n'And as concerning the nests and the drawers,' said Sloppy, after measuring the handle on his sleeve, and softly standing the stick aside against the wall, 'why, it would be a real pleasure to me. I've heerd tell that you can sing most beautiful; and I should be better paid with a song than with any money, for I always loved the likes of that, and often giv' Mrs Higden and Johnny a comic song myself, with \"Spoken\" in it. Though that's not your sort, I'll wager.'\n\n'You are a very kind young man,' returned the dressmaker; 'a really kind young man. I accept your offer.\u2014I suppose He won't mind,' she added as an afterthought, shrugging her shoulders; 'and if he does, he may!'\n\n'Meaning him that you call your father, Miss,' asked Sloppy.\n\n'No, no,' replied Miss Wren. 'Him, Him, Him!'\n\n'Him, him, him?' repeated Sloppy; staring about, as if for Him.\n\n'Him who is coming to court and marry me,' returned Miss Wren. 'Dear me, how slow you are!'\n\n'Oh! HIM!' said Sloppy. And seemed to turn thoughtful and a little troubled. 'I never thought of him. When is he coming, Miss?'\n\n'What a question!' cried Miss Wren. 'How should I know!'\n\n'Where is he coming from, Miss?'\n\n'Why, good gracious, how can I tell! He is coming from somewhere or other, I suppose, and he is coming some day or other, I suppose. I don't know any more about him, at present.'\n\nThis tickled Mr Sloppy as an extraordinarily good joke, and he threw back his head and laughed with measureless enjoyment. At the sight of him laughing in that absurd way, the dolls' dressmaker laughed very heartily indeed. So they both laughed, till they were tired.\n\n'There, there, there!' said Miss Wren. 'For goodness' sake, stop, Giant, or I shall be swallowed up alive, before I know it. And to this minute you haven't said what you've come for.'\n\n'I have come for little Miss Harmonses doll,' said Sloppy.\n\n'I thought as much,' remarked Miss Wren, 'and here is little Miss Harmonses doll waiting for you. She's folded up in silver paper, you see, as if she was wrapped from head to foot in new Bank notes. Take care of her, and there's my hand, and thank you again.'\n\n'I'll take more care of her than if she was a gold image,' said Sloppy, 'and there's both MY hands, Miss, and I'll soon come back again.'\n\nBut, the greatest event of all, in the new life of Mr and Mrs John Harmon, was a visit from Mr and Mrs Eugene Wrayburn. Sadly wan and worn was the once gallant Eugene, and walked resting on his wife's arm, and leaning heavily upon a stick. But, he was daily growing stronger and better, and it was declared by the medical attendants that he might not be much disfigured by-and-by. It was a grand event, indeed, when Mr and Mrs Eugene Wrayburn came to stay at Mr and Mrs John Harmon's house: where, by the way, Mr and Mrs Boffin (exquisitely happy, and daily cruising about, to look at shops,) were likewise staying indefinitely.\n\nTo Mr Eugene Wrayburn, in confidence, did Mrs John Harmon impart what she had known of the state of his wife's affections, in his reckless time. And to Mrs John Harmon, in confidence, did Mr Eugene Wrayburn impart that, please God, she should see how his wife had changed him!\n'I make no protestations,' said Eugene; '\u2014who does, who means them!\u2014I have made a resolution.'\n\n'But would you believe, Bella,' interposed his wife, coming to resume her nurse's place at his side, for he never got on well without her: 'that on our wedding day he told me he almost thought the best thing he could do, was to die?'\n\n'As I didn't do it, Lizzie,' said Eugene, 'I'll do that better thing you suggested\u2014for your sake.'\n\nThat same afternoon, Eugene lying on his couch in his own room upstairs, Lightwood came to chat with him, while Bella took his wife out for a ride. 'Nothing short of force will make her go,' Eugene had said; so, Bella had playfully forced her.\n\n'Dear old fellow,' Eugene began with Lightwood, reaching up his hand, 'you couldn't have come at a better time, for my mind is full, and I want to empty it. First, of my present, before I touch upon my future. M. R. F., who is a much younger cavalier than I, and a professed admirer of beauty, was so affable as to remark the other day (he paid us a visit of two days up the river there, and much objected to the accommodation of the hotel), that Lizzie ought to have her portrait painted. Which, coming from M. R. F., may be considered equivalent to a melodramatic blessing.'\n\n'You are getting well,' said Mortimer, with a smile.\n\n'Really,' said Eugene, 'I mean it. When M. R. F. said that, and followed it up by rolling the claret (for which he called, and I paid), in his mouth, and saying, \"My dear son, why do you drink this trash?\" it was tantamount in him\u2014to a paternal benediction on our union, accompanied with a gush of tears. The coolness of M. R. F. is not to be measured by ordinary standards.'\n\n'True enough,' said Lightwood.\n\n'That's all,' pursued Eugene, 'that I shall ever hear from M. R. F. on the subject, and he will continue to saunter through the world with his hat on one side. My marriage being thus solemnly recognized at the family altar, I have no further trouble on that score. Next, you really have done wonders for me, Mortimer, in easing my money-perplexities, and with such a guardian and steward beside me, as the preserver of my life (I am hardly strong yet, you see, for I am not man enough to refer to her without a trembling voice\u2014she is so inexpressibly dear to me, Mortimer!), the little that I can call my own will be more than it ever has been. It need be more, for you know what it always has been in my hands. Nothing.'\n\n'Worse than nothing, I fancy, Eugene. My own small income (I devoutly wish that my grandfather had left it to the Ocean rather than to me!) has been an effective Something, in the way of preventing me from turning to at Anything. And I think yours has been much the same.'\n'There spake the voice of wisdom,' said Eugene. 'We are shepherds both. In turning to at last, we turn to in earnest. Let us say no more of that, for a few years to come. Now, I have had an idea, Mortimer, of taking myself and my wife to one of the colonies, and working at my vocation there.'\n\n'I should be lost without you, Eugene; but you may be right.'\n\n'No,' said Eugene, emphatically. 'Not right. Wrong!'\n\nHe said it with such a lively\u2014almost angry\u2014flash, that Mortimer showed himself greatly surprised.\n\n'You think this thumped head of mine is excited?' Eugene went on, with a high look; 'not so, believe me. I can say to you of the healthful music of my pulse what Hamlet said of his. My blood is up, but wholesomely up, when I think of it. Tell me! Shall I turn coward to Lizzie, and sneak away with her, as if I were ashamed of her! Where would your friend's part in this world be, Mortimer, if she had turned coward to him, and on immeasurably better occasion?'\n\n'Honourable and stanch,' said Lightwood. 'And yet, Eugene\u2014'\n\n'And yet what, Mortimer?'\n\n'And yet, are you sure that you might not feel (for her sake, I say for her sake) any slight coldness towards her on the part of\u2014Society?'\n'O! You and I may well stumble at the word,' returned Eugene, laughing. 'Do we mean our Tippins?'\n\n'Perhaps we do,' said Mortimer, laughing also.\n\n'Faith, we DO!' returned Eugene, with great animation. 'We may hide behind the bush and beat about it, but we DO! Now, my wife is something nearer to my heart, Mortimer, than Tippins is, and I owe her a little more than I owe to Tippins, and I am rather prouder of her than I ever was of Tippins. Therefore, I will fight it out to the last gasp, with her and for her, here, in the open field. When I hide her, or strike for her, faint-heartedly, in a hole or a corner, do you whom I love next best upon earth, tell me what I shall most righteously deserve to be told:\u2014that she would have done well to turn me over with her foot that night when I lay bleeding to death, and spat in my dastard face.'\n\nThe glow that shone upon him as he spoke the words, so irradiated his features that he looked, for the time, as though he had never been mutilated. His friend responded as Eugene would have had him respond, and they discoursed of the future until Lizzie came back. After resuming her place at his side, and tenderly touching his hands and his head, she said:\n\n'Eugene, dear, you made me go out, but I ought to have stayed with you. You are more flushed than you have been for many days. What have you been doing?'\n\n'Nothing,' replied Eugene, 'but looking forward to your coming back.'\n\n'And talking to Mr Lightwood,' said Lizzie, turning to him with a smile. 'But it cannot have been Society that disturbed you.'\n\n'Faith, my dear love!' retorted Eugene, in his old airy manner, as he laughed and kissed her, 'I rather think it WAS Society though!'\nThe word ran so much in Mortimer Lightwood's thoughts as he went home to the Temple that night, that he resolved to take a look at Society, which he had not seen for a considerable period.Embed"}, {"_type":

get the best of you\nYou're fuelin' my suspicions--I'm taken by the sneak preview\nYou got the numbers--you got no limits\nOne day you're out but the next day you're in it\nYou find the answers--you know what to say\nGive us our reasons for livin' today\nI got my eyes on you\nGot my eye on you...\n\nWe share the laughter and pain when you're in it\nBring on disaster--cause we know you'll win

and flickered out\nYou sped away and you turned down the highway\n\nSo you ran(you keep on runnin)\nTook the heart of a lonly man\nI hope youd say\nBut now youve gone away\nSeemed like I never got a hold on you\nThe harder I tried the more desperate I grew\nI should have known I couldn't change your heart\nYou once said you need to be free\nOh babe you could have been with me\nYou fade away like the sun turning to darkness\n\nSo you ran(you keep on runnin)\nTook the heart of a lonly man\nI hope youd say\nBut now youve gone away\n\nIn this life we might find our way\nBut love is more than just day to day\n\nWhy (Echo) why why why\n\nSo you ran\nSo you ran\nSo you ran\n\nBaby\nI wonder who your with tonight\nCan he save you from the sacrafice\nWill he love you hold you\nFor another day\nOr is it just a stop on your lonly highway\nYou might also likeBaby\n\nSo you ran(you keep on runnin)\nTook the heart of a lonly man\nSo you ran\nI hope youd say\nBut now youve gone awayEmbed"},

Thank you. Thank you so much, please. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, members of Congress, my fellow Americans.\n\nWe are fifteen years into this new century. Fifteen years that dawned with terror touching our shores; that unfolded with a new generation fighting two long and costly wars; that saw a vicious recession spread across our nation and the world. It has been, and still is, a hard time for many.\n\nBut tonight, we turn the page.\n\nTonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999.\n\nOur unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis. More of our kids are graduating than ever before; more of our people are insured than ever before. We are as free from the grip of foreign oil as we've been in almost 30 years.\nTonight, for the first time since 9/11, our combat mission in Afghanistan is over.\n\nSix years ago, nearly 180,000 American troops served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Today, fewer than 15,000 remain. And we salute the courage and sacrifice of every man and woman in this 9/11 generation ... who has served to keep us safe. We are humbled and grateful for your service.\n\nAmerica, for all that we've endured, for all the grit and hard work required to come back, for all the tasks that lie ahead, know this: The shadow of crisis has passed, and the State of the Union is strong.\n\nAt this moment, with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy production, we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next fifteen years, and for decades to come.\n\nWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\n\nWill we approach the world fearful and reactive, dragged into costly conflicts that strain our military and set back our standing? Or will we lead wisely, using all elements of our power to defeat new threats and protect our planet?\nWill we allow ourselves to be sorted into factions and turned against one another, or will we recapture the sense of common purpose that has always propelled America forward?\n\nIn two weeks, I will send this Congress a budget filled with ideas that are practical, not partisan. And in the months ahead, I'll crisscross the country making a case for those ideas.\n\nSo tonight, I want to focus less on a checklist of proposals, and focus more on the values at stake in the choices before us.\n\nIt begins with our economy.\n\nSeven years ago, Rebekah and Ben Erler of Minneapolis were newlyweds.\n\nShe waited tables. He worked construction. Their first child, Jack, was on the way. They were young and in love in America, and it doesn't get much better than that.\n\n\"If only we had known,\" Rebekah wrote to me last spring, \"what was about to happen to the housing and construction market.\"\nAs the crisis worsened, Ben's business dried up, so he took what jobs he could find, even if they kept him on the road for long stretches of time.\n\nRebekah took out student loans and enrolled in community college and retrained for a new career.\n\nThey sacrificed for each other, and slowly, it paid off. They bought their first home. They had a second son, Henry. Rebekah got a better job, and then a raise. Ben's back in construction and home for dinner every night.\n\n\"It is amazing,\" Rebekah wrote, \"what you can bounce back from when you have to. We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, hard times.\"\n\n\"We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, hard times.\"\n\nAmerica, Rebekah and Ben's story is our story. They represent the millions who've worked hard and scrimped and sacrificed and retooled.\n\nYou are the reason that I ran for this office. You are the people I was thinking of six years ago today in the darkest months of the crisis when I stood on the steps of this Capitol and promised we would rebuild our economy on a new foundation. And it has been your resilience, your effort that has made it possible for our country to emerge stronger.\n\nWe believed we could reverse the tide of outsourcing, and draw new jobs to our shores. And over the past five years, our businesses have created more than 11 million new jobs.\n\nWe believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet. And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008.\n\nAnd thanks to lower gas prices and higher fuel standards, the typical family this year should save about $750 at the pump.\n\nWe believed we could prepare our kids for a more competitive world. And today, our younger students have earned the highest math and reading scores on record. Our high school graduation rate has hit an all-time high. More Americans finish college than ever before.\n\nWe believed that sensible regulations could prevent another crisis, shield families from ruin, and encourage fair competition.\n\nToday, we have new tools to stop taxpayer-funded bailouts, and a new consumer watchdog to protect us from predatory lending and abusive credit card practices. And in the past year alone, about ten million uninsured Americans finally gained the security of health coverage.\nAt every step, we were told our goals were misguided or too ambitious, that we would crush jobs and explode deficits. Instead, we've seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade, our deficits cut by two thirds, a stock market that has doubled and health care inflation at its lowest rate in 50 years.\n\nThere's good news, people.\n\nSo...\n\nSo -- so the verdict is clear. Middle-class economics works, expanding opportunity works, and these policies will continue to work as long as politics don't get in the way.\nWe can't slow down businesses or put our economy at risk with government shutdowns or fiscal showdowns. We can't put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street or refighting past battles on immigration when we've got to fix a broken system.\nAnd if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, I will veto it. It will have earned my veto.\nToday, thanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small-business owners plan to raise their employees' pay than at any time since 2007.\n\nBut here's the thing. Those of us here tonight, we need to set our sights higher than just making sure government doesn't screw things up, the government doesn't halt the progress we're making. We need to do more than just do no harm.\n\nTonight, together, let's do more to restore the link between hard work and growing opportunity for every American.\nBecause families like Rebekah's still need our help. She and Ben are working as hard as ever, but they've had to forego vacations and a new car so that they can pay off student loans and save for retirement. Friday night pizza, that's a big splurge. Basic child care for Jack and Henry costs more than their mortgage, and almost as much as a year at the University of Minnesota.\nLike millions of hardworking Americans, Rebekah isn't asking for a handout, but she is asking that we look for more ways to help families get ahead.\n\nAnd in fact, at every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot.\n\nWe set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet, tools they needed to go as far as their efforts and their dreams will take them.\n\nThat's what middle-class economics is: the idea that this country does best when everyone gets their fair shot, everyone does their fair share, everyone plays by the same set of rules.\n\nWe don't just want everyone to share in America's success; we want everyone to contribute to our success.\n\nSo -- so what does middle-class economics require in our time?\n\nFirst, middle-class economics means helping working families feel more secure in a world of constant change. That means helping folks afford child care, college, health care, a home, retirement, and my budget will address each of these issues, lowering the taxes of working families and putting thousands of dollars back into their pockets each year.\n\nHere's one example: During World War II, when men like my grandfather went off to war, having women like my grandmother in the workforce was a national security priority. So this country provided universal child care.\n\nIn today's economy, when having both parents in the workforce is an economic necessity for many families, we need affordable, high-quality child care more than ever.\n\nIt's not a nice-to-have: it's a must-have. So it's time we stop treating childcare as a side issue, or a women's issue, and treat it like the national economic priority that it is for all of us.\nAnd that's why my plan will make quality childcare more available, and more affordable, for every middle-class and low-income family with young children in America, by creating more slots and a new tax cut of up to $3,000 per child, per year.\n\nHere's another example. Today, we are the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't guarantee paid sick leave or paid maternity leave to our workers. 43 million workers have no paid sick leave. 43 million. Think about that.\nAnd that forces too many parents to make the gut-wrenching choice between a paycheck and a sick kid at home. So I'll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own. And since paid sick leave won where it was on the ballot last November, let's put it to a vote right here in Washington.\n\nSend me a bill that gives every worker in America the opportunity to earn seven days of paid sick leave.\nIt's the right thing to do.\n\nOf course, nothing helps families make ends meet like higher wages. That's why this Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.\nIt's 2015.\nIt's time.\n\nWe still need to make sure employees get the overtime they've earned ... and -- and everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, try it.\n\nIf not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.\n\nThese ideas won't make everybody rich, won't relieve every hardship. That's not the job of government.\n\nTo give working families a fair shot, we still need more employers to see beyond next quarter's earnings and recognize that investing in their workforce is in their company's long-term interest.\nWe still need laws that strengthen rather than weaken unions, and give American workers a voice.\n\nBut -- but you know, things like child care and sick leave and equal pay, things like lower mortgage premiums and a higher minimum wage, these ideas will make a meaningful difference in the lives of millions of families. That's a fact. And that's what all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, were sent here to do.\n\nSecond, to make sure folks keep earning higher wages down the road, we have to do more to help Americans upgrade their skills.\nNow America thrived in the 20th century because we made high school free, sent a generation of G.I.s to college, trained the best workforce in the world. We were ahead of the curve. But other countries caught on. And in a 21st century economy that rewards knowledge like never before, we need to up our game. We need to do more.\n\nBy the end of this decade, two in three job openings will require some higher education. Two in three. And yet, we still live in a country where too many bright, striving Americans are priced out of the education they need. It's not fair to them, and it's sure not smart for our future.\nThat's why I am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college to zero.\n\nKeep in mind, 40 percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market.\n\nWhoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt. Understand, you've got to earn it. You've got to keep your grades up and graduate on time.\nTennessee, a state with Republican leadership, and Chicago, a city with Democratic leadership, are showing that free community college is possible. I want to spread that idea all across America so that two years of college becomes as free and universal in America as high school is today.\n\nLet's stay ahead of the curve.\n\nAnd -- and I want to work with this Congress to make sure Americans already burdened with student loans can reduce their monthly payments so that student debt doesn't derail anyone's dreams.\n\nThanks to Vice President Biden's great work to update our job training system, we're connecting community colleges with local employers to train workers to fill high-paying jobs like coding and nursing and robotics.\n\nTonight, I'm also asking more businesses to follow the lead of companies like CVS and UPS and offer more educational benefits and paid apprenticeships, opportunities that give workers the chance to earn higher-paying jobs, even if they don't have a higher education.\n\nAnd as a new generation of veterans comes home, we owe them every opportunity to live the American Dream they helped defend.\n\nAlready, we've made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care, we're slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we're making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.\n\nAnd Joining Forces, the national campaign launched by Michelle and Jill Biden... thank you, Michelle, thank you, Jill -- has helped nearly 700,000 veterans and military spouses get a new job.\n\nSo to every CEO in America, let me repeat: If you want somebody who's going to get the job done, and done right, hire a veteran.\n\nFinally, as we better train our workers, we need the new economy to keep churning out high-wage jobs for our workers to fill.\n\nSince 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined.\n\nOur manufacturers have added almost 800,000 new jobs. Some of our bedrock sectors, like our auto industry, are booming. But there are also millions of Americans who work in jobs that didn't even exist 10 or 20 years ago: jobs at companies like Google, and eBay, and Tesla.\n\nSo no one knows for certain which industries will generate the jobs of the future. But we do know we want them here in America.\n\nWe know that.\n\nThat's why the third part of middle-class economics is all about building the most competitive economy anywhere, the place where businesses want to locate and hire.\n\n21st century businesses need 21st century infrastructure: modern ports, and stronger bridges, faster trains and the fastest Internet.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans used to agree on this. So let's set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline; let's pass a bipartisan ... infrastructure plan that could create more than 30 times as many jobs per year and make this country stronger for decades to come.\n\nLet's do it. Let's get it done.\n\nLet's get it done.\n\n21st century businesses, including small businesses, need to sell more American products overseas. Today, our businesses export more than ever, and exporters tend to pay their workers higher wages.\n\nBut as we speak, China wants to write the rules for the world's fastest-growing region. That would put our workers and our businesses at a disadvantage.\n\nWhy would we let that happen? We should write those rules. We should level the playing field.\n\nThat's why I'm asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe ... that aren't just free but are also fair. It's the right thing to do.\n\nLook, I'm -- I'm the first one to admit -- I'm the first one to admit that past trade deals haven't always lived up to the hype, and that's why we've gone after countries ... that break the rules at our expense. But 95 percent of the world's customers live outside our borders. We can't close ourselves off from those opportunities.\n\nMore than half of manufacturing executives have said they're actively looking to bring jobs back from China. So let's give them one more reason to get it done.\n\n21st century businesses will rely on American science and technology, research and development. I want the country that eliminated polio and mapped the human genome to lead a new era of medicine: one that delivers the right treatment at the right time.\n\nIn some patients with cystic fibrosis, this approach has reversed a disease once thought unstoppable. Tonight, I'm launching a new Precision Medicine Initiative to bring us closer to curing diseases like cancer and diabetes and to give all of us access to the personalized information we need to keep ourselves and our families healthier.\n\nWe can do this.\n\nI intend to protect a free and open Internet, to extend its reach to every classroom, and every community ... and help folks build the fastest networks, so that the next generation of digital innovators and entrepreneurs have the platform to keep reshaping our world.\n\nI want Americans to win the race for the kinds of discoveries that unleash new jobs: converting sunlight into liquid fuel; creating revolutionary prosthetics, so that a veteran who gave his arms for his country can play catch with his kids again.\n\nPushing out into the Solar System not just to visit, but to stay. Last month, we launched a new spacecraft as part of a re-energized space program that will send American astronauts to Mars.\n\nAn in two months, to prepare us for those missions, Scott Kelly will begin a year-long stay in space.\n\nSo good luck, Captain.\n\nMake sure to Instagram it. We're proud of you.\n\nNow, the truth is when it comes to issues like infrastructure and basic research, I know there's bipartisan support in this chamber. Members of both parties have told me so.\n\nWhere we too often run onto the rocks is how to pay for these investments. As Americans, we don't mind paying our fair share of taxes, as long as everybody else does too.\n\nBut for far too long, lobbyists have rigged the tax code with loopholes that let some corporations pay nothing while others pay full freight. They've riddled it with giveaways that the super rich don't need, while denying a break to middle-class families who do.\n\nThis year, we have an opportunity to change that. Let's close loopholes so we stop rewarding companies that keep profits abroad, and reward those that invest in America.\n\nLet's use those savings to rebuild our infrastructure and make it more attractive for companies to bring jobs home. Let's simplify the system and let a small-business owner file based on her actual bank statement instead of the number of accountants she can afford.\n\nAnd let's close the loopholes that lead to inequality by allowing the top one percent to avoid paying taxes on their accumulated wealth. We can use that money to help more families pay for childcare and send their kids to college. We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together.\n\nWe can achieve it together.\n\nHelping hardworking families make ends meet. Giving them the tools they need for good-paying jobs in this new economy. Maintaining the conditions of growth and competitiveness. This is where America needs to go. I believe it's where the American people want to go. It will make our economy stronger a year from now, 15 years from now, and deep into the century ahead.\n\nOf course, if there's one thing this new century has taught us, it's that we cannot separate our work at home from challenges beyond our shores.\n\nMy first duty as Commander-in-Chief is to defend the United States of America. In doing so, the question is not -- in doing so the question is not whether America leads in the world, but how.\n\nWhen we make rash decisions, reacting to the headlines instead of using our heads; when the first response to a challenge is to send in our military, then we risk getting drawn into unnecessary conflicts, and neglect the broader strategy we need for a safer, more prosperous world. That's what our enemies want us to do.\n\nI believe in a smarter kind of American leadership. We lead best when we combine military power with strong diplomacy; when we leverage our power with coalition building; when we don't let our fears blind us to the opportunities that this new century presents.\n\nThat's exactly what we're doing right now, and around the globe, it is making a difference.\n\nFirst, we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.\nWe will continue ... to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies.\n\nAt the same time, we've learned some costly lessons over the last 13 years.\n\nInstead of Americans patrolling the valleys of Afghanistan, we've trained their security forces, who've now taken the lead, and we've honored our troops' sacrifice by supporting that country's first democratic transition.\n\nInstead of sending large ground forces overseas, we're partnering with nations from South Asia to North Africa to deny safe haven to terrorists who threaten America.\n\nIn Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping ISIL's advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group.\n\nWe're also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort and assisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.\n\nNow, this effort will take time. It will require focus. But we will succeed. And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission by passing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL.\n\nWe need that authority.\n\nSecond, we are demonstrating the power of American strength and diplomacy. We're upholding the principle that bigger nations can't bully the small by opposing Russian aggression and supporting Ukraine's democracy, and reassuring our NATO allies.\n\nLast year, as we were doing the hard work of imposing sanctions along with our allies, as we were reinforcing our presence with the frontline states, Mr. Putin's aggression, it was suggested, was a masterful display of strategy and strength. That's what I heard from some folks. Well, today, it is America that stands strong and united with our allies, while Russia is isolated, with its economy in tatters.\n\nThat's how America leads: not with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.\nIn Cuba, we are ending a policy that was long past its expiration date.\n\nWhen what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years, it's time to try something new.\n\nAnd our shift in Cuba policy has the potential to end a legacy of mistrust in our hemisphere and removes the phony excuse for restrictions in Cuba, stands up for democratic values and extends the hand of friendship to the Cuban people.\n\nAnd this year, Congress should begin the work of ending the embargo.\n\nAs -- as his Holiness, Pope Francis, has said, diplomacy is the work of small steps. These small steps have added up to new hope for the future in Cuba.\n\nAnd after years in prison, we are overjoyed that Alan Gross is back where he belongs...\n\nWelcome home, Alan. We're glad you're here.\n\nOur diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran, where, for the first time in a decade, we've halted the progress of its nuclear program and reduced its stockpile of nuclear material.\n\nBetween now and this spring, we have a chance to negotiate a comprehensive agreement that prevents a nuclear-armed Iran, secures America and our allies, including Israel, while avoiding yet another Middle East conflict.\n\nThere're no guarantees that negotiations will succeed, and I keep all options on the table to prevent a nuclear Iran. But new sanctions passed by this Congress at this moment in time will all but guarantee that diplomacy fails, alienating America from its allies, making it harder to maintain sanctions and ensuring that Iran starts up its nuclear program again. It doesn't make sense. That is why I will veto any new sanctions bill that threatens to undo this progress.\n\nThe American people expect us to only go to war as a last resort, and I intend to stay true to that wisdom.\n\nThird, we're looking beyond the issues that have consumed us in the past to shape the coming century.\n\nNo foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids.\n\nBut we are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism. And tonight, I urge this Congress to finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyber-attacks, combat identity theft, and protect our children's information. That should be a bipartisan effort.\n\nYou know, if we don't act, we'll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe.\n\nIn West Africa, our troops, our scientists, our doctors, our nurses and healthcare workers are rolling back Ebola, saving countless lives and stopping the spread of disease.\n\nI could not be prouder of them, and I thank this Congress for your bipartisan support of their efforts.\n\nBut the job is not yet done, and the world needs to use this lesson to build a more effective global effort to prevent the spread of future pandemics, invest in smart development and eradicate extreme poverty.\n\nIn the Asia Pacific, we are modernizing alliances while making sure that other nations play by the rules in how they trade, how they resolve maritime disputes, how they participate in meeting common international challenges like nonproliferation and disaster relief.\n\nAnd no challenge, no challenge, poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.\n\n2014 was the planet's warmest year on record.\n\nNow, one year doesn't make a trend, but this does: 14 of the 15 warmest years on record have all fallen in the first 15 years of this century.\n\nI've heard some folks try to dodge the evidence by saying they're not scientists, that we don't have enough information to act. Well, I'm not a scientist either. But you know what? I know a lot of really good scientists at NASA and at NOAA and at our major universities, and the best scientists in the world are all telling us that our activities are changing the climate, and if we don't act forcefully, we'll continue to see rising oceans, longer, hotter heat waves, dangerous droughts and floods, and massive disruptions that can trigger greater migration and conflict and hunger around the globe. The Pentagon says that climate change poses immediate risks to our national security. We should act like it.\n\nThat's why, over the past six years, we've done more than ever to combat climate change, from the way we produce energy, to the way we use it. That's why we've set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history. And that's why I will not let this Congress endanger the health of our children by turning back the clock on our efforts. I am determined to make sure American leadership drives international action.\n\nIn Beijing, we made a historic announcement: the United States will double the pace at which we cut carbon pollution, and China committed, for the first time, to limiting their emissions. And because the world's two largest economies came together, other nations are now stepping up, and offering hope that, this year, the world will finally reach an agreement to protect the one planet we've got.\n\nAnd There's one last pillar of our leadership, and that's the example of our values.\n\nAs Americans, we respect human dignity, even when we're threatened, which is why I've prohibited torture, and worked to make sure our use of new technology like drones is properly constrained.\n\nIt's why we speak out against the deplorable anti-Semitism that has resurfaced in certain parts of the world.\n\nIt's why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims, the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That's why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners and condemn the persecution of women or religious minorities or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.\n\nWe do these things not only because they are the right thing to do ... but because ultimately, they make us safer.\n\nAs Americans, we have a profound commitment to justice. So it makes no sense to spend $3 million per prisoner to keep open a prison that the world condemns and terrorists use to recruit.\n\nSince I've been president, we've worked responsibly to cut the population of Gitmo in half. Now it is time to finish the job, and I will not relent in my determination to shut it down. It is not who we are.\n\nIt's time to close Gitmo.\n\nAs Americans, we cherish our civil liberties, and we need to uphold that commitment if we want maximum cooperation from other countries and industry in our fight against terrorist networks.\n\nSo while some have moved on from the debates over our surveillance programs, I have not. As promised, our intelligence agencies have worked hard, with the recommendations of privacy advocates to increase transparency and build more safeguards against potential abuse.\n\nAnd next month, we'll issue a report on how we're keeping our promise to keep our country safe while strengthening privacy.\n\nLooking to the future instead of the past, making sure we match our power with diplomacy and use force wisely. Building coalitions to meet new challenges and opportunities. Leading always with the example of our values. That's what makes us exceptional. That's what keeps us strong. And that's why we have to keep striving to hold ourselves to the highest of standards: our own.\n\nYou know, just over a decade ago, I gave a speech in Boston where I said there wasn't a liberal America, or a conservative America; a black America or a white America, but a United States of America.\n\nI said this because I had seen it in my own life, in a nation that gave someone like me a chance; because I grew up in Hawaii, a melting pot of races and customs; because I made Illinois my home, a state of small towns, rich farmland, and one of the world's great cities; a microcosm of the country where Democrats and Republicans and Independents, good people of every ethnicity and every faith, share certain bedrock values.\n\nOver the past six years, the pundits have pointed out more than once that my presidency hasn't delivered on this vision. How ironic, they say, that our politics seems more divided than ever. It's held up as proof not just of my own flaws, of which there are many, but also as proof that the vision itself is misguided, naive, that there are too many people in this town who actually benefit from partisanship and gridlock for us to ever do anything about it.\n\nI know how tempting such cynicism may be. But I still think the cynics are wrong.\n\nI still believe that we are one people. I still believe that together ... we can do great things, even when the odds are long.\n\nI believe this because over and over in my six years in office, I have seen America at its best. I've seen the hopeful faces of young graduates from New York to California; and our newest officers at West Point, Annapolis, Colorado Springs, and New London. I've mourned with grieving families in Tucson and Newtown; in Boston, and West Texas, and West Virginia. I've watched Americans beat back adversity from the Gulf Coast to the Great Plains; from Midwest assembly lines to the Mid-Atlantic seaboard.\n\nI've seen something like gay marriage go from a wedge issue used to drive us apart to a story of freedom across our country, a civil right now legal ... in states that seven in ten Americans call home.\n\nSo I know the good, and optimistic, and big-hearted generosity of the American people who, every day, live the idea that we are our brother's keeper, and our sister's keeper. And I know they expect those of us who serve here to set a better example.\n\nSo the question for those of us here tonight is how we, all of us, can better reflect America's hopes.\n\nI've served in Congress with many of you. I know many of you well. There are a lot of good people here, on both sides of the aisle.\n\nAnd many of you have told me that this isn't what you signed up for -- arguing past each other on cable shows, the constant fundraising, always looking over your shoulder at how the base will react to every decision.\n\nImagine if we broke out of these tired old patterns. Imagine if we did something different.\n\nUnderstand, a better politics isn't one where Democrats abandon their agenda or Republicans simply embrace mine; a better politics is one where we appeal to each other's basic decency instead of our basest fears.\n\nA better politics is one where we debate without demonizing each other, where we talk issues and values and principles and facts, rather than \"gotcha\" moments or trivial gaffes or fake controversies that have nothing to do with people's daily lives.\n\nA politics...\n\nA better politics is one where we spend less time drowning in dark money for ads that pull us into the gutter, and spend more time lifting young people up with a sense of purpose and possibility, asking them to join in the great mission of building America.\n\nIf we're going to have arguments, let's have arguments. But let's make them debates worthy of this body and worthy of this country.\n\nWe still may not agree on a woman's right to choose, but surely, we can agree it's a good thing that teen pregnancies and abortions are nearing all-time lows, and that every woman should have access to the health care that she needs.\n\nYes, passions still fly on immigration, but surely we can all see something of ourselves in the striving young student, and agree that no one benefits when a hardworking mom is snatched from her child, and that it's possible to shape a law that upholds our tradition as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants. I've talked to Republicans and Democrats about that. That's something that we can share.\n\nWe may go at it in campaign season, but surely we can agree that the right to vote is sacred ...that it's being denied to too many; and that, on this 50th anniversary of the great march from Selma to Montgomery and the passage of the Voting Rights Act, we can come together, Democrats and Republicans, to make voting easier for every single American.\n\nWe may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can't walk home without being harassed. And surely we can understand the wife who won't rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift.\n\nAnd surely we can agree it's a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America's criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all of us.\n\nThat's a better politics. That's how we start rebuilding trust. That's how we move this country forward. That's what the American people want. That's what they deserve.\n\nI have no more campaigns to run. My only agenda...\n\nI know, because I won both of them.\n\nMy only agenda for the next two years is the same as the one I've had since the day I swore an oath on the steps of this Capitol: to do what I believe is best for America.\n\nIf you share the broad vision I outlined tonight, I ask you to join me in the work at hand. If you disagree with parts of it, I hope you'll at least work with me where you do agree.\n\nAnd I commit to every Republican here tonight that I will not only seek out your ideas, I will seek to work with you to make this country stronger.\n\nBecause -- because I want this chamber, I want this city, to reflect the truth that for all our blind spots and shortcomings, we are a people with the strength and generosity of spirit to bridge divides, to unite in common effort, to help our neighbors, whether down the street or on the other side of the world.\n\nI want our actions to tell every child, in every neighborhood: your life matters, and we are as committed to improving your life chances ... as committed as we are we are to working on behalf of our own kids.\n\nI want future generations to know that we are a people who see our differences as a great gift, that we are a people who value the dignity and worth of every citizen: man and woman, young and old, black and white, Latino and Asian, immigrant and Native American, gay and straight, Americans with mental illness or physical disability. Everybody matters.\n\nI want them to grow up in a country that shows the world what we still know to be true: that we are still more than a collection of red states and blue states; that we are the United States of America.\n\nI want them to grow up in a country where a young mom can sit down and write a letter to her president with a story that sums up these past six years:\n\n\"It is amazing what you can bounce back from when you have to. We are a strong, tight-knit family who has made it through some very, very hard times.\"\n\nMy fellow Americans, we too are a strong, tight-knit family. We, too, have made it through some hard times. Fifteen years into this new century, we have picked ourselves up, dusted ourselves off and begun again the work of remaking America. We have laid a new foundation. A brighter future is ours to write.\n\nLet's begin this new chapter together, and let's start the work right now.\n\nThank you. God bless you.\n\nGod bless this country we love. Thank you.13Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/735951", "artist_names": "Donna Summer (Ft.

you\nAnimals in their zoo\nThey haven't got the time\nLanding is not on their minds\nHow do we have the nerve?\nWe're animals in preserve!\n[Verse 2]\nThey watch us all\nThey're only making sure that we don't trip and fall\nAnd they looked so hard\nBut they can't tell us why we're here and just what for\n'Cause they don't know\nWho opened up the door!\n\n[Chorus 2]\nHow can we find out more\nWho owns the keyless door\nWhere does the cycle end\nWho are the unwatched men\nWhere do we go from here\nFaith is a fading fear\nLife is a waiting room\nI hope they don't call me soon\n\n[Outro]\nHow
