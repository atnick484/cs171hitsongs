on,\u2005found\u2005someone new\nOne more\u2005girl who brings out the better\u2005in you\nAnd I thought my heart was detached\nFrom all the\u205fsunlight\u205fof\u205four past\nBut she's\u205fso sweet, she's\u205fso pretty\nDoes she mean you forgot about me?\n\n[Chorus]\nOh, I hope you're happy\nBut not like how you were with me\nI'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go\nSo find someone great, but don't find no one better\nI hope you're happy, but don't be happier\n[Verse 2]\nAnd do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?\nAn eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean\nRemember when I believed\nYou meant it when you said it first to me?\nAnd now I'm pickin' her apart\nLike cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart\nBut she's beautiful, she looks kind\nShe probably gives you butterflies\n\n[Chorus]\nI hope you're happy\nBut not like how you were with me\nI'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go\nSo find someone great, but don't find no one better\nI hope you're happy\nI wish you all the best, really\nSay you love her, baby, just not like you loved me\nAnd think of me fondly when your hands are on her\nI hope you're happy, but don't be happier\n\n[Bridge]\nOoh, ooh-ooh\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh\n\n[Chorus]\nI hope you're happy\nJust not like how you were with me\nI'm selfish, I know, can't let you go\nSo find someone great, but don't find

haystack\nI wanna sit you where my face at\nLunch with a few Mai Tais\nPurple kisses on my tie\nLife can\u2019t really predict love\nNow you\u2019re getting this dick, love\nI\u2019m looking for you with a flashlight\nI want to feel what a real fat ass like\nNo injection, I learned my lesson\nI walk it like I talk it, baby, this pedestrian\nRunnin\u2019 through your mind like Jackie Joyner\nPussy pop like (boom!) go get me a burner\nGot shot like (boom!)\nThis can be detrimental\nT-shirt and panties, that's your credential\nYou\u2019re cotton candy, I need a fistful\nI\u2019m awful antsy, hope that convince you\n[Outro: Robin Thicke]\nHey, girl\nYou know you're lookin' so damn fly\nYou lookin' like you fell from the sky (Angel)\nYou know you make a grown man cry\nI wanna give it to you, tonight\nAnd make everything you fantasize\nCome true, ooh baby\nI'll make it so, so, so amazing\nI'll give it to you, tonight\nAnd make everything you fantasize\nCome true, ooh baby\nI'll make it so, so, so amazing\nI'll give it to you\nI'll give it to you11Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 20, "api_path": "/songs/112836", "artist_names": "Tyga (Ft.

blowin' my mind\nHave you ever noticed every hurricane\nGets its name from a girl like this?\nShe's a cat five kind, keeps you up at night\nHangin' on to the edge of a kiss\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nShe's a beautiful mess\nYeah, the kind you love to love\nBut what happens next?\nI got a feelin' when the sun comes up\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna wish I had a storm warning\nI'm gonna wish I had a sign\nI'm gonna wish I had a little heads up\nA little leeway, a little more time\nSome kind of radar system locked in on love\nI got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'\nI'm gonna wish I had a storm warning\nI'm gonna wish I had a storm warning\n\n[Verse 2]\nAin't it funny how it feels when you're burning your wheels\nSomewhere between going and gone?\nYou get so lost that you can't turn it off\nYou give in and you just turn it on\nShe's a heart full of rain, red lips like a flame\nShe's a girl from your favorite song\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nWhat a beautiful mess\nOne part angel, one part perfect, one part a wreck\nThe kind of flood you'll never forget\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm gonna wish I had a storm warning\nI'm gonna wish I had a sign\nI'm gonna wish I had a little heads up\nA little leeway, a little more time\nSome kind of radar system locked in on love\nI got a feelin' by the time the night finds the mornin'\nI'm gonna wish I had a storm warning\nI'm gonna wish I had a storm

baby\nAnd though I tried to leave, I can't stop missing you baby\nAnd I keep coming, I keep coming back\n[Hook]\nI keep going in circles, circles\n'Round and 'round\nAnd while you're doing me so wrong\nI just keep holding you down\nI feel so stupid, foolish\nLoving you all this way\nBut what I can I say\nBut I wanna go\nI wanna go but I keep coming back\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhy I'm so confused for you, I have no answer boy (one time!)\nWhen I feel so used by you just like a toy (two times!)\nIt's a shame that you don't care enough to even give me half the love I give to you\nI live for you baby\nI'm ashamed to say that I'm to blame for how you act\nCause I keep coming, I keep coming back\n\n[Hook]\nI keep going in circles, circles\n'Round and 'round\nAnd while you're doing me so

hurts me so bad\nDon't know what it is that keeps me coming back\n\nHol' up (wait a minute)\nI said hol' up (wait a minute)\nI said hol' up (wait a minute)\nI said freeze!\n\n[Hook]\nI keep going in

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nEvery now and then, I still get a flashback\nOf the time I spent thinking you could be that one\nShould I have just kept your love?\nYes, I understand, we did have some good times\nOn the other hand, got me crying all night\nIt was too much for my mind\n\n[Chorus]\nSo even though I left you, I can't forget you\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nGuess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nWhen we were together, you ain't treat me right\nDamn, I really love you, Iain't gonna lie\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet)\n[Verse 2]\nI still have the box full of things you gave me\nStart to throw it out, something always stops me, yeah\nI'm not as over you as I say\nDeep inside my heart, I made the right decision\nBut it's kinda hard\nWhen your mind is thinking of, did I make a big mistake?\n\n[Chorus]\nSo even though I left you, I can't forget you\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nGuess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nWhen we were together, you ain't treat me right\nDamn, I really love you, Iain't gonna lie\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet)\n\n[Bridge]\nSee, I don't understand\nLike, somebody is gonna get hurt\nOut of this situation and you just hope it's not you..\nAt times..\nPart of me wants you, part of me don't, part of me is\nMissing you, part of me is gone. Part of me is saying that\nThe love is still strong. Part of me is letting go\n\n[Chorus]\nSo even though I left you, I can't forget you\n'Cause when I think about you (it's bittersweet, it's bittersweet)\nGuess I'll always love you (it's bittersweet,

no)\nMama's, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins\nThis is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers\nLift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye\n\n[Verse 1]\nAs a child, there were them times\nI didn't get it, but you kept me in line\nI didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes\nOn Sunday mornings, and I missed you\nBut I'm glad we talked through\nAll them grown folk things separation brings\nYou never let me know it\nYou never let it show because you loved me, and obviously\nThere's so much more left to say\nIf you were with me today, face-to-face\n[Chorus]\nI never knew I could hurt like this\nAnd every day life rolls on\nI wish I could talk to you for a while\nMiss you, but I try not to cry\nAs time goes by\nAnd it's true that you've reached a better place\nStill, I'd give the world to see your face\nAnd be right here next to you\nBut it's like you're gone too soon\nNow the hardest thing to do is say bye bye\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBye bye, bye bye, bye bye\nBye bye, bye bye, bye bye\nBye bye, bye bye, bye bye\nBye bye, bye bye\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd you never got a chance to see how good I've done\nAnd you never got to see me back at number one\nI wish that you were here to celebrate together\nI wish that we could spend the holidays together\nI remember when you used to tuck me in at night\nWith the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight\nI thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever\nIt's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI never knew I could hurt like this\nAnd every day life rolls on\nI wish I could talk to you for a while\nMiss you, but I try not to cry\nAs time goes by (As time goes by)\nAnd it's true that you've reached a better place\nStill, I'd give the world to see your face\nAnd be right here next to you\nBut it's like you're gone too soon\nNow the hardest thing to do is say bye bye (Oh)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nBye bye, bye bye, bye bye (The hardest thing to say, bye)\nBye bye, bye bye, bye bye\nBye bye, bye bye, bye bye (Bye)\nBye bye (Bye bye)\n\n[Bridge]\nThis is for my peoples who just lost somebody\nYour best friend, your baby, your man or your lady\nPut your hand way up high\nWe will never say bye (No, no, no)\nMama's, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins\nThis is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers\nLift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye\nBye\n[Chorus]\nNever knew I could hurt like this (I never knew it)\nAnd every day life rolls on (Every day of life, I wish)\nI wish I could talk to you for a while (I wish)\nMiss you, but I try not to cry (I wish)\nAs time goes by (I'm wishin' as time goes by)\nAnd it's true that you've reached a better place\nStill, I'd give
