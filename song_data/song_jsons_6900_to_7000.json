Franklin]\nSomehow I made it through the heartache, yes, I did\nOh, I escaped Aha ha\nI found my way out of the darkness\nI kept my faith (I know you did), kept my faith\n[Chorus: George Michael and Aretha Franklin]\nWhen the river was deep, I didn't falter\nWhen the mountain was high, I still believed\nWhen the valley was low, it didn't stop me, no no\nI knew you were waiting, I knew you were waiting for me\nUh huh\n\n[Verse 2: Aretha Franklin]\nWith an endless desire, I kept on searching\nSure in time our eyes would meet\nAnd like a bridge that's on fire, the hurt is over\nOne touch and you set me free\n\n[Pre-Chorus: George Michael and Aretha Franklin]\nNo, I don't regret a single moment, no I don't\n(I know you don't) Looking back\nWhen I think of all those disappointments\nI just laugh (I know you do), I just laugh\n\n[Chorus: George Michael and Aretha Franklin]\nWhen the river was deep, I didn't falter\nWhen the mountain was high, I still believed\nWhen the valley was low, it

heart (Broken heart)\n[Verse 2]\nYou pay the grocer\nFix the toaster\nYou kiss the host goodbye\nThen you break a window\nBurn the souffle\nScream a lullaby\n\n[Chorus]\nI know nothing stays the same (Stays the same)\nBut if you're willing to play the game (Play the game)\nIt's coming around again\nSo don't mind if I fall apart\nThere's more room in a broken heart\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd I believe in love\nBut what else can I do\nI'm so in love with you\n\n[Chorus]\nI know nothing stays the same (Stays the same)\nBut if you're willing to play the game (Play the game)\nIt will be coming around

at the walls\nIf I can't have your love I have nothing at all\nI believe a lot can be forgiven\nA broken heart can mend\nYou will see a whole new situation\nI won't be so misled\n\nI'm coming one step closer to you\nNow it's plain to see\nWhat you mean to me\nOne step closer to you\nYou're in my mind\nYou're in my heart, yeah\nYou might also likeI wanna be loved\nHold and hold on\n\nI believe a lot can be forgiven\nAnd a heart can mend\nYou will see a whole new situation\nI won't be so misled\n\nI'm coming one step closer to you\nNow I'm on my way\nComing back to stay\nOne step closer to you\nYou're in my mind\nYou're in my heart\n\n(One step closer to you) I've been thinking, pretty baby\n(One step closer to you) You know it's all right, all right\n(One step closer to you) (One step closer to you)Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1552228", "artist_names": "Mr. Mister", "full_title": "Is It Love by\u00a0Mr.\u00a0Mister",

who's keeping you\n\n[Chorus]\nI was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light\nThough I kept on trying, I could not make it right\nFor you, girl\nThere's just not enough love in the world\n[Verse 2]\nI know people hurt you so bad\nThey don't know the damage they can do, and it makes me so sad\nHow we knock each other down just like children on a playground\nEven after that old sun went down\n\n[Chorus]\nI was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light\nThough I kept on trying, I could not make it right\nFor you, girl\nThere's just not enough love in the world\n\n[Bridge]\nOh darlin', this is still a shady little town\nAnd sometimes it's so hard to smile\nFor the world, for the camera, and still have something left\nYou don't have to prove nothin' to nobody, just take good care of yourself\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm not easy to live with, I know that it's true\nYou're no picnic either, babe, that's one of the things I loved about you\nBut the time will come around when we need to settle down\nGot to get off this merry-go-round\n\n[Chorus]\nI was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light\nThough I kept on trying, I could not make it

I should turn you away\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never heard of love\n[Verse 2]\nI get a feeling when I look at you\nWherever you go now, I wanna be there too\nThey say we're crazy but I just don't care\nAnd if they keep on talking still they get nowhere\n\n[Chorus 2]\nSo I don't mind if they don't understand\nWhen I look at you, when you hold my hand\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never heard of love\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy should it matter to us if they don't approve\nWe should just take our chances\nWhile we've got nothing to lose\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n\n\n[Verse 3: Tracey Ullman, Kirsty MacColl]\nBaby!\nThere's no need for living in the past\nNow I've found good loving, gonna make it last\nI tell the others \"don't bother me\"\nCause when they look at you\nThey don't see what I see\nYou might also like[Chorus 3]\nNo, I don't listen to their wasted lines\nGot my eyes wide open and I see the signs\nCause they don't know 'bout us\nAnd they've never

mirrors (huh, huh)\nTrying to imitate their heroes\nYou make it with a false surrender (huh, huh)\nMore memories you won't remember\nThe senior with the Junior Miss (huh, huh)\nI wonder what the

Lyrics[Intro]\nPlease, please tell me now\nPlease, please tell me now\nPlease, please tell me now\nPlease, please tell me now\n\n[Verse 1]\nI made a break, I run out yesterday\nTried to find my mountain hideaway\nMaybe next year, maybe no go\nI know you're watching me\nEvery minute of the day, yeah\nI've seen the signs\nAnd the looks and the pictures\nThat give your game away, yeah\n\nThere's a dream that strings the road\nWith broken glass for us to hold\nAnd I cut so far before I had to say\n\n[Chorus 1]\nPlease, please tell me now\nIs there something I should know?\nIs there something I should say\nThat would make you come my way?\nDo you feel the same?\n'Cause you don't let it show\n\n[Verse 2]\nPeople stare and cross the road from me\nAnd jungle drums\nThey all clear the way for me\nCan you read my mind?\nCan you see in the snow?\n\nAnd fiery demons all dance\nWhen you walk through that door\nDon't say you're easy on me\nYou're about as easy as a nuclear war\nSee Duran Duran LiveGet tickets as low as $98You might also likeThere's a dream that strings the road\nWith broken glass for us to hold\nAnd I cut so far before I had to say\n\n[Chorus

the big bands used to come and play\nMy sister went there on a Saturday\n\nCome dancing\nAll her boyfriends used to come and call\nWhy not come dancing?\nIt's only natural\nAnother Saturday, another date\nShe would be ready but she's always make them wait\nIn the hallway in anticipation\nHe didn't know the night would end up in frustration\nHe'd end up blowing all his wages for the week\nAll for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek\n\nCome dancing\nThat's how they did it when I was just a kid\nAnd when they said come dancing\nMy sister always did\n\nMy sister should have come in at midnight\nAnd my mum would always sit up and wait\nIt always ended up in a big row\nWhen my sister used to get home late\n\nOut of my window I can see them in the moonlight\nTwo silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate\n\nThe day they knocked down the Palais\nMy sister stood and cried\nThe day they knocked down the Palais\nPart of my childhood died, just died\n\nNow I'm grown up and playing in a band\nAnd there's a car park where the Palais used to stand\nMy sister's married and she lives on an estate\nHer daughters go out now it's her turn to wait\nShe knows they get away with things she never could\nBut if I asked her I wonder if she would\nYou might also likeCome dancing\nCome on sister have yourself a ball\nDon't be afraid to come dancing\nIt's only natural\n\nCome dancing\nJust

Southern islands\nSailing a reach before a following sea\nShe was making for the trades on the outside\nAnd the downhill run to Papeete\nOff the wind on this heading lie, the Marquesas\nWe got eighty feet of the waterline\nNicely making way\nIn a noisy bar in Avalon, I tried to call you\nBut on a midnight watch I realized\nWhy twice you ran away\n[Pre-Chorus]\n(I think about)\nThink about how many times I have fallen\nSpirits are using me, larger voices calling\nWhat heaven brought you and me\nCannot be forgotten (I've been around the world)\n\n[Chorus]\nI have been around the world (Looking)\nLooking for that woman-girl\n(And I know she knows)\nWho knows love can endure\nAnd you know it will\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen you see the Southern Cross for the first time\nYou understand now why you came this way\n'Cause the truth you might be running from is so small\nBut it's as big as the promise\nThe promise of a coming day\nSo I'm sailing for tomorrow, my dreams are a-dying\nAnd my love is an anchor tied to you\nTied with a silver chain\nI have my ship\nAnd all her flags are a-flying\nShe is all that I have left\nAnd music is her name\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\n(I think about)\nThink about how many times I have fallen\nSpirits are using me, larger voices calling\nWhat heaven brought you and me\nCannot be forgotten (I've been around the world)\n\n[Chorus]\nI have been around the world (Looking)\nLooking for that woman-girl\nWho knows love can endure\nAnd you know it will\nAnd you know it will\n(Yes)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo we cheated and we lied and we tested\nAnd we never failed to fail\nIt was the easiest thing to do\nYou will survive being bested\nSomebody fine\nWill come along, make me forget about loving you\nIn the Southern Cross3Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

This little empty garden by the brownstone door\nAnd in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more\nWho lived here? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot\nWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop\nAnd we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed\nA gardener like that one, no one can replace\n[Chorus]\nAnd I've been knockin', but no one answers\nAnd I've been knockin' most of the day\nOh, and I've been callin', \"oh, hey, hey, Johnny\nCan't you come out to play?\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd through their tears\nSome say he farmed his best in younger years\nBut he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear\nWho lived there? He must have been a gardener that cared a lot\nWho weeded out the tears and grew a good crop\nNow we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls\nWe hear, we hear your name\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I've been knockin', but no one answers\nAnd I've been knockin' most of the day\nOh, and I've been callin', \"Oh, hey, hey, Johnny\nCan't you come out to play?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I've been knockin', but no one answers\nAnd I've been knockin' most of the day\nOh, and I've been callin', \"Oh, hey, hey, Johnny\nCan't you come out?\nCan you come out to play?\"\nSee Elton John LiveGet tickets as low as $103You might also like[Outro]\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?\nJohnny, can't you come out to play in your empty garden?2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1496739", "artist_names": "Kool & the Gang", "full_title": "Get Down On It by\u00a0Kool\u00a0& the Gang", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/0cd3e568785ef0bdf12a1c9c5453a327.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0cd3e568785ef0bdf12a1c9c5453a327.500x500x1.jpg", "id": 1496739, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 8455379, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1642965193, "path": "/Kool-and-the-gang-get-down-on-it-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 4, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Kool-and-the-gang-get-down-on-it-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1981, "month": 9, "day": 28}, "release_date_for_display": "September 28, 1981", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Sep. 28, 1981", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/0cd3e568785ef0bdf12a1c9c5453a327.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0cd3e568785ef0bdf12a1c9c5453a327.500x500x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 65243}, "title": "Get Down On It", "title_with_featured": "Get Down On It", "updated_by_human_at": 1661497986, "url": "https://genius.com/Kool-and-the-gang-get-down-on-it-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/19153", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/dd02699ebe9cc7cbd7ea54515072f2db.400x274x1.jpg", "id": 19153, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/dd02699ebe9cc7cbd7ea54515072f2db.400x274x1.jpg", "index_character": "k", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Kool & the Gang", "slug": "Kool-and-the-gang", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Kool-and-the-gang"}, "artist": "Kool & the Gang", "lyrics": "Get Down On It Lyrics[Intro]\nWhat you gonna do?\nYou wanna get down?

behind\nYou can hedge your bet on a clean Corvette\nTo get you there right on time\nNow if you're ready to dive into overdrive\nBaby, the green lights are on\nIt's like you're running your brain on some high octane\nEvery time she reaches fully blown\n\n[Chorus]\nWon't you take that ride on heavy metal?\nIt's the only way that you can travel down that road\nSatisfied on heavy metal\nBaby won't you ride, ride it until it explodes\nHeavy metal\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy oh my, how this lady can fly\nOnce she starts rollin' beneath you\nYou know you just can't lose, the way she moves\nYou wait for her to finally release you\nIt's not a big surprise to feel your temperature rise\nYou've got a touch of redline fever\n'Cause there is just one cure that they know for sure\nYou just become a heavy metal believer\n\n[Chorus]\nWon't you take that ride on heavy metal?\nIt's the only way that you can travel down that road\nSatisfied on heavy metal\nBaby won't you ride, ride it until it explodes\n\nHeavy
