uh!\n\n[Verse 1]\nI was working part time in a five-and-dime\nMy boss was Mr. McGee\nHe told me several times that he didn't like my kind\n'Cause I was a bit too leisurely\nSeems that I was busy doing something close to nothing\nBut different than the day before\nThat's when I saw her, ooh, I saw her\nShe walked in through the out door, out door\n[Chorus]\nShe wore a raspberry beret\nThe kind you find in a second hand store\nRaspberry beret\nAnd if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more\nRaspberry beret, I think I love her\n\n[Verse 2]\nBuilt like she was, she had the nerve to ask me\nIf I planned to do her any harm\nSo, look here, I put her on the back of my bike and, uh, we went riding\nDown by old man Johnson's farm\nI said, now, overcast days never turned me on\nBut something about the clouds and her mixed\nShe wasn't too bright but I could tell when she kissed me\nShe knew how to get her kicks\n\n[Chorus]\nShe wore a raspberry beret\nThe kind you find in a second hand store\nRaspberry beret\nAnd if it was warm, she wouldn't wear much more\nRaspberry beret, I think I love her\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe rain sounds so cool when it hits the barn roof\nAnd the horses wonder who you are\nThunder drowns out what the lightning sees\nYou feel like a movie star\nListen, they say the first time ain't the greatest\nBut I tell you, if I had the chance to do it all again\nI wouldn't change a stroke 'cause baby, I'm the most\nWith a girl as fine as she was then\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nRaspberry beret\nThe kind you find in a second hand store\nRaspberry beret\nAnd if it was

night but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you, shit\nYou don't like that I make this easy, leaving after sexing on the floor\nBaby, I know you need me like I need you, but I'm not the one you wanna love\n\n[Hook]\nSo just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me\nLoving ain't the same with a nigga like\nYou used to them but ain't no loving me\nI hear what you would say and girl, it's clear

loving me\nSo don't come looking for love\nOh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love\nDon't come looking for love\nOh, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love, no love\n[Verse 2]\nShawty if you looking for somebody trying to settle down\nProbably won't be around, nah baby\nYou should hit me when you tired\nOf playing up in the house and ain't nobody around, you need that\nWhen you need that late night\nWe can both make love to the daylight, you got it girl, you got it girl\nBut you know I can't stay right? Uh, nah babe\nAll I want is you so what you tryna do?\n\n[Hook]\nSo just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me\nLoving ain't the same with a nigga like\nYou used to them but ain't no loving me\nI

gotta go\nDon't take it personal, when it feel so good, we tend to get emotional\nBut that is when you find out that it hurts the most, since then I've always been like, trust nobody show no love\nYou

crazy\n\n[Chorus]\nBut there was something 'bout the way\nThe blue lights were shining\nBringing out the freedom in your eyes\nI was too busy watching you going wild child\nTo be worried about going to jail\nYou were thinking that running for it would make a good story\nI was thinking you were crazy as hell\nAnd you were so innocent, but you were stealing my heart\nI fell in love in the back of a cop car\n\n[Verse 2]\nMan, they weren't playing\nThey sure threw those cuffs on quick\nYou tried to sweet talk 'em\nThey didn't fall for it\nBut I did\nYou were on the left\nI was on the right\nI knew

line\nStepped out in the sun, when my feet hit the sand\nWhat a long strange trip\n\n[Chorus]\nI spent my whole life running around\nStill let the wind kind of blow me around\nWell I dropped a note in a bottle\nTo a long-legged model\nAnd I traded it in for a whole another world\nA pirate flag and an island girl\n[Verse 2]\nWell my friends back home think I've gone and lost my mind\nTake a sip of rum and you really would know why\nJolly Roger flying on the picnic table\nBlender in the kitchen, willing and able\nDon't know what makes you say what the hell\nBut when the salt air catches a hold of that sail\nSomething about it makes her just want to dance\nAnd she loves to dance\n\n[Chorus]\nI spent my whole life running around\nStill let the wind kind of blow me around\nWell I dropped a note in a bottle\nTo a long-legged model\nAnd I traded it in for a whole another world\nA pirate flag and an island girl\n\n[Bridge]\nWell I remember back home beneath the big old moon\nTucked back in

smile\nYou've never loved your stomach or your thighs\nThe dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine\nBut I'll love them endlessly\n\n[Chorus: Zayn & Liam]\nI won't let these little things slip

without a cup of tea\nAnd maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep\nAnd all those conversations are the secrets that I keep\nThough it makes no sense to me\nI know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape\nYou never want to know how much you weight\nYou still have to squeeze into your jeans\nBut you're perfect to me\n\n[Chorus: Harry & Niall]\nI won't let these little things

you\nAnd you'll never treat yourself right, darling, but I want you to\nIf I let you know, I'm here for you\nMaybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh\n\n[Breakdown: Harry, All]\nAnd I've just

singular, how 'bout let's make it plural\nSpin the globe, wherever it lands that's where we'll go\nWe'll hit up Europe, yep, and spend some Euros\nAnd maybe visit Berlin, the walls with the murals\nThis is your month baby, sign of the Virgo\nPrivate reservations, glasses full of Merlot\nA Ros\u00e9, a Burgundy, traveling like turbo\nBrush up on your Espa\u00f1ol, we're Barcelona-bound,

quick\nBut if I call, you gon' be like, \"Boo, why we haven't skyped yet?\"\nAnd on Skype, bet you say, \"'Le, where my flight at?\"\nIf I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at\nShit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic\nBut a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort\nJust look closer, my life is quite deceptive\nWomen'll sell they soul, just to buy some attention\nI need something to hold, fuck that passive aggression\nAnd when I'm back from off that road, don't ask me no questions\nPlease, fear what you don't know, haha\n\n[Chorus: Jeremih]\nI

T.I.A, I'm sure to make her rain\nThen I'm back up on my plane, Chi-town O'Hare\nWe spend some time and get some wine, have some milds from Harold's\nI told her this here's overrated, but I love your city baby\nGotta get back to the D, you know we finally famous\nDriver drop me off at Dulles, I'm headed to some money\nTSA be laughing, all them rubbers in your luggage\nI know I'ma always leave 'em,

see your brown skin shimmer in the sun for the first time\nI try to be the one who knows just what to do to you to get me that smile\nOne chance of meeting, you were walking by me on the street and I

far away -ay -ay -ay\n\n[Verse 2]\nTear stains on my pillow\nTryin' to forget ya\nDon't know what I'm gonna do\nFour day and countin', I've been layin' here\nStarin' myself in the mirror all alone in my room\nI can't feel this way again\nGotta think with my head\nCause my heart is what go me here\nSo hurt from what you done\nMore than enough reasons for me to move on\nCause I gave you my word, you

of things hopin' I never have to fit in\nSo tryna keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end\nMy girl love me, but fuck it, my heart beats slow\nAnd right now the tour bus is lookin' like a freak

something in your eyes\nCalls to mind a silver screen and all it's sad goodbyes\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm never gonna dance again\nThese guilty feet have got no rhythm\nThough it's easy to pretend\nI know you're not a fool\nI should have known better than to cheat a friend\nAnd waste a chance that I've been given\nSo I'm never gonna dance again\nThe way I danced with you\n[Verse 2]\nTime can never mend\nThe careless whispers of a good friend\nTo the heart and mind, ignorance is kind\nThere's no comfort in the truth, pain is all you'll find\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm never gonna dance again\nThese guilty feet have got no rhythm\nThough it's easy to pretend\nI know you're not a fool\nI should have known better than to cheat a friend\nAnd waste a chance that I've been given\nSo I'm never gonna dance again\nThe way I danced with you\n\n[Bridge]\nTonight the music seems so loud\nI wish that we could lose this crowd\nMaybe it's better this way\nWe hurt each other with the things we wanna say\nWe could have been so good together\nWe could have lived this dance forever\nNow who's gonna dance with me\nPlease stay\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm never gonna dance again\nThese guilty feet have

Would we laugh and talk for hours?\nThe way we did when our love first began\n\n[Verse 4: Randy Travis, Carrie Underwood, Both]\nWould you tell me that you've missed me too and that you've been so lonely?\nAnd you've waited for the day that I returned\nAnd we'd live and love forever, and that I'm your one and only\nOr would you say the tables finally turned?\n\n[Chorus: Carrie Underwood, Randy Travis, Both]\nWould you say I told you so?
