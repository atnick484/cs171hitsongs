she might not be coming back\nPeople said man don't you think it's time to take that old message off\nHe said no, you never know when she might call\n\nShe was just outside a bar in New York City\nHer

It's playing our song\nAre you sleepy? Take a nap\nYou're not afraid of the dark, are you?\n\n[Verse 1]\nYou hear the beat as it makes ya not want to go to sleep\nI knock on Dakota's door; it's locked, so I go to creep\n'Round the back with binoculars, not 'cause I wanna peep\nBut because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos, I wanna eat\nVisions of hot chocolaty marshmallows, all so sweet\nWith sugar plums; oh, look\nHere comes Marshall, he's on your street\nHe's placing hot, smoldering charcoals beneath your feet\nNow walk on 'em; he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek\nLike a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham\nCinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam\nFlavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBen\u00e9t Rams'\nI guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am\n[Chorus]\n(My music box)\n'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep\n(My music box)\nBut I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me\n(My music box)\nAlthough we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me\n(My music box, my music box)\nSo once you call, I come, I will answer\n(My music box)\n'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep\n(My music box)\nI hear my music box playing a song for me\n(My music box)\nSo won't you twirl around and do a whirl for me?\n(My music box, my music box)\nAnd would you be my private little dancer?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI almost look comatose; who wants to be sober? Gross\nI foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose\nPut coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose\nMy pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know\nI put on my mother's makeup, get naked and run around\nWavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds\nThere's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?\nThe devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out\nI must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?\nVoices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house\nThey pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box\nComes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do?

strings\nSome peddle steel whining like a whistle of an old freight train\nTo get that foot stomping honky tonking feeling going through my veins\nI need a little twang, twang, twang\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I like a lot of kinds of music, I try to keep an open mind\nDepending on the mood to strike me if I'm gonna stay till closing time\nSo when I wanna lift my spirits to get me feeling worth a dang\nI know I'm gonna have to hear it 'cause I gotta have some Hank to hang\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause I need a little twang, a little hillbilly bending on some guitar strings\nSome peddle steel whining like a

slide through my hands\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd wild horses couldn't drag me away\nWild horses couldn't drag me away\n\n[Verse 2]\nI watched you suffer a dull aching pain\nNow you've decided to show me the same\nNo sweeping exits or offstage lines\nCould make me feel bitter or treat you unkind\n[Chorus]\nWild horses couldn't drag me away\nWild horses couldn't drag me away\n\n[Verse 3]\nI know I've dreamt you a sin and a lie\nAnd I have my freedom, but I don't have much time\nFate has been suffered and tears must be cried\nSo let's do some living after we die\n\n[Chorus]\nWild horses couldn't

in me)\nBelieve me like a fairy tale\nYour tooth under your pillowcase\nNo, I won't, I won't, ever, ever let you down (No)\nLike a seesaw let you down (Oh)\nYou know why?\n'Cause we ain't on the playground no more, baby\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe're big enough to stand in the picture\nWe're big enough to stand next to love\n\n[Chorus]\nI was a player when I was little\nBut I'm bigger, I'm bigger\nA heartbreaker when I was little\nBut I'm bigger (I'm bigger) I'm bigger (Hey, hey)\nAnd all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here\n'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger\nI'm bigger and you're bigger, woah\n\n[Verse 2]\nRemember when my heart was young?\nIt was still bigger than me (Still bigger than me)\nIs that the reason that you stayed?\nMost would've got rid of me (Hey)\nNow the bullies in the schoolyard can't take our hugs and our kisses from us (No)\nBecause we ain't pushovers, no more, baby\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nWe're big enough to stand in the picture\nWe're big enough to stand next to love\n\n[Chorus]\nI was a player when I was little\nBut I'm bigger, I'm bigger\nA heartbreaker when I was little\nBut I'm bigger, I'm bigger\nAnd all the haters, I swear, they look so small from up here\n'Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger\nI'm bigger and you're bigger, hey\nI was a player when I was little\nBut I'm bigger (Hey) I'm bigger\nA heartbreaker when I was little\nBut

myself in the mirror \"nigga, you ain't dead\"\nI'm far from eccentric, I'm so psychotic\nI don't need you to shoot for me, nigga I got it\nWhen you see me in the hood motherfucker don't talk to me\n'Less you wan' talk about using the hawk for me\nWhen Al blew Black away I had him on some stupid shit\nThen my rap shit worked, now I'm super stupid rich\nAll I do is stunt now, I'm so Maybach\nThere I go fronting again, I meant to say laid back\nGo 'head move reckless, get banged for your necklace\nI serve him with the semi, feed him a clip for breakfast\n[Hook]\nYou want some? Come get some\nNigga it's murder one when I toss my gun\nYou might see me let it off, you might see me run\nBut you won't see shit time the police come\nHuh? You want some? Come get some\nNigga it's murder one when you see my gun\nI just squeeze and squeeze 'til the whole clip done\nYou just bleed and bleed 'til the police come\nHuh? You want some?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got a eighth of dope left, half a pound of purple\nShooters in my circle, try me I'll let 'em murk you\nGot more guns than a gun store, beef ain't what you want, boy\nYou wanna be nice to me, you wanna shoot dice with me\nYou want a ace on purpose, why you so nervous?\nNigga we from the same hood, we come from the same shit\nYou got gonorrhea too? We fucked with the same bitch\nGetting money is necessary; see me I'm a visionary\nAnd I'm saying that house should be a crack house\nNow see it how I see it or I'll bring the straps out\nThe tech and the mac out, the Sig and the Taurus\nThe Koch and that Heckler, then nigga we warrin'\nI let my pistols speak for me and all of 'em foreign\nClick-clack, comprende? I'm criminal-minded\nToss my Nina in the sewer, bet nobody find it\n'Til it's rusty and fucked up, forensics have fun, what?\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Outro: 50 Cent]\nCome get it, I'm strapped now, I'm with it\nCome get it - huh?

sadistic, materialistic\nLooking for a man makes them opportunistic\nThey're lyin' on the beach perpetratin' a tan\nSo that a brother with money can be their man\nSo on the beach you're strollin', real high-rollin'\nEverything you have is yours and not stolen\nA girl runs up with somethin' to prove\nSo don't just stand there, bust a move!\n\n[NEW DIRECTION GIRLS]\nYou want it, you got it\nYou

fellas\n\nYour best friend Harry has a brother Larry\nIn five days from now he's gonna marry\nHe's hopin' you can make it there if you can\n'Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man\nYou say \"neat-o\", check your libido\nAnd roll to the church in your new tuxedo\nThe bride walks down just to start the wedding\nAnd there's one more girl you won't be getting\nSo you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'\nA bridemaid looks and thinks that you're winkin'\nShe thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back\nAnd then you're feelin' really fine 'cause the girl is stacked\nReception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'\nLook at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'\nSays she wants to dance to a different groove\nNow you know what to do, G, bust a move!\n\n[NEW DIRECTION GIRLS]\nYou want

it comes to you\nAnd though I see us through, yeah\n\n[Chorus 2]\nChances are we'll find two destinations\nChances roll away from me\nStill, chances are more than expectations\nBut possibilities over me\n\n[Bridge]\nIt's a fight with two to one\nLay your money on the sun\nUntil you crash what have you done?\nIs there a better bet than love?\nWhat you are is what you bring\nYou gotta cry before you sing\nChances, chances\nChances lost are hope's torn out pages\nMaybe this time!\nYou might also like[Chorus 3]\nChances are we'll be the combination\nChances come and carry me\nChances are waiting to be taken\nAnd I can see...\nChances are the fascinations\nChances won't escape from me\nChances are only what we make them\nAnd all I need2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path":

question\nWe would cross paths like an intersection\nBut she just too far away for affection\nSo I pray that we never lose a connection\nCause I remember Stacy, she prolly hate me\nShe used to threaten she had a man to replace me\nShe talk that shit, I just hit the escape key\nAnd then she get mad and wanna go and erase me\nAnd I remember Amy, she used to AIM me\nShe stayed up late and used to blame me\nShe said I'm too wild, she wanna tame me\nI told her even Photoshop couldn't change me\nBut you-you-you, you got me open girl, why lie\nWe ain't even tryna settle, so why try\nEnd the night with a kiss and a bye bye\nNo strings attatched, your love is so Wi-Fi\n[Refrain: Jamie Foxx]\nI love it, girl\nThe way you bring your light into this room\nUh, I love it, girl\nThe way your

Louis computer bag\nWherever you are, I could be\nI type you a message full of X's and O's\nYou shoot me a video and then upload\nEven though I hate this distance, it keeps me persistent\nOne day I'll

up the tattoo by the waist\nLet the MC Serch 'til I reach third base\nAnd when I get home I'ma hit home plate\nWait, could this be considered our first date\nYe, the picture just looks so trash\nYour body make a baller spend cooked coke cash\nPlus every good girl wanna go bad\nIn Playboy mags like Stacy Dash\nOr Kim Kardashian, be a lady at it\nYou know what's a crazy thing\nSome girls'll make you wait longer than A.C.

terrified of what you do\nMy stomach screams just when I look at you\nRun far away, so I can breathe\nEven though you're far from suffocating me\nI can't set my hopes too high\n'Cause every 'Hello' ends with a 'Goodbye'\n\n[Chorus]\nBut you're so hypnotizing\nYou've got me laughing while I sing\nYou've got me smiling in my sleep\nAnd I can see this unraveling\nYour love is where I'm falling\nBut

that take me and erase me and I'm painted black\nYou have suffered enough and warred with yourself\nIt's time that you won\nTake this sinking boat and point it home\nWe've still got time\nRaise your
