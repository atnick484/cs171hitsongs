thing\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou can promise castles, treasures, babies, I don't care\n'Cause for now, you're just enough for me, I want you near\nLike a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck\nYou remember what I love, so baby, take me back\n[Chorus]\nTurn the lights down low and kiss me in the dark\n'Cause when you're touching me, baby, I see sparks\nYou make my heart go\nYou, you, you make my heart go\nYou, you, you make my heart go\n\n[Verse 2]\nTicking-tocking, like a bomb\nThrows me back to when I had you closer\nSkin to skin, we get it on\nWithout the love, I feel you going bolder\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nYou can promise castles, treasures, babies, I don't care\n'Cause for now, you're just enough for me, I want you near\nLike a fairytale to feel your breath right on my neck\nYou remember what I love, so baby, take me back\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn the lights down low and kiss me in the dark\n'Cause when you're touching me, baby, I see sparks\nYou make my heart go\nYou, you, you make my heart go\nYou, you, you make my heart go\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nTake it all off, want every inch of you\nTraveling back in time\nTangled up tight, just like we used to\nNow do that thing I like\n\n[Chorus]\nTurn the lights down low and kiss me in the dark\n'Cause when you're touching me, baby, I see sparks\nYou make my heart go\nYou, you, you make my heart go\nYou, you, you make my

phenomenal\nHowever long that it takes\nI'll go to whatever lengths\nIt's gonna make me a monster though\nI am phenomenal\nBut I'll never say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s impossible\u2019\nCause I'm born to be phenomenal\n[Verse 1]\nUnstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles\nUntoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll\nStomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em\nWhen the going got rough\nSome of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy\nWho the fuck taught you how to persevere?\nThere ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse\nThe messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse\nYeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well\nHang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve\nCause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall\nBut you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself\nTime to slip in that zone 'til I find myself\nInside the realm of the unknown and boldly go\nInto waters where nobody else has gone before\nOr willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so\nBomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant\nSometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...\n\n[Hook]\nI am phenomenal\nWith every ounce of my blood\nWith every breath in my lungs\nWon't stop until I'm phe-no-menal\nI am phenomenal\nHowever long that it takes\nI'll go to whatever lengths\nIt's gonna make me a monster though\nI am phenomenal\nBut I'll never say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s impossible\u2019\nCause I'm born to be phenomenal\nYou might also like[Verse 2]\nLet me self-empower you\nWhen you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you\nAnd you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel\nI'll show you how to use doubt as fuel\nConvert it to gunpowder too\nNow what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid\nPut the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing\nAh screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it\nPunch through it, just cock back, put your all into it\nNow you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage\nNever take back what you say\nIf you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match\nReady to scrap asap\nTake your fists and just ball it\nShow who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace\nNow picture 'em all as plastic and foam\nLays flat, where you put your dinner plates at\nAnd set it on 'em like a placemat\n(I am phenomenal)\nAnd I want you to say that\n\n[Hook]\nI am phenomenal\nWith every ounce of my blood\nWith every breath in my lungs\nWon't stop until I'm phe-no-menal\nI am phenomenal\nHowever long that it takes\nI'll go to whatever lengths\nIt's gonna make me a monster though\nI am phenomenal\nBut I'll never say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s impossible\u2019\nCause I'm born to be phenomenal\n[Bridge]\nOh, step into the unknown and find yourself\nYou\u2019re floating freely, no emotion\n\n[Verse 3]\nGot a fuckin\u2019 mouth with no shut-off valve\nCan't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed\nMe to come up out from under the fuckin' ground\nCause I worked my butt off now\nIt's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about\nCause I stuck it out\nLike a motherfuckin' tongue thats how\nI responded when I got shoved around\nYou're gonna have non-believers\nBut when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how\nGet it how you live\nBut are you prepared to give more than you get?\nAnd put in twice what you get back from this shit\nThough what you sacrifice barely is half, never give\nRap is my shiv\nBut it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will\nSometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill\nHow I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt\nI rhyme like life is still an uphill climb\nReady to face any challenge, waitin'\nCan taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation\nLook what I have built, reputation is validation\nThe only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing\nOnly thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement\nOr accusation... I am legendary status, in fact\nThat is the only way you'll ever be able to say\nYou're a legend is makin' an allegation\nI write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with\nAs I fight to the death, 'til my last breath\nManage to prove who the best man is\nPrevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'\nIn the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage\nOf knowin' what it's like to be southpaw\nCause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed\nCause I am\n\n[Hook]\nI am phenomenal\nWith every ounce of my blood\nWith every breath in my lungs\nWon't stop until I'm phe-no-menal\nI am phenomenal\nHowever long that it takes\nI'll go to whatever lengths\nIt's gonna make me a monster though\nI am phenomenal\nBut I'll never say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s impossible\u2019\nCause I'm born to be phenomenal462Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 9, "api_path": "/songs/2168874", "artist_names": "How I Became The Bomb", "full_title": "Ulay, Oh by\u00a0How\u00a0I Became The Bomb", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/536d7e41fecc147f18a83a4daf89c2db.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/536d7e41fecc147f18a83a4daf89c2db.640x640x1.jpg", "id": 2168874, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 1691210, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1515641092, "path": "/How-i-became-the-bomb-ulay-oh-lyrics", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/How-i-became-the-bomb-ulay-oh-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2014, "month": 11, "day": 4}, "release_date_for_display": "November 4, 2014", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Nov. 4, 2014", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/536d7e41fecc147f18a83a4daf89c2db.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/536d7e41fecc147f18a83a4daf89c2db.640x640x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 8, "hot": false, "pageviews": 19217}, "title": "Ulay, Oh", "title_with_featured": "Ulay, Oh", "updated_by_human_at": 1661311512, "url": "https://genius.com/How-i-became-the-bomb-ulay-oh-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/381379", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fb42d29524edd9b0e08da77858d17615.1000x562x1.jpg", "id": 381379, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/fb42d29524edd9b0e08da77858d17615.1000x562x1.jpg", "index_character": "h", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "How I Became The Bomb", "slug": "How-i-became-the-bomb", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/How-i-became-the-bomb"}, "artist": "How I Became The Bomb", "lyrics": "Ulay, Oh LyricsThere she was like a picture\nThere she was, she was just the same\nThere she was; he just had to know that she had forgot his name\nUlay, Ulay, Oh\n\nThinking back to the last time\nOn the wall as they turned away\nWalking back; was it just a dream or did he hear her say:\n\"Ulay, Ulay, Oh\"?\nTrying his best to forget her\nTrying his best to just keep his stride\nKept his word, but he knows he heard:\n\"Ulay, Ulay, Oh\nUlay, Ulay, Oh\"\nThere she was like a picture\nThere she was, she was just the same\nThere she was; he just had to know she had not forgot his name\nUlay, Ulay, Oh\nUlay, Ulay, Oh\nUlay, Ulay, Oh\nUlay, Ulay, Oh\nUlay, Ulay, Oh\nUlay, Ulay, Oh\nUlay, Ulay, Oh\n\nThere he was like his picture\nThere he was; he was just the same\nThere he was.

eyes\n\n[Chorus]\nYou want me to say, please\nBaby I can say, please\nYou want me to get down on my knees\nBaby I can get down on my knees\n[Verse 2]\nThe will was strong, but my legs were weak\nI

"lyrics": "Say It Ain\u2019t So Huck: Second Thoughts On Mark Twain\u2019s Masterpiece LyricsSo I broke my leg. Doesn\u2019t matter how\u2013since the accident I\u2019ve heard plenty of broken-leg tales, and, I\u2019m telling you, I didn\u2019t realize that walking down the stairs, walking down hills, dancing in high heels, or stamping your foot on the brake pedal could be so dangerous. At any rate, like numerous broken-legged intellectuals before me, I found the prospect of three months in bed in the dining room rather seductive from a book-reading point of view, and I eagerly got started. Great novels piled up on my table, and right at the top was The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which, I\u2019m embarrassed to admit, I hadn\u2019t read since junior high school. The novel took me a couple of days (it was longer than I had remembered), and I closed the cover stunned. Yes, stunned. Not, by any means, by the artistry of the book but by the notion that this is the novel all American literature grows out of, that this is a great novel, that this is even a serious novel.\n\nAlthough Huck had his fans at publication, his real elevation into the pantheon was worked out early in the Propaganda Era, between 1948 and 1955, by Lionel Trilling, Leslie Fiedler, T. S. Eliot, Joseph Wood Krutch, and some lesser lights, in the introductions to American and British editions of the novel and in such journals as Partisan Review and The New York Times Book Review. The requirements of Huck\u2019s installation rapidly revealed themselves: the failure of the last twelve chapters (in which Huck finds Jim imprisoned on the Phelps plantation and Tom Sawyer is reintroduced and elaborates a cruel and unnecessary scheme for Jim\u2019s liberation) had to be diminished, accounted for, or forgiven; after that, the novel\u2019s special qualities had to be placed in the context first of other American novels (to their detriment) and then of world literature. The best bets here seemed to be Twain\u2019s style and the river setting, and the critics invested accordingly: Eliot, who had never read the novel as a boy, traded on his own childhood beside the big river, elevating Huck to the Boy, and the Mississippi to the River God, therein finding the sort of mythic resonance that he admired. Trilling liked the river god idea, too, though he didn\u2019t bother to capitalize it. He also thought that Twain, through Huck\u2019s lying, told truths, one of them being (I kid you not) that \"something ... had gone out of American life after the [Civil War], some simplicity, some innocence, some peace.\" What Twain himself was proudest of in the novel\u2013his style\u2013Trilling was glad to dub \"not less than definitive in American literature. The prose of Huckleberry Finn established for written prose the virtues of American colloquial speech. . . . He is the master of the style that escapes the fixity of the printed page, that sounds in our ears with the immediacy of the heard voice, the very voice of unpretentious truth.\" The last requirement was some quality that would link Huck to other, though \"lesser,\" American novels such as Herman Melville\u2019s Moby-Dick, that would possess some profound insight into the American character. Leslie Fiedler obligingly provided it when he read homoerotic attraction into the relationship between Huck and Jim, pointing out the similarity of this to such other white man-dark man friendships as those between Ishmael and Queequeg in Moby-Dick and Natty Bumppo and Chingachgook in James Fenimore Cooper\u2019s Last of the Mohicans.\n\nThe canonization proceeded apace: great novel (Trilling, 1950), greatest novel (Eliot, 1950), world-class novel (Lauriat Lane Jr., 1955). Sensible naysayers, such as Leo Marx, were lost in the shuffle of propaganda. But, in fact, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has little to offer in the way of greatness. There is more to be learned about the American character from its canonization than through its canonization.\n\nLet me hasten to point out that, like most others, I don\u2019t hold any grudges against Huck himself. He\u2019s just a boy trying to survive. The villain here is Mark Twain, who knew how to give Huck a voice but didn\u2019t know how to give him a novel. Twain was clearly aware of the story\u2019s difficulties. Not finished with having revisited his boyhood in Tom Sawyer, Twain conceived of a sequel and began composition while still working on Tom Sawyer\u2019s page proofs. Four hundred pages into it, having just passed Cairo and exhausted most of his memories of Hannibal and the upper Mississippi, Twain put the manuscript aside for three years. He was facing a problem every novelist is familiar with: his original conception was beginning to conflict with the implications of the actual story. It is at this point in the story that Huck and Jim realize two things: they have become close friends, and they have missed the Ohio River and drifted into what for Jim must be the most frightening territory of all\u2013down the river, the very place Miss Watson was going to sell him to begin with. Jim\u2019s putative savior, Huck, has led him as far astray as a slave can go, and the farther they go, the worse it is going to be for him. Because the Ohio was not Twain\u2019s territory, the fulfillment of Jim\u2019s wish would necessarily lead the novel away from the artistic integrity that Twain certainly sensed his first four hundred pages possessed. He found himself writing not a boy\u2019s novel, like Tom Sawyer, but a man\u2019s novel, about real moral dilemmas and growth. The patina of nostalgia for a time and place, Missouri in the 1840s (not unlike former President Ronald Reagan\u2019s nostalgia for his own boyhood, when \"Americans got along\"), had been transformed into actual longing for a timeless place of friendship and freedom, safe and hidden, on the big river. But the raft had floated Huck and Jim, and their author with them, into the truly dark heart of the American soul and of American history: slave country.\n\nTwain came back to the novel and worked on it twice again, once to rewrite the chapters containing the feud between the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons, and later to introduce the Duke and the Dauphin. It is with the feud that the novel begins to fail, because from here on the episodes are mere distractions from the true subject of the work: Huck\u2019s affection for and responsibility to Jim. The signs of this failure are everywhere, as Jim is pushed to the side of the narrative, hiding on the raft and confined to it, while Huck follows the Duke and the Dauphin onshore to the scenes of much simpler and much less philosophically taxing moral dilemmas, such as fraud. Twain was by nature an improviser, and he was pleased enough with these improvisations to continue. When the Duke and the Dauphin finally betray Jim by selling him for forty dollars, Huck is shocked, but the fact is neither he nor Twain has come up with a plan that would have saved Jim in the end. Tom Sawyer does that.\n\nConsiderable critical ink has flowed over the years in an attempt to integrate the Tom Sawyer chapters with the rest of the book, but it has flowed in vain. As Leo Marx points out, and as most readers sense intuitively, once Tom reappears, \"[m]ost of those traits which made [Huck] so appealing a hero now disappear. . . . It should be added at once that Jim doesn\u2019t mind too much. The fact is that he has undergone a similar transformation. On the raft he was an individual, man enough to denounce Huck when Huck made him the victim of a practical joke. In the closing episode, however, we lose sight of Jim in the maze of farcical invention.\" And the last twelve chapters are boring, a sure sign that an author has lost the battle between plot and theme and is just filling in the blanks.\nAs with all bad endings, the problem really lies at the beginning, and at the beginning of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn neither Huck nor Twain takes Jim\u2019s desire for freedom at all seriously; that is, they do not accord it the respect that a man\u2019s passion deserves. The sign of this is that not only do the two never cross the Mississippi to Illinois, a free state, but they hardly even consider it. In both Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, the Jackson\u2019s Island scenes show that such a crossing, even in secret, is both possible and routine, and even though it would present legal difficulties for an escaped slave, these would certainly pose no more hardship than locating the mouth of the Ohio and then finding passage up it. It is true that there could have been slave catchers in pursuit (though the novel ostensibly takes place in the 1840s and the Fugitive Slave Act was not passed until 1850), but Twain\u2019s moral failure, once Huck and Jim link up, is never even to account for their choice to go down the river rather than across it. What this reveals is that for all his lip service to real attachment between white boy and black man, Twain really saw Jim as no more than Huck\u2019s sidekick, homoerotic or otherwise. All the claims that are routinely made for the book\u2019s humanitarian power are, in the end, simply absurd. Jim is never autonomous, never has a vote, always finds his purposes subordinate to Huck\u2019s, and, like every good sidekick, he never minds. He grows ever more passive and also more affectionate as Huck and the Duke and the Dauphin and Tom (and Twain) make ever more use of him for their own purposes. But this use they make of him is not supplementary; it is integral to Twain\u2019s whole conception of the novel. Twain thinks that Huck\u2019s affection is a good enough reward for Jim.\n\nThe sort of meretricious critical reasoning that has raised Huck\u2019s paltry good intentions to a \"strategy of subversion\" (David L. Smith) and a \"convincing indictment of slavery\" (Eliot) precisely mirrors the same sort of meretricious reasoning that white people use to convince themselves that they are not \"racist.\" If Huck feels positive toward Jim, and loves him, and thinks of him as a man, then that\u2019s enough. He doesn\u2019t actually have to act in accordance with his feelings. White Americans always think racism is a feeling, and they reject it or they embrace it. To most Americans, it seems more honorable and nicer to reject it, so they do, but they almost invariably fail to understand that how they feel means very little to black Americans, who understand racism as a way of structuring American culture, American politics, and the American economy. To invest The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with \"greatness\" is to underwrite a very simplistic and evasive theory of what racism is and to promulgate it, philosophically, in schools and the media as well as in academic journals. Surely the discomfort of many readers, black and white, and the censorship battles that have dogged Huck Finn in the last twenty years are understandable in this context. No matter how often the critics \"place in context\" Huck\u2019s use of the word \"nigger,\" they can never excuse or fully hide the deeper racism of the novel\u2013the way Twain and Huck use Jim because they really don\u2019t care enough about his desire for freedom to let that desire change their plans. And to give credit to Huck suggests that the only racial insight Americans of the nineteenth or twentieth century are capable of is a recognition of the obvious\u2013that blacks, slave and free, are human.\n\nErnest Hemingway, thinking of himself, as always, once said that all American literature grew out of Huck Finn. It undoubtedly would have been better for American literature, and American culture, if our literature had grown out of one of the best-selling novels of all time, another American work of the nineteenth century, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, which for its portrayal of an array of thoughtful, autonomous, and passionate black characters leaves Huck Finn far behind. Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was published in 1852, when Twain was seventeen, still living in Hannibal and contributing to his brother\u2019s newspapers, still sympathizing with the South, nine years before his abortive career in the Confederate Army. Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin was the most popular novel of its era, universally controversial. In 1863, when Harriet Beecher Stowe visited the White House, Abraham Lincoln condescended to remark to her, \"So this is the little lady who made this great war.\"\n\nThe story, familiar to most nineteenth-century Americans, either through the novel or through the many stage adaptations that sentimentalized Stowe\u2019s work, may be sketched briefly: A Kentucky slave, Tom, is sold to pay off a debt to a slave trader, who takes him to New Orleans. On the boat trip downriver, Tom is purchased by the wealthy Augustine St. Clare at the behest of his daughter, Eva. After Eva\u2019s death, and then St. Clare\u2019s, Tom is sold again, this time to Simon Legree, whose remote plantation is the site of every form of cruelty and degradation. The novel was immediately read and acclaimed by any number of excellent judges: Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Leo Tolstoy, George Sand\u2013the whole roster of nineteenth-century liberals whose work we read today and try to persuade ourselves that Huck Finn is equal to. English novelist and critic Charles Kingsley thought Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin the best novel ever written. These writers honored Stowe\u2019s book for all its myriad virtues. One of these was her adept characterization of a whole world of whites and blacks who find themselves gripped by slavery, many of whose names have entered the American language as expressions\u2013not only Uncle Tom himself but Simon Legree and, to a lesser extent, little Eva and the black child Topsy. The characters appear, one after another, vivified by their attitudes, desires, and opinions as much as by their histories and their fates. Surely Augustine St. Clare, Tom\u2019s owner in New Orleans, is an exquisite portrayal of a humane but indecisive man, who knows what he is doing but not how to stop it. Surely Cassy, a fellow slave whom Tom meets on the Legree plantation, is one of the great angry women in all of literature\u2013not only bitter, murderous, and nihilistic but also intelligent and enterprising. Surely the midlife spiritual journey of Ophelia St. Clare, Augustine\u2019s Yankee cousin, from self-confident ignorance to affectionate understanding is most convincing, as is Topsy\u2019s parallel journey from ignorance and self-hatred to humanity. The ineffectual Mr. Shelby and his submissive, and subversive, wife; the slave trader Haley; Tom\u2019s wife, Chloe; Augustine\u2019s wife, Marie; Legree\u2019s overseers, Sambo and Quimbo\u2013good or evil, they all live.\n\nAs for Tom himself, we all know what an \"Uncle Tom\" is, except we don\u2019t. The popular Uncle Tom sucks up to the master and exhibits bovine patience. the real Uncle Tom is both a realist and a man of deep principle. When he is sold by Mr. Shelby in Kentucky, he knows enough of Shelby\u2019s affairs to know that what his master asserts is true: it\u2019s Tom who must go or the whole estate will be sold off for debt, including Tom\u2019s wife and three children. Later, on the Legree estate, his religious faith tells him that the greatest danger he finds there is not to his life but to his soul. His logic is impeccable. He holds fast to his soul, in the face of suffering, in a way that even nonbelievers like myself must respect. In fact, Tom\u2019s story eerily prefigures stories of spiritual solace through deep religious belief that have come out of both the Soviet Gulag and the Nazi concentration camp in the same way that the structure of power on Legree\u2019s plantation, and the suffering endured there, forecasts and duplicates many stories of recent genocides.\n\nThe power of Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin is the power of brilliant analysis married to great wisdom of feeling. Stowe never forgets the logical end of any relationship in which one person is the subject and the other is the object. No matter how the two people feel, or what their intentions are, the logic of the relationship is inherently tragic and traps both parties until the false subject/object relationship is ended. Stowe\u2019s most oft-repeated and potent representation of this inexorable logic is the forcible separation of family members, especially of mothers from children. Eliza, faced with the sale of her child, Harry, escapes across the breaking ice of the Ohio River. Lucy, whose ten-month-old is sold behind her back, kills herself. Prue, who has been used for breeding, must listen to her last child cry itself to death because her mistress won\u2019t let her save it; she falls into alcoholism and thievery and is finally whipped to death. Cassy, prefiguring a choice made by one of the characters in Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved, kills her last child so that it won\u2019t grow up in slavery. All of these women have been promised something by their owners\u2013love, education, the privilege and joy of raising their children\u2013but, owing to slavery, all of these promises have been broken. The grief and despair these women display is no doubt what T. S. Eliot was thinking of when he superciliously labeled Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin \"sensationalist propaganda,\" but, in fact, few critics in the nineteenth century ever accused Stowe of making up or even exaggerating such stories. One group of former slaves who were asked to comment on Stowe\u2019s depiction of slave life said that she had failed to portray the very worst, and Stowe herself was afraid that if she told some of what she had heard from escaped slaves and other informants during her eighteen years in Cincinnati, the book would be too dark to find any readership at all.\n\nStowe\u2019s analysis does not stop with the slave owners and traders, or with the slaves themselves. She understands perfectly that slavery is an economic system embedded in America as a whole, and she comments ironically on Christian bankers in New York whose financial dealings result in the sale of slaves, on Northern politicians who promote the capture of escaped slaves for the sake of the public good, on ministers of churches who give the system a Christian stamp of approval. One of Stowe\u2019s most skillful techniques is her method of weaving a discussion of slavery into the dialogue of her characters. Especially interesting is a conversation Mark Twain could have paid attention to. Augustine St. Clare and his abolitionist cousin, Ophelia, are discussing his failure to act in accordance with his feelings of revulsion against slavery. After entertaining Ophelia\u2019s criticisms for a period, Augustine points out that Ophelia herself is personally disgusted by black people and doesn\u2019t like to come into contact with them. He says, \"You would think no harm in a child\u2019s caressing a large dog, even if he was black . . . custom with us does what Christianity ought to do,\u2013obliterates the feeling of personal prejudice.\" When Ophelia takes over the education of Topsy, a child who has suffered a most brutal previous upbringing, she discovers that she can do nothing with her until she takes her, literally, to her bosom. But personal relationships do not mitigate the evils of slavery; Ophelia makes sure to give Topsy her freedom.\n\nStowe also understands that the real root of slavery is that it is profitable as well as customary. Augustine and his brother live with slavery because it is the system they know and because they haven\u2019t the imagination to live without it. Simon Legree embraces slavery because he can make money from it and because it gives him even more absolute power over his workers than he could find in the North or in England.\n\nThe very heart of nineteenth-century American experience and literature, the nature and meaning of slavery, is finally what Twain cannot face in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. As Jim and Huck drift down Twain\u2019s beloved river, the author finds himself nearing what must have been a crucial personal nexus: how to reconcile the felt memory of boyhood with the cruel implications of the social system within which that boyhood was lived. He had avoided this problem for the most part in Tom Sawyer: slaves hardly impinge on the lives of Tom and the other boys. But once Twain allows Jim a voice, this voice must speak in counterpoint to Huck\u2019s voice and must raise issues that cannot easily be resolved, either personally or culturally. Harriet Beecher Stowe, New Englander, daughter of Puritans and thinkers, active in the abolitionist movement and in the effort to aid and educate escaped slaves, had no such personal conflict when she sat down to write Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. Nothing about slavery was attractive to her either as a New Englander or as a resident of Cincinnati for almost twenty years. Her lack of conflict is apparent in the clarity of both the style and substance of the novel.\n\nWhy, then, we may ask, did Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, for all its power and popularity, fail to spawn American literature? Fail, even, to work as a model for how to draw passionate, autonomous, and interesting black literary characters? Fail to keep the focus of the American literary imagination on the central dilemma of the American experience: race? Part of the reason is certainly that the public conversation about race and slavery that had been a feature of antebellum American life fell silent after the Civil War. Perhaps the answer is to be found in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: everyone opted for the ultimate distraction, lighting out for the territory. And the reason is to be found in Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin: that\u2019s where the money was.\n\nBut so what? These are only authors, after all, and once a book is published the author can\u2019t be held accountable for its role in the culture. For that we have to blame the citizens themselves, or their teachers, or their teachers, the arbiters of critical taste. In \"Melodramas of Beset Manhood: How Theories of American Fiction Exclude Women Authors,\" the scholar Nina Baym has already detailed how the canonization of a very narrow range of white, Protestant, middle-class male authors (Twain, Hawthorne, Melville, Emerson, etc.) has misrepresented our literary life\u2013first by defining the only worthy American literary subject as \"the struggle of the individual against society [in which] the essential quality of America comes to reside in its unsettled wilderness and the opportunities that such a wilderness offers to the individual as the medium on which he may inscribe, unhindered, his own destiny and his own nature,\" and then by casting women, and especially women writers (specialists in the \"flagrantly bad best-seller,\" according to Leslie Fiedler), as the enemy. In such critical readings, all other themes and modes of literary expression fall out of consideration as \"un-American.\" There goes Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, there goes Edith Wharton, there goes domestic life as a subject, there go almost all the best-selling novelists of the nineteenth century and their readers, who were mostly women. The real loss, though, is not to our literature but to our culture and ourselves, because we have lost the subject of how the various social groups who may not escape to the wilderness are to get along in society; and, in the case of Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, the hard-nosed, unsentimental dialogue about race that we should have been having since before the Civil War. Obviously, Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin is no more the last word on race relations than The Brothers Karamazov or David Copperfield is on any number of characteristically Russian or English themes and social questions. Some of Stowe\u2019s ideas about inherent racial characteristics (whites: cold, heartless; blacks: naturally religious and warm) are bad and have been exploded. One of her solutions to the American racial conflicts that she foresaw, a colony in Africa, she later repudiated. Nevertheless, her views about many issues were brilliant, and her heart was wise. She gained the respect and friendship of many men and women of goodwill, black and white, such as Frederick Douglass, the civil-rights activist Mary Church Terrill, the writer and social activist James Weldon Johnson, and W.E.B. Du Bois. What she did was find a way to talk about slavery and family, power and law, life and death, good and evil, North and South. She truly believed that all Americans together had to find a solution to the problem of slavery in which all were implicated. When her voice, a courageously public voice\u2013as demonstrated by the public arguments about slavery that race throughout Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u2013fell silent in our culture and was replaced by the secretive voice of Huck Finn, who acknowledges Jim only when they are alone on the raft together out in the middle of the big river, racism fell out of the public world and into the private one, where whites think it really is but blacks know it really isn\u2019t.\n\nShould Huckleberry Finn be taught in the schools? The critics of the Propaganda Era laid the groundwork for the universal inclusion of the book in school curriculums by declaring it great. Although they predated the current generation of politicized English professors, this was clearly a political act, because the entry of Huck Finn into classrooms sets the terms of the discussion of racism and American history, and sets them very low: all you have to do to be a hero is acknowledge that your poor sidekick is human; you don\u2019t actually have to act in the interests of his humanity. Arguments about censorship have been regularly turned into nonsense by appeals to Huck\u2019s \"greatness.\" Moreover, so much critical thinking has gone into defending Huck so that he can be great, so that American literature can be found different from and maybe better than Russian or English or French literature, that the very integrity of the critical enterprise has been called into question. That most readers intuitively reject the last twelve chapters of the novel on the grounds of tedium or triviality is clear from the fact that so many critics have turned themselves inside out to defend them. Is it so mysterious that criticism has failed in our time after being so robust only a generation ago? Those who cannot be persuaded that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a great novel have to draw some conclusion.\n\nI would rather my children read Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, even though it is far more vivid in its depiction of cruelty than Huck Finn, and this is because Stowe\u2019s novel is clearly and unmistakably a tragedy. No whitewash, no secrets, but evil, suffering, imagination, endurance, and redemption\u2013just like life. Like little Eva, who eagerly but fearfully listens to the stories of the slaves that her family tries to keep from her, our children want to know what is going on, what has gone on, and what we intend to do about it. If \"great\" literature has any purpose, it is to help us face up to our responsibilities instead of enabling us to avoid them once again by lighting out for the territory.Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.This civil action was brought under 42 U. S. C.  1983 and 1988 to redress the alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights. The complaint, alleging that by means of a 1901 statute of Tennessee apportioning the members of the General Assembly among the State's 95 counties,[1] \"these plaintiffs and others similarly situated, *188 are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by virtue of the debasement of their votes,\" was dismissed by a three-judge court convened under 28 U. S. C.  2281 in the Middle District of Tennessee.[2] The court held that it lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter and also that no claim was stated upon which relief could be granted. 179 F. Supp. 824. We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal. 364 U. S. 898.[3] We hold that the dismissal was error, and remand the cause to the District Court for trial and further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nThe General Assembly of Tennessee consists of the Senate with 33 members and the House of Representatives with 99 members. The Tennessee Constitution provides in Art. II as follows:\"Sec. 3. Legislative authorityTerm of office. The Legislative authority of this State shall be vested in a General Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives, both dependent on the people; who shall hold their offices for two years from the day of the general election.\"Sec. 4. Census.An enumeration of the qualified voters, and an apportionment of the Representatives in the General Assembly, shall be made in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and within every subsequent term of ten years.\"Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.The number of Representatives shall, at the several *189 periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided, that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.\"Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no county shall be divided in forming a district.\"Thus, Tennessee's standard for allocating legislative representation among her counties is the total number of qualified voters resident in the respective counties, subject only to minor qualifications.[4] Decennial reapportionment *190 in compliance with the constitutional scheme was effected by the General Assembly each decade from 1871 to 1901. The 1871 apportionment[5] was preceded by an 1870 statute requiring an enumeration.[6] The 1881 apportionment involved three statutes, the first authorizing an enumeration, the second enlarging the Senate from 25 to *191 33 members and the House from 75 to 99 members, and the third apportioning the membership of both Houses.[7] In 1891 there were both an enumeration and an apportionment.[8] In 1901 the General Assembly abandoned separate enumeration in favor of reliance upon the Federal Census and passed the Apportionment Act here in controversy.[9] In the more than 60 years since that action, all proposals in both Houses of the General Assembly for reapportionment have failed to pass.[10]\n*192 Between 1901 and 1961, Tennessee has experienced substantial growth and redistribution of her population. In 1901 the population was 2,020,616, of whom 487,380 were eligible to vote.[11] The 1960 Federal Census reports the State's population at 3,567,089, of whom 2,092,891 are eligible to vote.[12] The relative standings of the counties in terms of qualified voters have changed significantly. It is primarily the continued application of the 1901 Apportionment Act to this shifted and enlarged voting population which gives rise to the present controversy.\n\nIndeed, the complaint alleges that the 1901 statute, even as of the time of its passage, \"made no apportionment of Representatives and Senators in accordance with the constitutional formula . . . , but instead arbitrarily and capriciously apportioned representatives in the Senate and House without reference . . . to any logical or reasonable formula whatever.\"[13] It is further alleged *193 that \"because of the population changes since 1900, and the failure of the Legislature to reapportion itself since 1901,\" the 1901 statute became \"unconstitutional and obsolete.\" Appellants also argue that, because of the composition of the legislature effected by the 1901 Apportionment Act, redress in the form of a state constitutional amendment to change the entire mechanism for reapportioning, or any other change short of that, is difficult or impossible.[14] The complaint concludes that \"these plaintiffs *194 and others similarly situated, are denied the equal protection of the laws accorded them by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States by virtue of the debasement of their votes.\"[15] They seek a *195 declaration that the 1901 statute is unconstitutional and an injunction restraining the appellees from acting to conduct any further elections under it. They also pray that unless and until the General Assembly enacts a valid reapportionment, the District Court should either decree a reapportionment by mathematical application of the Tennessee constitutional formulae to the most recent Federal Census figures, or direct the appellees to conduct legislative elections, primary and general, at large. They also pray for such other and further relief as may be appropriate.I.THE DISTRICT COURT'S OPINION AND ORDER OF DISMISSAL.Because we deal with this case on appeal from an order of dismissal granted on appellees' motions, precise identification *196 of the issues presently confronting us demands clear exposition of the grounds upon which the District Court rested in dismissing the case. The dismissal order recited that the court sustained the appellees' grounds \"(1) that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, and (2) that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted . . . .\"\n\nIn the setting of a case such as this, the recited grounds embrace two possible reasons for dismissal:\n\nFirst: That the facts and injury alleged, the legal bases invoked as creating the rights and duties relied upon, and the relief sought, fail to come within that language of Article III of the Constitution and of the jurisdictional statutes which define those matters concerning which United States District Courts are empowered to act;\n\nSecond: That, although the matter is cognizable and facts are alleged which establish infringement of appellants' rights as a result of state legislative action departing from a federal constitutional standard, the court will not proceed because the matter is considered unsuited to judicial inquiry or adjustment.\n\nWe treat the first ground of dismissal as \"lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter.\" The second we consider to result in a failure to state a justiciable cause of action.\n\nThe District Court's dismissal order recited that it was issued in conformity with the court's per curiam opinion. The opinion reveals that the court rested its dismissal upon lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and lack of a justiciable cause of action without attempting to distinguish between these grounds. After noting that the plaintiffs challenged the existing legislative apportionment in Tennessee under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, and summarizing the supporting allegations and the relief requested, the court stated that\"The action is presently before the Court upon the defendants' motion to dismiss predicated upon three *197 grounds: first, that the Court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter; second, that the complaints fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted; and third, that indispensable party defendants are not before the Court.\" 179 F. Supp., at 826.The court proceeded to explain its action as turning on the case's presenting a \"question of the distribution of political strength for legislative purposes.\" For,\"From a review of [numerous Supreme Court] . . . decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule, as enunciated and applied by the Supreme Court, is that the federal courts, whether from a lack of jurisdiction or from the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial consideration, will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment.\" 179 F. Supp., at 826.The court went on to express doubts as to the feasibility of the various possible remedies sought by the plaintiffs. 179 F. Supp., at 827-828. Then it made clear that its dismissal reflected a view not of doubt that violation of constitutional rights was alleged, but of a court's impotence to correct that violation:\"With the plaintiffs' argument that the legislature of Tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the rights of the plaintiffs the Court entirely agrees. It also agrees that the evil is a serious one which should be corrected without further delay. But even so the remedy in this situation clearly does not lie with the courts. It has long been recognized and is accepted doctrine that there are indeed some rights guaranteed by the Constitution for the violation of which the courts cannot give redress.\" 179 F. Supp., at 828.In light of the District Court's treatment of the case, we hold today only (a) that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of *198 action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) because appellees raise the issue before this Court, that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes.[16] Beyond noting that we have no cause at this stage to doubt the District Court will be able to fashion relief if violations of constitutional rights are found, it is improper now to consider what remedy would be most appropriate if appellants prevail at the trial.II.JURISDICTION OF THE SUBJECT MATTER.The District Court was uncertain whether our cases withholding federal judicial relief rested upon a lack of federal jurisdiction or upon the inappropriateness of the subject matter for judicial considerationwhat we have designated \"nonjusticiability.\" The distinction between the two grounds is significant. In the instance of nonjusticiability, consideration of the cause is not wholly and immediately foreclosed; rather, the Court's inquiry necessarily proceeds to the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded. In the instance of lack of jurisdiction the cause either does not \"arise under\" the Federal Constitution, laws or treaties (or fall within one of the other enumerated categories of Art. III,  2), or is not a \"case or controversy\" within the meaning of that section; or the cause is not one described by any jurisdictional statute. Our conclusion, see pp. 208-237. infra, that this cause presents no nonjusticiable \"political question\" settles the only possible doubt that it is a case or controversy. Under the present heading of \"Jurisdiction *199 of the Subject Matter\" we hold only that the matter set forth in the complaint does arise under the Constitution and is within 28 U. S. C.  1343.\n\nArticle III,  2, of the Federal Constitution provides that \"The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority . . . .\" It is clear that the cause of action is one which \"arises under\" the Federal Constitution. The complaint alleges that the 1901 statute effects an apportionment that deprives the appellants of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Dismissal of the complaint upon the ground of lack of jurisdiction of the subject matter would, therefore, be justified only if that claim were \"so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit,\" Newburyport Water Co. v. Newburyport, 193 U. S. 561, 579, or \"frivolous,\" Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 683.[17] That the claim is unsubstantial must be \"very plain.\" Hart v. Keith Vaudeville Exchange, 262 U. S. 271, 274. Since the District Court obviously and correctly did not deem the asserted federal constitutional claim unsubstantial and frivolous, it should not have dismissed the complaint for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter. And of course no further consideration of the merits of the claim is relevant to a determination of the court's jurisdiction of the subject matter. We said in an earlier voting case from Tennessee: \"It is obvious . . . that the court, in dismissing for want of jurisdiction, was controlled by what it deemed to be the want of merit in the averments which were made in the complaint as to the violation of the Federal right. But as the very nature of the controversy was Federal, and, therefore, *200 jurisdiction existed, whilst the opinion of the court as to the want of merit in the cause of action might have furnished ground for dismissing for that reason, it afforded no sufficient ground for deciding that the action was not one arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States.\" Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487, 493. \"For it is well settled that the failure to state a proper cause of action calls for a judgment on the merits and not for a dismissal for want of jurisdiction.\" Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 682. See also Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, 263 U. S. 291, 305-308.\n\nSince the complaint plainly sets forth a case arising under the Constitution, the subject matter is within the federal judicial power defined in Art. III,  2, and so within the power of Congress to assign to the jurisdiction of the District Courts. Congress has exercised that power in 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3):\"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law[18] to be commenced by any person . . . [t]o redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States . . . .\"[19]*201 An unbroken line of our precedents sustains the federal courts' jurisdiction of the subject matter of federal constitutional claims of this nature. The first cases involved the redistricting of States for the purpose of electing Representatives to the Federal Congress. When the Ohio Supreme Court sustained Ohio legislation against an attack for repugnancy to Art. I,  4, of the Federal Constitution, we affirmed on the merits and expressly refused to dismiss for want of jurisdiction \"In view . . . of the subject-matter of the controversy and the Federal characteristics which inhere in it . . . .\" Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 570. When the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of a suit to enjoin the Secretary of State of Minnesota from acting under Minnesota redistricting legislation, we reviewed the constitutional merits of the legislation and reversed the State Supreme Court. Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355. And see companion cases from the New York Court of Appeals and the Missouri Supreme Court, Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U. S. 375; Carroll v. Becker, 285 U. S. 380. When a three-judge District Court, exercising jurisdiction under the predecessor of 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3), permanently enjoined officers of the State of Mississippi from conducting an election of Representatives under a Mississippi redistricting act, we reviewed the federal questions on the merits and reversed the District Court. Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1, reversing 1 F. Supp. 134. A similar decree of a District Court, exercising jurisdiction under the same statute, concerning a Kentucky redistricting act, was *202 reviewed and the decree reversed. Mahan v. Hume, 287 U. S. 575, reversing 1 F. Supp. 142.[20]\n\nThe appellees refer to Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, as authority that the District Court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter. Appellees misconceive the holding of that case. The holding was precisely contrary to their reading of it. Seven members of the Court participated in the decision. Unlike many other cases in this field which have assumed without discussion that there was jurisdiction, all three opinions filed in Colegrove discussed the question. Two of the opinions expressing the views of four of the Justices, a majority, flatly held that there was jurisdiction of the subject matter. MR. JUSTICE BLACK joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and Mr. Justice Murphy stated: \"It is my judgment that the District Court had jurisdiction . . . ,\" citing the predecessor of 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3), and Bell v. Hood, supra. 328 U. S., at 568. Mr. Justice Rutledge, writing separately, expressed agreement with this conclusion. 328 U. S., at 564, 565, n. 2. Indeed, it is even questionable that the opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, joined by Justices Reed and Burton, doubted jurisdiction of the subject matter. Such doubt would have been inconsistent with the professed willingness to turn the decision on either the majority or concurring views in Wood v. Broom, supra. 328 U. S., at 551.\n\nSeveral subsequent cases similar to Colegrove have been decided by the Court in summary per curiam statements. None was dismissed for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter. Cook v. Fortson, 329 U. S. 675; Turman v. *203 Duckworth, ibid.; Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804;[21]Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940; Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916; Cox v. Peters, 342 U. S. 936; Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912; Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920; Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991; Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U. S. 916; Matthews v. Handley, 361 U. S. 127.[22]\n\nTwo cases decided with opinions after Colegrove likewise plainly imply that the subject matter of this suit is within District Court jurisdiction. In MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, the District Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction, which had been invoked under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3), a suit to enjoin enforcement of the requirement that nominees for state-wide elections be supported by a petition signed by a minimum number of persons from at least 50 of the State's 102 counties. This Court's disagreement with that action is clear since the Court affirmed the judgment after a review of the merits and concluded that the particular claim there was without merit. In South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, we affirmed the dismissal of an attack on the Georgia \"county unit\" system but founded our action on a ground that plainly would not have been reached if the lower court lacked jurisdiction of the subject matter, which allegedy existed under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3). The express words of our holding were that \"Federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing *204 political issues arising from a state's geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions.\" 339 U. S., at 277.\n\nWe hold that the District Court has jurisdiction of the subject matter of the federal constitutional claim asserted in the complaint.III.STANDING.A federal court cannot \"pronounce any statute, either of a State or of the United States, void, because irreconcilable with the Constitution, except as it is called upon to adjudge the legal rights of litigants in actual controversies.\" Liverpool Steamship Co. v. Commissioners of Emigration, 113 U. S. 33, 39. Have the appellants alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions? This is the gist of the question of standing. It is, of course, a question of federal law.\nThe complaint was filed by residents of Davidson, Hamilton, Knox, Montgomery, and Shelby Counties. Each is a person allegedly qualified to vote for members of the General Assembly representing his county.[23] These appellants sued \"on their own behalf and on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties, and further, on behalf of all voters of the State of Tennessee who *205 are similarly situated . . . .\"[24] The appellees are the Tennessee Secretary of State, Attorney General, Coordinator of Elections, and members of the State Board of Elections; the members of the State Board are sued in their own right and also as representatives of the County Election Commissioners whom they appoint.[25]\n*206 We hold that the appellants do have standing to maintain this suit. Our decisions plainly support this conclusion. Many of the cases have assumed rather than articulated the premise in deciding the merits of similar claims.[26] And Colegrove v. Green, supra, squarely held that voters who allege facts showing disadvantage to themselves as individuals have standing to sue.[27] A number *207 of cases decided after Colegrove recognized the standing of the voters there involved to bring those actions.[28]\n\nThese appellants seek relief in order to protect or vindicate an interest of their own, and of those similarly situated. Their constitutional claim is, in substance, that the 1901 statute constitutes arbitrary and capricious state action, offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment in its irrational disregard of the standard of apportionment prescribed by the State's Constitution or of any standard, effecting a gross disproportion of representation to voting population. The injury which appellants assert is that this classification disfavors the voters in the counties in which they reside, placing them in a position of constitutionally unjustifiable inequality vis-a-vis voters *208 in irrationally favored counties. A citizen's right to a vote free of arbitrary impairment by state action has been judicially recognized as a right secured by the Constitution, when such impairment resulted from dilution by a false tally, cf. United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299; or by a refusal to count votes from arbitrarily selected precincts, cf. United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383, or by a stuffing of the ballot box, cf. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371; United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S. 385.\n\nIt would not be necessary to decide whether appellants' allegations of impairment of their votes by the 1901 apportionment will, ultimately, entitle them to any relief, in order to hold that they have standing to seek it. If such impairment does produce a legally cognizable injury, they are among those who have sustained it. They are asserting \"a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the effectiveness of their votes,\" Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S., at 438, not merely a claim of \"the right, possessed by every citizen, to require that the Government be administered according to law . . . .\" Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126, 129; compare Leser v. Garnett, 258 U. S. 130. They are entitled to a hearing and to the District Court's decision on their claims. \"The very essence of civil liberty certainly consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.\" Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 163.IV.JUSTICIABILITY.In holding that the subject matter of this suit was not justiciable, the District Court relied on Colegrove v. Green, supra, and subsequent per curiam cases.[29] The *209 court stated: \"From a review of these decisions there can be no doubt that the federal rule . . . is that the federal courts . . . will not intervene in cases of this type to compel legislative reapportionment.\" 179 F. Supp., at 826. We understand the District Court to have read the cited cases as compelling the conclusion that since the appellants sought to have a legislative apportionment held unconstitutional, their suit presented a \"political question\" and was therefore nonjusticiable. We hold that this challenge to an apportionment presents no nonjusticiable \"political question.\" The cited cases do not hold the contrary.\n\nOf course the mere fact that the suit seeks protection of a political right does not mean it presents a political question. Such an objection \"is little more than a play upon words.\" Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536, 540. Rather, it is argued that apportionment cases, whatever the actual wording of the complaint, can involve no federal constitutional right except one resting on the guaranty of a republican form of government,[30] and that complaints based on that clause have been held to present political questions which are nonjusticiable.\n\nWe hold that the claim pleaded here neither rests upon nor implicates the Guaranty Clause and that its justiciability is therefore not foreclosed by our decisions of cases involving that clause. The District Court misinterpreted Colegrove v. Green and other decisions of this Court on which it relied. Appellants' claim that they are being denied equal protection is justiciable, and if *210 \"discrimination is sufficiently shown, the right to relief under the equal protection clause is not diminished by the fact that the discrimination relates to political rights.\" Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1, 11. To show why we reject the argument based on the Guaranty Clause, we must examine the authorities under it. But because there appears to be some uncertainty as to why those cases did present political questions, and specifically as to whether this apportionment case is like those cases, we deem it necessary first to consider the contours of the \"political question\" doctrine.\n\nOur discussion, even at the price of extending this opinion, requires review of a number of political question cases, in order to expose the attributes of the doctrine attributes which, in various settings, diverge, combine, appear, and disappear in seeming disorderliness. Since that review is undertaken solely to demonstrate that neither singly nor collectively do these cases support a conclusion that this apportionment case is nonjusticiable, we of course do not explore their implications in other contexts. That review reveals that in the Guaranty Clause cases and in the other \"political question\" cases, it is the relationship between the judiciary and the coordinate branches of the Federal Government, and not the federal judiciary's relationship to the States, which gives rise to the \"political question.\"\n\nWe have said that \"In determining whether a question falls within [the political question] category, the approriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination are dominant considerations.\" Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 454-455. The nonjusticiability of a political question is primarily a function of the separation of powers. Much confusion results from the capacity of the \"political question\" label to obscure the need for *211 case-by-case inquiry. Deciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution. To demonstrate this requires no less than to analyze representative cases and to infer from them the analytical threads that make up the political question doctrine. We shall then show that none of those threads catches this case.\n\nForeign relations: There are sweeping statements to the effect that all questions touching foreign relations are political questions.[31] Not only does resolution of such issues frequently turn on standards that defy judicial application, or involve the exercise of a discretion demonstrably committed to the executive or legislature;[32] but many such questions uniquely demand single-voiced statement of the Government's views.[33] Yet it is error to suppose that every case or controversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance. Our cases in this field seem invariably to show a discriminating analysis of the particular question posed, in terms of the history of its management by the political branches, of its susceptibility to judicial handling in the light of its nature and posture in the specific case, and of the possible consequences *212 of judicial action. For example, though a court will not ordinarily inquire whether a treaty has been terminated, since on that question \"governmental action . . . must be regarded as of controlling importance,\" if there has been no conclusive \"governmental action\" then a court can construe a treaty and may find it provides the answer. Compare Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270, 285, with Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts v. New Haven, 8 Wheat. 464, 492-495.[34] Though a court will not undertake to construe a treaty in a manner inconsistent with a subsequent federal statute, no similar hesitancy obtains if the asserted clash is with state law. Compare Whitney v. Robertson; 124 U. S. 190, with Kolovrat v. Oregon, 366 U. S. 187.\n\nWhile recognition of foreign governments so strongly defies judicial treatment that without executive recognition a foreign state has been called \"a republic of whose existence we know nothing,\"[35] and the judiciary ordinarily follows the executive as to which nation has sovereignty over disputed territory,[36] once sovereignty over an area is politically determined and declared, courts may examine the resulting status and decide independently whether a statute applies to that area.[37] Similarly, recognition of belligerency abroad is an executive responsibility, but if the executive proclamations fall short of an explicit answer, a court may construe them seeking, for example, to determine whether the situation is such that statutes designed to assure American neutrality have *213 become operative. The Three Friends, 166 U. S. 1, 63, 66. Still again, though it is the executive that determines a person's status as representative of a foreign government, Ex parte Hitz, 111 U. S. 766, the executive's statements will be construed where necessary to determine the court's jurisdiction, In re Baiz, 135 U. S. 403. Similar judicial action in the absence of a recognizedly authoritative executive declaration occurs in cases involving the immunity from seizure of vessels owned by friendly foreign governments. Compare Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578, with Mexico v. Hoffman, 324 U. S. 30, 34-35.\n\nDates of duration of hostilities: Though it has been stated broadly that \"the power which declared the necessity is the power to declare its cessation, and what the cessation requires,\" Commercial Trust Co. v. Miller, 262 U. S. 51, 57, here too analysis reveals isolable reasons for the presence of political questions, underlying this Court's refusal to review the political departments' determination of when or whether a war has ended. Dominant is the need for finality in the political determination, for emergency's nature demands \"A prompt and unhesitating obedience,\" Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 30 (calling up of militia). Moreover, \"the cessation of hostilities does not necessarily end the war power. It was stated in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & W. Co., 251 U. S. 146, 161, that the war power includes the power `to remedy the evils which have arisen from its rise and progress' and continues during that emergency. Stewart v. Kahn, 11 Wall. 493, 507.\" Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking Co., 331 U. S. 111, 116. But deference rests on reason, not habit.[38] The question in a particular case may not seriously implicate considerations of finalitye. g., a public program of importance *214 (rent control) yet not central to the emergency effort.[39] Further, clearly definable criteria for decision may be available. In such case the political question barrier falls away: \"[A] Court is not at liberty to shut its eyes to an obvious mistake, when the validity of the law depends upon the truth of what is declared. . . . [It can] inquire whether the exigency still existed upon which the continued operation of the law depended.\" Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U. S. 543, 547-548.[40] Compare Woods v. Miller Co., 333 U. S. 138. On the other hand, even in private litigation which directly implicates no feature of separation of powers, lack of judicially discoverable standards and the drive for even-handed application may impel reference to the political departments' determination of dates of hostilities' beginning and ending. The Protector, 12 Wall. 700.\n\nValidity of enactments: In Coleman v. Miller, supra, this Court held that the questions of how long a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution remained open to ratification, and what effect a prior rejection had on a subsequent ratification, were committed to congressional resolution and involved criteria of decision that necessarily escaped the judicial grasp.[41] Similar considerations apply to the enacting process: \"The respect due to coequal and independent departments,\" and the need for finality and certainty about the status of a statute contribute to judicial reluctance to inquire whether, as passed, it complied with all requisite formalities. Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 672, 676-677; see Leser v. Garnett, 258 U. S. 130, 137. But it is not true that courts will never delve *215 into a legislature's records upon such a quest: If the enrolled statute lacks an effective date, a court will not hesitate to seek it in the legislative journals in order to preserve the enactment. Gardner v. The Collector, 6 Wall. 499. The political question doctrine, a tool for maintenance of governmental order, will not be so applied as to promote only disorder.\n\nThe status of Indian tribes: This Court's deference to the political departments in determining whether Indians are recognized as a tribe, while it reflects familiar attributes of political questions,[42]United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407, 419, also has a unique element in that \"the relation of the Indians to the United States is marked by peculiar and cardinal distinctions which exist no where else. . . . [The Indians are] domestic dependent nations . . . in a state of pupilage. Their relation to the United States resembles that of a ward to his guardian.\" The Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 16, 17.[43] Yet, here too, there is no blanket rule. While *216 \" `It is for [Congress] . . . , and not for the courts, to determine when the true interests of the Indian require his release from [the] condition of tutelage' . . . , it is not meant by this that Congress may bring a community or body of people within the range of this power by arbitrarily calling them an Indian tribe . . . .\" United States v. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 46. Able to discern what is \"distinctly Indian,\" ibid., the courts will strike down *217 any heedless extension of that label. They will not stand impotent before an obvious instance of a manifestly unauthorized exercise of power.\nIt is apparent that several formulations which vary slightly according to the settings in which the questions arise may describe a political question, although each has one or more elements which identify it as essentially a function of the separation of powers. Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\n\nUnless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability on the ground of a political question's presence. The doctrine of which we treat is one of \"political questions,\" not one of \"political cases.\" The courts cannot reject as \"no law suit\" a bona fide controversy as to whether some action denominated \"political\" exceeds constitutional authority. The cases we have reviewed show the necessity for discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and posture of the particular case, and the impossibility of resolution by any semantic cataloguing.\n\nBut it is argued that this case shares the characteristics of decisions that constitute a category not yet considered, cases concerning the Constitution's guaranty, in Art. IV, *218  4, of a republican form of government. A conclusion as to whether the case at bar does present a political question cannot be confidently reached until we have considered those cases with special care. We shall discover that Guaranty Clause claims involve those elements which define a \"political question,\" and for that reason and no other, they are nonjusticiable. In particular, we shall discover that the nonjusticiability of such claims has nothing to do with their touching upon matters of state governmental organization.\n\nRepublican form of government: Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, though in form simply an action for damages for trespass was, as Daniel Webster said in opening the argument for the defense, \"an unusual case.\"[44] The defendants, admitting an otherwise tortious breaking and entering, sought to justify their action on the ground that they were agents of the established lawful government of Rhode Island, which State was then under martial law to defend itself from active insurrection; that the plaintiff was engaged in that insurrection; and that they entered under orders to arrest the plaintiff. The case arose \"out of the unfortunate political differences which agitated the people of Rhode Island in 1841 and 1842,\" 7 How., at 34, and which had resulted in a situation wherein two groups laid competing claims to recognition as the lawful government.[45] The plaintiff's right to *219 recover depended upon which of the two groups was entitled to such recognition; but the lower court's refusal to receive evidence or hear argument on that issue, its charge to the jury that the earlier established or \"charter\" government was lawful, and the verdict for the defendants, were affirmed upon appeal to this Court.\n\nChief Justice Taney's opinion for the Court reasoned as follows: (1) If a court were to hold the defendants' acts unjustified because the charter government had no legal existence during the period in question, it would follow that all of that government's actionslaws enacted, taxes collected, salaries paid, accounts settled, sentences passedwere of no effect; and that \"the officers who carried their decisions into operation [were] answerable as trespassers, if not in some cases as criminals.\"[46] There was, of course, no room for application of any doctrine of de facto status to uphold prior acts of an officer not authorized de jure, for such would have defeated the plaintiff's very action. A decision for the plaintiff would inevitably have produced some significant measure of chaos, a consequence to be avoided if it could be done without abnegation of the judicial duty to uphold the Constitution.\n\n(2) No state court had recognized as a judicial responsibility settlement of the issue of the locus of state governmental authority. Indeed, the courts of Rhode Island had in several cases held that \"it rested with the political power to decide whether the charter government had been displaced or not,\" and that that department had acknowledged no change.\n\n*220 (3) Since \"[t]he question relates, altogether, to the constitution and laws of [the] . . . State,\" the courts of the United States had to follow the state courts' decisions unless there was a federal constitutional ground for overturning them.[47]\n\n(4) No provision of the Constitution could be or had been invoked for this purpose except Art. IV,  4, the Guaranty Clause. Having already noted the absence of standards whereby the choice between governments could be made by a court acting independently, Chief Justice Taney now found further textual and practical reasons for concluding that, if any department of the United States was empowered by the Guaranty Clause to resolve the issue, it was not the judiciary:\"Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the State before it can determine whether it is republican or not. And when the senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the councils of the Union, the authority of the government under which they are appointed, as well as its republican character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority. And its decision is binding on every other department of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue; and . . . Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy. Yet the right to decide is placed there, and not in the courts.*221 \"So, too, as relates to the clause in the above-mentioned article of the Constitution, providing for cases of domestic violence. It rested with Congress, too, to determine upon the means proper to be adopted to fulfill this guarantee. . . . [B]y the act of February 28, 1795, [Congress] provided, that, `in case of an insurrection in any State against the government thereof, it shall be lawful for the President of the United States, on application of the legislature of such State or of the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened), to call forth such number of the militia of any other State or States, as may be applied for, as he may judge sufficient to suppress such insurrection.'\"By this act, the power of deciding whether the exigency had arisen upon which the government of the United States is bound to interfere, is given to the President. . . .\"After the President has acted and called out the militia, is a Circuit Court of the United States authorized to inquire whether his decision was right? . . . If the judicial power extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and not of order. . . .\"It is true that in this case the militia were not called out by the President. But upon the application of the governor under the charter government, the President recognized him as the executive power of the State, and took measures to call out the militia to support his authority if it should be found necessary for the general government to interfere . . . . [C]ertainly no court of the United States, with a knowledge of this decision, would have been justified in recognizing the opposing party as the lawful government *222. . . . In the case of foreign nations, the government acknowledged by the President is always recognized in the courts of justice. . . .\" 7 How., at 42-44.Clearly, several factors were thought by the Court in Luther to make the question there \"political\": the commitment to the other branches of the decision as to which is the lawful state government; the unambiguous action by the President, in recognizing the charter government as the lawful authority; the need for finality in the executive's decision; and the lack of criteria by which a court could determine which form of government was republican.[48]\n*223 But the only significance that Luther could have for our immediate purposes is in its holding that the Guaranty Clause is not a repository of judicially manageable standards which a court could utilize independently in order to identify a State's lawful government. The Court has since refused to resort to the Guaranty Clausewhich alone had been invoked for the purposeas the source of a constitutional standard for invalidating state action. See Taylor & Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U. S. 548 (claim that Kentucky's resolution of contested gubernatorial election deprived voters of republican government held nonjusticiable); Pacific States Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118 (claim that initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Kiernan v. Portland, 223 U. S. 151 (claim that municipal charter amendment per municipal initiative and referendum negated republican government held nonjusticiable); *224 Marshall v. Dye, 231 U. S. 250 (claim that Indiana's constitutional amendment procedure negated republican government held nonjusticiable); O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U. S. 244 (claim that delegation to court of power to form drainage districts negated republican government held \"futile\"); Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565 (claim that invalidation of state reapportionment statute per referendum negates republican government held nonjusticiable);[49]Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219 (claim that workmen's compensation violates republican government held nonjusticiable); Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, 281 U. S. 74 (claim that rule requiring invalidation of statute by all but one justice of state court negated republican government held nonjusticiable); Highland Farms Dairy v. Agnew, 300 U. S. 608 (claim that delegation to agency of power to control milk prices violated republican government, rejected).\n\nJust as the Court has consistently held that a challenge to state action based on the Guaranty Clause presents no justiciable question so has it held, and for the same reasons, that challenges to congressional action on the ground of inconsistency with that clause present no justiciable question. In Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, the State sought by an original bill to enjoin execution of the Reconstruction Acts, claiming that it already possessed \"A republican State, in every political, legal, constitutional, and juridical sense,\" and that enforcement of the new Acts \"Instead of keeping the guaranty against a forcible overthrow of its government by foreign invaders or domestic insurgents, . . . is destroying that very government by force.\"[50] Congress had clearly refused to *225 recognize the republican character of the government of the suing State.[51] It seemed to the Court that the only constitutional claim that could be presented was under the Guaranty Clause, and Congress having determined that the effects of the recent hostilities required extraordinary measures to restore governments of a republican form, this Court refused to interfere with Congress' action at the behest of a claimant relying on that very guaranty.[52]\n\nIn only a few other cases has the Court considered Art. IV,  4, in relation to congressional action. It has refused to pass on a claim relying on the Guaranty Clause to establish that Congress lacked power to allow the States to employ the referendum in passing on legislation redistricting for congressional seats. Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, supra. And it has pointed out that Congress is not required to establish republican government in the territories before they become States, and before they have attained a sufficient population to warrant a *226 popularly elected legislature. Downes v. Bidwell, 182 U. S. 244, 278-279 (dictum).[53]\n\nWe come, finally, to the ultimate inquiry whether our precedents as to what constitutes a nonjusticiable \"political question\" bring the case before us under the umbrella of that doctrine. A natural beginning is to note whether any of the common characteristics which we have been able to identify and label descriptively are present. We find none: The question here is the consistency of state action with the Federal Constitution. We have no question decided, or to be decided, by a political branch of government coequal with this Court. Nor do we risk embarrassment of our government abroad, or grave disturbance at home[54] if we take issue with Tennessee as to the constitutionality of her action here challenged. Nor need the appellants, in order to succeed in this action, ask the Court to enter upon policy determinations for which judicially manageable standards are lacking. Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar, and it has been open to courts since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to determine, if on the particular facts they must, that a discrimination reflects no policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.\n\nThis case does, in one sense, involve the allocation of political power within a State, and the appellants *227 might conceivably have added a claim under the Guaranty Clause. Of course, as we have seen, any reliance on that clause would be futile. But because any reliance on the Guaranty Clause could not have succeeded it does not follow that appellants may not be heard on the equal protection claim which in fact they tender. True, it must be clear that the Fourteenth Amendment claim is not so enmeshed with those political question elements which render Guaranty Clause claims nonjusticiable as actually to present a political question itself. But we have found that not to be the case here.\n\nIn this connection special attention is due Pacific States Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118. In that case a corporation tax statute enacted by the initiative was attacked ostensibly on three grounds: (1) due process; (2) equal protection; and (3) the Guaranty Clause. But it was clear that the first two grounds were invoked solely in aid of the contention that the tax was invalid by reason of its passage:\"The defendant company does not contend here that it could not have been required to pay a license tax. It does not assert that it was denied an opportunity to be heard as to the amount for which it was taxed, or that there was anything inhering in the tax or involved intrinsically in the law which violated any of its constitutional rights. If such questions had been raised they would have been justiciable, and therefore would have required the calling into operation of judicial power. Instead, however, of doing any of these things, the attack on the statute here made is of a wholly different character. Its essentially political nature is at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which the contention here advanced makes it [sic] not on the tax as a tax, but on the State as a State. It is addressed to the *228 framework and political character of the government by which the statute levying the tax was passed. It is the government, the political entity, which (reducing the case to its essence) is called to the bar of this court, not for the purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power assailed, on the ground that its exertion has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation, but to demand of the State that it establish its right to exist as a State, republican in form.\" 223 U. S., at 150-151.The due process and equal protection claims were held nonjusticiable in Pacific States not because they happened to be joined with a Guaranty Clause claim, or because they sought to place before the Court a subject matter which might conceivably have been dealt with through the Guaranty Clause, but because the Court believed that they were invoked merely in verbal aid of the resolution of issues which, in its view, entailed political questions. Pacific States may be compared with cases such as Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219, wherein the Court refused to consider whether a workmen's compensation act violated the Guaranty Clause but considered at length, and rejected, due process and equal protection arguments advanced against it; and O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U. S. 244, wherein the Court refused to consider whether Nebraska's delegation of power to form drainage districts violated the Guaranty Clause, but went on to consider and reject the contention that the action against which an injunction was sought was not a taking for a public purpose.\n\nWe conclude then that the nonjusticiability of claims resting on the Guaranty Clause which arises from their embodiment of questions that were thought \"political,\" can have no bearing upon the justiciability of the equal protection claim presented in this case. Finally, we *229 emphasize that it is the involvement in Guaranty Clause claims of the elements thought to define \"political questions,\" and no other feature, which could render them nonjusticiable. Specifically, we have said that such claims are not held nonjusticiable because they touch matters of state governmental organization. Brief examination of a few cases demonstrates this.\n\nWhen challenges to state action respecting matters of \"the administration of the affairs of the State and the officers through whom they are conducted\"[55] have rested on claims of constitutional deprivation which are amenable to judicial correction, this Court has acted upon its view of the merits of the claim. For example, in Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U. S. 135, we reversed the Nebraska Supreme Court's decision that Nebraska's Governor was not a citizen of the United States or of the State and therefore could not continue in office. In Kennard v. Louisiana ex rel. Morgan, 92 U. S. 480, and Foster v. Kansas ex rel. Johnston, 112 U. S. 201, we considered whether persons had been removed from public office by procedures consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment's due process guaranty, and held on the merits that they had. And only last Term, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, we applied the Fifteenth Amendment to strike down a redrafting of municipal boundaries which effected a discriminatory impairment of voting rights, in the face of what a majority of the Court of Appeals thought to be a sweeping commitment to state legislatures of the power to draw and redraw such boundaries.[56]\nGomillion was brought by a Negro who had been a resident of the City of Tuskegee, Alabama, until the municipal boundaries were so recast by the State Legislature *230 as to exclude practically all Negroes. The plaintiff claimed deprivation of the right to vote in municipal elections. The District Court's dismissal for want of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. This Court unanimously reversed. This Court's answer to the argument that States enjoyed unrestricted control over municipal boundaries was:\"Legislative control of municipalities, no less than other state power, lies within the scope of relevant limitations imposed by the United States Constitution.. . . The opposite conclusion, urged upon us by respondents, would sanction the achievement by a State of any impairment of voting rights whatever so long as it was cloaked in the garb of the realignment of political subdivisions. `It is inconceivable that guaranties embedded in the Constitution of the United States may thus be manipulated out of existence.' \" 364 U. S., at 344-345.To a second argument, that Colegrove v. Green, supra, was a barrier to hearing the merits of the case, the Court responded that Gomillion was lifted \"out of the so-called `political' arena and into the conventional sphere of constitutional litigation\" because here was discriminatory treatment of a racial minority violating the Fifteenth Amendment.\"A statute which is alleged to have worked unconstitutional deprivations of petitioners' rights is not immune to attack simply because the mechanism employed by the legislature is a redefinition of municipal boundaries. . . . While in form this is merely an act redefining metes and bounds, if the allegations are established, the inescapable human effect of this essay in geometry and geography is to despoil colored citizens, and only colored citizens, of *231 their theretofore enjoyed voting rights. That was not Colegrove v. Green.\"When a State exercises power wholly within the domain of state interest, it is insulated from federal judicial review. But such insulation is not carried over when state power is used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected right.\" 364 U. S., at 347.[57]We have not overlooked such cases as In re Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200, and Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U. S. 487, which held that federal equity power could not be exercised to enjoin a state proceeding to remove a public officer. But these decisions explicitly reflect only a traditional limit upon equity jurisdiction, and not upon federal courts' power to inquire into matters of state governmental organization. This is clear not only from the opinions in those cases, but also from White v. Berry, 171 U. S. 366, which, relying on Sawyer, withheld federal equity from staying removal of a federal officer. Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586, simply dismissed an appeal from an unsuccessful suit to upset a State's removal procedure, on the ground that the constitutional claim presentedthat a jury trial was necessary if the removal procedure was to comport with due process requirementswas frivolous. Finally, in Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U. S. 548, where losing candidates attacked the constitutionality of Kentucky's resolution of a contested gubernatorial election, the Court refused to consider the merits of a claim posited upon *232 the Guaranty Clause, holding it presented a political question, but also held on the merits that the ousted candidates had suffered no deprivation of property without due process of law.[58]\n\nSince, as has been established, the equal protection claim tendered in this case does not require decision of any political question, and since the presence of a matter affecting state government does not render the case nonjusticiable, it seems appropriate to examine again the reasoning by which the District Court reached its conclusion that the case was nonjusticiable.\n\nWe have already noted that the District Court's holding that the subject matter of this complaint was nonjusticiable relied upon Colegrove v. Green, supra, and later cases. Some of those concerned the choice of members of a state legislature, as in this case; others, like Colegrove itself and earlier precedents, Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U. S. 375, and Carroll v. Becker, 285 U. S. 380, concerned the choice of Representatives in the Federal Congress. Smiley, Koenig and Carroll settled the issue in favor of justiciability of questions of congressional redistricting. The Court followed these precedents in Colegrove although over the dissent of three of the seven Justices who participated in that decision. On the issue of justiciability, all four Justices comprising a majority relied upon Smiley v. Holm, but in two opinions, one for three Justices, 328 U. S., at 566, 568, and a separate one by Mr. Justice Rutledge, 328 U. S., at 564. The argument that congressional redistricting problems presented a \"political question\" the resolution of which was confided to Congress might have been rested upon Art. I,  4, Art. I,  5, Art. I,  2, and Amendment *233 XIV,  2. Mr. Justice Rutledge said: \"But for the ruling in Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, I should have supposed that the provisions of the Constitution, Art. I,  4, that \"The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for . . . Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations . . .'; Art. I,  2 [but see Amendment XIV,  2], vesting in Congress the duty of apportionment of representatives among the several states `according to their respective Numbers'; and Art. I,  5, making each House the sole judge of the qualifications of its own members, would remove the issues in this case from justiciable cognizance. But, in my judgment, the Smiley case rules squarely to the contrary, save only in the matter of degree. . . . Assuming that that decision is to stand, I think . . . that its effect is to rule that this Court has power to afford relief in a case of this type as against the objection that the issues are not justiciable.\" 328 U. S., at 564-565. Accordingly, Mr. Justice Rutledge joined in the conclusion that the case was justiciable, although he held that the dismissal of the complaint should be affirmed. His view was that \"The shortness of the time remaining [before forthcoming elections] makes it doubtful whether action could, or would, be taken in time to secure for petitioners the effective relief they seek. . . . I think, therefore, the case is one in which the Court may properly, and should, decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the judgment should be affirmed and I join in that disposition of the cause.\" 328 U. S., at 565-566.[59]\n*234 Article I,  2, 4, and 5, and Amendment XIV,  2, relate only to congressional elections and obviously do not govern apportionment of state legislatures. However, our decisions in favor of justiciability even in light of those provisions plainly afford no support for the District Court's conclusion that the subject matter of this controversy presents a political question. Indeed, the refusal to award relief in Colegrove resulted only from the controlling view of a want of equity. Nor is anything contrary to be found in those per curiams that came after Colegrove. This Court dismissed the appeals in Cook v. Fortson and Turman v. Duckworth, 329 U. S. 675, as moot. MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, held only that in that case equity would not act to void the State's requirement that there be at least a minimum of support for nominees *235 for state-wide office, over at least a minimal area of the State. Problems of timing were critical in Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916, dismissing for want of a substantial federal question a three-judge court's dismissal of the suit as prematurely brought, 102 F. Supp. 708; and in Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U. S. 916, denying mandamus sought to compel the convening of a three-judge court movants urged the Court to advance consideration of their case, \"Inasmuch as the mere lapse of time before this case can be reached in the normal course of . . . business may defeat the cause, and inasmuch as the time problem is due to the inherent nature of the case . . . .\" South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, like Colegrove appears to be a refusal to exercise equity's powers; see the statement of the holding, quoted, supra, p. 203. And Cox v. Peters, 342 U. S. 936, dismissed for want of a substantial federal question the appeal from the state court's holding that their primary elections implicated no \"state action.\" See 208 Ga. 498, 67 S. E. 2d 579. But compare Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461.\n\nTedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940, indicates solely that no substantial federal question was raised by a state court's refusal to upset the districting of city council seats, especially as it was urged that there was a rational justification for the challenged districting. See 43 So. 2d 514. Similarly, in Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912, it was certain only that the state court had refused to issue a discretionary writ, original mandamus in the Supreme Court. That had been denied without opinion, and of course it was urged here that an adequate state ground barred this Court's review. And in Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40, the Supreme Court of Tennessee held that it could not invalidate the very statute at issue in the case at bar, but its holding rested on its state law of remedies, i. e., the state view of *236 de facto officers,[60] and not on any view that the norm for legislative apportionment in Tennessee is not numbers of qualified voters resident in the several counties. Of course this Court was there precluded by the adequate state ground, and in dismissing the appeal, 352 U. S. 920, we cited Anderson, supra, as well as Colegrove. Nor does the Tennessee court's decision in that case bear upon this, for just as in Smith v. Holm, 220 Minn. 486, 19 N. W. 2d 914, and Magraw v. Donovan, 163 F. Supp. 184, 177 F. Supp. 803, a state court's inability to grant relief does not bar a federal court's assuming jurisdiction to inquire into alleged deprivation of federal constitutional rights. Problems of relief also controlled in Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991, affirming the District Court's refusal to mandamus the Governor to call a session of the legislature, to mandamus the legislature then to apportion, and if they did not comply, to mandamus the State Supreme Court to do so. And Matthews v. Handley, 361 U. S. 127, affirmed a refusal to strike down the State's gross income tax statuteurged on the ground that the legislature was malapportionedthat had rested on the adequacy of available state legal remedies for suits involving that tax, including challenges to its constitutionality. Lastly, Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804, in which Mr. Justice Rutledge concurred in this Court's refusal to note the appeal from a dismissal for want of equity, is sufficiently explained by his statement in Cook v. Fortson, supra: \"The discretionary exercise or nonexercise of equitable or declaratory judgment jurisdiction. . . in one case is not precedent in another case *237 where the facts differ.\" 329 U. S., at 678, n. 8. (Citations omitted.)\n\nWe conclude that the complaint's allegations of a denial of equal protection present a justiciable constitutional cause of action upon which appellants are entitled to a trial and a decision. The right asserted is within the reach of judicial protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nThe judgment of the District Court is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\nMR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER did not participate in the decision of this case.MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.While I join the opinion of the Court and, like the Court, do not reach the merits, a word of explanation is necessary.[1] I put to one side the problems of \"political\" *242 questions involving the distribution of power between this Court, the Congress, and the Chief Executive. We have here a phase of the recurring problem of the relation of the federal courts to state agencies. More particularly, the question is the extent to which a State may weight one person's vote more heavily than it does another's.\n\nSo far as voting rights are concerned, there are large gaps in the Constitution. Yet the right to vote is inherent in the republican form of government envisaged by Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution. The House and now the Senateare chosen by the people. The time, manner, and place of elections of Senators and Representatives are left to the States (Article I, Section 4, Clause 1; Amendment XVII) subject to the regulatory power of Congress. A \"republican form\" of government is guaranteed each State by Article IV, Section 4, and each is likewise promised protection against invasion.[2]Ibid. *243 That the States may specify the qualifications for voters is implicit in Article I, Section 2, Clause 1, which provides that the House of Representatives shall be chosen by the *244 people and that \"the Electors (voters) in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors (voters) of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.\" The same provision, contained in the Seventeenth Amendment, governs the election of Senators. Within limits those qualifications may be fixed by state law. See Lassiter v. Northampton Election Board, 360 U. S. 45, 50-51. Yet, as stated in Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651, 663-664, those who vote for members of Congress do not \"owe their right to vote to the State law in any sense which makes the exercise of the right to depend exclusively on the law of the State.\" The power of Congress to prescribe the qualifications for voters and thus override state law is not in issue here. It is, however, clear that by reason of the commands of the Constitution there are several qualifications that a State may not require.\n\nRace, color, or previous condition of servitude is an impermissible standard by reason of the Fifteenth Amendment, and that alone is sufficient to explain Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339. See Taper, Gomillion versus Lightfoot (1962), pp. 12-17.\n\nSex is another impermissible standard by reason of the Nineteenth Amendment.\n\nThere is a third barrier to a State's freedom in prescribing qualifications of voters and that is the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the provision invoked here. And so the question is, may a State weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another?\n\nThe traditional test under the Equal Protection Clause has been whether a State has made \"an invidious discrimination,\" as it does when it selects \"a particular race or nationality for oppressive treatment.\" See Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U. S. 535, 541. Universal equality is not *245 the test; there is room for weighting. As we stated in Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 489, \"The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.\"\n\nI agree with my Brother CLARK that if the allegations in the complaint can be sustained a case for relief is established. We are told that a single vote in Moore County, Tennessee, is worth 19 votes in Hamilton County, that one vote in Stewart or in Chester County is worth nearly eight times a single vote in Shelby or Knox County. The opportunity to prove that an \"invidious discrimination\" exists should therefore be given the appellants.\n\nIt is said that any decision in cases of this kind is beyond the competence of courts. Some make the same point as regards the problem of equal protection in cases involving racial segregation. Yet the legality of claims and conduct is a traditional subject for judicial determination. Adjudication is often perplexing and complicated. An example of the extreme complexity of the task can be seen in a decree apportioning water among the several States. Nebraska v. Wyoming, 325 U. S. 589, 665. The constitutional guide is often vague, as the decisions under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses show. The problem under the Equal Protection Clause is no more intricate. See Lewis, Legislative Apportionment and the Federal Courts, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 1057, 1083-1084.\n\nThere are, of course, some questions beyond judicial competence. Where the performance of a \"duty\" is left to the discretion and good judgment of an executive officer, the judiciary will not compel the exercise of his discretion one way or the other (Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 109), for to do so would be to take over the office. Cf. Federal Communications Comm'n v. Broadcasting Co., 309 U. S. 134, 145.\n\n*246 Where the Constitution assigns a particular function wholly and indivisibly[3] to another department, the federal judiciary does not intervene. Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U. S. 297, 302. None of those cases is relevant here.\n\n*247 There is no doubt that the federal courts have jurisdiction of controversies concerning voting rights. The Civil Rights Act gives them authority to redress the deprivation \"under color of any State law\" of any \"right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens . . . .\" 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3). And 28 U. S. C.  1343 (4) gives the federal courts authority to award damages or issue an injunction to redress the violation of \"any Act of Congress providing for the protection of civil rights, including the right to vote.\" (Italics added.) The element of state action covers a wide range. For as stated in United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 326:\"Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is clothed with the authority of state law, is action taken `under color of' state law.\" And see Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167.The right to vote in both federal and state elections was protected by the judiciary long before that right received the explicit protection it is now accorded by  1343 (4). Discrimination against a voter on account of race has been penalized (Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651) or struck down. Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649; Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461. Fraudulent acts that dilute the votes of some *248 have long been held to be within judicial cognizance. Ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S. 371. The \"right to have one's vote counted\" whatever his race or nationality or creed was held in United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383, 386, to be \"as open to protection by Congress as the right to put a ballot in a box.\" See also United States v. Classic, supra, 324-325; United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S. 385.\n\nChief Justice Holt stated in Ashby v. White, 2 Ld. Raym. 938, 956 (a suit in which damages were awarded against election officials for not accepting the plaintiff's vote, 3 Ld. Raym. 320) that:\"To allow this action will make publick officers more careful to observe the constitution of cities and boroughs, and not to be so partial as they commonly are in all elections, which is indeed a great and growing mischief, and tends to the prejudice of the peace of the nation.\"The same prophylactic effect will be produced here, as entrenched political regimes make other relief as illusory in this case as a petition to Parliament in Ashby v. White would have been.[4]\n*249 Intrusion of the Federal Government into the election machinery of the States has taken numerous formsinvestigations (Hannah v. Larche, 363 U. S. 420); criminal proceedings (Ex parte Siebold, supra; Ex parte Yarbrough, supra; United States v. Mosley, supra; United States v. Classic, supra); collection of penalties (Smith v. Allwright, supra); suits for declaratory relief and for an injunction (Terry v. Adams, supra); suits by the United States under the Civil Rights Act to enjoin discriminatory practices. United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17.\n\nAs stated by Judge McLaughlin in Dyer v. Kazuhisa Abe, 138 F. Supp. 220, 236 (an apportionment case in Hawaii which was reversed and dismissed as moot, 256 F. 2d 728):\"The whole thrust of today's legal climate is to end unconstitutional discrimination. It is ludicrous to preclude judicial relief when a mainspring of representative government is impaired. Legislators have no immunity from the Constitution. The legislatures of our land should be made as responsive to the Constitution of the United States as are the citizens who elect the legislators.\"With the exceptions of Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549; MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281; South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, and the decisions they spawned, the Court has never thought that protection of voting rights *250 was beyond judicial cognizance. Today's treatment of those cases removes the only impediment to judicial cognizance of the claims stated in the present complaint.\n\nThe justiciability of the present claims being established, any relief accorded can be fashioned in the light of well-known principles of equity.[5]\n*251MR. JUSTICE CLARK, concurring.One emerging from the rash of opinions with their accompanying clashing of views may well find himself suffering a mental blindness. The Court holds that the appellants have alleged a cause of action. However, it refuses to award relief herealthough the facts are undisputed and fails to give the District Court any guidance whatever. One dissenting opinion, bursting with words that go through so much and conclude with so little, contemns the majority action as \"a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past.\" Another describes the complaint as merely asserting conclusory allegations that Tennessee's apportionment is \"incorrect,\" \"arbitrary,\" \"obsolete,\" and \"unconstitutional.\" I believe it can be shown that this case is distinguishable from earlier cases dealing with the distribution of political power by a State, that a patent violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution has been shown, and that an appropriate remedy may be formulated.I.I take the law of the case from MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281 (1948), which involved an attack under the Equal Protection Clause upon an Illinois election statute. The Court decided that case on its merits without hindrance from the \"political question\" doctrine. Although the statute under attack was upheld, it is clear *252 that the Court based its decision upon the determination that the statute represented a rational state policy. It stated:\"It would be strange indeed, and doctrinaire, for this Court, applying such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws, to deny a State the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former.\" Id., at 284. (Emphasis supplied.)The other cases upon which my Brethren dwell are all distinguishable or inapposite. The widely heralded case of Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549 (1946), was one not only in which the Court was bobtailed but in which there was no majority opinion. Indeed, even the \"political question\" point in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion was no more than an alternative ground.[1] Moreover, the appellants did not present an equal protection argument.[2] While it has served as a Mother Hubbard to most of the subsequent cases, I feel it was in that respect illcast and for all of these reasons put it to one side.[3] Likewise, *253 I do not consider the Guaranty Clause cases based on Art. I,  4, of the Constitution, because it is not invoked here and it involves different criteria, as the Court's opinion indicates. Cases resting on various other considerations not present here, such as Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991 (1957) (lack of equity); Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920 (1956) (adequate state grounds supporting the state judgment); Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912 (1952) (adequate state grounds); Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916 (1952) (failure to exhaust state procedures), are of course not controlling. Finally, the Georgia county-unit-system cases, such as South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276 (1950), reflect the viewpoint of MacDougall, i. e., to refrain from intervening where there is some rational policy behind the State's system.[4]II.The controlling facts cannot be disputed. It appears from the record that 37% of the voters of Tennessee elect 20 of the 33 Senators while 40% of the voters elect 63 of the 99 members of the House. But this might not on its face be an \"invidious discrimination,\" Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, 348 U. S. 483, 489 (1955), for a \"statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.\" McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 426 (1961).\n\nIt is true that the apportionment policy incorporated in Tennessee's Constitution, i. e., state-wide numerical equality of representation with certain minor qualifications,[5] is a rational one. On a county-by-county comparison *254 a districting plan based thereon naturally will have disparities in representation due to the qualifications. But this to my mind does not raise constitutional problems, for the overall policy is reasonable. However, the root of the trouble is not in Tennessee's Constitution, for admittedly its policy has not been followed. The discrimination lies in the action of Tennessee's Assembly in allocating legislative seats to counties or districts created by it. Try as one may, Tennessee's apportionment just cannot be made to fit the pattern cut by its Constitution. This was the finding of the District Court. The policy of the Constitution referred to by the dissenters, therefore, is of no relevance here. We must examine what the Assembly has done.[6] The frequency and magnitude of the inequalities in the present districting admit of no policy whatever. An examination of Table I accompanying this opinion, post, p. 262, conclusively reveals that the apportionment picture in Tennessee is a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions. This is not to say that some of the disparity cannot be explained, but when the entire table is examinedcomparing the voting strength of counties of like population as well as contrasting that of the smaller with the larger countiesit leaves but one conclusion, namely that Tennessee's apportionment is a crazy quilt without rational basis. At the risk of being accused of picking out a few of the horribles I shall allude to a series of examples that are taken from Table I.\n\nAs is admitted, there is a wide disparity of voting strength between the large and small counties. Some *255 samples are: Moore County has a total representation of two[7] with a population (2,340) of only one-eleventh of Rutherford County (25,316) with the same representation; Decatur County (5,563) has the same representation as Carter (23,303) though the latter has four times the population; likewise, Loudon County (13,264), Houston (3,084), and Anderson County (33,990) have the same representation, i. e., 1.25 each. But it is said that in this illustration all of the under-represented counties contain municipalities of over 10,000 population and they therefore should be included under the \"urban\" classification, rationalizing this disparity as an attempt to effect a rural-urban political balance. But in so doing one is caught up in the backlash of his own bull whip, for many counties have municipalities with a population exceeding 10,000, yet the same invidious discrimination is present. For example:CountyPopulationRepresentationCarter23,3031.10Maury24,5562.25Washington36,9671.93Madison37,2453.50*256\n\nLikewise, counties with no municipality of over 10,000 suffer a similar discrimination:CountyPopulationRepresentationGrundy6,5400.95Chester6,3912.00Cumberland9,5930.63Crockett9,6762.00Loudon13,2641.25Fayette13,5772.50This could not be an effort to attain political balance between rural and urban populations. Since discrimination is present among counties of like population, the plan is neither consistent nor rational. It discriminates horizontally creating gross disparities between rural areas themselves as well as between urban areas themselves,[8] still maintaining the wide vertical disparity already pointed out between rural and urban.\n\nIt is also insisted that the representation formula used above (see n. 7) is \"patently deficient\" because \"it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district.\" This is a strange claim coming from those who rely on the proposition that \"the voice of every voter\" need not have \"approximate equality.\" Indeed, representative government, as they say, is not necessarily one of \"bare numbers.\" The use of floterial districts in our political system is not ordinarily based on the theory that the floterial representative is splintered among the counties of his district per relative population. His function is to represent the whole district. However, I shall meet the charge on its own ground and by use of its \"adjusted *257 `total representation' \" formula show that the present apportionment is loco. For example, compare some \"urban\" areas of like population, using the HARLAN formula:CountyPopulationRepresentationWashington36,9672.65Madison37,2454.87Carter23,3031.48Greene23,6492.05Maury24,5563.81Coffee13,4062.32Hamblen14,0901.07And now, using the same formula, compare some so-called \"rural\" areas of like population:CountyPopulationRepresentation>Moore2,3401.23Pickett2,5650.22Stewart5,2381.60Cheatham5,2630.74Chester6,3911.36Grundy6,5400.69Smith8,7312.04Unicoi8,7870.40And for counties with similar representation but with gross differences in population, take:CountyPopulationRepresentationSullivan55,7124.07Maury24,5563.81Blount30,3532.12Coffee13,4062.32These cannot be \"distorted effects,\" for here the same formula proposed by the dissenters is used and the result is even \"a crazier\" quilt.\n\n*258 The truth is thatalthough this case has been here for two years and has had over six hours' argument (three times the ordinary case) and has been most carefully considered over and over again by us in Conference and individuallyno one, not even the State nor the dissenters, has come up with any rational basis for Tennessee's apportionment statute.\n\nNo oneexcept the dissenters advocating the HARLAN \"adjusted `total representation' \" formulacontends that mathematical equality among voters is required by the Equal Protection Clause. But certainly there must be some rational design to a State's districting. The discrimination here does not fit any patternas I have said, it is but a crazy quilt. My Brother HARLAN contends that other proposed apportionment plans contain disparities. Instead of chasing those rabbits he should first pause long enough to meet appellants' proof of discrimination by showing that in fact the present plan follows a rational policy. Not being able to do this, he merely counters with such generalities as \"classic legislative judgment,\" no \"significant discrepancy,\" and \"de minimis departures.\" I submit that even a casual glance at the present apportionment picture shows these conclusions to be entirely fanciful. If present representation has a policy at all, it is to maintain the status quo of invidious discrimination at any cost. Like the District Court, I conclude that appellants have met the burden of showing \"Tennessee is guilty of a clear violation of the state constitution and of the [federal] rights of the plaintiffs. . . .\"III.Although I find the Tennessee apportionment statute offends the Equal Protection Clause, I would not consider intervention by this Court into so delicate a field if there were any other relief available to the people of Tennessee. But the majority of the people of Tennessee have no *259 \"practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls\" to correct the existing \"invidious discrimination.\" Tennessee has no initiative and referendum. I have searched diligently for other \"practical opportunities\" present under the law. I find none other than through the federal courts. The majority of the voters have been caught up in a legislative strait jacket. Tennessee has an \"informed, civically militant electorate\" and \"an aroused popular conscience,\" but it does not sear \"the conscience of the people's representatives.\" This is because the legislative policy has riveted the present seats in the Assembly to their respective constituencies, and by the votes of their incumbents a reapportionment of any kind is prevented. The people have been rebuffed at the hands of the Assembly; they have tried the constitutional convention route, but since the call must originate in the Assembly it, too, has been fruitless. They have tried Tennessee courts with the same result,[9] and Governors have fought the tide only to flounder. It is said that there is recourse in Congress and perhaps that may be, but from a practical standpoint this is without substance. To date Congress has never undertaken such a task in any State. We therefore must conclude that the people of Tennessee are stymied and without judicial intervention will be saddled with the present discrimination in the affairs of their state government.IV.Finally, we must consider if there are any appropriate modes of effective judicial relief. The federal courts are of course not forums for political debate, nor should they *260 resolve themselves into state constitutional convention or legislative assemblies. Nor should their jurisdiction be exercised in the hope that such a declaration as is made today may have the direct effect of bringing on legislative action and relieving the courts of the problem of fashioning relief. To my mind this would be nothing less than blackjacking the Assembly into reapportioning the State. If judicial competence were lacking to fashion an effective decree, I would dismiss this appeal. However, like the Solicitor General of the United States, I see no such difficulty in the position of this case. One plan might be to start with the existing assembly districts, consolidate some of them, and award the seats thus released to those counties suffering the most egregious discrimination. Other possibilities are present and might be more effective. But the plan here suggested would at least release the strangle hold now on the Assembly and permit it to redistrict itself.\n\nIn this regard the appellants have proposed a plan based on the rationale of state-wide equal representation. Not believing that numerical equality of representation throughout a State is constitutionally required, I would not apply such a standard albeit a permissive one. Nevertheless, the dissenters attack it by the application of the HARLAN \"adjusted `total representation' \" formula. The result is that some isolated inequalities are shown, but this in itself does not make the proposed plan irrational or place it in the \"crazy quilt\" category. Such inequalities, as the dissenters point out in attempting to support the present apportionment as rational, are explainable. Moreover, there is no requirement that any plan have mathematical exactness in its application. Only where, as here, the total picture reveals incommensurables of both magnitude and frequency can it be said that there is present an invidious discrimination.\n\n*261 In view of the detailed study that the Court has given this problem, it is unfortunate that a decision is not reached on the merits. The majority appears to hold, at least sub silentio, that an invidious discrimination is present, but it remands to the three-judge court for it to make what is certain to be that formal determination. It is true that Tennessee has not filed a formal answer. However, it has filed voluminous papers and made extended arguments supporting its position. At no time has it been able to contradict the appellants' factual claims; it has offered no rational explanation for the present apportionment; indeed, it has indicated that there are none known to it. As I have emphasized, the case proceeded to the point before the three-judge court that it was able to find an invidious discrimination factually present, and the State has not contested that holding here. In view of all this background I doubt if anything more can be offered or will be gained by the State on remand, other than time. Nevertheless, not being able to muster a court to dispose of the case on the merits, I concur in the opinion of the majority and acquiesce in the decision to remand. However, in fairness I do think that Tennessee is entitled to have my idea of what it faces on the record before us and the trial court some light as to how it might proceed.\n\nAs John Rutledge (later Chief Justice) said 175 years ago in the course of the Constitutional Convention, a chief function of the Court is to secure the national rights.[10] Its decision today supports the proposition for which our forebears fought and many died, namely, that to be fully conformable to the principle of right, the form of government must be representative.[11] That is the keystone upon which our government was founded *262 and lacking which no republic can survive. It is well for this Court to practice self-restraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication, but never in its history have those principles received sanction where the national rights of so many have been so clearly infringed for so long a time. National respect for the courts is more enhanced through the forthright enforcement of those rights rather than by rendering them nugatory through the interposition of subterfuges. In my view the ultimate decision today is in the greatest tradition of this Court.\n\nTABLE 1County>1950 Voting PopulationPresent total representation using J.

JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.The separate writings of my dissenting and concurring Brothers stray so far from the subject of today's decision as to convey, I think, a distressingly inaccurate impression of what the Court decides. For that reason, I think it appropriate, in joining the opinion of the Court, to emphasize in a few words what the opinion does and does not say.\n\nThe Court today decides three things and no more: \"(a) that the court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (b) that a justiciable cause of action is stated upon which appellants would be entitled to appropriate relief; and (c) . . . that the appellants have standing to challenge the Tennessee apportionment statutes.\" Ante, pp. 197-198.\n\nThe complaint in this case asserts that Tennessee's system of apportionment is utterly arbitrarywithout any possible justification in rationality. The District Court did not reach the merits of that claim, and this Court quite properly expresses no view on the subject. Contrary to the suggestion of my Brother HARLAN, the Court does not say or imply that \"state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter.\" Post, p. 332. The Court does not say or imply that there is anything in the Federal Constitution \"to prevent a State, acting not irrationally, from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests, temper, and customs of its people.\" Post, p. 334. And contrary to the suggestion of my Brother DOUGLAS, the Court most assuredly does not decide the question, \"may a State weight the vote of one county or one district more heavily than it weights the vote in another?\" Ante, p. 244.\n\nIn MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, the Court held that the Equal Protection Clause does not \"deny a State the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative *266 as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting their political weight at the polls not available to the former.\" 335 U. S., at 284. In case after case arising under the Equal Protection Clause the Court has said what it said again only last Termthat \"the Fourteenth Amendment permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others.\" McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425. In case after case arising under that Clause we have also said that \"the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it.\" Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 584.\n\nToday's decision does not turn its back on these settled precedents. I repeat, the Court today decides only: (1) that the District Court possessed jurisdiction of the subject matter; (2) that the complaint presents a justiciable controversy; (3) that the appellants have standing. My Brother CLARK has made a convincing prima facie showing that Tennessee's system of apportionment is in fact utterly arbitrarywithout any possible justification in rationality. My Brother HARLAN has, with imagination and ingenuity, hypothesized possibly rational bases for Tennessee's system. But the merits of this case are not before us now. The defendants have not yet had an opportunity to be heard in defense of the State's system of apportionment; indeed, they have not yet even filed an answer to the complaint. As in other cases, the proper place for the trial is in the trial court, not here.MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, whom MR. JUSTICE HARLAN joins, dissenting.The Court today reverses a uniform course of decision established by a dozen cases, including one by which the very claim now sustained was unanimously rejected *267 only five years ago. The impressive body of rulings thus cast aside reflected the equally uniform course of our political history regarding the relationship between population and legislative representationa wholly different matter from denial of the franchise to individuals because of race, color, religion or sex. Such a massive repudiation of the experience of our whole past in asserting destructively novel judicial power demands a detailed analysis of the role of this Court in our constitutional scheme. Disregard of inherent limits in the effective exercise of the Court's \"judicial Power\" not only presages the futility of judicial intervention in the essentially political conflict of forces by which the relation between population and representation has time out of mind been and now is determined. It may well impair the Court's position as the ultimate organ of \"the supreme Law of the Land\" in that vast range of legal problems, often strongly entangled in popular feeling, on which this Court must pronounce. The Court's authoritypossessed of neither the purse nor the swordultimately rests on sustained public confidence in its moral sanction. Such feeling must be nourished by the Court's complete detachment, in fact and in appearance, from political entanglements and by abstention from injecting itself into the clash of political forces in political settlements.\n\nA hypothetical claim resting on abstract assumptions is now for the first time made the basis for affording illusory relief for a particular evil even though it foreshadows deeper and more pervasive difficulties in consequence. The claim is hypothetical and the assumptions are abstract because the Court does not vouchsafe the lower courtsstate and federalguidelines for formulating specific, definite, wholly unprecedented remedies for the inevitable litigations that today's umbrageous disposition is bound to stimulate in connection with politically motivated reapportionments in so many States. In *268 such a setting, to promulgate jurisdiction in the abstract is meaningless. It is as devoid of reality as \"a brooding omnipresence in the sky,\" for it conveys no intimation what relief, if any, a District Court is capable of affording that would not invite legislatures to play ducks and drakes with the judiciary. For this Court to direct the District Court to enforce a claim to which the Court has over the years consistently found itself required to deny legal enforcement and at the same time to find it necessary to withhold any guidance to the lower court how to enforce this turnabout, new legal claim, manifests an odd indeed an esotericconception of judicial propriety. One of the Court's supporting opinions, as elucidated by commentary, unwittingly affords a disheartening preview of the mathematical quagmire (apart from divers judicially inappropriate and elusive determinants) into which this Court today catapults the lower courts of the country without so much as adumbrating the basis for a legal calculus as a means of extrication. Even assuming the indispensable intellectual disinterestedness on the part of judges in such matters, they do not have accepted legal standards or criteria or even reliable analogies to draw upon for making judicial judgments. To charge courts with the task of accommodating the incommensurable factors of policy that underlie these mathematical puzzles is to attribute, however flatteringly, omnicompetence to judges. The Framers of the Constitution persistently rejected a proposal that embodied this assumption and Thomas Jefferson never entertained it.\n\nRecent legislation, creating a district appropriately described as \"an atrocity of ingenuity,\" is not unique. Considering the gross inequality among legislative electoral units within almost every State, the Court naturally shrinks from asserting that in districting at least substantial equality is a constitutional requirement enforceable *269 by courts.[*] Room continues to be allowed for weighting. This of course implies that geography, economics, urban-rural conflict, and all the other non-legal factors which have throughout our history entered into political districting are to some extent not to be ruled out in the undefined vista now opened up by review in the federal courts of state reapportionments. To some extentaye, there's the rub. In effect, today's decision empowers the courts of the country to devise what should constitute the proper composition of the legislatures of the fifty States. If state courts should for one reason or another find themselves unable to discharge this task, the duty of doing so is put on the federal courts or on this Court, if State views do not satisfy this Court's notion of what is proper districting.\n\nWe were soothingly told at the bar of this Court that we need not worry about the kind of remedy a court could effectively fashion once the abstract constitutional right to have courts pass on a state-wide system of electoral districting is recognized as a matter of judicial rhetoric, because legislatures would heed the Court's admonition. This is not only a euphoric hope. It implies a sorry *270 confession of judicial impotence in place of a frank acknowledgement that there is not under our Constitution a judicial remedy for every political mischief, for every undesirable exercise of legislative power. The Framers carefully and with deliberate forethought refused so to enthrone the judiciary. In this situation, as in others of like nature, appeal for relief does not belong here. Appeal must be to an informed, civically militant electorate. In a democratic society like ours, relief must come through an aroused popular conscience that sears the conscience of the people's representatives. In any event there is nothing judicially more unseemly nor more self-defeating than for this Court to make in terrorem pronouncements, to indulge in merely empty rhetoric, sounding a word of promise to the ear, sure to be disappointing to the hope.\n\nThis is the latest in the series of cases in which the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment have been invoked in federal courts as restrictions upon the power of the States to allocate electoral weight among the voting populations of their various geographical subdivisions.[1] The present action, which *271 comes here on appeal from an order of a statutory three-judge District Court dismissing amended complaints seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, challenges the provisions of Tenn. Code Ann., 1955  3-101 to 3-109, which apportion state representative and senatorial seats among Tennessee's ninety-five counties.\n\nThe original plaintiffs, citizens and qualified voters entitled to vote for members of the Tennessee Legislature in the several counties in which they respectively reside, bring this action in their own behalf and \"on behalf of all other voters in the State of Tennessee,\" or, as they alternatively assert, \"on behalf of all qualified voters of their respective counties, and further, on behalf of all voters of the State of Tennessee who are similarly situated.\" The cities of Knoxville and Chattanooga, and the Mayor of Nashvilleon his own behalf as a qualified voter and, pursuant to an authorizing resolution by the Nashville City Council, as a representative of all the city's residentswere permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff.[2] The defendants are executive officials charged with statutory duties in connection with state elections.[3]\n*272 The original plaintiffs' amended complaint avers, in substance, the following.[4] The Constitution of the State of Tennessee declares that \"elections shall be free and equal,\" provides that no qualifications other than age, citizenship and specified residence requirements shall be attached to the right of suffrage, and prohibits denying to any person the suffrage to which he is entitled except upon conviction of an infamous crime. Art. I,  5; Art. IV,  1. It requires an enumeration of qualified voters within every term of ten years after 1871 and an apportionment of representatives and senators among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified voters in each[5] at the time of each decennial *273 enumeration. Art. II,  4, 5, 6. Notwithstanding these provisions, the State Legislature has not reapportioned itself since 1901. The Reapportionment Act of that year, Tenn. Acts 1901, c. 122, now Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  3-101 to 3-109,[6] was unconstitutional when enacted, because not preceded by the required enumeration of qualified voters and because it allocated legislative seats arbitrarily, unequally and discriminatorily, as measured by the 1900 federal census. Moreover, irrespective of the question of its validity in 1901, it is asserted that the Act became \"unconstitutional and obsolete\" in 1911 by virtue of the decennial reapportionment requirement of the Tennessee Constitution. Continuing a \"purposeful and systematic plan to discriminate against a geographical class of persons,\" recent Tennessee Legislatures have failed, as did their predecessors, to enact reapportionment legislation, although a number of bills providing for reapportionment have been introduced. Because of population shifts since 1901, the apportionment fixed by the Act of that year and still in effect is not proportionate to population, denies to the counties in which the plaintiffs *274 live an additional number of representatives to which they are entitled, and renders plaintiffs' votes \"not as effective as the votes of the voters residing in other senatorial and representative districts . . . .\" Plaintiffs \"suffer a debasement of their votes by virtue of the incorrect, arbitrary, obsolete and unconstitutional apportionment of the General Assembly . . . ,\" and the totality of the malapportionment's effectwhich permits a minority of about thirty-seven percent of the voting population of the State to control twenty of the thirty-three members of Tennessee's Senate, and a minority of forty percent of the voting population to control sixty-three of the ninety-nine members of the Houseresults in \"a distortion of the constitutional system\" established by the Federal and State Constitutions, prevents the General Assembly \"from being a body representative of the people of the State of Tennessee, . . .\" and is \"contrary to the basic principle of representative government . . . ,\" and \"contrary to the philosophy of government in the United States and all Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence . . . .\"\n\nExhibits appended to the complaint purport to demonstrate the extent of the inequalities of which plaintiffs complain. Based upon \"approximate voting population,\"[7] these set forth figures showing that the State *275 Senator from Tennessee's most populous senatorial district represents five and two-tenths times the number of voters represented by the Senator from the least populous district, while the corresponding ratio for most and least populous House districts is more than eighteen to one. The General Assembly thus apportioned has discriminated against the underrepresented counties and in favor of the overrepresented counties in the collection and distribution of various taxes and tax revenues, notably in the distribution of school and highway-improvement funds,[8] this discrimination being \"made possible and effective\" by the Legislature's failure to reapportion itself. Plaintiffs conclude that election of the State Legislature pursuant to the apportionment fixed by the 1901 Act violates the Tennessee Constitution and deprives them of due process of law and of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. Their prayer below was for a declaratory judgment striking down the Act, an injunction restraining defendants from any acts necessary to the holding of elections in the districts prescribed by Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  3-101 to 3-109, until such time as the legislature is reapportioned \"according to the *276 Constitution of the State of Tennessee,\" and an order directing defendants to declare the next primary and general elections for members of the Tennessee Legislature on an at-large basisthe thirty-three senatorial candidates and the ninety-nine representative candidates receiving the highest number of votes to be declared elected.[9]\n\nMotions to dismiss for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter and for failure to state a claim were made and granted, 179 F. Supp. 824, the District Court relying upon this Court's series of decisions beginning with Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, rehearing denied, 329 U. S. 825, motion for reargument before the full bench denied, 329 U. S. 828. The original and intervening plaintiffs bring the case here on appeal. 364 U. S. 898. In this Court they have altered their request for relief, suggesting a \"step-by-step approach.\" The first step is a remand to the District Court with directions to vacate the order dismissing the complaint and to enter an order retaining jurisdiction, providing \"the necessary spur to legislative action . . . .\" If this proves insufficient, appellants will ask the \"additional spur\" of an injunction prohibiting elections under the 1901 Act, or a declaration of the Act's unconstitutionality, or both. Finally, all other means failing, the District Court is invited by the plaintiffs, greatly daring, to order an election at large or redistrict the State itself or through a master. The Solicitor General of the United States, who has filed a brief amicus and argued in favor of reversal, asks the Court on this appeal to hold only that the District Court has \"jurisdiction\" and may properly exercise it to entertain the plaintiffs' claims on the merits. This would leave to that court after remand the questions of the challenged statute's *277 constitutionality and of some undefined, unadumbrated relief in the event a constitutional violation is found. After an argument at the last Term, the case was set down for reargument, 366 U. S. 907, and heard this Term.I.In sustaining appellants' claim, based on the Fourteenth Amendment, that the District Court may entertain this suit, this Court's uniform course of decision over the years is overruled or disregarded. Explicitly it begins with Colegrove v. Green, supra, decided in 1946, but its roots run deep in the Court's historic adjudicatory process.\n\nColegrove held that a federal court should not entertain an action for declaratory and injunctive relief to adjudicate the constitutionality, under the Equal Protection Clause and other federal constitutional and statutory provisions, of a state statute establishing the respective districts for the State's election of Representatives to the Congress. Two opinions were written by the four Justices who composed the majority of the seven sitting members of the Court. Both opinions joining in the result in Colegrove v. Green agreed that considerations were controlling which dictated denial of jurisdiction though not in the strict sense of want of power. While the two opinions show a divergence of view regarding some of these considerations, there are important points of concurrence. Both opinions demonstrate a predominant concern, first, with avoiding federal judicial involvement in matters traditionally left to legislative policy making; second, with respect to the difficultyin view of the nature of the problems of apportionment and its history in this countryof drawing on or devising judicial standards for judgment, as opposed to legislative determinations, of the part which mere numerical equality among voters should play as a criterion for the allocation of *278 political power; and, third, with problems of finding appropriate modes of reliefparticularly, the problem of resolving the essentially political issue of the relative merits of at-large elections and elections held in districts of unequal population.\n\nThe broad applicability of these considerationssummarized in the loose shorthand phrase, \"political question\" in cases involving a State's apportionment of voting power among its numerous localities has led the Court, since 1946, to recognize their controlling effect in a variety of situations. (In all these cases decision was by a full Court.) The \"political question\" principle as applied in Colegrove has found wide application commensurate with its function as \"one of the rules basic to the federal system and this Court's appropriate place within that structure.\" Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U. S. 549, 570. In Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804, litigants brought suit in a Federal District Court challenging as offensive to the Equal Protection Clause Illinois' state legislative-apportionment laws. They pointed to state constitutional provisions requiring decennial reapportionment and allocation of seats in proportion to population, alleged a failure to reapportion for more than forty-five yearsduring which time extensive population shifts had rendered the legislative districts grossly unequaland sought declaratory and injunctive relief with respect to all elections to be held thereafter. After the complaint was dismissed by the District Court, this Court dismissed an appeal for want of a substantial federal question. A similar District Court decision was affirmed here in Radford v. Gary, 352 U. S. 991. And cf. Remmey v. Smith, 342 U. S. 916. In Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940, the Court declined to hear, for want of a substantial federal question, the claim that the division of a municipality into voting districts of unequal population for the selection for councilmen fell *279 afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment, and in Cox v. Peters, 342 U. S. 936, rehearing denied, 343 U. S. 921, it found no substantial federal question raised by a state court's dismissal of a claim for damages for \"devaluation\" of plaintiff's vote by application of Georgia's county-unit system in a primary election for the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. The same Georgia system was subsequently attacked in a complaint for declaratory judgment and an injunction; the federal district judge declined to take the requisite steps for the convening of a statutory three-judge court; and this Court, in Hartsfield v. Sloan, 357 U. S. 916, denied a motion for leave to file a petition for a writ of mandamus to compel the district judge to act. In MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, 283, the Court noted that \"To assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government,\" and, citing the Colegrove cases, declined to find in \"such broad constitutional concepts as due process and equal protection of the laws,\" id., at 284, a warrant for federal judicial invalidation of an Illinois statute requiring as a condition for the formation of a new political party the securing of at least two hundred signatures from each of fifty counties. And in South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, another suit attacking Georgia's county-unit law, it affirmed a District Court dismissal, saying\"Federal courts consistently refuse to exercise their equity powers in cases posing political issues arising from a state's geographical distribution of electoral strength among its political subdivisions.\" Id., at 277.Of course it is important to recognize particular, relevant diversities among comprehensively similar situations. Appellants seek to distinguish several of this Court's prior decisions on one or another groundColegrove v. *280 Green on the ground that federal, not state, legislative apportionment was involved; Remmey v. Smith on the ground that state judicial remedies had not been tried; Radford v. Gary on the ground that Oklahoma has the initiative, whereas Tennessee does not. It would only darken counsel to discuss the relevance and significance of each of these assertedly distinguishing factors here and in the context of this entire line of cases. Suffice it that they do not serve to distinguish Colegrove v. Barrett, supra, which is on all fours with the present case, or to distinguish Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920, in which the full Court without dissent, only five years ago, dismissed on authority of Colegrove v. Green and Anderson v. Jordan, 343 U. S. 912, an appeal from the Supreme Court of Tennessee in which a precisely similar attack was made upon the very statute now challenged. If the weight and momentum of an unvarying course of carefully considered decisions are to be respected, appellants' claims are foreclosed not only by precedents governing the exact facts of the present case but are themselves supported by authority the more persuasive in that it gives effect to the Colegrove principle in distinctly varying circumstances in which state arrangements allocating relative degrees of political influence among geographic groups of voters were challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment.II.The Colegrove doctrine, in the form in which repeated decisions have settled it, was not an innovation. It represents long judicial thought and experience. From its earliest opinions this Court has consistently recognized a class of controversies which do not lend themselves to judicial standards and judicial remedies. To classify the various instances as \"political questions\" is rather a form *281 of stating this conclusion than revealing of analysis.[10] Some of the cases so labelled have no relevance here. But from others emerge unifying considerations that are compelling.\n\n1. The cases concerning war or foreign affairs, for example, are usually explained by the necessity of the country's speaking with one voice in such matters. While this concern alone undoubtedly accounts for many of the decisions,[11] others do not fit the pattern. It would hardly embarrass the conduct of war were this Court to determine, in connection with private transactions between litigants, the date upon which war is to be deemed terminated. But the Court has refused to do so. See, e. g., The Protector, 12 Wall. 700; Brown v. Hiatts, 15 wall. 177; Adger v. Alston, 15 Wall. 555; Williams v. Bruffy, 96 U. S. 176, 192-193. It does not suffice to explain such cases as Ludecke v. Watkins, 335 U. S. 160deferring to political determination the question of the duration of war for purposes of the Presidential power to deport alien enemiesthat judicial intrusion would seriously *282 impede the President's power effectively to protect the country's interests in time of war. Of course, this is true; but the precise issue presented is the duration of the time of war which demands the power. Cf. Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19; Lamar v. Browne, 92 U. S. 187, 193; Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., 251 U. S. 146; Kahn v. Anderson, 255 U. S. 1. And even for the purpose of determining the extent of congressional regulatory power over the tribes and dependent communities of Indians, it is ordinarily for Congress, not the Court, to determine whether or not a particular Indian group retains the characteristics constitutionally requisite to confer the power.[12]E. g., United States v. Holliday, 3 Wall. 407; Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286; United States v. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28. A controlling factor in such cases is that, decision respecting these kinds of complex matters of policy being traditionally committed not to courts but to the political agencies of government for determination by criteria of political expediency, there exists no standard ascertainable by settled judicial experience or process by reference to which a political decision affecting the question at issue between the parties can be judged. Where the question arises in the course of a litigation involving primarily the adjudication of other issues between the litigants, the Court accepts as a basis for adjudication the political departments' decision of it. But where its determination is the sole function to be served by the exercise of the judicial power, the Court will not entertain the action. See Chicago & Southern Air Lines, Inc., v. Waterman S. S. Corp., *283 333 U. S. 103. The dominant consideration is \"the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination . . . .\" Mr. Chief Jusice Hughes, for the Court, in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 454-455. Compare United States v. Rogers, 4 How. 567, 572, with Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515.[13]\n\nThis may be, like so many questions of law, a matter of degree. Questions have arisen under the Constitution to which adjudication gives answer although the criteria for decision are less than unwavering bright lines. Often in these cases illumination was found in the federal structures established by, or the underlying presuppositions of, the Constitution. With respect to such questions, the Court has recognized that, concerning a particular power of Congress put in issue, \". . . effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes.\" Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 120. It is also true that even regarding the duration of war and the status of Indian tribes, referred to above as subjects ordinarily committed exclusively to the non-judicial branches, the Court has suggested that some limitations exist upon the range within which the decisions of those branches will be permitted to go unreviewed. See United States v. Sandoval, supra, at 46; cf. Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U. S. 543. But this is merely to acknowledge that particular circumstances may differ so greatly in degree as to differ thereby in kind, and that, although within a certain range of cases on a continuum, no standard of distinction can be found to tell between them, other cases will fall above or below the range. The doctrine of political questions, like any other, is not to *284 be applied beyond the limits of its own logic, with all the quiddities and abstract disharmonies it may manifest. See the disposition of contentions based on logically distorting views of Colegrove v. Green and Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161, in Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339.\n\n2. The Court has been particularly unwilling to intervene in matters concerning the structure and organization of the political institutions of the States. The abstention from judicial entry into such areas has been greater even than that which marks the Court's ordinary approach to issues of state power challenged under broad federal guarantees. \"We should be very reluctant to decide that we had jurisdiction in such a case, and thus in an action of this nature to supervise and review the political administration of a state government by its own officials and through its own courts. The jurisdiction of this court would only exist in case there had been . . . such a plain and substantial departure from the fundamental principles upon which our government is based that it could with truth and propriety be said that if the judgment were suffered to remain, the party aggrieved would be deprived of his life, liberty or property in violation of the provisions of the Federal Constitution.\" Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586, 596. See Taylor and Marshall v. Beckham (No. 1), 178 U. S. 548; Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U. S. 487; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1. Cf. In re Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200, 220-221.\n\nWhere, however, state law has made particular federal questions determinative of relations within the structure of state government, not in challenge of it, the Court has resolved such narrow, legally defined questions in proper proceedings. See Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U. S. 135. In such instances there is no conflict between state policy and the exercise of federal judicial *285 power. This distinction explains the decisions in Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355; Koenig v. Flynn, 285 U. S. 375; and Carroll v. Becker, 285 U. S. 380, in which the Court released state constitutional provisions prescribing local lawmaking procedures from misconceived restriction of superior federal requirements. Adjudication of the federal claim involved in those cases was not one demanding the accommodation of conflicting interests for which no readily accessible judicial standards could be found. See McPherson v. Blacker, 146 U. S. 1, in which, in a case coming here on writ of error from the judgment of a state court which had entertained it on the merits, the Court treated as justiciable the claim that a State could not constitutionally select its presidential electors by districts, but held that Art. II,  1, cl. 2, of the Constitution left the mode of choosing electors in the absolute discretion of the States. Cf. Pope v. Williams, 193 U. S. 621; Breedlove v. Suttles, 302 U. S. 277. To read with literalness the abstracted jurisdictional discussion in the McPherson opinion reveals the danger of conceptions of \"justiciability\" derived from talk and not from the effective decision in a case. In probing beneath the surface of cases in which the Court has declined to interfere with the actions of political organs of government, of decisive significance is whether in each situation the ultimate decision has been to intervene or not to intervene. Compare the reliance in South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276, on MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, and the \"jurisdictional\" form of the opinion in Wilson v. North Carolina, 169 U. S. 586, 596, supra.\n\n3. The cases involving Negro disfranchisement are no exception to the principle of avoiding federal judicial intervention into matters of state government in the absence of an explicit and clear constitutional imperative. For here the controlling command of Supreme Law is plain and unequivocal. An end of discrimination against *286 the Negro was the compelling motive of the Civil War Amendments. The Fifteenth expresses this in terms, and it is no less true of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth. Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 67-72; Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303, 306-307; Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536, 541. Thus the Court, in cases involving discrimination against the Negro's right to vote, has recognized not only the action at law for damages,[14] but, in appropriate circumstances, the extraordinary remedy of declaratory or injunctive relief.[15]Schnell v. Davis, 336 U. S. 933; Terry v. Adams, 345 U. S. 461.[16] Injunctions in these cases, it should be noted, would not have restrained state-wide general elections. Compare Giles v. Harris, 189 U. S. 475.\n\n4. The Court has refused to exercise its jurisdiction to pass on \"abstract questions of political power, of sovereignty, of government.\" Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U. S. 447, 485. See Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 258 U. S. 158, 162; New Jersey v. Sargent, 269 U. S. 328, 337. The \"political question\" doctrine, in this aspect, reflects the policies underlying the requirement of \"standing\": that the litigant who would challenge official *287 action must claim infringement of an interest particular and personal to himself, as distinguished from a cause of dissatisfaction with the general frame and functioning of governmenta complaint that the political institutions are awry. See Stearns v. Wood, 236 U. S. 75; Fairchild v. Hughes, 258 U. S. 126; United Public Workers v. Mitchell, 330 U. S. 75, 89-91. What renders cases of this kind non-justiciable is not necessarily the nature of the parties to them, for the Court has resolved other issues between similar parties;[17] nor is it the nature of the legal question involved, for the same type of question has been adjudicated when presented in other forms of controversy.[18] The crux of the matter is that courts are not fit instruments of decision where what is essentially at stake is the composition of those large contests of policy traditionally fought out in non-judicial forums, by which governments and the actions of governments are made and unmade. See Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700; White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646; Phillips v. Payne, 92 U. S. 130; Marsh v. Burroughs, 1 Woods 463, 471-472 (Bradley, Circuit Justice); cf. Wilson v. Shaw, 204 U. S. 24; but see Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559. Thus, where the Cherokee Nation sought by an original motion to restrain the State of Georgia from the enforcement of laws which assimilated Cherokee territory to the State's counties, abrogated Cherokee law, and abolished Cherokee government, the Court held that such a claim was not judicially cognizable. Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1.[19] And in Georgia *288 v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a bill by the State of Georgia seeking to enjoin enforcement of the Reconstruction Acts on the ground that the command by military districts which they established extinguished existing state government and replaced it with a form of government unauthorized by the Constitution:[20]\"That these matters, both as stated in the body of the bill; and, in the prayers for relief, call for the judgment of the court upon political questions, and, upon rights, not of persons or property, but of a political character, will hardly be denied. For the rights for the protection of which our authority is invoked, are the rights of sovereignty, of political jurisdiction, of government, of corporate existence as a State, with all its constitutional powers and privileges. No case of private rights or private property infringed, or in danger of actual or threatened infringement, is presented by the bill, in a judicial form, for the judgment of the court.\" Id., at 77.[21]*289 5. The influence of these converging considerations the caution not to undertake decision where standards meet for judicial judgment are lacking, the reluctance to interfere with matters of state government in the absence of an unquestionable and effectively enforceable mandate, the unwillingness to make courts arbiters of the broad issues of political organization historically committed to other institutions and for whose adjustment the judicial process is ill-adaptedhas been decisive of the settled line of cases, reaching back more than a century, which holds that Art. IV,  4, of the Constitution, guaranteeing to the States \"a Republican Form of Government,\"[22] is not enforceable through the courts. E. g., O'Neill v. Leamer, 239 U. S. 244; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U. S. 219; Cochran v. Board of Education, 281 U. S. 370; Highland Farms Dairy, Inc., v. Agnew, 300 U. S. 608.[23] Claims resting on this specific *290 guarantee of the Constitution have been held nonjusticiable which challenged state distribution of powers between the legislative and judicial branches, Ohio ex rel. Bryant v. Akron Metropolitan Park District, 281 U. S. 74, state delegation of power to municipalities, Kiernan v. Portland, Oregon, 223 U. S. 151, state adoption of the referendum as a legislative institution, Ohio ex rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, 241 U. S. 565, 569, and state restriction upon the power of state constitutional amendment, Marshall v. Dye, 231 U. S. 250, 256-257. The subject was fully considered in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118, in which the Court dismissed for want of jurisdiction a writ of error attacking a state license-tax statute enacted by the initiative, on the claim that this mode of legislation was inconsistent with a Republican Form of Government and violated the Equal Protection Clause and other federal guarantees. After nothing \". . . the ruinous destruction of legislative authority in matters purely political which would necessarily be occasioned by giving sanction *291 to the doctrine which underlies and would be necessarily involved in sustaining the propositions contended for,\"[24] the Court said:\". . . [The] essentially political nature [of this claim] is at once made manifest by understanding that the assault which the contention here advanced makes it [sic] not on the tax as a tax, but on the State as a State. It is addressed to the framework and political character of the government by which the statute levying the tax was passed. It is the government, the political entity, which (reducing the case to its essence) is called to the bar of this court, not for the purpose of testing judicially some exercise of power assailed, on the ground that its exertion *292 has injuriously affected the rights of an individual because of repugnancy to some constitutional limitation, but to demand of the State that it establish its right to exist as a State, republican in form.\" Id., at 150-151.The starting point of the doctrine applied in these cases is, of course, Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1. The case arose out of the Dorr Rebellion in Rhode Island in 1841-1842. Rhode Island, at the time of the separation from England, had not adopted a new constitution but had continued, in its existence as an independent State, under its original royal Charter, with certain statutory alterations. This frame of government provided no means for amendment of the fundamental law; the right of suffrage was to be prescribed by legislation, which limited it to freeholders. In the 1830's, largely because of the growth of towns in which there developed a propertied class whose means were not represented by freehold estates, dissatisfaction arose with the suffrage qualifications of the charter government. In addition, population shifts had caused a dated apportionment of seats in the lower house to yield substantial numerical inequality of political influence, even among qualified voters. The towns felt themselves underrepresented, and agitation began for electoral reform. When the charter government failed to respond, popular meetings of those who favored the broader suffrage were held and delegates elected to a convention which met and drafted a state constitution. This constitution provided for universal manhood suffrage (with certain qualifications); and it was to be adopted by vote of the people at elections at which a similarly expansive franchise obtained. This new scheme of government was ratified at the polls and declared effective by the convention, but the government elected and organized under it, with Dorr at its head, never came to power. The *293 charter government denied the validity of the convention, the constitution and its government and, after an insignificant skirmish, routed Dorr and his followers. It meanwhile provided for the calling of its own convention, which drafted a constitution that went peacefully into effect in 1843.[25]\nLuther v. Borden was a trespass action brought by one of Dorr's supporters in a United States Circuit Court to recover damages for the breaking and entering of his house. The defendants justified under military orders pursuant to martial law declared by the charter government, and plaintiff, by his reply, joined issue on the legality of the charter government subsequent to the adoption of the Dorr constitution. Evidence offered by the plaintiff tending to establish that the Dorr government was the rightful government of Rhode Island was rejected by the Circuit Court; the court charged the jury that the charter government was lawful; and on a verdict for defendants, plaintiff brought a writ of error to this Court.\n\nThe Court, through Mr. Chief Justice Taney, affirmed. After noting that the issue of the charter government's legality had been resolved in that government's favor by the state courts of Rhode Islandthat the state courts, deeming the matter a political one unfit for judicial determination, had declined to entertain attacks upon the existence and authority of the charter governmentthe Chief Justice held that the courts of the United States must follow those of the State in this regard. Id., at 39-40. It was recognized that the compulsion to follow *294 state law would not apply in a federal court in the face of a superior command found in the Federal Constitution, ibid., but no such command was found. The Constitution, the Court saidreferring to the Guarantee Clause of the Fourth Article\". . . as far as it has provided for an emergency of this kind, and authorized the general government to interfere in the domestic concerns of a State, has treated the subject as political in its nature, and placed the power in the hands of that department.\" Id., at 42.\"Under this article of the Constitution it rests with Congress to decide what government is the established one in a State. For as the United States guarantee to each State a republican government, Congress must necessarily decide what government is established in the State before it can determine whether it is republican or not. And when the senators and representatives of a State are admitted into the councils of the Union, the authority of the government under which they are appointed, as well as its republican character, is recognized by the proper constitutional authority. And its decision is binding on every other department of the government, and could not be questioned in a judicial tribunal. It is true that the contest in this case did not last long enough to bring the matter to this issue; and as no senators or representatives were elected under the authority of the government of which Mr. Dorr was the head, Congress was not called upon to decide the controversy. Yet the right to decide is placed there, and not in the courts.\" Ibid.[26]*295 In determining this issue non-justiciable, the Court was sensitive to the same considerations to which its later decisions have given the varied applications already discussed. It adverted to the delicacy of judicial intervention into the very structure of government.[27] It acknowledged that tradition had long entrusted questions of this nature to non-judicial processes,[28] and that judicial processes were unsuited to their decision.[29] The absence of guiding standards for judgment was critical, for the question whether the Dorr constitution had been rightfully adopted depended, in part, upon the extent of the franchise to be recognizedthe very point of contention over which rebellion had been fought.\". . . [I]f the Circuit Court had entered upon this inquiry, by what rule could it have determined the qualification of voters upon the adoption or rejection of the proposed constitution, unless there was some previous law of the State to guide it? It is the province of a court to expound the law, not to make it. And certainly it is no part of the judicial functions of any court of the United States to prescribe the qualification of voters in a State, giving the right to those to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State, or taking it away from those to whom it is given; nor has it the right to determine what political privileges *296 the citizens of a State are entitled to, unless there is an established constitution or law to govern its decision.\" Id., at 41.Mr. Justice Woodbury (who dissented with respect to the effect of martial law) agreed with the Court regarding the inappropriateness of judicial inquiry into the issues:\"But, fortunately for our freedom from political excitements in judicial duties, this court can never with propriety be called on officially to be the umpire in questions merely political. The adjustment of these questions belongs to the people and their political representatives, either in the State or general government. These questions relate to matters not to be settled on strict legal principles. They are adjusted rather by inclination,or prejudice or compromise, often. Some of them succeed or are defeated even by public policy alone, or mere naked power, rather than intrinsic right. . . .\"Another evil, alarming and little foreseen, involved in regarding these as questions for the final arbitrament of judges would be, that in such an event all political privileges and rights would, in a dispute among the people, depend on our decision finally. . . . [D]isputed points in making constitutions, depending often, as before shown, on policy, inclination, popular resolves, and popular will, . . . if the people, in the distribution of powers under the constitution, should ever think of making judges supreme arbiters in political controversies, when not selected by nor, frequently, amenable to them, nor at liberty to follow such various considerations in their judgments as belong to mere political questions, they will dethrone themselves and lose one of their own invaluable birthrights; building up in this way slowly, but surelya new sovereign power in the *297 republic, in most respects irresponsible and unchangeable for life, and one more dangerous, in theory at least, than the worst elective oligarchy in the worst of times. . . .\" Id., at 51-53.[30]III.The present case involves all of the elements that have made the Guarantee Clause cases non-justiciable. It is, in effect, a Guarantee Clause claim masquerading under a different label. But it cannot make the case more fit for judicial action that appellants invoke the Fourteenth Amendment rather than Art. IV,  4, where, in fact, the gist of their complaint is the sameunless it can be found that the Fourteenth Amendment speaks with greater particularity to their situation. We have been admonished to avoid \"the tyranny of labels.\" Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97, 114. Art. IV,  4, is not committed by express constitutional terms to Congress. It is the nature of the controversies arising under it, nothing else, which has made it judicially unenforceable. Of course, if a controversy falls within judicial power, it depends \"on how he [the plaintiff] casts his action,\" Pan American Petroleum Corp. v. Superior Court, 366 U. S. 656, 662, whether he brings himself within a jurisdictional statute. But where judicial competence is wanting, it cannot be created by invoking one clause of the Constitution rather than another. When what was essentially a Guarantee Clause claim was sought to be laid, as well, under the Equal Protection Clause in Pacific States Telephone & Telegraph Co. v. Oregon, supra, the Court had no difficulty in \"dispelling *298 any mere confusion resulting from forms of expression and considering the substance of things . . . .\" 223 U. S., at 140.\n\nHere appellants attack \"the State as a State,\" precisely as it was perceived to be attacked in the Pacific States case, id., at 150. Their complaint is that the basis of representation of the Tennessee Legislature hurts them. They assert that \"a minority now rules in Tennessee,\" that the apportionment statute results in a \"distortion of the constitutional system,\" that the General Assembly is no longer \"a body representative of the people of the State of Tennessee,\" all \"contrary to the basic principle of representative government . . . .\" Accepting appellants' own formulation of the issue, one can know this handsaw from a hawk. Such a claim would be non-justiciable not merely under Art. IV,  4, but under any clause of the Constitution, by virtue of the very fact that a federal court is not a forum for political debate. Massachusetts v. Mellon, supra.\n\nBut appellants, of course, do not rest on this claim simpliciter. In invoking the Equal Protection Clause, they assert that the distortion of representative government complained of is produced by systematic discrimination against them, by way of \"a debasement of their votes . . . .\" Does this characterization, with due regard for the facts from which it is derived, add anything to appellants' case?[31]\n\nAt first blush, this charge of discrimination based on legislative underrepresentation is given the appearance of *299 a more private, less impersonal claim, than the assertion that the frame of government is askew. Appellants appear as representatives of a class that is prejudiced as a class, in contradistinction to the polity in its entirety. However, the discrimination relied on is the deprivation of what appellants conceive to be their proportionate share of political influence. This, of course, is the practical effect of any allocation of power within the institutions of government. Hardly any distribution of political authority that could be assailed as rendering government non-republican would fail similarly to operate to the prejudice of some groups, and to the advantage of others, within the body politic. It would be ingenuous not to see, or consciously blind to deny, that the real battle over the initiative and referendum, or over a delegation of power to local rather than state-wide authority, is the battle between forces whose influence is disparate among the various organs of government to whom power may be given. No shift of power but works a corresponding shift in political influence among the groups composing a society.\n\nWhat, then, is this question of legislative apportionment? Appellants invoke the right to vote and to have their votes counted.[32] But they are permitted to vote and their votes are counted. They go to the polls, they cast their ballots, they send their representatives to the state *300 councils. Their complaint is simply that the representatives are not sufficiently numerous or powerfulin short, that Tennessee has adopted a basis of representation with which they are dissatisfied. Talk of \"debasement\" or \"dilution\" is circular talk. One cannot speak of \"debasement\" or \"dilution\" of the value of a vote until there is first defined a standard of reference as to what a vote should be worth. What is actually asked of the Court in this case is to choose among competing bases of representationultimately, really, among competing theories of political philosophyin order to establish an appropriate frame of government for the State of Tennessee and thereby for all the States of the Union.\n\nIn such a matter, abstract analogies which ignore the facts of history deal in unrealities; they betray reason. This is not a case in which a State has, through a device however oblique and sophisticated, denied Negroes or Jews or redheaded persons a vote, or given them only a third or a sixth of a vote. That was Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339. What Tennessee illustrates is an old and still widespread method of representationrepresentation by local geographical division, only in part respective of populationin preference to others, others, forsooth, more appealing. Appellants contest this choice and seek to make this Court the arbiter of the disagreement. They would make the Equal Protection Clause the charter of adjudication, asserting that the equality which it guarantees comports, if not the assurance of equal weight to every voter's vote, at least the basic conception that representation ought to be proportionate to population, a standard by reference to which the reasonableness of apportionment plans may be judged.\n\nTo find such a political conception legally enforceable in the broad and unspecific guarantee of equal protection is to rewrite the Constitution. See Luther v. Borden, supra. Certainly, \"equal protection\" is no more secure *301 a foundation for judicial judgment of the permissibility of varying forms of representative government than is \"Republican Form.\" Indeed since \"equal protection of the laws\" can only mean an equality of persons standing in the same relation to whatever governmental action is challenged, the determination whether treatment is equal presupposes a determination concerning the nature of the relationship. This, with respect to apportionment, means an inquiry into the theoretic base of representation in an acceptably republican state. For a court could not determine the equal-protection issue without in fact first determining the Republican-Form issue, simply because what is reasonable for equal-protection purposes will depend upon what frame of government, basically, is allowed. To divorce \"equal protection\" from \"Republican Form\" is to talk about half a question.\n\nThe notion that representation proportioned to the geographic spread of population is so universally accepted as a necessary element of equality between man and man that it must be taken to be the standard of a political equality preserved by the Fourteenth Amendmentthat it is, in appellants' words \"the basic principle of representative government\"is, to put it bluntly, not true. However desirable and however desired by some among the great political thinkers and framers of our government, it has never been generally practiced, today or in the past. It was not the English system, it was not the colonial system, it was not the system chosen for the national government by the Constitution, it was not the system exclusively or even predominantly practiced by the States at the time of adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is not predominantly practiced by the States today. Unless judges, the judges of this Court, are to make their private views of political wisdom the measure of the Constitutionviews which in all honesty cannot but give the appearance, if not reflect the reality, of *302 involvement with the business of partisan politics so inescapably a part of apportionment controversiesthe Fourteenth Amendment, \"itself a historical product,\" Jackman v. Rosenbaum Co., 260 U. S. 22, 31, provides no guide for judicial oversight of the representation problem.1. Great Britain.Writing in 1958, Professor W. J. M. Mackenzie aptly summarized the British history of the principle of representation proportioned to population: \" `Equal electoral districts' formed part of the programme of radical reform in England in the 1830s, the only part of that programme which has not been realised.\"[33] Until the late nineteenth century, the sole base of representation (with certain exceptions not now relevant) was the local geographical unit: each county or borough returned its fixed number of members, usually two for the English units, regardless of population.[34] Prior to the Reform Act of 1832, this system was marked by the almost total disfranchisement of the populous northern industrial centers, which had grown to significant size at the advent of the Industrial Revolution and had not been granted borough representation, and by the existence of the rotten borough, playing its substantial part in the Crown's struggle for continued control of the Commons.[35] In 1831, ten southernmost English counties, numbering three and a quarter million people, had two hundred and thirty-five parliamentary representatives, while the six northernmost counties, with more than three and a half million people, had sixty-eight.[36] It was said that one hundred and eighty persons appointed three hundred and *303 fifty members in the Commons.[37] Less than a half century earlier, Madison in the Federalist had remarked that half the House was returned by less than six thousand of the eight million people of England and Scotland.[38]\n\nThe Act of 1832, the product of a fierce partisan political struggle and the occasion of charges of gerrymandering not without foundation,[39] effected eradication of only the most extreme numerical inequalities of the unreformed system. It did not adopt the principle of representation based on population, but merely disfranchised certain among the rotten borough and enfranchised most of the urban centersstill quite without regard to their relative numbers.[40] In the wake of the Act there remained substantial electoral inequality: the boroughs of Cornwall were represented sixteen times as weightily, judged by population, as the county's eastern division; the average ratio of seats to population in ten agricultural counties was four and a half times that in ten manufacturing divisions; Honiton, with about three thousand inhabitants, was equally represented with Liverpool, which had four hundred thousand.[41] In 1866 apportionment by population began to be advocated generally in the House, but was not made the basis of the redistribution of 1867, although the act of that year did apportion representation more evenly, gauged by the population standard.[42] Population shifts increased the surviving inequalities; by 1884 the representation ratio *304 in many small boroughs was more than twenty-two times that of Birmingham or Manchester, forty-to-one disparities could be found elsewhere, and, in sum, in the 1870's and 1880's, a fourth of the electorate returned two-thirds of the members of the House.[43]\n\nThe first systematic English attempt to distribute seats by population was the Redistribution Act of 1885.[44] The statute still left ratios of inequality of as much as seven to one,[45] which had increased to fifteen to one by 1912.[46] In 1918 Parliament again responded to \"shockingly bad\" conditions of inequality,[47] and to partisan political inspiration,[48] by redistribution.[49] In 1944, redistribution was put on a periodic footing by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act of that year,[50] which committed a continuing primary responsibility for reapportioning the Commons to administrative agencies (Boundary Commissions for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, respectively).[51] The Commissions, having regard to certain rules prescribed for their guidance, are to prepare at designated intervals reports for the Home Secretary's submission to Parliament, along with the draft of an Order in Council to give effect to the *305 Commissions' recommendations. The districting rules adopt the basic principle of representation by population, although the principle is significantly modified by directions to respect local geographic boundaries as far as practicable, and by discretion to take account of special geographical conditions, including the size, shape and accessibility of constituencies. Under the original 1944 Act, the rules provided that (subject to the exercise of the discretion respecting special geographical conditions and to regard for the total size of the House of Commons as prescribed by the Act) so far as practicable, the single-member districts should not deviate more than twenty-five percent from the electoral quota (population divided by number of constituencies). However, apparently at the recommendation of the Boundary Commission for England, the twenty-five percent standard was eliminated as too restrictive in 1947, and replaced by the flexible provision that constituencies are to be as near the electoral quota as practicable, a rule which is expressly subordinated both to the consideration of special geographic conditions and to that of preserving local boundaries.[52] Free of the twenty-five percent rule, the Commissions drew up plans of distribution in which inequalities among the districts run, in ordinary cases, as high as two to one and, in the case of a few extraordinary constituencies, three to one.[53] The action of the Boundary Commission for England was twice challenged in the courts in 1954the claim being that the Commission had violated statutory rules *306 prescribing the standards for its judgmentand in both cases the Judges declined to intervene. In Hammersmith Borough Council v. Boundary Commission for England,[54] Harman, J., was of opinion that the nature of the controversy and the scheme of the Acts made the matter inappropriate for judicial interference, and in Harper v. Home Secretary,[55] the Court of Appeal, per Evershed, M. R., quoting Harman, J., with approval, adverting to the wide range of discretion entrusted to the Commission under the Acts, and remarking the delicate character of the parliamentary issues in which it was sought to engage the court, reached the same conclusion.[56]\n\nThe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1958,[57] made two further amendments to the law. Responsive to the recommendation of the Boundary Commission for England,[58] the interval permitted between Commission reports was more than doubled, to a new maximum of fifteen years.[59] And at the suggestion of the same Commission that \"It would ease the future labours of the Commission and remove much local irritation if Rule 5 [requiring that the electorate of each constituency be as near the electoral quota as practicable] were to be so amended as to allow us to make recommendations preserving the status quo in any area where such a course appeared to be desirable and not inconsistent *307 with the broad intention of the Rules,\"[60] the Commissions were directed to consider the inconvenience attendant upon the alteration of constituencies, and the local ties which such alteration might break. The Home Secretary's view of this amendment was that it worked to erect \"a presumption against making changes unless there is a very strong case for them.\"[61]2. The Colonies and the Union.For the guiding political theorists of the Revolutionary generation, the English system of representation, in its most salient aspects of numerical inequality, was a model to be avoided, not followed.[62] Nevertheless, the basic English principle of apportioning representatives among the local governmental entities, towns or counties, rather than among units of approximately equal population, had early taken root in the colonies.[63] In some, as in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, numbers of electors were taken into account, in a rough fashion, by allotting increasing fixed quotas of representatives to several towns or classes of towns graduated by population, but in most of the colonies delegates were allowed to the local units without respect to numbers.[64] This resulted in grossly unequal electoral units.[65] The representation ratio in one North Carolina county was more than eight times that in another.[66] Moreover, American rotten boroughs had appeared,[67] and apportionment was made an instrument first in the political *308 struggles between the King or the royal governors and the colonial legislatures,[68] and, later, between the older tidewater regions in the colonies and the growing interior.[69] Madison in the Philadelphia Convention adverted to the \"inequality of the Representation in the Legislatures of particular States, . . .\"[70] arguing that it was necessary to confer on Congress the power ultimately to regulate the times, places and manner of selecting Representatives,[71] in order to forestall the overrepresented counties' securing themselves a similar overrepresentation in the national councils. The example of South Carolina, where Charleston's overrepresentation was a continuing bone of contention between the tidewater and the back country, was cited by Madison in the Virginia Convention and by King in the Massachusetts Convention, in support of the same power, and King also spoke of the extreme numerical inequality arising from Connecticut's town-representation system.[72]\n\nSuch inequalities survived the constitutional period. The United States Constitution itself did not largely adopt the principle of numbers. Apportionment of the national legislature among the States was one of the most difficult problems for the Convention;[73] its solution involving State representation in the Senate[74] and the three-fifths compromise in the House[75]left neither chamber apportioned proportionately to population. *309 Within the States, electoral power continued to be allotted to favor the tidewater.[76] Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia, recorded the \"very unequal\" representation there: individual counties differing in population by a ratio of more than seventeen to one elected the same number of representatives, and those nineteen thousand of Virginia's fifty thousand men who lived between the falls of the rivers and the seacoast returned half the State's senators and almost half its delegates.[77] In South Carolina in 1790, the three lower districts, with a white population of less than twenty-nine thousand elected twenty senators and seventy assembly members; while in the uplands more than one hundred and eleven thousand white persons elected seventeen senators and fifty-four assemblymen.[78]\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, the demands of the interior became more insistent. The apportionment quarrel in Virginia was a major factor in precipitating the calling of a constitutional convention in 1829. Bitter animosities racked the convention, threatening the State with disunion. At last a compromise which gave the three hundred and twenty thousand people of the west thirteen senators, as against the nineteen senators returned by the three hundred sixty-three thousand people of the east, commanded agreement. It was adopted at the polls but left the western counties so dissatisfied that there were threats of revolt and realignment with the State of Maryland.[79]\n\nMaryland, however, had her own numerical disproportions. In 1820, one representative vote in Calvert County *310 was worth five in Frederick County, and almost two hundred thousand people were represented by eighteen members, while fifty thousand others elected twenty.[80] This was the result of the county-representation system of allotment. And, except for Massachusetts which, after a long struggle, did adopt representation by population at the mid-century, a similar town-representation principle continued to prevail in various forms throughout New England, with all its attendant, often gross inequalities.[81]3. The States at the time of ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and those later admitted. The several state conventions throughout the first half of the nineteenth century were the scenes of fierce sectional and party strifes respecting the geographic allocation of representation.[82] Their product was a wide variety of apportionment methods which recognized the element of population in differing ways and degrees. Particularly pertinent to appraisal of the contention that the Fourteenth Amendment embodied a standard limiting the freedom of the States with regard to the principles and bases of local legislative apportionment is an examination of the apportionment provisions of the thirty-three States which ratified the Amendment between 1866 and 1870, at their respective times of ratification. These may be considered in two groups: (A) the ratifying States other than the ten Southern States whose constitutions, at the time of ratification or shortly thereafter, were the work of the Reconstruction Act conventions;[83] and *311 (B) the ten Reconstruction-Act States. All thirty-three are significant, because they demonstrate how unfounded is the assumption that the ratifying States could have agreed on a standard apportionment theory or practice, and how baseless the suggestion that by voting for the Equal Protection Clause they sought to establish a test mold for apportionment whichif appellants' argument is soundstruck down sub silentio not a few of their own state constitutional provisions. But the constitutions of the ten Reconstruction-Act States have an added importance, for it is scarcely to be thought that the Congress which was so solicitous for the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment as to make the readmission of the late rebel States to Congress turn on their respective ratifications of it, would have approved constitutions whichagain, under appellants' theorycontemporaneously offended the Amendment.A. Of the twenty-three ratifying States of the first group, seven or eight had constitutions which demanded or allowed apportionment of both houses on the basis of population,[84] unqualifiedly or with only qualifications respecting the preservation of local boundaries.[85] Three *312 more apportioned on what was essentially a population base, but provided that in one house counties having a specified fraction of a ratioa moiety or two-thirds should have a representative.[86] Since each of these three States limited the size of their chambers, the fractional rule could operateand, at least in Michigan, has in fact operated[87]to produce substantial numerical inequalities *313 in favor of the sparsely populated counties.[88] Iowa favored her small counties by the rule that no more than four counties might be combined in a representative district,[89] and New York and Kansas compromised population and county-representation principles by assuring every county, regardless of the number of its inhabitants, at least one seat in their respective Houses.[90]\n\nOhio and Maine recognized the factor of numbers by a different device. The former gave a House representative to each county having half a ratio, two representatives for a ratio and three-quarters, three representatives for three ratios, and a single additional representative for each additional ratio.[91] The latter, after apportioning among counties on a population base, gave each town of fifteen hundred inhabitants one representative, each town of three thousand, seven hundred and fifty inhabitants two representatives, and so on in increasing intervals to twenty-six thousand, two hundred and fifty inhabitants towns of that size or larger receiving the maximum permitted number of representatives: seven.[92] The departure from numerical equality under these systems is apparent: in Maine, assuming the incidence of towns in *314 all categories, representative ratios would differ by factors of two and a half to one, at a minimum. Similarly, Missouri gave each of its counties, however small, one representative, two representatives for three ratios, three representatives for six ratios, and one additional representative for each three ratios above six.[93] New Hampshire allotted a representative to each town of one hundred and fifty ratable male polls of voting age and one more representative for each increment of three hundred above that figure;[94] its Senate was not apportioned by population but among districts based on the proportion of direct taxes paid.[95] In Pennsylvania, the basis of apportionment in both houses was taxable inhabitants; and in the House every county of at least thirty-five hundred taxables had a representative, nor could more than three counties be joined in forming a representative district; while in the Senate no city or county could have more than four of the State's twenty-five to thirty-three senators.[96]\n\nFinally, four States apportioned at least one House with no regard whatever to population. In Connecticut[97] and Vermont[98] representation in the House was on a town basis; Rhode Island gave one senator to each of its towns or cities,[99] and New Jersey, one to each of its counties.[100]*315 Nor, in any of these States, was the other House apportioned on a strict principle of equal numbers: Connecticut gave each of its counties a minimum of two senators[101] and Vermont, one;[102] New Jersey assured each county a representative;[103] and in Rhode Island, which gave at least one representative to each town or city, no town or city could have more than one-sixth of the total number in the House.[104]B. Among the ten late Confederate States affected by the Reconstruction Acts, in only four did it appear that apportionment of both state legislative houses would or might be based strictly on population.[105] In North Carolina,[106] South Carolina,[107] Louisiana,[108] and Alabama,[109] each county (in the case of Louisiana, each parish) was assured at least one seat in the lower House irrespective of numbersa distribution which exhausted, respectively, *316 on the basis of the number of then-existing counties, three-quarters, one-quarter, two-fifths and three-fifths of the maximum possible number of representatives, before a single seat was available for assignment on a population basis; and in South Carolina, moreover, the Senate was composed of one member elected from each county, except that Charleston sent two.[110] In Florida's House, each county had one seat guaranteed and an additional seat for every thousand registered voters up to a maximum of four representatives;[111] while Georgia, whose Senate seats were distributed among forty-four single-member districts each composed of three contiguous counties,[112] assigned representation in its House as follows: three seats to each of the six most populous counties, two to each of the thirty-one next most populous, one to each of the remaining ninety-five.[113] As might be expected, the one-representative-per-county minimum pattern has proved incompatible with numerical equality,[114] and Georgia's *317 county-clustering system has produced representative-ratio disparities, between the largest and smallest counties, of more than sixty to one.[115]C.\nThe constitutions[116] of the thirteen States which Congress admitted to the Union after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment showed a similar pattern. Six of them required or permitted apportionment of both Houses by population, subject only to qualifications concerning local boundaries.[117] Wyoming, apportioning by population, guaranteed to each of its counties at least one seat in each House,[118] and Idaho, which prescribed (after the first legislative session) that apportionment should be \"as may be provided by law,\" gave each county at least one representative.[119] In Oklahoma, House members were apportioned among counties so as to give one *318 seat for half a ratio, two for a ratio and three-quarters, and one for each additional ratio up to a maximum of seven representatives per county.[120] Montana required reapportionment of its House on the basis of periodic enumerations according to ratios to be fixed by law[121] but its counties were represented as counties in the Senate, each county having one senator.[122] Alaska[123] and Hawaii[124] each apportioned a number of senators among constitutionally fixed districts; their respective Houses were to be periodically reapportioned by population, subject to a moiety rule in Alaska[125] and to Hawaii's guarantee of one representative to each of four constitutionally designated areas.[126] The Arizona Constitution assigned representation to each county in each house, giving one or two senators and from one to seven representatives to each, and making no provision for reapportionment.[127]\n*319 4. Contemporary apportionment. Detailed recent studies are available to describe the present-day constitutional and statutory status of apportionment in the fifty States.[128] They demonstrate a decided twentieth-century trend away from population as the exclusive base of representation. Today, only a dozen state constitutions provide for periodic legislative reapportionment of both houses by a substantially unqualified application of the population standard,[129] and only about a dozen more prescribe such reapportionment for even a single chamber. \"Specific provision for county representation in at least one house of the state legislature has been increasingly adopted since the end of the 19th century. . . .\"[130] More than twenty States now guarantee each county at least one seat in one of their houses regardless of population, and in nine others county or town units are given equal representation in one legislative branch, whatever the number of each unit's inhabitants. Of course, numerically considered, \"These provisions invariably result in over-representation of the least populated areas. . . .\"[131] And in an effort to curb the political dominance of metropolitan regions, at least ten States now limit the maximum entitlement of any single county (or, in some cases, city) *320 in one legislative houseanother source of substantial numerical disproportion.[132]\n\nMoreover, it is common knowledge that the legislatures have not kept reapportionment up to date, even where state constitutions in terms require it.[133] In particular, the pattern of according greater per capita representation to rural, relatively sparsely populated areasthe same pattern which finds expression in various state constitutional provisions,[134] and which has been given effect in England and elsewhere[135]has, in some of the States, been made the law by legislative inaction in the face of *321 population shifts.[136] Throughout the country, urban and suburban areas tend to be given higher representation ratios than do rural areas.[137]\n\nThe stark fact is that if among the numerous widely varying principles and practices that control state legislative apportionment today there is any generally prevailing feature, that feature is geographic inequality in relation to the population standard.[138] Examples could be endlessly multiplied. In New Jersey, counties of *322 thirty-five thousand and of more than nine hundred and five thousand inhabitants respectively each have a single senator.[139] Representative districts in Minnesota range from 7,290 inhabitants to 107,246 inhabitants.[140] Ratios of senatorial representation in California vary as much as two hundred and ninety-seven to one.[141] In Oklahoma, the range is ten to one for House constituencies and roughly sixteen to one for Senate constituencies.[142] Colebrook, Connecticutpopulation 592elects two House representatives; Hartfordpopulation 177,397also elects two.[143] The first, third and fifth of these examples are the products of constitutional provisions which subordinate population to regional considerations in apportionment; the second is the result of legislative inaction; the fourth derives from both constitutional and legislative sources. A survey made in 1955, in sum, reveals that less than thirty percent of the population inhabit districts sufficient to elect a House majority in thirteen States and a Senate majority in nineteen States.[144] These figures show more than individual variations from a generally accepted standard of electoral equality. They show that there is notas there has never beena standard by *323 which the place of equality as a factor in apportionment can be measured.\n\nManifestly, the Equal Protection Clause supplies no clearer guide for judicial examination of apportionment methods than would the Guarantee Clause itself. Apportionment, by its character, is a subject of extraordinary complexity, involvingeven after the fundamental theoretical issues concerning what is to be represented in a representative legislature have been fought out or compromised considerations of geography, demography, electoral convenience, economic and social cohesions or divergencies among particular local groups, communications, the practical effects of political institutions like the lobby and the city machine, ancient traditions and ties of settled usage, respect for proven incumbents of long experience and senior status, mathematical mechanics, censuses compiling relevant data, and a host of others.[145]*324 Legislative responses throughout the country to the reapportionment demands of the 1960 Census have glaringly confirmed that these are not factors that lend themselves to evaluations of a nature that are the staple of judicial determinations or for which judges are equipped to adjudicate by legal training or experience or native wit. And this is the more so true because in every strand of this complicated, intricate web of values meet the contending forces of partisan politics.[146] The practical significance of apportionment is that the next election results may differ because of it. Apportionment battles are overwhelmingly party or intra-party contests.[147] It will add a virulent source of friction and tension in federal-state relations to embroil the federal judiciary in them.[148]\n*325IV.Appellants, however, contend that the federal courts may provide the standard which the Fourteenth Amendment lacks by reference to the provisions of the constitution of Tennessee. The argument is that although the same or greater disparities of electoral strength may be suffered to exist immune from federal judicial review in States where they result from apportionment legislation consistent with state constitutions, the Tennessee Legislature may not abridge the rights which, on its face, its own constitution appears to give, without by that act denying equal protection of the laws. It is said that the law of Tennessee, as expressed by the words of its written constitution, has made the basic choice among policies in favor of representation proportioned to population, and that it is no longer open to the State to allot its voting power on other principles.\n\nThis reasoning does not bear analysis. Like claims invoking state constitutional requirement have been rejected here and for good reason. It is settled that whatever federal consequences may derive from a discrimination worked by a state statute must be the same as if the same discrimination were written into the *326 State's fundamental law. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Browning, 310 U. S. 362. And see Castillo v. McConnico, 168 U. S. 674; Coulter v. Louisville & N. R. Co., 196 U. S. 599, 608-609; Owensboro Waterworks Co. v. Owensboro, 200 U. S. 38; Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U. S. 312, 316-317; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1, 11. Appellants complain of a practice which, by their own allegations, has been the law of Tennessee for sixty years. They allege that the Apportionment Act of 1901 created unequal districts when passed and still maintains unequal districts. They allege that the Legislature has since 1901 purposefully retained unequal districts. And the Supreme Court of Tennessee has refused to invalidate the law establishing these unequal districts. Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40; appeal dismissed here in 352 U. S. 920. In these circumstances, what was said in the Browning case, supra, at 369, clearly governs this case:\". . . Here, according to petitioner's own claim, all the organs of the state are conforming to a practice, systematic, unbroken for more than forty years, and now questioned for the first time. It would be a narrow conception of jurisprudence to confine the notion of `laws' to what is found written on the statute books, and to disregard the gloss which life has written upon it. Settled state practice cannot supplant constitutional guarantees, but it can establish what is state law. The Equal Protection Clause did not write an empty formalism into the Constitution. Deeply embedded traditional ways of carrying out state policy, such as those of which petitioner complains, are often tougher and truer law than the dead words of the written text. . . . [T]he Equal Protection Clause is not a command of candor. . . .\"*327 Tennessee's law and its policy respecting apportionment are what 60 years of practice show them to be, not what appellants cull from the unenforced and, according to its own judiciary, unenforceable words of its Constitution. The statute comes here on the same footing, therefore, as would the apportionment laws of New Jersey, California or Connecticut,[149] and is unaffected by its supposed repugnance to the state constitutional language on which appellants rely.[150]\n\nIn another aspect, however, the Kidd v. McCanless case, supra, introduces a factor peculiar to this litigation, which only emphasizes the duty of declining the exercise of federal judicial jurisdiction. In all of the apportionment cases which have come before the Court, a consideration which has been weighty in determining their non-justiciability has been the difficulty or impossibility of devising effective judicial remedies in this class of case. An injunction restraining a general election unless the legislature reapportions would paralyze the critical centers of a State's political system and threaten political dislocation whose consequences are not foreseeable. A declaration devoid *328 of implied compulsion of injunctive or other relief would be an idle threat.[151] Surely a Federal District Court could not itself remap the State: the same complexities which impede effective judicial review of apportionment a fortiori make impossible a court's consideration of these imponderables as an original matter. And the choice of elections at large as opposed to elections by district, however unequal the districts, is a matter of sweeping political judgment having enormous political implications, the nature and reach of which are certainly beyond the informed understanding of, and capacity for appraisal by, courts.\n\nIn Tennessee, moreover, the McCanless case has closed off several among even these unsatisfactory and dangerous modes of relief. That case was a suit in the state courts attacking the 1901 Reapportionment Act and seeking a declaration and an injunction of the Act's enforcement or, alternatively, a writ of mandamus compelling state election officials to hold the elections at large, or, again alternatively, a decree of the court reapportioning the State. The Chancellor denied all coercive relief, but entertained the suit for the purpose of rendering a declaratory judgment. It was his view that despite an invalidation of the statute under which the present legislature was elected, that body would continue to possess de facto authority to reapportion, and that therefore the maintaining of the suit did not threaten the disruption of the government. The Tennessee Supreme Court agreed that no coercive relief could be granted; in particular, it said, \"There is no provision of law for election of our General Assembly by an election at large over the State.\" 200 Tenn., at 277, 292 S. W. 2d, at 42. Thus, a legislature elected at *329 large would not be the legally constituted legislative authority of the State. The court reversed, however, the Chancellor's determination to give declaratory relief, holding that the ground of demurrer which asserted that a striking down of the statute would disrupt the orderly process of government should have been sustained:\"(4) It seems obvious and we therefore hold that if the Act of 1901 is to be declared unconstitutional, then the de facto doctrine cannot be applied to maintain the present members of the General Assembly in office. If the Chancellor is correct in holding that this statute has expired by the passage of the decade following its enactment then for the same reason all prior apportionment acts have expired by a like lapse of time and are non-existent. Therefore we would not only not have any existing members of the General Assembly but we would have no apportionment act whatever under which a new election could be held for the election of members to the General Assembly......\"The ultimate result of holding this Act unconstitutional by reason of the lapse of time would be to deprive us of the present Legislature and the means of electing a new one and ultimately bring about the destruction of the State itself.\" 200 Tenn., at 281-282, 292 S. W. 2d, at 44.A federal court enforcing the Federal Constitution is not, to be sure, bound by the remedial doctrines of the state courts. But it must consider as pertinent to the propriety or impropriety of exercising its jurisdiction those state-law effects of its decree which it cannot itself control. A federal court cannot provide the authority requisite to make a legislature the proper governing body of the State of Tennessee. And it cannot be doubted that the striking *330 down of the statute here challenged on equal protection grounds, no less than on grounds of failure to reapportion decennially, would deprive the State of all valid apportionment legislation andunder the ruling in McCanlessdeprive the State of an effective law-based legislative branch. Just such considerations, among others here present, were determinative in Luther v. Borden and the Oregon initiative cases.[152]\n\nAlthough the District Court had jurisdiction in the very restricted sense of power to determine whether it could adjudicate the claim, the case is of that class of political controversy which, by the nature of its subject, is unfit for federal judicial action. The judgment of the District Court, in dismissing the complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted, should therefore be affirmed.Dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER joins.The dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, in which I join, demonstrates the abrupt departure the majority makes from judicial history by putting the federal courts into this area of state concernsan area which, in this instance, the Tennessee state courts themselves have refused to enter.\n\nIt does not detract from his opinion to say that the panorama of judicial history it unfolds, though evincing a steadfast underlying principle of keeping the federal courts out of these domains, has a tendency, because of variants in expression, to becloud analysis in a given case. With due respect to the majority, I think that has happened here.\n\nOnce one cuts through the thicket of discussion devoted to \"jurisdiction,\" \"standing,\" \"justiciability,\" and \"political *331 question,\" there emerges a straightforward issue which, in my view, is determinative of this case. Does the complaint disclose a violation of a federal constitutional right, in other words, a claim over which a United States District Court would have jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3) and 42 U. S. C.  1983? The majority opinion does not actually discuss this basic question, but, as one concurring Justice observes, seems to decide it \"sub silentio.\" Ante, p. 261. However, in my opinion, appellants' allegations, accepting all of them as true, do not, parsed down or as a whole, show an infringement by Tennessee of any rights assured by the Fourteenth Amendment. Accordingly, I believe the complaint should have been dismissed for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. Rules Civ. Proc., Rule 12 (b) (6).\n\nIt is at once essential to recognize this case for what it is. The issue here relates not to a method of state electoral apportionment by which seats in the federal House of Representatives are allocated, but solely to the right of a State to fix the basis of representation in its own legislature. Until it is first decided to what extent that right is limited by the Federal Constitution, and whether what Tennessee has done or failed to do in this instance runs afoul of any such limitation, we need not reach the issues of \"justiciability\" or \"political question\" or any of the other considerations which in such cases as Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, led the Court to decline to adjudicate a challenge to a state apportionment affecting seats in the federal House of Representatives, in the absence of a controlling Act of Congress. See also Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1.\n\nThe appellants' claim in this case ultimately rests entirely on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It is asserted that Tennessee has violated the Equal Protection Clause by maintaining in effect a *332 system of apportionment that grossly favors in legislative representation the rural sections of the State as against its urban communities. Stripped to its essentials the complaint purports to set forth three constitutional claims of varying breadth:(1) The Equal Protection Clause requires that each vote cast in state legislative elections be given approximately equal weight.(2) Short of this, the existing apportionment of state legislators is so unreasonable as to amount to an arbitrary and capricious act of classification on the part of the Tennessee Legislature, which is offensive to the Equal Protection Clause.(3) In any event, the existing apportionment is rendered invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment because it flies in the face of the Tennessee Constitution.For reasons given in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion, ante, pp. 325-327, the last of these propositions is manifestly untenable, and need not be dealt with further. I turn to the other two.I.I can find nothing in the Equal Protection Clause or elsewhere in the Federal Constitution which expressly or impliedly supports the view that state legislatures must be so structured as to reflect with approximate equality the voice of every voter. Not only is that proposition refuted by history, as shown by my Brother FRANKFURTER, but it strikes deep into the heart of our federal system. Its acceptance would require us to turn our backs on the regard which this Court has always shown for the judgment of state legislatures and courts on matters of basically local concern.\n\n*333 In the last analysis, what lies at the core of this controversy is a difference of opinion as to the function of representative government. It is surely beyond argument that those who have the responsibility for devising a system of representation may permissibly consider that factors other than bare numbers should be taken into account. The existence of the United States Senate is proof enough of that. To consider that we may ignore the Tennessee Legislature's judgment in this instance because that body was the product of an asymmetrical electoral apportionment would in effect be to assume the very conclusion here disputed. Hence we must accept the present form of the Tennessee Legislature as the embodiment of the State's choice, or, more realistically, its compromise, between competing political philosophies. The federal courts have not been empowered by the Equal Protection Clause to judge whether this resolution of the State's internal political conflict is desirable or undesirable, wise or unwise.\n\nWith respect to state tax statutes and regulatory measures, for example, it has been said that the \"day is gone when this Court uses the . . . Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws . . . because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.\" Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 488. I would think it all the more compelling for us to follow this principle of self-restraint when what is involved is the freedom of a State to deal with so intimate a concern as the structure of its own legislative branch. The Federal Constitution imposes no limitation on the form which a state government may take other than generally committing to the United States the duty to guarantee to every State \"a Republican Form of Government.\" And, as my Brother FRANKFURTER so conclusively proves (ante, pp. 308-317), no intention to fix immutably the *334 means of selecting representatives for state governments could have been in the minds of either the Founders or the draftsmen of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn short, there is nothing in the Federal Constitution to prevent a State, acting not irrationally, from choosing any electoral legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interests, temper, and customs of its people. I would have thought this proposition settled by MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281, in which the Court observed (at p. 283) that to \"assume that political power is a function exclusively of numbers is to disregard the practicalities of government,\" and reaffirmed by South v. Peters, 339 U. S. 276. A State's choice to distribute electoral strength among geographical units, rather than according to a census of population, is certainly no less a rational decision of policy than would be its choice to levy a tax on property rather than a tax on income. Both are legislative judgments entitled to equal respect from this Court.II.The claim that Tennessee's system of apportionment is so unreasonable as to amount to a capricious classification of voting strength stands up no better under dispassionate analysis.\n\nThe Court has said time and again that the Equal Protection Clause does not demand of state enactments either mathematical identity or rigid equality. E. g., Allied Stores of Ohio v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 522, 527-528, and authorities there cited; McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 425-426. All that is prohibited is \"invidious discrimination\" bearing no rational relation to any permissible policy of the State. Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., supra, at 489. And in deciding whether such discrimination has been practiced by a State, it must be borne in mind that a \"statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived *335 to justify it.\" McGowan v. Maryland, supra. It is not inequality alone that calls for a holding of unconstitutionality; only if the inequality is based on an impermissible standard may this Court condemn it.\n\nWhat then is the basis for the claim made in this case that the distribution of state senators and representatives is the product of capriciousness or of some constitutionally prohibited policy? It is not that Tennessee has arranged its electoral districts with a deliberate purpose to dilute the voting strength of one race, cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339, or that some religious group is intentionally underrepresented. Nor is it a charge that the legislature has indulged in sheer caprice by allotting representatives to each county on the basis of a throw of the dice, or of some other determinant bearing no rational relation to the question of apportionment. Rather, the claim is that the State Legislature has unreasonably retained substantially the same allocation of senators and representatives as was established by statute in 1901, refusing to recognize the great shift in the population balance between urban and rural communities that has occurred in the meantime.\n\nIt is further alleged that even as of 1901 the apportionment was invalid, in that it did not allocate state legislators among the counties in accordance with the formula set out in Art. II,  5, of the Tennessee Constitution. In support of this the appellants have furnished a Table which indicates that as of 1901 six counties were overrepresented and 11 were underrepresented. But that Table in fact shows nothing in the way of significant discrepancy; in the instance of each county it is only one representative who is either lacking or added. And it is further perfectly evident that the variations are attributable to nothing more than the circumstance that the then enumeration of voters resulted in fractional remainders with respect to which the precise formula of the Tennessee Constitution was in some *336 instances slightly disregarded. Unless such de minimis departures are to be deemed of significance, these statistics certainly provide no substantiation for the charge that the 1901 apportionment was arbitrary and capricious. Indeed, they show the contrary.\n\nThus reduced to its essentials, the charge of arbitrariness and capriciousness rests entirely on the consistent refusal of the Tennessee Legislature over the past 60 years to alter a pattern of apportionment that was reasonable when conceived.\n\nA Federal District Court is asked to say that the passage of time has rendered the 1901 apportionment obsolete to the point where its continuance becomes vulnerable under the Fourteenth Amendment. But is not this matter one that involves a classic legislative judgment? Surely it lies within the province of a state legislature to conclude that an existing allocation of senators and representatives constitutes a desirable balance of geographical and demographical representation, or that in the interest of stability of government it would be best to defer for some further time the redistribution of seats in the state legislature.\n\nIndeed, I would hardly think it unconstitutional if a state legislature's expressed reason for establishing or maintaining an electoral imbalance between its rural and urban population were to protect the State's agricultural interests from the sheer weight of numbers of those residing in its cities. A State may, after all, take account of the interests of its rural population in the distribution of tax burdens, e. g., American Sugar Rfg. Co. v. Louisiana, 179 U. S. 89, and recognition of the special problems of agricultural interests has repeatedly been reflected in federal legislation, e. g., Capper-Volstead Act, 42 Stat. 388; Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 31. Even the exemption of agricultural activities from state criminal statutes of otherwise general application has not been deemed offensive to the Equal Protection Clause. *337 Tigner v. Texas, 310 U. S. 141. Does the Fourteenth Amendment impose a stricter limitation upon a State's apportionment of political representatives to its central government? I think not. These are matters of local policy, on the wisdom of which the federal judiciary is neither permitted nor qualified to sit in judgment.\n\nThe suggestion of my Brother FRANKFURTER that courts lack standards by which to decide such cases as this, is relevant not only to the question of \"justiciability,\" but also, and perhaps more fundamentally, to the determination whether any cognizable constitutional claim has been asserted in this case. Courts are unable to decide when it is that an apportionment originally valid becomes void because the factors entering into such a decision are basically matters appropriate only for legislative judgment. And so long as there exists a possible rational legislative policy for retaining an existing apportionment, such a legislative decision cannot be said to breach the bulwark against arbitrariness and caprice that the Fourteenth Amendment affords. Certainly, with all due respect, the facile arithmetical argument contained in Part II of my Brother CLARK'S separate opinion (ante, pp. 253-258) provides no tenable basis for considering that there has been such a breach in this instance. (See the Appendix to this opinion.)\n\nThese conclusions can hardly be escaped by suggesting that capricious state action might be found were it to appear that a majority of the Tennessee legislators, in refusing to consider reapportionment, had been actuated by self-interest in perpetuating their own political offices or by other unworthy or improper motives. Since Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, was decided many years ago, it has repeatedly been pointed out that it is not the business of the federal courts to inquire into the personal motives of legislators. E. g., Arizona v. California, 283 U. S. 423, 455 & n. 7. The function of the federal judiciary ends in *338 matters of this kind once it appears, as I think it does here on the undisputed facts, that the state action complained of could have rested on some rational basis. (See the Appendix to this opinion.)\n\nIt is my view that the majority opinion has failed to point to any recognizable constitutional claim alleged in this complaint. Indeed, it is interesting to note that my Brother STEWART is at pains to disclaim for himself, and to point out that the majority opinion does not suggest, that the Federal Constitution requires of the States any particular kind of electoral apportionment, still less that they must accord to each voter approximately equal voting strength. Concurring opinion, ante, p. 265. But that being so, what, may it be asked, is left of this complaint? Surely the bare allegations that the existing Tennessee apportionment is \"incorrect,\" \"arbitrary,\" \"obsolete\" and \"unconstitutional\"amounting to nothing more than legal conclusionsdo not themselves save the complaint from dismissal. See Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1; Collins v. Hardyman, 341 U. S. 651. Nor do those allegations shift to the appellees the burden of proving the constitutionality of this state statute; as is so correctly emphasized by my Brother STEWART (ante, p. 266), this Court has consistently held in cases arising under the Equal Protection Clause that \" `the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it.' Metropolitan Casualty Ins. Co. v. Brownell, 294 U. S. 580, 584.\" (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the appellants do not suggest that they could show at a trial anything beyond the matters previously discussed in this opinion, which add up to nothing in the way of a supportable constitutional challenge against this statute. And finally, the majority's failure to come to grips with the question whether the complaint states a claim cognizable under the Federal Constitutionan issue necessarily presented by appellees' motion to dismiss *339 does not of course furnish any ground for permitting this action to go to trial.\n\nFrom a reading of the majority and concurring opinions one will not find it difficult to catch the premises that underlie this decision. The fact that the appellants have been unable to obtain political redress of their asserted grievances appears to be regarded as a matter which should lead the Court to stretch to find some basis for judicial intervention. While the Equal Protection Clause is invoked, the opinion for the Court notably eschews explaining how, consonant with past decisions, the undisputed facts in this case can be considered to show a violation of that constitutional provision. The majority seems to have accepted the argument, pressed at the bar, that if this Court merely asserts authority in this field, Tennessee and other \"malapportioning\" States will quickly respond with appropriate political action, so that this Court need not be greatly concerned about the federal courts becoming further involved in these matters. At the same time the majority has wholly failed to reckon with what the future may hold in store if this optimistic prediction is not fulfilled. Thus, what the Court is doing reflects more an adventure in judicial experimentation than a solid piece of constitutional adjudication. Whether dismissal of this case should have been for want of jurisdiction or, as is suggested in Bell v. Hood, 327 U. S. 678, 682-683, for failure of the complaint to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, the judgment of the District Court was correct.\n\nIn conclusion, it is appropriate to say that one need not agree, as a citizen, with what Tennessee has done or failed to do, in order to deprecate, as a judge, what the majority is doing today. Those observers of the Court who see it primarily as the last refuge for the correction of all inequality or injustice, no matter what its nature or source, will no doubt applaud this decision and its break *340 with the past. Those who consider that continuing national respect for the Court's authority depends in large measure upon its wise exercise of self-restraint and discipline in constitutional adjudication, will view the decision with deep concern.\n\nI would affirm.APPENDIX TO OPINION OF MR. JUSTICE HARLAN.THE INADEQUACY OF ARITHMETICAL FORMULAS AS MEASURES OF THE RATIONALITY OF TENNESSEE'S APPORTIONMENT.Two of the three separate concurring opinions appear to concede that the Equal Protection Clause does not guarantee to each state voter a vote of approximately equal weight for the State Legislature. Whether the existing Tennessee apportionment is constitutional is recognized to depend only on whether it can find \"any possible justification in rationality\" (ante, p. 265); it is to be struck down only if \"the discrimination here does not fit any pattern\" (ante, p. 258).\n\nOne of the concurring opinions, that of my Brother STEWART, suggests no reasons which would justify a finding that the present distribution of state legislators is unconstitutionally arbitrary. The same is true of the majority opinion. My Brother CLARK, on the other hand, concludes that \"the apportionment picture in Tennessee is a topsy-turvical of gigantic proportions\" (ante, p. 254), solely on the basis of certain statistics presented in the text of his separate opinion and included in a more extensive Table appended thereto. In my view, that analysis is defective not only because the \"total representation\" formula set out in footnote 7 of the opinion (ante, p. 255), rests on faulty mathematical foundations, but, more basically, because the approach taken wholly *341 ignores all other factors justifying a legislative determination of the sort involved in devising a proper apportionment for a State Legislature.\n\nIn failing to take any of such other matters into account and in focusing on a particular mathematical formula which, as will be shown, is patently unsound, my Brother CLARK'S opinion has, I submit, unwittingly served to bring into bas-relief the very reasons that support the view that this complaint does not state a claim on which relief could be granted. For in order to warrant holding a state electoral apportionment invalid under the Equal Protection Clause, a court, in line with well-established constitutional doctrine, must find that none of the permissible policies and none of the possible formulas on which it might have been based could rationally justify particular inequalities.I.At the outset, it cannot be denied that the apportionment rules explicitly set out in the Tennessee Constitution are rational. These rules are based on the following obviously permissible policy determinations: (1) to utilize counties as electoral units; (2) to prohibit the division of any county in the composition of electoral districts; (3) to allot to each county that has a substantial voting populationat least two-thirds of the average voting population per countya separate \"direct representative\"; (4) to create \"floterial\" districts (multicounty representative districts) made up of more than one county; and (5) to require that such districts be composed of adjoining counties.[1] Such a framework unavoidably *342 leads to unreliable arithmetic inequalities under any mathematical formula whereby the counties' \"total representation\" is sought to be measured. It particularly results in egregiously deceptive disparities if the formula proposed in my Brother CLARK'S opinion is applied.\n\nThat formula computes a county's \"total representation\" by adding (1) the number of \"direct representatives\" the county is entitled to elect; (2) a fraction of any other seats in the Tennessee House which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a \"floterial district\"; (3) triple the number of senators the county is entitled to elect alone; and (4) triple a fraction of any seats in the Tennessee Senate which are allocated to that county jointly with one or more others in a multicounty senatorial district. The fractions used for items (2) and (4) are computed by allotting to each county in a combined district an equal share of the House or Senate seat, regardless of the voting population of each of the counties that make up the election district.[2]\n*343 This formula is patently deficient in that it eliminates from consideration the relative voting power of the counties that are joined together in a single election district. As a result, the formula unrealistically assigns to Moore County one-third of a senator, in addition to its direct representative (ante, p. 255), although it must be obvious that Moore's voting strength in the Eighteenth Senatorial District is almost negligible. Since Moore County could cast only 2,340 votes of a total eligible vote of 30,478 in the senatorial district, it should in truth be considered as represented by one-fifteenth of a senator. Assuming, arguendo, that any \"total representation\" figure is of significance, Moore's \"total representation\" should be 1.23, not 2.[3]\n\nThe formula suggested by my Brother CLARK must be adjusted regardless whether one thinks, as I assuredly do not, that the Federal Constitution requires that each vote be given equal weight. The correction is necessary simply to reflect the real facts of political life. It may, of course, be true that the floterial representative's \"function *344 is to represent the whole district\" (ante, p. 256). But can it be gainsaid that so long as elections within the district are decided not by a county-unit system, in which each county casts one vote, but by adding the total number of individual votes cast for each candidate, the concern of the elected representatives will primarily be with the most populous counties in the district?II.I do not mean to suggest that any mathematical formula, albeit an \"adjusted\" one, would be a proper touchstone to measure the rationality of the present or of appellants' proposed apportionment plan. For, as the Table appended to my Brother CLARK'S opinion so conclusively shows, whether one applies the formula he suggests or one that is adjusted to reflect proportional voting strength within an election district, no plan of apportionment consistent with the principal policies of the Tennessee Constitution could provide proportionately equal \"total representation\" for each of Tennessee's 95 counties.\n\nThe pattern suggested by the appellants in Exhibits \"A\" and \"B\" attached to their complaint is said to be a \"fair distribution\" which accords with the Tennessee Constitution, and under which each of the election districts represents approximately equal voting population. But even when tested by the \"adjusted\" formula, the plan reveals gross \"total representation\" disparities that would make it appear to be a \"crazy quilt.\" For example, Loudon County, with twice the voting population of Humphreys County would have less representation than Humphreys, and about one-third the representation of Warren County, which has only 73 more voters. Among the more populous counties, similar discrepancies would appear. Although Anderson County has only somewhat over 10% more voters than Blount County, it would have *345 approximately 75% more representation. And Blount would have approximately two-thirds the representation of Montgomery County, which has about 13% less voters.[4]III.The fault with a purely statistical approach to the case at hand lies not with the particular mathematical formula used, but in the failure to take account of the fact that a multitude of legitimate legislative policies, along with circumstances of geography and demography, could account for the seeming electoral disparities among counties. The principles set out in the Tennessee Constitution are just some of those that were deemed significant. Others may have been considered and accepted by those entrusted with the responsibility for Tennessee's apportionment. And for the purposes of judging constitutionality under the Equal Protection Clause it must be remembered that what is controlling on the issue of \"rationality\" is not what the State Legislature may actually have considered but what it may be deemed to have considered.\n\nFor example, in the list of \"horribles\" cited by my Brother CLARK (ante, p. 255), all the \"underrepresented\" counties are semiurban: all contain municipalities of over 10,000 population.[5] This is not to say, however, that the *346 presence of any such municipality within a county necessarily demands that its proportional representation be reduced in order to render it consistent with an \"urban versus rural\" plan of apportionment. Other considerations may intervene and outweigh the Legislature's desire to distribute seats so as to achieve a proper balance between urban and rural interests. The size of a county, in terms of its total area, may be a factor.[6] Or the location within a county of some major industry may be thought to call for dilution of voting strength.[7] Again, the combination of certain smaller counties with their more heavily populated neighbors in senatorial or \"floterial\" districts may result in apparent arithmetic inequalities.[8]\n\nMore broadly, the disparities in electoral strength among the various counties in Tennessee, both those relied upon by my Brother CLARK and others, may be *347 accounted for by various economic,[9] political,[10] and geographic[11] considerations. No allegation is made by the appellants that the existing apportionment is the result of any other forces than are always at work in any legislative process; and the record, briefs, and arguments in this Court themselves attest to the fact that the appellants could put forward nothing further at a trial.\n\nBy disregarding the wide variety of permissible legislative considerations that may enter into a state electoral apportionment my Brother CLARK has turned a highly complex process into an elementary arithmetical puzzle. *348 It is only by blinking reality that such an analysis can stand and that the essentially legislative determination can be made the subject of judicial inquiry.IV.Apart from such policies as those suggested which would suffice to justify particular inequalities, there is a further consideration which could rationally have led the Tennessee Legislature, in the exercise of a deliberate choice, to maintain the status quo. Rigidity of an apportionment pattern may be as much a legislative policy decision as is a provision for periodic reapportionment. In the interest of stability, a State may write into its fundamental law a permanent distribution of legislators among its various election districts, thus forever ignoring shifts in population. Indeed, several States have achieved this result by providing for minimum and maximum representation from various political subdivisions such as counties, districts, cities, or towns. See Harvey, Reapportionments of State Legislatures Legal Requirements, 17 Law & Contemp. Probs. (1952), 364, 368-372.\n\nIt is said that one cannot find any rational standard in what the Tennessee Legislature has failed to do over the past 60 years. But surely one need not search far to find rationality in the Legislature's continued refusal to recognize the growth of the urban population that has accompanied the development of industry over the past half decade. The existence of slight disparities between rural areas does not overcome the fact that the foremost apparent legislative motivation has been to preserve the electoral strength of the rural interests notwithstanding shifts in population. And I understand it to be conceded by at least some of the majority that this policy is not *349 rendered unconstitutional merely because it favors rural voters.\n\nOnce the electoral apportionment process is recognized for what it isthe product of legislative give-and-take and of compromise among policies that often conflict the relevant constitutional principles at once put these appellants out of the federal courts.NOTES[1]  Public Acts of Tennessee, c. 122 (1901), now Tenn. Code Ann.  3-101 to 3-107. The full text of the 1901 Act as amended appears in an Appendix to this opinion, post, p. 237.\n\n[2]  The three-judge court was convened pursuant to the order of a single district judge, who, after he had reviewed certain decisions of this Court and found them distinguishable in features \"that may ultimately prove to be significant,\" held that the complaint was not so obviously without merit that he would be justified in refusing to convene a three-judge court. 175 F. Supp. 649, 652.\n\n[3]  We heard argument first at the 1960 Term and again at this Term when the case was set over for reargument. 366 U. S. 907.\n\n[4]  A county having less than, but at least two-thirds of, the population required to choose a Representative is allocated one Representative. See also Tenn. Const., Art. II,  6. A common and much more substantial departure from the number-of-voters or total-population standard is the guaranty of at least one seat to each county. See, e. g., Kansas Const., Art. 2,  2; N. J. Const., Art. 4,  3,  1.\n\nWhile the Tennessee Constitution speaks of the number of \"qualified voters,\" the exhibits attached to the complaint use figures based on the number of persons 21 years of age and over. This basis seems to have been employed by the General Assembly in apportioning legislative seats from the outset. The 1870 statute providing for the first enumeration, Acts of 1870 (1st Sess.), c. 107, directed the courts of the several counties to select a Commissioner to enumerate \"all the male inhabitants of their respective counties, who are twenty-one years of age and upward, who shall be resident citizens of their counties on the first day of January, 1871 . . . .\" Reports compiled in the several counties on this basis were submitted to the General Assembly by the Secretary of State and were used in the first apportionment. Appendix to Tenn. S. J., 1871, 41-43. Yet such figures would not reflect the numbers of persons qualified to exercise the franchise under the then-governing qualifications: (a) citizenship; (b) residence in the State 12 months, and in the county 6 months; (c) payment of poll taxes for the preceding year unless entitled to exemption. Acts of 1870 (2d Sess.), c. 10. (These qualifications continued at least until after 1901. See Shan. Tenn. Code Ann.,  1167, 1220 (1896; Supp. 1904).) Still, when the General Assembly directed the Secretary of State to do all he could to obtain complete reports from the counties, the Resolution spoke broadly of \"the impossibility of . . . [redistricting] without the census returns of the voting population from each county . . . .\" Tenn. S. J., 1871, 46-47, 96. The figures also showed a correlation with Federal Census figures for 1870. The Census reported 259,016 male citizens 21 and upward in Tennessee. Ninth Census of the United States, 1870, Statistics of the Population 635 (1872). The Tennessee Secretary of State's Report, with 15 counties not reported, gave a figure of 237,431. Using the numbers of actual votes in the last gubernatorial election for those 15 counties, the Secretary arrived at a total of 250,025. Appendix to Tenn. S. J., 1871, 41-43. This and subsequent history indicate continued reference to Census figures and finally in 1901, abandonment of a state enumeration in favor of the use of Census figures. See notes 7, 8, 9, infra. See also Williams, Legislative Apportionment in Tennessee, 20 Tenn. L. Rev. 235, 236, n. 6. It would therefore appear that unless there is a contrary showing at the trial, appellant's current figures, taken from the United States Census Reports, are apposite.\n\n[5]  Acts of 1871 (1st Sess.), c. 146.\n\n[6]  Acts of 1870 (1st Sess.), c. 107.\n\n[7]  The statute authorizing the enumeration was Acts of 1881 (1st Sess.), c. 124. The enumeration commissioners in the counties were allowed \"access to the U. S. Census Reports of the enumeration of 1880, on file in the offices of the County Court Clerks of the State, and a reference to said reports by said commissioners shall be legitimate as an auxiliary in the enumeration required . . . .\" Ibid.,  4.\n\nThe United States Census reported 330,305 male citizens 21 and upward in Tennessee. The Tenth Census of the United States, 1880, Compendium 596 (1883). The Tennessee Secretary of State's Report gave a figure of 343,817, Tenn. H. J. (1st Extra. Sess.), 1881, 12-14 (1882).\n\nThe General Assembly was enlarged in accordance with the constitutional mandate since the State's population had passed 1,500,000. Acts of 1881 (1st Extra. Sess.), c. 5; and see, id., S. J. Res. No. III; see also Tenth Census of the United States, 1880, Statistics of the Population 77 (1881). The statute apportioning the General Assembly was Acts of 1881 (1st Extra. Sess.), c. 6.\n\n[8]  Acts of 1891, c. 22; Acts of 1891 (Extra. Sess.), c. 10. Reference to United States Census figures was allowed just as in 1881, see supra, n. 7. The United States Census reported 402,476 males 21 and over in Tennessee. The Eleventh Census of the United States, 1890, Population (Part I) 781 (1895). The Tennessee Secretary of State's Report gave a figure of 399,575. 1 Tenn. S. J., 1891, 473-474.\n\n[9]  Acts of 1901, S. J. Res. No. 35; Acts of 1901, c. 122. The Joint Resolution said: \"The Federal census of 1900 has been very recently taken and by reference to said Federal census an accurate enumeration of the qualified voters of the respective counties of the State of Tennessee can be ascertained and thereby save the expense of an actual enumeration . . . .\"\n\n[10]  For the history of legislative apportionment in Tennessee, including attempts made since 1901, see Tenn.

White. Examples of preliminary steps are: In 1911, the Senate called upon the Redistricting Committee to make an enumeration of qualified voters and to use the Federal Census of 1910 as the basis. Acts of 1911, S. J. Res. No. 60, p. 315. Similarly, in 1961, the Senate called for appointment of a select committee to make an enumeration of qualified voters. Acts of 1961, S. J. Res. No. 47. In 1955, the Senate called for a study of reapportionment. Tenn. S. J., 1955, 224; but see id., at 1403.

There is no provision for popular initiative in Tennessee. Amendments proposed in the Senate or House must first be approved by a majority of all members of each House and again by two-thirds of the members in the General Assembly next chosen. The proposals are then submitted to the people at the next general election in which a Governor is to be chosen. Alternatively, the legislature may submit to the people at any general election the question of calling a convention to consider specified proposals. Such as are adopted at a convention do not, however, become effective unless approved by a majority of the qualified voters voting separately on each proposed change or amendment at an election fixed by the convention. Conventions shall not be held oftener than once in six years. Tenn. Const., Art. XI,  3. Acts of 1951, c. 130,  3, and Acts of 1957, c. 340,  3, provided that delegates to the 1953 and 1959 conventions were to be chosen from the counties and floterial districts just as are members of the State House of Representatives. The General Assembly's call for a 1953 Constitutional Convention originally contained a provision \"relating to the appointment [sic] of representatives and senators\" but this was excised. Tenn. H. J., 1951, 784. A Resolution introduced at the 1959 Constitutional Convention and reported unfavorably by the Rules Committee of the Convention was as follows:\n\n\"By Mr. Chambliss (of Hamilton County), Resolution No. 12 Relative to Convention considering reapportionment, which is as follows:\n\n\"WHEREAS, there is a rumor that this Limited Convention has been called for the purpose of postponing for six years a Convention that would make a decision as to reapportionment; and\n\n\"WHEREAS, there is pending in the United States Courts in Tennessee a suit under which parties are seeking, through decree, to compel reapportionment; and\n\n\"WHEREAS, it is said that this Limited Convention, which was called for limited consideration, is yet a Constitutional Convention within the language of the Constitution as to Constitutional Conventions, forbidding frequent Conventions in the last sentence of Article Eleven, Section 3, second paragraph, more often than each six years, to-wit:\n\n\"`No such Convention shall be held oftener than once in six years.'\n\n\"NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, That it is the consensus of opinion of the members of this Convention that since this is a Limited Convention as hereinbefore set forth another Convention could be had if it did not deal with the matters submitted to this Limited Convention.\n\n\"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That it is the consensus of opinion of this Convention that a Convention should be called by the General Assembly for the purpose of considering reapportionment in order that a possibility of Court enforcement being forced on the Sovereign State of Tennessee by the Courts of the National Government may be avoided.\n\n\"BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, That this Convention be adjourned for two years to meet again at the same time set forth in the statute providing for this Convention, and that it is the consensus of opinion of this body that it is within the power of the next General Assembly of Tennessee to broaden the powers of this Convention and to authorize and empower this Convention to consider a proper amendment to the Constitution that will provide, when submitted to the electorate, a method of reapportionment.\" Tenn. Constitutional Convention of 1959, The Journal and Debates, 35, 278.\n\n[15]  It is clear that appellants' federal constitutional claims rest exclusively on alleged violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Their primary claim is that the 1901 statute violates the Equal Protection Clause of that amendment. There are allegations invoking the Due Process Clause but from the argument and the exhibits it appears that the Due Process Clause argument is directed at certain tax statutes. Insofar as the claim involves the validity of those statutes under the Due Process Clause we find it unnecessary to decide its merits. And if the allegations regarding the tax statutes are designed as the framework for proofs as to the effects of the allegedly discriminatory apportionment, we need not rely upon them to support our holding that the complaint states a federal constitutional claim of violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Whether, when the issue to be decided is one of the constitutional adequacy of this particular apportionment, taxation arguments and exhibits as now presented add anything, or whether they could add anything however presented, is for the District Court in the first instance to decide.\n\nThe complaint, in addition to the claims under the Federal Constitution, also alleges rights, and the General Assembly's duties, under the Tennessee Constitution. Since we hold that appellants haveif it develops at trial that the facts support the allegationsa cognizable federal constitutional cause of action resting in no degree on rights guaranteed or putatively guaranteed by the Tennessee Constitution, we do not consider, let alone enforce, rights under a State Constitution which go further than the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment. Lastly, we need not assess the legal significance, in reaching our conclusion, of the statements of the complaint that the apportionment effected today under the 1901 Act is \"contrary to the philosophy of government in the United States and all Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence . . . .\"\n\n[16]  We need not reach the question of indispensable parties because the District Court has not yet decided it.\n\n[17]  The accuracy of calling even such dismissals \"jurisdictional\" was questioned in Bell v. Hood. See 327 U. S., at 683.\n\n[18]  42 U. S. C.  1983 provides: \"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\"\n\n[19]  This Court has frequently sustained District Court jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3) or its predecessors to entertain suits to redress deprivations of rights secured against state infringement by the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157; Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117; cf. Nixon v. Herndon, 273 U. S. 536; Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73; Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167; Egan v. Aurora, 365 U. S. 514.\n\n[20]  Since that case was not brought to the Court until after the election had been held, the Court cited not only Wood v. Broom, but also directed dismissal for mootness, citing Brownlow v. Schwartz, 261 U. S. 216.\n\n[21]  Compare Boeing Aircraft Co. v. King County, 330 U. S. 803 (\"the appeal is dismissed for want of jurisdiction\"). See Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 440.\n\n[22]  Matthews did affirm a judgment that may be read as a dismissal for want of jurisdiction, 179 F. Supp. 470. However, the motion to affirm also rested on the ground of failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Cf. text following, on MacDougall v. Green. And see text, infra, p. 236.\n\n[23]  The Mayor of Nashville suing \"on behalf of himself and all residents of the City of Nashville, Davidson County, . . .\" and the Cities of Chattanooga (Hamilton County) and Knoxville (Knox County), each suing on behalf of its residents, were permitted to intervene as parties plaintiff. Since they press the same claims as do the initial plaintiffs, we find it unnecessary to decide whether the intervenors would have standing to maintain this action in their asserted representative capacities.\n\n[24]  The complaint also contains an averment that the appellants sue \"on their own behalf and on behalf of all other voters in the State of Tennessee.\" (Emphasis added.) This may be read to assert a claim that voters in counties allegedly over-represented in the General Assembly also have standing to complain. But it is not necessary to decide that question in this case.\n\n[25]  The duties of the respective appellees are alleged to be as follows:\n\n\"Defendant, Joe C. Carr, is the duly elected, qualified and acting Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville in said State, and as such he is charged with the duty of furnishing blanks, envelopes and information slips to the County Election Commissioners, certifying the results of elections and maintaining the records thereof; and he is further ex officio charged, together with the Governor and the Attorney General, with the duty of examining the election returns received from the County Election Commissioners and declaring the election results, by the applicable provisions of the Tennessee Code Annotated, and by Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1949, inter alia.\n\n\"Defendant, George F. McCanless, is the duly appointed and acting Attorney General of the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville in said State, and is charged with the duty of advising the officers of the State upon the law, and is made by Section 23-1107 of the Tennessee Code Annotated a necessary party defendant in any declaratory judgment action where the constitutionality of statutes of the State of Tennessee is attacked, and he is ex-officio charged, together with the Governor and the Secretary of State, with the duty of declaring the election results, under Section 2-140 of the Tennessee Code Annotated.\n\n\"Defendant, Jerry McDonald, is the duly appointed Coordinator of Elections in the State of Tennessee, with his office in Nashville, Tennessee, and as such official, is charged with the duties set forth in the public law enacted by the 1959 General Assembly of Tennessee creating said office.\n\n\"Defendant, Dr. Sam Coward, James Alexander, and Hubert Brooks are the duly appointed and qualified members constituting the State Board of Elections, and as such they are charged with the duty of appointing the Election Commissioners for all the counties of the State of Tennessee, the organization and supervision of the biennial elections as provided by the Statutes of Tennessee, Chapter 9 of Title 2 of the Tennessee Code Annotated, Sections 2-901, et seq.\n\n\"That this action is brought against the aforenamed defendants in their representative capacities, and that said Election Commissioners are sued also as representatives of all of the County Election Commissioners in the State of Tennessee, such persons being so numerous as to make it impracticable to bring them all before the court; that there is a common question of law involved, namely, the constitutionality of Tennessee laws set forth in the Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 3-101 through Section 3-109, inclusive; that common relief is sought against all members of said Election Commissions in their official capacities, it being the duties of the aforesaid County Election Commissioners, within their respective jurisdictions, to appoint the judges of elections, to maintain the registry of qualified voters of said County, certify the results of elections held in said County to the defendants State Board of Elections and Secretary of State, and of preparing ballots and taking other steps to prepare for and hold elections in said Counties by virtue of Sections 2-1201, et seq. of Tennessee Code Annotated, and Section 2-301, et seq. of Tennessee Code Annotated, and Chapter 164 of the Acts of 1949, inter alia.\"\n\nThe question whether the named defendants are sufficient parties remains open for consideration on remand.\n\n[26]  Smiley v. Holm, supra, at 361 (\" `citizen, elector and taxpayer' of the State\"); Koenig v. Flynn, supra, at 379 (\" `citizens and voters' of the State\") Wood v. Broom, supra, at 4 (\"citizen of Mississippi, a qualified elector under its laws, and also qualified to be a candidate for election as representative in Congress\"); cf. Carroll v. Becker, supra (candidate for office).\n\n[27]  Mr. Justice Rutledge was of the view that any question of standing was settled in Smiley v. Holm, supra; MR. JUSTICE BLACK stated \"that appellants had standing to sue, since the facts alleged show that they have been injured as individuals.\" He relied on Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433, 438, 467. See 328 U. S. 564, 568.\n\nCommentators have suggested that the following statement in MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER'S opinion might imply a view that appellants there had no standing: \"This is not an action to recover for damage because of the discriminatory exclusion of a plaintiff from rights enjoyed by other citizens. The basis for the suit is not a private wrong, but a wrong suffered by Illinois as a polity.\" 328 U. S., at 552. See Jaffe, Standing to Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 1265, 1298 (1961); Lewis, Legislative Apportionment and the Federal Courts, 71 Harv. L. Rev. 1057, 1081-1083 (1958). But since the opinion goes on to consider the merits, it seems that this statement was not intended to intimate any view that the plaintiffs in that action lacked standing. Nor do the cases cited immediately after the above quotation deal with standing. See especially Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268, 272-273.\n\n[28]  MacDougall v.

Braden, 16 How. 635, 657.\n\n[43]  This case, so frequently cited for the broad proposition that the status of an Indian tribe is a matter for the political departments, is in fact a noteworthy example of the limited and precise impact of a political question. The Cherokees brought an original suit in this Court to enjoin Georgia's assertion of jurisdiction over Cherokee territory and abolition of Cherokee government and laws. Unquestionably the case lay at the vortex of most fiery political embroilment. See 1 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 729-779. But in spite of some broader language in separate opinions, all that the Court held was that it possessed no original jurisdiction over the suit: for the Cherokees could in no view be considered either a State of this Union or a \"foreign state.\" Chief Justice Marshall treated the question as one of de novo interpretation of words in the Constitution. The Chief Justice did say that \"The acts of our government plainly recognize the Cherokee nation as a state, and the courts are bound by those acts,\" but here he referred to their existence \"as a state, as a distinct political society, separated from others . . . .\" From there he went to \"A question of much more difficulty . . . . Do the Cherokees constitute a foreign state in the sense of the constitution?\" Id., at 16. Thus, while the Court referred to \"the political\" for the decision whether the tribe was an entity, a separate polity, it held that whether being an entity the tribe had such status as to be entitled to sue originally was a judicially soluble issue: criteria were discoverable in relevant phrases of the Constitution and in the common understanding of the times. As to this issue, the Court was not hampered by problems of the management of unusual evidence or of possible interference with a congressional program. Moreover, Chief Justice Marshall's dictum that \"It savours too much of the exercise of political power to be within the proper province of the judicial department,\" id., at 20, was not addressed to the issue of the Cherokees' status to sue, but rather to the breadth of the claim asserted and the impropriety of the relief sought. Compare Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, 77. The Chief Justice made clear that if the issue of the Cherokees' rights arose in a customary legal context, \"a proper case with proper parties,\" it would be justiciable. Thus, when the same dispute produced a case properly brought, in which the right asserted was one of protection under federal treaties and laws from conflicting state law, and the relief sought was the voiding of a conviction under that state law, the Court did void the conviction. Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515. There, the fact that the tribe was a separate polity served as a datum contributing to the result, and despite the consequences in a heated federal-state controversy and the opposition of the other branches of the National Government, the judicial power acted to reverse the State Supreme Court. An example of similar isolation of a political question in the decision of a case is Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, see infra.\n\n[44]  7 How., at 29. And see 11 The Writings and Speeches of Daniel Webster 217 (1903).\n\n[45]  See Mowry, The Dorr War (1901), and its exhaustive bibliography. And for an account of circumstances surrounding the decicion here, see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 185-195.\n\nDorr himself, head of one of the two groups and held in a Rhode Island jail under a conviction for treason, had earlier sought a decision from the Supreme Court that his was the lawful government. His application for original habeas corpus in the Supreme Court was denied because the federal courts then lacked authority to issue habeas for a prisoner held under a state court sentence. Ex parte Dorr, 3 How. 103.\n\n[46]  7 How., at 39.\n\n[47]  Id., at 39, 40.\n\n[48]  Even though the Court wrote of unrestrained legislative and executive authority under this Guaranty, thus making its enforcement a political question, the Court plainly implied that the political question barrier was no absolute: \"Unquestionably a military government, established as the permanent government of the State, would not be a republican government, and it would be the duty of Congress to overthrow it.\" 7 How., at 45. Of course, it does not necessarily follow that if Congress did not act, the Court would. For while the judiciary might be able to decide the limits of the meaning of \"republican form,\" and thus the factor of lack of criteria might fall away, there would remain other possible barriers to decision because of primary commitment to another branch, which would have to be considered in the particular fact setting presented.\n\nThat was not the only occasion on which this Court indicated that lack of criteria does not obliterate the Guaranty's extreme limits: \"The guaranty is of a republican form of government. No particular government is designated as republican, neither is the exact form to be guaranteed, in any manner especially designated. Here, as in other parts of the instrument, we are compelled to resort elsewhere to ascertain what was intended.\n\n\"The guaranty necessarily implies a duty on the part of the States themselves to provide such a government. All the States had governments when the Constitution was adopted. In all the people participated to some extent, through their representatives elected in the manner specially provided. These governments the Constitution did not change. They were accepted precisely as they were, and it is, therefore, to be presumed that they were such as it was the duty of the States to provide. Thus we have unmistakable evidence of what was republican in form, within the meaning of that term as employed in the Constitution.\" Minor v. Happersett, 21 Wall. 162, 175-176. There, the question was whether a government republican in form could deny the vote to women.\n\nIn re Duncan, 139 U. S. 449, upheld a murder conviction against a claim that the relevant codes had been invalidly enacted. The Court there said:\n\n\"By the Constitution, a republican form of government is guaranteed to every State in the Union, and the distinguishing feature of that form is the right of the people to choose their own officers for governmental administration, and pass their own laws in virtue of the legislative power reposed in representative bodies, whose legitimate acts may be said to be those of the people themselves; but, while the people are thus the source of political power, their governments, National and State, have been limited by written constitutions, and they have themselves thereby set bounds to their own power, as against the sudden impulses of mere majorities.\" 139 U. S., at 461. But the Court did not find any of these fundamental principles violated.\n\n[49]  But cf. Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), 253 U. S. 221; National Prohibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350.\n\n[50]  6 Wall., at 65, 66.\n\n[51]  The First Reconstruction Act opened: \"Whereas no legal State governments . . . now exists [sic] in the rebel States of . . . Georgia [and] Mississippi . . . ; and whereas it is necessary that peace and good order should be enforced in said States until loyal and republican State governments can be legally established: . . .\" 14 Stat. 428. And see 15 Stat. 2, 14.\n\n[52]  In Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, the State sought to enjoin the President from executing the Acts, alleging that his role was purely ministerial. The Court held that the duties were in no sense ministerial, and that although the State sought to compel inaction rather than action, the absolute lack of precedent for any such distinction left the case one in which \"general principles . . . forbid judicial interference with the exercise of Executive discretion.\" 4 Wall., at 499. See also Mississippi v. Stanton, 154 U. S. 554; and see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed.), 463.\n\nFor another instance of congressional action challenged as transgressing the Guaranty Clause, see The Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 125-126, overruled, Graves v. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466.\n\n[53]  On the other hand, the implication of the Guaranty Clause in a case concerning congressional action does not always preclude judicial action. It has been held that the clause gives Congress no power to impose restrictions upon a State's admission which would undercut the constitutional mandate that the State be on an equal footing. Coyle v. Smith, 221 U. S. 559. And in Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, although Congress had determined that the State's government was not republican in form, the State's standing to bring an original action in this Court was sustained.\n\n[54]  See, infra, p. 235, considering Kidd v. McCanless, 352 U. S. 920.\n\n[55]  Boyd v. Nebraska ex rel. Thayer, 143 U. S. 135, 183 (Field, J., dissenting).\n\n[56]  Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 270 F. 2d 594, relying upon, inter alia, Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161.\n\n[57]  The Court's opinion was joined by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, noting his adherence to the dissents in Colegrove and South v. Peters, supra; and the judgment was concurred in by MR. JUSTICE WHITTAKER, who wrote that the decision should rest on the Equal Protection Clause rather than on the Fifteenth Amendment, since there had been not solely a denial of the vote (if there had been that at all) but also a \"fencing out\" of a racial group.\n\n[58]  No holding to the contrary is to be found in Cave v. Newell, 246 U. S. 650, dismissing a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Missouri, 272 Mo. 653, 199 S. W. 1014; or in Snowden v. Hughes, 321 U. S. 1.\n\n[59]  The ground of Mr. Justice Rutledge's vote to affirm is further explained in his footnote 3, 328 U. S., at 566: \" `The power of a court of equity to act is a discretionary one. . . . Where a federal court of equity is asked to interfere with the enforcement of state laws, it should do so only \"to prevent irreparable injury which is clear and imminent.\" ' American Federation of Labor v. Watson, 327 U. S. 582, 593 and cases cited.\"\n\nNo constitutional questions, including the question whether voters have a judicially enforceable constitutional right to vote at elections of congressmen from districts of equal population, were decided in Colegrove. Six of the participating Justices reached the questions but divided three to three on their merits. Mr. Justice Rutledge believed that it was not necessary to decide them. He said: \"There is [an alternative to constitutional decision] in this case. And I think the gravity of the constitutional questions raised so great, together with the possibilities for collision [with the political departments of the Government], that the admonition [against avoidable constitutional decision] is appropriate to be followed here. Other reasons support this view, including the fact that, in my opinion, the basic ruling and less important ones in Smiley v. Holm, supra, would otherwise be brought into question.\" 328 U. S., at 564-565. He also joined with his brethren who shared his view that the issues were justiciable in considering that Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1, decided no constitutional questions but \"the Court disposed of the cause on the ground that the 1929 Reapportionment Act, 46 Stat. 21, did not carry forward the requirements of the 1911 Act, 37 Stat. 13, and declined to decide whether there was equity in the bill.\" 328 U. S., at 565; see also, id., at 573. We agree with this view of Wood v. Broom.\n\n[60]  See also Buford v. State Board of Elections, 206 Tenn. 480, 334 S. W. 2d 726; State ex rel. Sanborn v. Davidson County Board of Election Comm'rs, No. 36,391 Tenn. Sup. Ct., Oct. 29, 1954 (unreported); 8 Vand. L. Rev. 501 (1955).DOUGLAS CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1]  I feel strongly that many of the cases cited by the Court and involving so-called \"political\" questions were wrongly decided.\n\nIn joining the opinion, I do not approve those decisions but only construe the Court's opinion in this case as stating an accurate historical account of what the prior cases have held.\n\n[2]  The statements in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 42, that this guaranty is enforceable only by Congress or the Chief Executive is not maintainable. Of course the Chief Executive, not the Court, determines how a State will be protected against invasion. Of course each House of Congress, not the Court, is \"the Judge of the Elections, Returns, and Qualifications of its own Members.\" Article I, Section 5, Clause 1. But the abdication of all judicial functions respecting voting rights (7 How., at 41), however justified by the peculiarities of the charter form of government in Rhode Island at the time of Dorr's Rebellion, states no general principle. It indeed is contrary to the cases discussed in the body of this opinionthe modern decisions of the Court that give the full panoply of judicial protection to voting rights. Today we would not say with Chief Justice Taney that it is no part of the judicial function to protect the right to vote of those \"to whom it is denied by the written and established constitution and laws of the State.\" Ibid.\n\nMoreover, the Court's refusal to examine the legality of the regime of martial law which had been laid upon Rhode Island (id., at 45-46) is indefensible, as Mr. Justice Woodbury maintained in his dissent. Id., at 59 et seq. Today we would ask with him: \". . . who could hold for a moment, when the writ of habeas corpus cannot be suspended by the legislature itself, either in the general government or most of the States, without an express constitutional permission, that all other writs and laws could be suspended, and martial law substituted for them over the whole State or country, without any express constitutional license to that effect, in any emergency?\" Id., at 67.\n\nJustice Woodbury went on to say:\n\n\"It would be alarming enough to sanction here an unlimited power, exercised either by legislatures, or the executive, or courts, when all our governments are themselves governments of limitations and checks, and of fixed and known laws, and the people a race above all others jealous of encroachments by those in power. And it is far better that those persons should be without the protection of the ordinary laws of the land who disregard them in an emergency, and should look to a grateful country for indemnity and pardon, than to allow, beforehand, the whole frame of jurisprudence to be overturned, and every thing placed at the mercy of the bayonet.\n\n\"No tribunal or department in our system of governments ever can be lawfully authorized to dispense with the laws, like some of the tyrannical Stuarts, or to repeal, or abolish, or suspend the whole body of them; or, in other words, appoint an unrestrained military dictator at the head of armed men.\n\n\"Whatever stretches of such power may be ventured on in great crises, they cannot be upheld by the laws, as they prostrate the laws and ride triumphant over and beyond them, however the Assembly of Rhode Island, under the exigency, may have hastily supposed that such a measure in this instance was constitutional. It is but a branch of the omnipotence claimed by Parliament to pass bills of attainder, belonging to the same dangerous and arbitrary family with martial law.\" Id., at 69-70.\n\nWhat he wrote was later to become the tradition, as expressed by Chief Justice Hughes in Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U. S. 378, 401: \"What are the allowable limits of military discretion, and whether or not they have been overstepped in a particular case, are judicial questions.\"\n\n[3]  The category of the \"political\" question is, in my view, narrower than the decided cases indicate. \"Even the English courts have held that a resolution of one House of Parliament does not change the law (Stockdale v. Hansard (1839), 9 A. & E. 1; and Bowles v. Bank of England (No. 2) [1913] 1 Ch. 57), and these decisions imply that the House of Commons acting alone does not constitute the `Parliament' recognized by the English courts.\" 103 Sol. Jour. 995, 996. The Court in Bowles v. Bank of England, [1913] 1 Ch. 57, 84-85, stated: \"By the statute 1 W. & M., usually known as the Bill of Rights, it was finally settled that there could be no taxation in this country except under authority of an Act of Parliament. The Bill of Rights still remains unrepealed, and no practice or custom, however prolonged, or however acquiesced in on the part of the subject, can be relied on by the Crown as justifying any infringement of its provisions. It follows that, with regard to the powers of the Crown to levy taxation, no resolution, either of the Committee for Ways and Means or of the House itself, has any legal effect whatever. Such resolutions are necessitated by a parliamentary procedure adopted with a view to the protection of the subject against the hasty imposition of taxes, and it would be strange to find them relied on as justifying the Crown in levying a tax before such tax is actually imposed by Act of Parliament.\"\n\nIn The Pocket Veto Case, 279 U. S. 655, the Court undertook a review of the veto provisions of the Constitution and concluded that the measure in litigation had not become a law. Cf. Coleman v. Miller, 307 U. S. 433.\n\nGeorgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50, involved the application of the Reconstruction Acts to Georgialaws which destroyed by force the internal regime of that State. Yet the Court refused to take jurisdiction. That question was no more \"political\" than a host of others we have entertained. See, e. g., Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579; Alabama v. Texas, 347 U. S. 272.\n\nToday would this Court hold nonjusticiable or \"political\" a suit to enjoin a Governor who, like Fidel Castro, takes everything into his own hands and suspends all election laws?\n\nGeorgia v. Stanton, supra, expresses a philosophy at war with Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, and Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304. The dominance of the civilian authority has been expressed from the beginning. See Wise v. Withers, 3 Cranch 331, 337; Sterling v. Constantin, supra, note 2.\n\n[4]  We are told by the National Institute of Municipal Law Officers in an amicus brief:\n\n\"Regardless of the fact that in the last two decades the United States has become a predominantly urban country where well over two-thirds of the population now lives in cities or suburbs, political representation in the majority of state legislatures is 50 or more years behind the times. Apportionments made when the greater part of the population was located in rural communities are still determining and undermining our elections.\n\n\"As a consequence, the municipality of 1960 is forced to function in a horse and buggy environment where there is little political recognition of the heavy demands of an urban population. These demands will become even greater by 1970 when some 150 million people will be living in urban areas.\n\n\"The National Institute of Municipal Law Officers has for many years recognized the wide-spread complaint that by far the greatest preponderance of state representatives and senators are from rural areas which, in the main, fail to become vitally interested in the increasing difficulties now facing urban administrators.\n\n\"Since World War II, the explosion in city and suburban population has created intense local problems in education, transportation, and housing. Adequate handling of these problems has not been possible to a large extent, due chiefly to the political weakness of municipalities. This situation is directly attributable to considerable under-representation of cities in the legislatures of most states.\" Amicus brief, pp. 2-3.\n\n[5]  The recent ruling by the Iowa Supreme Court that a legislature, though elected under an unfair apportionment scheme, is nonetheless a legislature empowered to act (Cedar Rapids v. Cox, 252 Iowa 948, 964, 108 N. W. 2d 253, 262-263; cf. Kidd v. McCanless, 200 Tenn. 273, 292 S. W. 2d 40) is plainly correct.\n\nThere need be no fear of a more disastrous collision between federal and state agencies here than where a federal court enjoins gerrymandering based on racial lines. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot, supra.\n\nThe District Court need not undertake a complete reapportionment. It might possibly achieve the goal of substantial equality merely by directing respondent to eliminate the egregious injustices. Or its conclusion that reapportionment should be made may in itself stimulate legislative action. That was the result in Asbury Park Press v. Woolley, 33 N. J. 1, 161 A. 2d 705, where the state court ruled it had jurisdiction:\n\n\"If by reason of passage of time and changing conditions the reapportionment statute no longer serves its original purpose of securing to the voter the full constitutional value of his franchise, and the legislative branch fails to take appropriate restorative action, the doors of the courts must be open to him. The law-making body cannot by inaction alter the constitutional system under which it has its own existence.\" 33 N. J., at 14, 161 A. 2d, at 711. The court withheld its decision on the merits in order that the legislature might have an opportunity to consider adoption of a reapportionment act. For the sequel see Application of Lamb, 67 N. J. Super. 39, 46-47, 169 A. 2d 822, 825-826.\n\nReapportionment was also the result in Magraw v. Donovan, 159 F. Supp. 901, where a federal three-judge District Court took jurisdiction, saying, 163 F. Supp. 184, 187:\n\n\"Here it is the unmistakable duty of the State Legislature to reapportion itself periodically in accordance with recent population changes. . . . Early in January 1959 the 61st Session of the Minnesota Legislature will convene, all of the members of which will be newly elected on November 4th of this year. The facts which have been presented to us will be available to them. It is not to be presumed that the Legislature will refuse to take such action as is necessary to comply with its duty under the State Constitution. We defer decision on all the issues presented (including that of the power of this Court to grant relief), in order to afford the Legislature full opportunity to `heed the constitutional mandate to redistrict.' \"\n\nSee 177 F. Supp. 803, where the case was dismissed as moot, the State Legislature having acted.CLARK CONCURRENCE FOOTNOTES[1]  The opinion stated at 551 that the Court \"could also dispose of this case on the authority of Wood v. Broom [287 U. S. 1 (1932)].\" Wood v. Broom involved only the interpretation of a congressional reapportionment Act.\n\n[2]  Similarly, the Equal Protection Clause was not invoked in Tedesco v. Board of Supervisors, 339 U. S. 940 (1950).\n\n[3]  I do not read the later case of Colegrove v. Barrett, 330 U. S. 804 (1947), as having rejected the equal protection argument adopted here. That was merely a dismissal of an appeal where the equal protection point was mentioned along with attacks under three other constitutional provisions, two congressional Acts, and three state constitutional provisions.\n\n[4]  Georgia based its election system on a consistent combination of political units and population, giving six unit votes to the eight most populous counties, four unit votes to the 30 counties next in population, and two unit votes to each of the remaining counties.\n\n[5]  See Part I of the Appendix to MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S dissent, post, p. 341.\n\n[6]  It is suggested that the districting is not unconstitutional since it was established by a statute that was constitutional when passed some 60 years ago. But many Assembly Sessions since that time have deliberately refused to change the original act, and in any event \"[a] statute [constitutionally] valid when enacted may become invalid by change in the conditions to which it is applied.\" Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Walters, 294 U. S. 405, 415 (1935).\n\n[7]  \"Total representation\" indicates the combined representation in the State Senate (33 members) and the State House of Representatives (99 members) in the Assembly of Tennessee. Assuming a county has one representative, it is credited in this calculation with 1/99. Likewise, if the same county has one-third of a senate seat, it is credited with another 1/99, and thus such a county, in our calculation, would have a \"total representation\" of two; if a county has one representative and one-sixth of a senate seat, it is credited with 1.5/99, or 1.50. It is this last figure that I use here in an effort to make the comparisons clear. The 1950 rather than the 1960 census of voting population is used to avoid the charge that use of 1960 tabulations might not have allowed sufficient time for the State to act. However, the 1960 picture is even more irrational than the 1950 one.\n\n[8]  Of course this was not the case in the Georgia county unit system, South v. Peters, supra, or the Illinois initiative plan, MacDougall v. Green, supra, where recognized political units having independent significance were given minimum political weight.\n\n[9]  It is interesting to note that state judges often rest their decisions on the ground that this Court has precluded adjudication of the federal claim. See, e. g., Scholle v. Secretary of State, 360 Mich. 1, 104 N. W. 2d 63 (1960).\n\n[10]  1 Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, 124.\n\n[11]  Kant, Perpetual Peace.\n\n[*]  It is worth reminding that the problem of legislative apportionment is not one dividing North and South. Indeed, in the present House of Representatives, for example, Michigan's congressional districts are far less representative of the numbers of inhabitants, according to the 1960 census, than are Louisiana's. Michigan's Sixteenth District, which is 93.1% urban, contains 802,994 persons and its Twelfth, which is 47.6% urban, contains 177,431one-fifth as many persons. Louisiana's most populous district, the Sixth, is 53.6% urban and contains 536,029 persons, and its least populous, the Eighth, 36.7% urban, contains 263,850nearly half. Gross disregard of any assumption that our political system implies even approximation to the notion that individual votes in the various districts within a State should have equal weight is as true, e. g., of California, Illinois, and Ohio as it is of Georgia. See United States Department of Commerce, Census Release, February 24, 1962, CB62-23.FRANKFURTER DISSENT FOOTNOTES[1]  See Wood v. Broom, 287 U. S. 1; Colegrove v. Green, 328 U.

Supp. 184 (D. C. D. Minn.); cf. Dyer v. Kazuhisa Abe, 138 F. Supp. 220 (D. C. D. Hawaii). And see Keogh v. Neely, 50 F. 2d 685 (C. A. 7th Cir.).\n\n[2]  Although the motion to intervene by the Mayor of Nashville asserted an interest in the litigation in only a representative capacity, the complaint which he subsequently filed set forth that he was a qualified voter who also sued in his own behalf. The municipalities of Knoxville and Chattanooga purport to represent their residents. Since the claims of the municipal intervenors do not differ materially from those of the parties who sue as individual voters, the Court need not now determine whether the municipalities are proper parties to this proceeding. See, e. g., Stewart v. Kansas City, 239 U. S. 14.\n\n[3]  The original complaint named as defendants Tennessee's Secretary of State, Attorney General, Coordinator of Elections, and the three members of the State Board of Elections, seeking to make the Board members representatives of all the State's County Election Commissioners. The prayer in an intervening complaint by the City of Knoxville, that the Commissioners of Elections of Knox County be added as parties defendant seems not to have been acted on by the court below. Defendants moved to dismiss, inter alia, on the ground of failure to join indispensable parties, and they argue in this Court that only the County Election Commissioners of the ninety-five counties are the effective administrators of Tennessee's elections laws, and that none of the defendants have substantial duties in connection therewith. The District Court deferred ruling on this ground of the motion. Inasmuch as it involves questions of local law more appropriately decided by judges sitting in Tennessee than by this Court, and since in any event the failure to join County Election Commissioners in this action looking to prospective relief could be corrected, if necessary, by amendment of the complaints, the issue does not concern the Court on this appeal.\n\n[4]  Jurisdiction is predicated upon R. S.  1979, 42 U. S. C.  1983, and 28 U. S. C.  1343 (3).\n\n[5]  However, counties having two-thirds of the ratio required for a Representative are entitled to seat one member in the House, and there are certain geographical restrictions upon the formation of Senate districts. The applicable provisions of Article II of the Tennessee Constitution are:\n\n\"Sec. 4. Census.An enumeration of the qualified voters, and an apportionment of the Representatives in the General Assembly, shall be made in the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy-one, and within every subsequent term of ten years.\"\n\n\"Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.\"\n\n\"Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no county shall be divided in forming a district.\"\n\n[6]  It is alleged that certain amendments to the Act of 1901 made only minor modifications of that Act, adjusting the boundaries of individual districts in a manner not material to plaintiffs' claims.\n\n[7]  The exhibits do not reveal the source of the population figures which they set forth, but it appears that the figures were taken from the United States Census of Population, 1950, Volume II, Part 42 (Tennessee), Table 41, at 76-91. These census figures represent the total population over twenty-one years of age in each Tennessee county; they do not purport to enumerate \"qualified voters\" or \"qualified electors,\" the measure of apportionment prescribed by the Tennessee Constitution. See note 5, supra. To qualify to vote in Tennessee, in addition to fulfilling the age requirement, an individual must be a citizen of the United States, a resident of the State for twelve months and of the county where he offers his vote for six months next preceding the election, and must not be under the disqualification attaching to conviction for certain offenses. Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  2-201, 2-205. The statistics found in the United States Census of Population, 1950, Volume II, Part 42 (Tennessee), Table 42, at 92-97, suggest that the residence requirement, in particular, may be an unknown variable of considerable significance. Appellants do not suggest a means by which a court, on the basis of the federal census figures, can determine the number of qualified voters in the various Tennessee counties.\n\n[8]  The \"county aid funds\" derived from a portion of a state gasoline privilege tax, for example, are distributed among the counties as follows: one-half equally among the ninety-five counties, one-quarter on the basis of area, one-quarter on the basis of population, to be used by county authorities in the building, repairing and improving of county roads and bridges. Tenn. Code Ann., 1955,  54-403. Appellants urge that this distribution is discriminatory.\n\n[9]  Plaintiffs also suggested, as an alternative to at-large elections, that the District Court might itself redistrict the State. They did not, however, expressly pray such relief.\n\n[10]  See Bickel, Foreword: The Passive Virtues, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 40, 45 et seq. (1961).\n\n[11]  See, e. g., United States v. Palmer, 3 Wheat. 610, 634, 635; The Divina Pastora, 4 Wheat. 52; Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415; Kennett v. Chambers, 14 How. 38; Doe v. Braden, 16 How. 635; Jones v. United States, 137 U. S. 202; Terlinden v. Ames, 184 U. S. 270; Charlton v. Kelly, 229 U. S. 447; Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 U. S. 297; Ex parte Peru, 318 U. S. 578; Clark v. Allen, 331 U. S. 503. Compare Foster and Elam v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, with United States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 691. Of course, judgment concerning the \"political\" nature of even a controversy affecting the Nation's foreign affairs is not a simple mechanical matter, and certain of the Court's decisions have accorded scant weight to the consideration of unity of action in the conduct of external relations. Compare Vermilya-Brown Co. v. Connell, 335 U. S. 377, with United States v. Pink, 315 U. S. 203.\n\n[12]  Obviously, this is the equivalent of saying that the characteristics are not \"constitutionally requisite\" in a judicially enforceable sense. The recognition of their necessity as a condition of legislation is left, as is observance of certain other constitutional commands, to the conscience of the non-judicial organs. Cf. Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66.\n\n[13]  Also compare the Coleman case and United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, with Hawke v. Smith (No. 1), 253 U. S. 221. See the National Prohibition Cases, 253 U. S. 350; and consider the Court's treatment of the several contentions in Leser v. Garnett, 258 U. S. 130.\n\n[14]  E. g., Myers v. Anderson, 238 U. S. 368; Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73; Lane v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649. The action for damages for improperly rejecting an elector's vote had been given by the English law since the time of Ashby v. White, 1 Brown's Cases in Parliament 62; 2 Ld. Raym. 938; 3 Ld. Raym. 320, a case which in its own day precipitated an intra-parliamentary war of major dimensions. See 6 Hansard, Parliamentary History of England (1810), 225-324, 376-436. Prior to the racial-discrimination cases, this Court had recognized the action, by implication, in dictum in Swafford v. Templeton, 185 U. S. 487, and Wiley v. Sinkler, 179 U. S. 58, both respecting federal elections.\n\n[15]  Cf. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339.\n\n[16]  By statute an action for preventive relief is now given the United States in certain voting cases. 71 Stat. 637, 42 U. S. C.  1971 (c), amending R. S.  2004. See United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17; United States v. Thomas, 362 U. S. 58.\n\n[17]  Compare Rhode Island v. Massachusetts, 12 Pet. 657, and cases following, with Georgia v. Stanton, 6 Wall. 50.\n\n[18]  Compare Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, with Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, 5 Pet. 1, 20, 28 (Mr. Justice Johnson, concurring), 51 and 75 (Mr. Justice Thompson, dissenting).\n\n[19]  This was an alternative ground of Chief Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court. Id., at 20. The question which Marshall reserved as \"unnecessary to decide,\" ibid., was not the justiciability of the bill in this aspect, but the \"more doubtful\" question whether that \"part of the bill which respects the land occupied by the Indians, and prays the aid of the court to protect their possession,\" might be entertained. Ibid. Mr. Justice Johnson, concurring, found the controversy non-justiciable and would have put the ruling solely on this ground, id., at 28, and Mr. Justice Thompson, in dissent, agreed that much of the matter in the bill was not fit for judicial determination. Id., at 51, 75.\n\n[20]  Cf. Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475.\n\n[21]  Considerations similar to those which determined the Cherokee Nation case and Georgia v. Stanton no doubt explain the celebrated decision in Nabob of the Carnatic v. East India Co., 1 Ves. jun. *371; 2 Ves. jun. *56, rather than any attribution of a portion of British sovereignty, in respect of Indian affairs, to the company. The reluctance of the English Judges to involve themselves in contests of factional political power is of ancient standing. In The Duke of York's Claim to the Crown, 5 Rotuli Parl. 375, printed in Wambaugh, Cases on Constitutional Law (1915), 1, the role which the Judges were asked to play appears to have been rather that of advocates than of judges, but the answer which they returned to the Lords relied on reasons equally applicable to either role.\n\n[22]  \"The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government, and shall protect each of them against Invasion; and on Application of the Legislature, or of the Executive (when the Legislature cannot be convened) against domestic Violence.\"\n\n[23]  Cf. the cases holding that the Fourteenth Amendment imposes no such restriction upon the form of a State's governmental organization as will permit persons affected by government action to complain that in its organization principles of separation of powers have been violated. E. g., Dreyer v. Illinois, 187 U. S. 71; Soliah v. Heskin, 222 U. S. 522; Houck v. Little River Drainage District, 239 U. S. 254. The same consistent refusal of this Court to find that the Federal Constitution restricts state power to design the structure of state political institutions is reflected in the cases rejecting claims arising out of the States' creation, alteration, or destruction of local subdivisions or their powers, insofar as these claims are made by the subdivisions themselves, see Laramie County v. Albany County, 92 U. S. 307; Pawhuska v. Pawhuska Oil & Gas Co., 250 U. S. 394; Trenton v. New Jersey, 262 U. S. 182; Risty v. Chicago, R. I. & P. R. Co., 270 U. S. 378, 389-390; Williams v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 289 U. S. 36, or by the whole body of their residents who share only a general, undifferentiated interest in their preservation. See Hunter v. Pittsburgh, 207 U. S. 161. The policy is also given effect by the denial of \"standing\" to persons seeking to challenge state action as infringing the interest of some separate unit within the State's administrative structurea denial which precludes the arbitrament by federal courts of what are only disputes over the local allocation of government functions and powers. See, e. g., Smith v. Indiana, 191 U. S. 138; Braxton County Court v. West Virginia, 208 U. S. 192; Marshall v. Dye, 231 U. S. 250; Stewart v. Kansas City, 239 U. S. 14.\n\n[24]  223 U. S., at 141. \". . . [T]he contention, if held to be sound, would necessarily affect the validity, not only of the particular statute which is before us, but of every other statute passed in Oregon since the adoption of the initiative and referendum. And indeed the propositions go further than this, since in their essence they assert that there is no governmental function, legislative or judicial, in Oregon, because it cannot be assumed, if the proposition be well founded, that there is at one and the same time one and the same government which is republican in form and not of that character.\" Compare Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 38-39:\n\n\". . . For, if this court is authorized to enter upon this inquiry as proposed by the plaintiff, and it should be decided that the charter government had no legal existence during the period of time above mentioned,if it had been annulled by the adoption of the opposing government,then the laws passed by its legislature during that time were nullities; its taxes wrongfully collected; its salaries and compensation to its officers illegally paid; its public accounts improperly settled; and the judgments and sentences of its courts in civil and criminal cases null and void, and the officers who carried their decisions into operation answerable as trespassers, if not in some cases as criminals.\n\n\"When the decision of this court might lead to such results, it becomes its duty to examine very carefully its own powers before it undertakes to exercise jurisdiction.\"\n\n[25]  See Bowen, The Recent Contest in Rhode Island (1844); Frieze, A Concise History of the Efforts to Obtain an Extension of Suffrage in Rhode Island; From the Year 1811 to 1842 (2d ed. 1842); Mowry, The Dorr War (1901); Wayland, The Affairs of Rhode Island (2d ed. 1842).\n\n[26]  The Court reasoned, with respect to the guarantee against domestic violence also contained in Art. IV,  4, that this, too, was an authority committed solely to Congress; that Congress had empowered the President, not the courts, to enforce it; and that it was inconceivable that the courts should assume a power to make determinations in the premises which might conflict with those of the Executive. It noted further that, in fact, the President had recognized the governor of the charter government as the lawful authority in Rhode Island, although it had been unnecessary to call out the militia in his support.\n\n[27]  See note 24, supra.\n\n[28]  Id., at 39, 46-47.\n\n[29]  Id., at 41-42.\n\n[30]  In evaluating the Court's determination not to inquire into the authority of the charter government, it must be remembered that, throughout the country, Dorr \"had received the sympathy of the Democratic press. His cause, therefore, became distinctly a party issue.\" 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (Rev. ed. 1937), 186.\n\n[31]  Appellants also allege discrimination in the legislature's allocation of certain tax burdens and benefits. Whether or not such discrimination would violate the Equal Protection Clause if the tax statutes were challenged in a proper proceeding, see Dane v. Jackson, 256 U. S. 589; cf. Nashville, C. & St. L. R. Co. v. Wallace, 288 U. S. 249, 268, these recitative allegations do not affect the nature of the controversy which appellants' complaints present.\n\n[32]  Appellants would find a \"right\" to have one's ballot counted on authority of United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383; United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299; United States v. Saylor, 322 U. S. 385. All that these cases hold is that conspiracies to commit certain sharp election practices which, in a federal election, cause ballots not to receive the weight which the law has in fact given them, may amount to deprivations of the constitutionally secured right to vote for federal officers. But see United States v. Bathgate, 246 U. S. 220.

Some counted all inhabitants, e. g., N. J. Const., 1844, Art. IV,  3; some, only white inhabitants, e. g., Ill. Const., 1848, Art. III,  8; some, male inhabitants over twenty-one, e. g., Ind. Const., 1851, Art. IV,  4-5; some, qualified voters, e. g., Tenn. Const., 1834, Art. II,  4 to 6; some excluded aliens, e. g., N. Y. Const., 1846, Art. III,  4, 5 (and untaxed persons of color); some excluded untaxed Indians and military personnel, e. g., Neb. Const., 1866-1867, Art. II,  3. For present purposes these differences, although not unimportant as revealing fundamental divergences in representation theory, will be disregarded.\n\n[85]  Ore. Const., 1857, Art. IV,  5, 6, 7; Ill. Const., 1848, Art. III,  8, 9; Ind. Const., 1851, Art. IV,  4, 5, 6; Minn. Const., 1857, Art. IV,  2; Wis. Const., 1848, Art. IV,  3 to 5; Mass. Const., 1780, Amends. XXI, XXII; Neb. Const., 1866-1867, Art. II,  3. All of these but Minnesota made provision for periodic reapportionment. Nevada's Constitution of 1864, Art. XV,  13, provided that the federal censuses and interim state decennial enumerations should serve as the bases of representation for both houses, but did not expressly require either numerical equality or reapportionment at fixed intervals.\n\nSeveral of these constitutions contain provisions which forbid splitting counties or which otherwise require recognition of local boundaries. See, e. g., the severe restriction in Ill. Const., 1848, Art. III,  9. Such provisions will almost inevitably produce numerical inequalities. See, for example, University of Oklahoma, Bureau of Government Research, Legislative Apportionment in Oklahoma (1956), 21-23. However, because their effect in this regard will turn on idiosyncratic local factors, and because other constitutional provisions are a more significant source of inequality, these provisions are here disregarded.\n\n[86]  Tenn. Const., 1834, Art. II,  4 to 6 (two-thirds of a ratio entitles a county to one representative in the House); W. Va. Const., 1861-1863, Art. IV,  4, 5, 7, 8, 9 (one-half of a ratio entitles a county to one representative in the House); Mich. Const., 1850, Art. IV,  2 to 4 (one-half of a ratio entitles each county thereafter organized to one representative in the House). In Oregon and Iowa a major-fraction rule applied which gave a House seat not only to counties having a moiety of a single ratio, but to all counties having more than half a ratio in excess of the multiple of a ratio. Ore. Const., 1857, Art. IV,  6, note 85, supra; Iowa Const., 1857, Art. III,  33, 34, 35, 37, note 89, infra.\n\n[87]  See Bone, States Attempting to Comply with Reapportionment Requirements, 17 Law & Contemp. Prob. 387, 391 (1952).\n\n[88]  It also appears, although the section is not altogether clear, that the provisions of West Virginia's Constitution controlling apportionment of senators would operate in favor of the State's less populous regions by limiting any single county to a maximum of two senators.

The Virginia Constitutions and Texas' provisions for apportioning its lower chamber do not in terms require equality of numbers, although they call for reapportionment following a census. In Arkansas, the legislature was authorized, but not commanded, to reapportion periodically; it is not clear that equality was required.\n\n[106]  N. C. Const., 1868, Art. II,  6, 7. See Art.

The extent of legislative authority to alter the apportionment is unclear, but it appears that the three-tiered structure is meant to be permanent.\n\n[114]  See, e. g., Durfee, Apportionment of Representation in the Legislature: A Study of State Constitutions, 43 Mich.

The Colorado and Utah Constitutions provide for reapportionment \"according to ratios to be fixed by law\" after periodic census and enumeration. In New Mexico the legislature is authorized, but not commanded, to reapportion periodically. North Dakota does not in terms demand equality in House representation; members are to be assigned among the several senatorial districts, which are of equal population.\n\n[118]  Wyo.

On the basis of 1910 census figures, this apportionment yielded, for example, a senatorial-ratio differential of more than four to one between Mohave and Cochise or between Mohave and Maricopa Counties.

Moreover, state constitutions generally speak with a specificity totally lacking in attempted utilization of the generalities of the Fourteenth Amendment to apportionment matters. Some expressly commit apportionment to state judicial review, see, e. g., N. Y. Const., 1938, Art. III,  5, and even where they do not, they do precisely fix the criteria for judicial judgment respecting the allocation of representative strength within the electorate. See, e. g., Asbury Park Press. Inc., v. Woolley. 33 N. J. 1, 161 A. 2d 705.\n\n[151]  Appellants' suggestion that, although no relief may need be given, jurisdiction ought to be retained as a \"spur\" to legislative action does not merit discussion.\n\n[152]  See note 24, supra.HARLAN APPENDIX FOOTNOTES[1]  The relevant provisions of the Tennessee Constitution are Art. II,  5 and 6:\n\n\"Sec. 5. Apportionment of representatives.The number of Representatives shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts, according to the number of qualified voters in each; and shall not exceed seventy-five, until the population of the State shall be one million and a half, and shall never exceed ninety-nine; Provided, that any county having two-thirds of the ratio shall be entitled to one member.\n\n\"Sec. 6. Apportionment of senators.The number of Senators shall, at the several periods of making the enumeration, be apportioned among the several counties or districts according to the number of qualified electors in each, and shall not exceed one-third the number of representatives. In apportioning the Senators among the different counties, the fraction that may be lost by any county or counties, in the apportionment of members to the House of Representatives, shall be made up to such county or counties in the Senate, as near as may be practicable. When a district is composed of two or more counties, they shall be adjoining; and no counties shall be divided in forming a district.\"\n\n[2]  This formula is not clearly spelled out in the opinion, but it is necessarily inferred from the figures that are presented. Knox County, for example, is said to have a \"total representation\" of 7.25. It elects (1) three direct representatives (value 3.00); (2) one representative from a two-county district (value .50); (3) one direct senator (value 3.00); and (4) one senator in a four-county district (value .75). See Appendix to opinion of MR. JUSTICE CLARK, ante, pp. 262-264.\n\n[3]  If this \"adjusted\" formula for measuring \"total representation\" is applied to the other \"horribles\" cited in the concurring opinion (ante, p. 255), it reveals that these countieswhich purportedly have equal \"total representation\" but distinctly unequal voting population do not have the same \"total representation\" at all. Rather than having the same representation as Rutherford County, Moore County has only about 40% of what Rutherford has. Decatur County has only 55% of the representation of Carter County. While Loudon and Anderson Counties are substantially underrepresented, this is because of their proximity to Knox County, which outweighs their votes in the Sixth Senatorial District and in the Eighth Floterial District.\n\n[4]  These disparities are as serious, if not more so, when my Brother CLARK'S formula is applied to the appellants' proposal. For example, if the seven counties chosen by him as illustrative are examined as they would be represented under the appellants' distribution, Moore County, with a voting population of 2,340, is given more electoral strength than Decatur County, with a voting population of 5,563. Carter County (voting population 23,302) has 20% more \"total representation\" than Anderson County (voting population 33,990), and 33% more than Rutherford County (voting population 25,316).\n\n[5]  Murfreesboro, Rutherford County (pop. 16,017); Elizabethton, Carter County (pop. 10,754); Oak Ridge, Anderson County (pop. 27,387). Tennessee Blue Book, 1960, pp. 143-149.\n\n[6]  For example, Carter and Washington Counties are each approximately 60% as large as Maury and Madison Counties in terms of square miles, and this may explain the disparity between their \"total representation\" figures.\n\n[7]  For example, in addition to being \"semi-urban,\" Blount County is the location of the City of Alcoa, where the Aluminum Company of America has located a large aluminum smelting and rolling plant. This may explain the difference between its \"total representation\" and that of Gibson County, which has no such large industry and contains no municipality as large as Maryville.\n\n[8]  For example, Chester County (voting population 6,391) is one of those that is presently said to be overrepresented. But under the appellants' proposal, Chester would be combined with populous Madison County in a \"floterial district\" and with four others, including Shelby County, in a senatorial district. Consequently, its total representation according to the Appendix to my Brother CLARK'S opinion would be .19. (Ante, p. 262.) This would have the effect of disenfranchising all the county's voters. Similarly, Rhea County's almost 9,000 voters would find their voting strength so diluted as to be practically nonexistent.\n\n[9]  For example, it is primarily the eastern portion of the State that is complaining of malapportionment (along with the Cities of Memphis and Nashville). But the eastern section is where industry is principally located and where population density, even outside the large urban areas, is highest. Consequently, if Tennessee is apportioning in favor of its agricultural interests, as constitutionally it was entitled to do, it would necessarily reduce representation from the east.\n\n[10]  For example, sound political reasons surely justify limiting the legislative chambers to workable numbers; in Tennessee, the House is set at 99 and the Senate at 33. It might have been deemed desirable, therefore, to set a ceiling on representation from any single county so as not to deprive others of individual representation. The proportional discrepancies among the four counties with large urban centers may be attributable to a conscious policy of limiting representation in this manner.\n\n[11]  For example, Moore County is surrounded by four counties each of which has sufficient voting population to exceed two-thirds of the average voting population per county (which is the standard prescribed by the Tennessee Constitution for the assignment of a direct representative), thus qualifying for direct representatives. Consequently Moore County must be assigned a representative of its own despite its small voting population because it cannot be joined with any of its neighbors in a multicounty district, and the Tennessee Constitution prohibits combining it with nonadjacent counties.

But this may perhaps proceed from a want of fore-thought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present - They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those number-less afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection. To this must be ascribed their disposition to sleep when abstracted from their diversions, and unemployed in labor.\n\n- Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia\n(187-88) Almost nineteenth Euro-American intellectual of the ninteenth century could have written the preceding words.The notion of Negro inferiority was so deeply pervasive among those heirs of \"The Enlightment\" that the categories and even the vocabulary of Negro inferiority were formalized into a tedious, unmodulated litany. This uniformity increased rather than diminished during the course of the century. As Leon Litwack and others have shown, even the Abolitionists, who actively opposed slavery, frequently regarded blacks as inherently inferior. This helps to explain the widespread popularity of colonization schemes among Abolitionists and other liberals.1 As for Jefferson, it is not surprising that he held such ideas, but it is impressive that he formulated so clearly at the end of the eighteenth century what would become the dominant view of the Negro in the nineteenth century. In many ways, this Father of American Democracy - and quite possibly of five mulatto children - was a man of his time and ahead of his time.2\n\nIn July of 1876, exactly one century after the American Declaration of Independence, Mark Twain began writing Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a novel which illustrates trenchantly the social limitations which American \"civilization\" imposes on individual freedom. The book takes special note of ways in which racism impinges upon the lives of Afro-Americans, even when they are legally \"free.\" It is therefore ironic that Huckleberry Finn has often been attacked and even censored as a racist work. I would argue, on the contrary, that except for Melville's work, Huckleberry Finn is without peers among major Euro-American novels for its explicitly anti-racist stance.3 Those who brand the book \"racist\"generally do so without having considered the specific form of racial discourse to which the novel responds. Furthermore, Huckleberry Finn offers much more than the typical liberal defenses of \"human dignity\" and protests against cruelty. Though it contains some such elements, it is more fundamentally a critique of those socially constituted fictions- most notably romanticism, religion, and the concept of \"the Negro\" - which serve to justify and to disguise selfish, cruel, and exploitative behavior.\n\nWhen I speak of \"racial discourse,\" I mean more than simply attitudes about \"race\" or conventions of talking about \"race.\" Most importantly, I mean that \"race\" itself is a discursive formation, which delimits social relations on the basis of alleged physical differences.4 \"Race\" is a strategy for relegating a segment of the population to a permanent inferior status. It functions by insisting that each \"race\" has specific, definitive, inherent behavioral tendencies and capacities, which distinguish it from other \"races.\" Though scientifically specious, \"race\" has been powerfully effective as an ideology and as a form of social definition, which serves the interests of Euro-American hegemony. In America, race has been deployed against numerous groups, including Native Americans, Jews, Asians, and even - for brief periods - an assortment of European immigrants.\n\nFor obvious reasons, however, the primary emphasis historically has been on defining \"the Negro\" as a deviant from Euro- American norms. \"Race\" in America means white supremacy and black inferiority5; and \"the Negro,\" a socially constituted fiction, is a generalized, one-dimensional surrogate for the historical reality of Afro-American people. It is this reified fiction which Twain attacks in Huckleberry Finn. Twain adopts a strategy of subversion in his attack on race. That is, he focuses on a number of commonplaces associated with \"the Negro,\" and then he systematically dramatizes their inadequacy. He uses the term \"nigger,\" and he shows Jim engaging in superstitious behavior. Yet he portrays Jim as a compassionate, shrewd, thoughtful, self-sacrificing and even wise man. Indeed, his portrayal of Jim contradicts every claim presented in Jefferson's description of \"the Negro.\" Jim is cautious, he gives excellent advice, he suffers persistent anguish over separation from his wife and child, and he even sacrifices his own sleep in order that Huck may rest. Jim, in short, exhibits all qualities that \"the Negro\" supposedly lacks. Twain's conclusions do more than merely subvert the justifications of slavery, which was already long since abolished. Twain began this book during the final disintegration of Reconstruction, and his satire on antebellum Southern bigotry is also an implicit response to the Negrophobic climate of the post-Reconstruction era (Berkove; Gollin; Egan, esp. 66-102). It is troubling, therefore, that so many readers have completely misunderstood Twain's subtle attack on racism.\nTwain's use of the word \"nigger\" has provoked some readers to reject the novel. (See Hentoff). As one of the most offensive words in our vocabulary, \"nigger\" remains heavily shrouded in taboo. A careful assessment of this term within the context of American racial discourse, however, will allow us to understand the particular way in which the author uses it. If we attend closely to Twain's use of the word, we may find in it not just a trigger to outrage, but more importantly, a means of understanding the precise nature of American racism and Mark Twain's attack on it.\n\nMost obviously, Twain uses \"nigger\" throughout the book as a synonym for \"slave.\" There is ample evidence from other sources that this corresponds to one usage common during the Antebellum period. We first encounter it in reference to \"Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim\" (Ch. 2). This usage, like the term \"nigger stealer,\" clearly designates the \"nigger\" as a piece of property: a commodity, a slave. This passage also provides the only apparent textual justification for the common critical practice of labelling Jim, \"Nigger Jim,\" as if \"nigger\" were a part of his proper name. This loathsome habit goes back at least as far as Albert Bigelow Paine's biography of Twain (1912). In any case, \"nigger\" in this sense connotes an inferior, even subhuman, creature, who is properly owned by and subservient to Euro-Americans. Both Huck and Jim use the word in this sense. For example, when Huck fabricates his tale about the riverboat accident, the following exchange occurs between him and Aunt Sally:'Good gracious! anybody hurt?'\n'No'm. Killed a nigger.'\n'Well, it's lucky, because sometimes people do\nget hurt' (Ch. 32).Huck has never met Aunt Sally prior to this scene, and in spinning a lie which this stranger will find unobjectionable, he correctly assumes that the common notion of Negro subhumanity will be appropriate. Huck's off-hand remark is intended to exploit Aunt Sally's attitudes, not to express Huck's own. A nigger, Aunt Sally confirms, is not a person. Yet this exchange is hilarious, precisely because we know that Huck is playing upon her glib and conventional bigotry. We know that Huck's relationship to Jim has already invalidated for him such obtuse racial notions. The conception of the \"nigger\" is a socially constituted and sanctioned fiction, and it is just as false and as absurd as Huck's explicit fabrication, which Aunt Sally also swallows whole.\n\nIn fact, the exchange between Huck and Aunt Sally reveals a great deal about how racial discourse operates. Its function is to promulgate a conception of \"the Negro\" as a subhuman and expendable creature, who is by definition feeble-minded, immoral, lazy, and superstitious. One crucial purpose of this social fiction is to justify the abuse and exploitation of Afro-American people by substituting the essentialist fiction of \"Negro-ism\" for the actual character of individual Afro-Americans. Hence, in racial discourse every Afro-American becomes just another instance of \"the Negro\" - just another \"nigger.\" Twain recognizes this invidious tendency of race- thinking, however, and he takes every opportunity to expose the mismatch between racial abstractions and real human beings.\n\nFor example, when Pap drunkenly inveighs against the free mulatto from Ohio, he is outraged by what appears to him as a crime against natural laws. (Ch. 6). In the first place, a \"free nigger\" is, for Pap, a contradiction in terms. Indeed, the man's clothes, his demeanor, his education, his profession, and even his silver-headed cane bespeak a social status normally achieved by only a small elite of white men. He is, in other words, a \"nigger\" who refuses to behave like a \"nigger.\" Pap's ludicrous protestations discredit both himself and other believers in \"the Negro,\" as many critics have noted. But it has\" not been sufficiently stressed that Pap's racial views correspond very closely to those of most of his white Southern contemporaries, in substance if not in manner of expression. Such views were held not only by poor whites but by all \"right-thinking\" Southerners, regardless of their social class. Indeed, not even the traumas of the Civil War would cure Southerners of this folly. Furthermore, Pap's indignation at the Negro's right to vote is precisely analogous to the Southern backlash against the enfranchisement of Afro-Americans during Reconstruction. Finally, Pap's comments are rather mild compared to the anti-Negro diatribes which were beginning to emerge among politicians even as Twain was writing Huckleberry Finn. He began writing this novel during the final days of Reconstruction, and it seems more than reasonable to assume that the shameful white supremacist bluster of that epoch - exemplified by Pap's tirade - informed Twain's critique of racism in Huckleberry Finn. (See Pettit, Mark Twain and the South, 35-50).\n\nPap's final description of this Ohio gentlemen as \"a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free-nigger\" (Ch. 6) almost totally contradicts his previous description of the man as a proud, elegant, dignified figure. Yet this contradiction is perfectly consistent with Pap's need to reassert \"the Negro\" in lieu of social reality. Despite the vulgarity of Pap's personal character, his thinking about race is highly conventional and, therefore, respectable. But most of us cannot respect Pap's views, and when we reject them, we reject the standard racial discourse of both 1840 and 1880.\n\nA reader who objects to the word \"nigger\" might still insist that Twain could have avoided using it. But it is difficult to imagine how Twain could have debunked a discourse without using the specific terms of that discourse. Even when Twain was writing his book, \"nigger\" was universally recognized as an insulting, demeaning word. According to Stuart Berg Flexner, \"Negro\" was generally pronounced as \"nigger\" until about 1825, at which time Abolitionists began objecting to that term (57). They preferred \"colored person\" or \"person of color.\" Hence, W. E. B. Du Bois reports that some black Abolitionists of the early 1830s declared themselves united \"as men, . . . not as slaves; as 'people of color,' not as 'Negroes' \" (245). Writing a generation later in Army Life in a Black Regiment (1869), Thomas Wentworth Higginson deplored the common use of \"nigger\" among freedmen, which he regarded as evidence of low self-esteem (28). The objections to \"nigger,\" then, are not a consequence of the modern sensibility but had been common for a half century before Huckleberry Finn was published. The specific function of this term in the book, however, is neither to offend nor merely to provide linguistic authenticity. Much more importantly, it establishes a context against which Jim's specific virtues may emerge as explicit refutations of racist presuppositions.\n\nOf course, the concept of the \"nigger\" entails far more than just the deployment of certain vocabulary. Most of the attacks on the book focus on its alleged perpetuation of racial stereotypes. Twain does indeed use racial stereotypes here. That practice could be excused as characteristic of the genre of humor within which Twain works. Frontier humor relies upon the use of stock types, and consequently, racial stereotypes are just one of many types present in Huckleberry Finn. Yet while valid, such an appeal to generic convention would be unsatisfactory, because it would deny Twain the credit which he deserves for the sophistication of his perceptions (see Ellison, Hansen, Lynn).\n\nAs a serious critic of American society, Twain recognized that racial discourse depends upon the deployment of a system of stereotypes which constitute \"the Negro\" as fundamentally different from and inferior to Euro-Americans. As with his handling of \"nigger,\" Twain's strategy with racial stereotypes is to elaborate them in order to undermine them. To be sure, those critics are correct who have argued that Twain uses this narrative to reveal Jim's humanity. Jim, however, is just one individual. Much more importantly, Twain uses the narrative to expose the cruelty and hollowness of that racial discourse which exists only to obscure the humanity of all Afro-American people.\n\nOne aspect of Huckleberry Finn which has elicited copious critical commentary is Twain's use of superstition (see especially Hoffman, \"Jim's Magic\"). In nineteenth century racial discourse, \"the Negro\" was always defined as inherently superstitious.6 Many critics, therefore, have cited Jim's superstitious behavior as an instance of negative stereotyping. One cannot deny that in this respect Jim closely resembles the entire tradition of comic darkies (see Woodard and MacCann), but to observe this similarity is a negligible feat. The issue is, does Twain merely reiterate cliches, or does he use these conventional patterns to make an unconventional point? A close examination will show that in virtually every instance, Twain uses Jim's superstition to make points which undermine rather than revalidate the dominant racial discourse.\n\nThe first incident of this superstitious behavior occurs in Chapter 2, as a result of one of Tom Sawyer's pranks. When Jim falls asleep under a tree, Tom hangs his hat on a branch. Subsequently, Jim concocts an elaborate tale about having been hexed and ridden by witches. The tale grows more grandiose with subsequent retellings, and eventually Jim becomes a local celebrity, sporting a five-cent piece on a string around his neck as a talisman. \"Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country,\" the narrator reports. Jim's celebrity finally reaches the point that \"Jim was most ruined, for a servant, because he got so stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.\" This is, no doubt, amusing. Yet whether Jim believes his own tale or not - and the \"superstitious Negro\" thesis requires us to assume that he does - the fact remains that Jim clearly benefits from becoming more a celebrity and less a \"servant.\" It is his owner, not Jim, who suffers when Jim's uncompensated labor diminishes.7\n\nThis incident has often been interpreted as an example of risible Negro gullibility and ignorance, as exemplified by blackface minstrelsy. Such a reading has more than a little validity, but can only partially account for the implications of this scene. If not for the final sentence, such an account might seem wholly satisfactory, but the information that Jim becomes, through his own storytelling, unsuited for life as a slave, introduces unexpected complications. Is it likely that Jim has been deceived by his own creative prevarications - especially given what we learn about his character subsequently? Or has he cleverly exploited the conventions of \"Negro superstition\" in order to turn a silly boy's prank to his own advantage?\n\nRegardless of whether we credit Jim with forethought in this matter, it is undeniable that he turns Tom's attempt to humiliate him into a major personal triumph. In other words, Tom gives him an inch, and he takes an ell. It is also obvious that he does so by exercising remarkable skills as a rhetorician. By constructing a fictitious narrative of his own experience, Jim elevates himself above his prescribed station in life. By becoming, in effect, an author, Jim writes himself a new destiny. Jim's triumph may appear to be dependent upon the gullibility of other \"superstitious\" Negroes, but since we have no direct encounter with them, we cannot know whether they are unwitting victims of Jim's ruse or not. A willing audience need not be a totally credulous one. In any case, it is intelligence, not stupidity, which facilitates Jim's triumph. Tom may have had his chuckle, but the last laugh, clearly, belongs to Jim.\nIn assessing Jim's character, we should keep in mind that forethought, creativity and shrewdness are qualities which racial discourse - see Thomas Jefferson - denies to \"the Negro.\" In that sense, Jim's darky performance here subverts the fundamental definition of the darky. For \"the Negro\" is defined to be an object, not a subject. Yet does an object construct its own narrative? Viewed in this way, the fact of superstition, which traditionally connotes ignorance and unsophistication, becomes far less important than the ends to which superstition is put. This inference exposes, once again, the inadequacy of a positivist epistemology, which holds, for example, that \"a rose is a rose is a rose.\" No one will deny the self-evidence of a tautology; but a rose derives whatever meaning it has from the context within which it is placed (including the context of traditional symbolism.) It is the contextualizing activity, not das Ding-an-sich, which generates meaning. Again and again, Twain attacks racial essentialism by directing our attention, instead, to the particularity of individual action. We find that Jim is not \"the Negro.\" Jim is Jim, and we, like Huck, come to understand what Jim is by attending to what he does in specific situations.\n\nIn another instance of explicitly superstitious behavior, Jim uses a hairball to tell Huck's fortune. One may regard this scene as a comical example of Negro ignorance and credulity, acting in concert with the ignorance and credulity of a fourteen-year-old white boy. That reading would allow one an unambiguous laugh at Jim's expense. If one examines the scene carefully, however, the inadequacy of such a reductive reading becomes apparent. Even if Jim does believe in the supernatural powers of this hairball, the fact remains that most of the transaction depends upon Jim's quick wits. For example, the soothsaying aside, much of the exchange between Huck and Jim is an exercise in wily and understated economic bartering. In essence, Jim wants to be paid for his services, while Huck wants free advice. Jim insists that the hairball will not speak without being paid. Huck, who has a dollar, will only admit to having a counterfeit quarter. Jim responds by pretending to be in collusion with Huck. He explains how to doctor the \"quarter\" so that \"anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball\" (Ch. 4). But obviously it is not the hair-ball who will benefit from acquiring and spending this counterfeit coin (cf. Weaver and Williams).\n\nIn this transaction, Jim serves his own interests while appearing to serve Huck's interests. He takes a slug which is worthless to Huck, and through the alchemy of his own cleverness, he contrives to make it worth twenty-five cents to himself. That, in antebellum America, is not a bad price for telling a fortune. But more importantly, Twain shows Jim self- consciously subverting the prescribed definition of \"the Negro,\" even as he performs within the limitations of that role. He remains the conventional \"Negro\" by giving the white boy what he wants, at no real cost, and by consistently appearing to be passive and subservient to the desires of Huck and the hair-ball. But in fact, he serves his own interests all along. Such resourcefulness is hardly consistent with the familiar, one-dimensional concept of \"the superstitious Negro.\"\n\nAnd while Jim's reading is formulaic, it is hardly simple-minded. He sees the world as a kind of Manichean universe, in which forces of light and darkness - white and black - vie for dominance. Pap, he says, is uncertain what to do, torn between his white and black angels. Jim's advice, \"to res' easy en let de ole man take his own way\" (Ch. 4), turns out to be good advice, because Huck greatly enjoys life in the cabin, despite Pap's fits of drunken excess. This mixture of pleasure and pain is precisely what Jim predicts. Admittedly, Jim's conceptual framework is not original. Nonetheless, his reading carries considerable force, because it corresponds so neatly to the dominant thematic patterns in this book, and more broadly, to the sort of dualistic thinking which informs much of Twain's work. (To take an obvious example, consider the role reversals and character contrasts in Pudd'n-head Wilson or The Prince and the Pauper). And most immediately, Jim's comments here reflect tellingly upon his situation as a black slave in racist America. The slave's fate is always torn between his master's will and his own.\n\nIn this reading and other incidents, Jim emerges as an astute and sensitive observer of human behavior, both in his comments regarding Pap and in his subtle remarks to Huck. Jim clearly possesses a subtlety and intelligence which \"the Negro\" allegedly lacks. Twain makes this point more clearly in the debate scene in Chapter 15. True enough, most of this debate is, as several critics have noted, conventional minstrel show banter. Nevertheless, Jim demonstrates impressive reasoning abilities, despite his factual ignorance. For example, in their argument over \"Poly-voo-franzy,\" Huck makes a category error by implying that the difference between languages is analogous to the difference between human language and cat language. While Jim's response - that man should talk like a man - betrays his ignorance of cultural diversity, his argument is perceptive and structurally sound. The humor in Huck' s conclusion, \"you can't learn a nigger how to argue,\" arises precisely from our recognition that Jim's argument is better than Huck's.\n\nThroughout the novel, Twain presents Jim in ways which render ludicrous the conventional wisdom about \"Negro character.\" As an intelligent, sensitive, wily and considerate individual, Jim demonstrates that one's race provides no useful index of one's character. While that point may seem obvious to many contemporary readers, it is a point rarely made by nineteenth-century Euro-American novelists. Indeed, except for Melville, J. W. DeForest, Albion Tourgee, and George Washington Cable, white novelists virtually always portrayed Afro-American characters as exemplifications of \"Negroness.\" In this regard, the twentieth century has been little better. By presenting us a series of glimpses which penetrate the \"Negro\" exterior and reveal the person beneath it, Twain debunks American racial discourse. For racial discourse maintains that the \"Negro\" exterior is all that a \"Negro\" really has.\n\nThis insight in itself is a notable accomplishment. Twain, however, did not view racism as an isolated phenomenon, and it was his effort to place racism within the context of other cultural traditions which produced the most problematic aspect of his novel. For it is in the final chapters - the Tom Sawyer section - which most critics consider the weakest part of the book, that Twain links his criticisms of slavery and Southern romanticism, condemning the cruelties which both of these traditions entail. (See Altenbernd). Critics have objected to these chapters on various grounds. Some of the most common are that Jim becomes reduced to a comic darky (e.g., Marx, Schmitz), that Tom's antics undermine the seriousness of the novel, and that these burlesque narrative developments destroy the structural integrity of the novel. Most critics see this conclusion as an evasion of the difficult issues which the novel has raised. There is no space here for a discussion of the structural issues, but it seems to me that as a critique of American racial discourse, these concluding chapters offer a harsh, coherent, and uncompromising indictment.\n\nTom Sawyer's absurd scheme to \"rescue\" Jim offends, because the section begins with Huck's justly celebrated crisis of conscience, which culminates in his resolve to free Jim, even if doing so condemns him to hell. The passage which leads to Huck's decision, as familiar as it is, merits reexamination:I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around, and see that paper ....I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: 'All right, then, I'll go to hell' - and tore it up (Ch.31).The issue here is not just whether or not Huck should return a contraband8 - an escaped slave - to its proper owner. More fundamentally, Huck must decide whether to accept the conventional wisdom which defines \"Negroes\" as subhuman commodities, or the evidence of his own experience, which has shown Jim to be a good and kind man and a true friend.\n\nHuck makes the obvious decision, but his doing so represents more than simply a liberal choice of conscience over social convention. Twain explicitly makes Huck's choice a sharp attack on the Southern church. Huck scolds himself: \"Here was the Sunday school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd done it they'd a learnt you, there, that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire\" (Ch. 31). Yet despite Huck's anxiety, his choice is obviously correct. Furthermore, by the time that Twain wrote these words, more than twenty years of national strife, including Civil War and Reconstruction, had established Huck's conclusion regarding slavery as a dominant national consensus. Not even reactionary Southerners advocated a reinstitution of slavery. Since the Southern church had taught that slavery was God's will, Huck's decision flatly repudiates the church's teachings regarding slavery. And implicitly, it also repudiates the church as an institution by suggesting that the church functions to undermine, not to encourage, a reliance on one's conscience. To define \"Negroes\" as subhuman removes them from moral consideration and therefore justifies the callous exploitation of them. This view of religion is consistent with the cynical iconoclasm which Twain expressed in Letters from the Earth and others of his \"dark\" works.9\n\nIn this context, Tom Sawyer appears to us as a superficially charming but fundamentally distasteful interloper. His actions are governed not by conscience but rather by romantic conventions and literary \"authorities.\" Indeed, while Tom may appear to be a kind of renegade, he is in essence thoroughly conventional in his values and proclivities. Despite all his boyish pranks, Tom represents a kind of solid respectability- a younger version of the Southern gentleman, as exemplified by the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons (see Hoffman, Form and Fable, 327-28). Hence, when Tom proposes to help Huck steal Jim, Huck laments that \"Tom Sawyer fell, considerable, in my estimation. Only I couldn't believe it. Tom Sawyer a nigger stealen\" (Ch. 33). Such liberating activity is proper for Huck, who is not respectable, but not for Tom, who is. As with the previous example, however, this one implies a deep criticism of the status quo. Huck's act of conscience, which most of us would now endorse, is possible only for an outsider. This hardly speaks well for the moral integrity of Southern (or American) \"civilization.\"\n\nTo examine Tom's role in the novel, let us begin at the end. Upon learning of the failed escape attempt and Jim's recapture, Tom cries out, self-righteously: \"turn him loose! He ain't no slave; he's as free as any creatur that walks this earth\" (Ch. 42). Tom has known all along that his cruel and ludicrous scheme to rescue the captured \"prisoner\" was being enacted upon a free man; and indeed, only his silence regarding Jim's status allowed the scheme to proceed with Jim's cooperation. Certainly, neither Huck nor Jim would otherwise have indulged Tom's foolishness. Tom's gratuitous cruelty here in the pursuit of his own amusement corresponds to his less vicious prank against Jim in Chapter 2 . And just as before, Twain converts Tom's callous mischief into a personal triumph for Jim.\n\nNot only has Jim suffered patiently, which would in truth represent a doubtful virtue. (Jim is not Uncle Tom.) Jim demonstrates his moral superiority by surrendering himself in order to assist the doctor in treating his wounded tormentor. This is hardly the behavior which one would expect from a commodity, and it is precisely Jim's status - man or chattel - which has been fundamentally at issue throughout the novel. It may be true that Tom's lengthy juvenile antics subvert the tone of the novel, but they also provide the necessary backdrop for Jim's noble act. Up to this point, we have been able to admire Jim's good sense and to respond sentimentally to his good character. This, however, is the first time that we see him making a significant (and wholly admirable) moral decision. His act sets him apart from everyone else in the novel except Huck. And modestly (if not disingenuously), he claims to be behaving just as Tom Sawyer would. Always conscious of his role as a \"Negro,\" Jim knows better than to claim personal credit for his good deed. Yet the contrast between Jim's behavior and Tom's is unmistakable. Huck declares that Jim is \"white inside\" (Ch. 40). He apparently intends this as a compliment, but Tom is fortunate that Jim does not behave like most of the whites in the novel.\n\nTwain also contrasts Jim's self-sacrificing compassion with the cruel and mean-spirited behavior of his captors, emphasizing that white skin does not justify claims of superior virtue. They abuse Jim, verbally and physically, and some want to lynch him as an example to other slaves. The moderates among them, however, resist, pointing out that they could be made to pay for the destruction of private property. As Huck observes: \"the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right, is always the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of him (Ch. 42). As if these enforcers of white supremacy did not appear contemptible enough already, Twain then has the doctor describe Jim as the best and most faithful nurse he has ever seen, despite Jim's \"resking his freedom\" and his obvious fatigue. These vigilantes do admit that Jim deserves to be rewarded, but their idea of a reward is to cease punching and cursing him. They are not even generous enough to remove Jim's heavy shackles. Ultimately, Huckleberry Finn renders a harsh judgment on American society. Freedom from slavery, the novel implies, is not freedom from gratuitous cruelty; and racism, like romanticism, is finally just an elaborate justification which the adult counterparts of Tom Sawyer use to facilitate their exploitation and abuse of other human beings. Tom feels guilty, with good reason, for having exploited Jim, but his final gesture of paying Jim off is less an insult to Jim than it is Twain's commentary on Tom himself. Just as slaveholders believe that economic relations (ownership) can justify their privilege of mistreating other human beings, Tom apparently believes that an economic exchange can suffice as atonement for his misdeeds. Perhaps he finds a forty-dollar token more affordable than an apology. But then, just as Tom could only \"set a free nigger free,\" considering, as Huck says, \"his bringing-up\" (Ch. 42), he similarly could hardly be expected to apologize for his pranks. Huck, by contrast, is equally rich, but he has apologized to Jim earlier in the novel. And this is the point of Huck's final remark, rejecting the prospect of civilization. To become civilized is not just to become like Aunt Sally. More immediately, it is to become like Tom Sawyer.\nJim is, indeed, \"as free as any creatur that walks this earth.\" In other words, he is a man, like all men, at the mercy of other men's arbitrary cruelties. In a sense, given Twain's view of freedom, to allow Jim to escape to the North or to have Tom announce Jim's manumission earlier would be an evasion of the novel's ethical insights. While one may escape from legal bondage, there is no escape from the cruelties of this \"civilization.\" There is no promised land, where one may enjoy absolute personal freedom. An individual's freedom is always constrained by one's social relations to other people. Being legally free does not spare Jim from gratuitous humiliation and physical suffering in the final chapters, precisely because Jim is still regarded as a \"nigger.\" Even if he were as accomplished as the mulatto from Ohio, he would not be exempt from mistreatment. Furthermore, since Tom represents the hegemonic values of his society, Jim's \"freedom\" amounts to little more than an obligation to live by his wits and to make the best of a bad situation.\n\nSlavery and racism, then, are social evils which take their places alongside various others which the novel documents, such as the insane romanticism that inspires the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons blithely to murder each other, generation after generation. Twain rejects entirely the mystification of race and demonstrates that Jim is in most ways a better man than the men who regard him as their inferior. But he also shows how little correlation there may be between the treatment one deserves and the treatment one receives.\n\nIf this conclusion sounds uncontroversial from the perspective of 1984, we would do well to remember that it contradicts entirely the overwhelming and optimistic consensus of 1884. And no other nineteenth-century novel so effectively locates racial discourse within the context of a general critique of American institutions and traditions. Indeed, the novel suggests that real individual freedom, in this land of the free, cannot be found. \"American civilization\" enslaves and exploits rather than liberates. It is hardly an appealing message.\n\nGiven the subtlety of Mark Twain's approach, it is not surprising that most of his contemporaries misunderstood or simply ignored the novel's demystification of race. Despite their patriotic rhetoric, they, like Pap, were unprepared to take seriously the implications of \"freedom, justice, and equality.\" They, after all, espoused an ideology and an explicit language of race which was virtually identical to Thomas Jefferson's. Yet racial discourse flatly contradicts and ultimately renders hypocritical the egalitarian claims of liberal democracy. The heart of Twain's message to us is that an honest person must reject one or the other. But hypocrisy, not honesty, is our norm. For too many of us continue to assert both racial distinction and liberal values, simultaneously. If we, a century later, continue to be confused about Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, perhaps it is because we remain more deeply committed to both racial discourse and a self-deluding optimism than we care to admit.\n\nWilliams College\nNotes\n\n1. The literature on the Abolition movement and on antebellum debates regarding the Negro is, of course, voluminous. George Fredrickson's excellent The Black Image in the White Mind is perhaps the best general work of its kind. Fredrickson's The Inner Civil War is also valuable, especialy pp. 53-64. Leon Litwack closely examines the ambivalence of Abolitionists regarding racial intermingling (214-46). Benjamin Quarles presents the most detailed examination of black Abolitionists, though Vincent Harding offers a more vivid (and overtly polemical) account of their relationships to white Abolitionists (101-194).\n\n2. The debate over Jefferson's relationship to Sally Hemings has raged for two centuries. The most thorough scholarly accounts are by Fawn Brodie, who suggests that Jefferson did have a prolonged involvement with Hemings, and by Virginius Dabney, who endeavors to exonerate Jefferson of such charges. Barbara Chase-Riboud presents a fictionalized version of this relationship in Sally Hemings. The first Afro-American novel, Clotel; Or the President's Daughter (1853) by William Wells Brown, was also based on this alleged affair.\n\n3. For dates of composition, see Blair. For a discussion of Melville's treatment of race, Carolyn Karchner's Shadow Over the Promised Land is especially valuable. Articles on Benito Cere\u00f1o by Joyce Adler and Jean Yellin are also noteworthy. Rayford Logan and Lawrence J. Friedman provide detailed accounts of the racist climate in Post-Reconstruction America, emphasizing the literary manifestations of such attitudes. Friedman's discussion of George Washington Cable (99-118), the outspoken Southern liberal, is very informative. For a general historical overview of the period, C. Vann Woodward's work remains unsurpassed. John W. Cell offers a provocative reconsideration of Woodward's arguments, and Joel Williamson's new book documents the excessively violent tendencies of Southern racism at the end of the century.\n\n4. My use of \"racial discourse\" has some affinities to Foucault's conception of \"discourse.\" This is not, however, a strictly Foucaultian reading. While Foucault's definition of discursive practices provides one of the most sophisticated tools presently available for cultural analysis, his conception of power seems to me problematic. I prefer an account of power which allows for a consideration of interest and hegemony. Theorists such as Marshall Berman (34-35) and Catherine MacKinnon (526) have indicated similar reservations. Frank Lentriccia, however, has made a provocative attempt to modify Foucaultian analysis, drawing upon Gramsci's analysis of hegemony. See Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, Power/ Knowledge (esp. 92-108), and The History of Sexuality, (esp. 92-102).\n\n5. This is not to discount the sufferings of other groups. But historically, the philosophical basis of Western racial discourse- which existed even before the European \"discovery\" of America- has been the equation of \"good\" and \"evil\" with light and darkness (or, white and black.) (See Derrida; Jordan, 1-40; and West, 47-65). Economically, the slave trade, chattel slavery, agricultural peonage, and color-coded wage differentials have made the exploitation of African-Americans the most profitable form of racism. Finally, Afro- Americans have long been the largest American \"minority\" group. Consequently, the primacy of \"the Negro\" in American racial discourse is, to use Althusser's term (87-126), \"Overdetermined.\" The acknowledgment of primary status, however, is hardly a claim of privilege.\n\n6. Even the allegedly scientific works on the Negro focused on superstition as a definitive trait. See, for example, W. D. Weatherford and Jerome Dowd. No one has commented more scathingly on Negro superstition than William H. Thomas, who was, by American definitions, a Negro himself.\n\n7. Hoffman in Form and Fable (331) reveals an implicit understanding of Jim's creativity, but he does not pursue the point in detail.\n\n8. This term became a part of the official military vocabulary during the Civil War, referring to a slave who had gone \"AWOL.\"\n\n9. A number of works comment on Twain's religious views and the relation between his critiques of religion and of racism. See Ensor; Pettit, \"Mark Train and the Negro\"; and Gollin.\n\n10. I would like to thank my colleagues, David Langston and Michael Bell, for the helpful suggestions which they offered to me regarding this essay.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAdler, Joyce. \"Melville's Benito Cere\u00f1o: Slavery and Violence in the Americas.\" Science and Society , 38 (1974), 19-48.\n\nAltenbernd, Lynn. \"Huck Finn, Emancipator.\" Criticism, 1 (1959), 298-307.\n\nAlthusser, Louis.

But this may perhaps proceed from a want of fore-thought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it be present - They are more ardent after their female: but love seems with them to be more an eager desire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation. Their griefs are transient. Those number-less afflictions, which render it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In general, their existence appears to participate more of sensation than reflection. To this must be ascribed their disposition to sleep when abstracted from their diversions, and unemployed in labor.\n\n- Thomas Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia\n(187-88) Almost nineteenth Euro-American intellectual of the ninteenth century could have written the preceding words.The notion of Negro inferiority was so deeply pervasive among those heirs of \"The Enlightment\" that the categories and even the vocabulary of Negro inferiority were formalized into a tedious, unmodulated litany. This uniformity increased rather than diminished during the course of the century. As Leon Litwack and others have shown, even the Abolitionists, who actively opposed slavery, frequently regarded blacks as inherently inferior. This helps to explain the widespread popularity of colonization schemes among Abolitionists and other liberals.1 As for Jefferson, it is not surprising that he held such ideas, but it is impressive that he formulated so clearly at the end of the eighteenth century what would become the dominant view of the Negro in the nineteenth century. In many ways, this Father of American Democracy - and quite possibly of five mulatto children - was a man of his time and ahead of his time.2\n\nIn July of 1876, exactly one century after the American Declaration of Independence, Mark Twain began writing Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, a novel which illustrates trenchantly the social limitations which American \"civilization\" imposes on individual freedom. The book takes special note of ways in which racism impinges upon the lives of Afro-Americans, even when they are legally \"free.\" It is therefore ironic that Huckleberry Finn has often been attacked and even censored as a racist work. I would argue, on the contrary, that except for Melville's work, Huckleberry Finn is without peers among major Euro-American novels for its explicitly anti-racist stance.3 Those who brand the book \"racist\"generally do so without having considered the specific form of racial discourse to which the novel responds. Furthermore, Huckleberry Finn offers much more than the typical liberal defenses of \"human dignity\" and protests against cruelty. Though it contains some such elements, it is more fundamentally a critique of those socially constituted fictions- most notably romanticism, religion, and the concept of \"the Negro\" - which serve to justify and to disguise selfish, cruel, and exploitative behavior.\n\nWhen I speak of \"racial discourse,\" I mean more than simply attitudes about \"race\" or conventions of talking about \"race.\" Most importantly, I mean that \"race\" itself is a discursive formation, which delimits social relations on the basis of alleged physical differences.4 \"Race\" is a strategy for relegating a segment of the population to a permanent inferior status. It functions by insisting that each \"race\" has specific, definitive, inherent behavioral tendencies and capacities, which distinguish it from other \"races.\" Though scientifically specious, \"race\" has been powerfully effective as an ideology and as a form of social definition, which serves the interests of Euro-American hegemony. In America, race has been deployed against numerous groups, including Native Americans, Jews, Asians, and even - for brief periods - an assortment of European immigrants.\n\nFor obvious reasons, however, the primary emphasis historically has been on defining \"the Negro\" as a deviant from Euro- American norms. \"Race\" in America means white supremacy and black inferiority5; and \"the Negro,\" a socially constituted fiction, is a generalized, one-dimensional surrogate for the historical reality of Afro-American people. It is this reified fiction which Twain attacks in Huckleberry Finn. Twain adopts a strategy of subversion in his attack on race. That is, he focuses on a number of commonplaces associated with \"the Negro,\" and then he systematically dramatizes their inadequacy. He uses the term \"nigger,\" and he shows Jim engaging in superstitious behavior. Yet he portrays Jim as a compassionate, shrewd, thoughtful, self-sacrificing and even wise man. Indeed, his portrayal of Jim contradicts every claim presented in Jefferson's description of \"the Negro.\" Jim is cautious, he gives excellent advice, he suffers persistent anguish over separation from his wife and child, and he even sacrifices his own sleep in order that Huck may rest. Jim, in short, exhibits all qualities that \"the Negro\" supposedly lacks. Twain's conclusions do more than merely subvert the justifications of slavery, which was already long since abolished. Twain began this book during the final disintegration of Reconstruction, and his satire on antebellum Southern bigotry is also an implicit response to the Negrophobic climate of the post-Reconstruction era (Berkove; Gollin; Egan, esp. 66-102). It is troubling, therefore, that so many readers have completely misunderstood Twain's subtle attack on racism.\nTwain's use of the word \"nigger\" has provoked some readers to reject the novel. (See Hentoff). As one of the most offensive words in our vocabulary, \"nigger\" remains heavily shrouded in taboo. A careful assessment of this term within the context of American racial discourse, however, will allow us to understand the particular way in which the author uses it. If we attend closely to Twain's use of the word, we may find in it not just a trigger to outrage, but more importantly, a means of understanding the precise nature of American racism and Mark Twain's attack on it.\n\nMost obviously, Twain uses \"nigger\" throughout the book as a synonym for \"slave.\" There is ample evidence from other sources that this corresponds to one usage common during the Antebellum period. We first encounter it in reference to \"Miss Watson's big nigger, named Jim\" (Ch. 2). This usage, like the term \"nigger stealer,\" clearly designates the \"nigger\" as a piece of property: a commodity, a slave. This passage also provides the only apparent textual justification for the common critical practice of labelling Jim, \"Nigger Jim,\" as if \"nigger\" were a part of his proper name. This loathsome habit goes back at least as far as Albert Bigelow Paine's biography of Twain (1912). In any case, \"nigger\" in this sense connotes an inferior, even subhuman, creature, who is properly owned by and subservient to Euro-Americans. Both Huck and Jim use the word in this sense. For example, when Huck fabricates his tale about the riverboat accident, the following exchange occurs between him and Aunt Sally:'Good gracious! anybody hurt?'\n'No'm. Killed a nigger.'\n'Well, it's lucky, because sometimes people do\nget hurt' (Ch. 32).Huck has never met Aunt Sally prior to this scene, and in spinning a lie which this stranger will find unobjectionable, he correctly assumes that the common notion of Negro subhumanity will be appropriate. Huck's off-hand remark is intended to exploit Aunt Sally's attitudes, not to express Huck's own. A nigger, Aunt Sally confirms, is not a person. Yet this exchange is hilarious, precisely because we know that Huck is playing upon her glib and conventional bigotry. We know that Huck's relationship to Jim has already invalidated for him such obtuse racial notions. The conception of the \"nigger\" is a socially constituted and sanctioned fiction, and it is just as false and as absurd as Huck's explicit fabrication, which Aunt Sally also swallows whole.\n\nIn fact, the exchange between Huck and Aunt Sally reveals a great deal about how racial discourse operates. Its function is to promulgate a conception of \"the Negro\" as a subhuman and expendable creature, who is by definition feeble-minded, immoral, lazy, and superstitious. One crucial purpose of this social fiction is to justify the abuse and exploitation of Afro-American people by substituting the essentialist fiction of \"Negro-ism\" for the actual character of individual Afro-Americans. Hence, in racial discourse every Afro-American becomes just another instance of \"the Negro\" - just another \"nigger.\" Twain recognizes this invidious tendency of race- thinking, however, and he takes every opportunity to expose the mismatch between racial abstractions and real human beings.\n\nFor example, when Pap drunkenly inveighs against the free mulatto from Ohio, he is outraged by what appears to him as a crime against natural laws. (Ch. 6). In the first place, a \"free nigger\" is, for Pap, a contradiction in terms. Indeed, the man's clothes, his demeanor, his education, his profession, and even his silver-headed cane bespeak a social status normally achieved by only a small elite of white men. He is, in other words, a \"nigger\" who refuses to behave like a \"nigger.\" Pap's ludicrous protestations discredit both himself and other believers in \"the Negro,\" as many critics have noted. But it has\" not been sufficiently stressed that Pap's racial views correspond very closely to those of most of his white Southern contemporaries, in substance if not in manner of expression. Such views were held not only by poor whites but by all \"right-thinking\" Southerners, regardless of their social class. Indeed, not even the traumas of the Civil War would cure Southerners of this folly. Furthermore, Pap's indignation at the Negro's right to vote is precisely analogous to the Southern backlash against the enfranchisement of Afro-Americans during Reconstruction. Finally, Pap's comments are rather mild compared to the anti-Negro diatribes which were beginning to emerge among politicians even as Twain was writing Huckleberry Finn. He began writing this novel during the final days of Reconstruction, and it seems more than reasonable to assume that the shameful white supremacist bluster of that epoch - exemplified by Pap's tirade - informed Twain's critique of racism in Huckleberry Finn. (See Pettit, Mark Twain and the South, 35-50).\n\nPap's final description of this Ohio gentlemen as \"a prowling, thieving, infernal, white-shirted free-nigger\" (Ch. 6) almost totally contradicts his previous description of the man as a proud, elegant, dignified figure. Yet this contradiction is perfectly consistent with Pap's need to reassert \"the Negro\" in lieu of social reality. Despite the vulgarity of Pap's personal character, his thinking about race is highly conventional and, therefore, respectable. But most of us cannot respect Pap's views, and when we reject them, we reject the standard racial discourse of both 1840 and 1880.\n\nA reader who objects to the word \"nigger\" might still insist that Twain could have avoided using it. But it is difficult to imagine how Twain could have debunked a discourse without using the specific terms of that discourse. Even when Twain was writing his book, \"nigger\" was universally recognized as an insulting, demeaning word. According to Stuart Berg Flexner, \"Negro\" was generally pronounced as \"nigger\" until about 1825, at which time Abolitionists began objecting to that term (57). They preferred \"colored person\" or \"person of color.\" Hence, W. E. B. Du Bois reports that some black Abolitionists of the early 1830s declared themselves united \"as men, . . . not as slaves; as 'people of color,' not as 'Negroes' \" (245). Writing a generation later in Army Life in a Black Regiment (1869), Thomas Wentworth Higginson deplored the common use of \"nigger\" among freedmen, which he regarded as evidence of low self-esteem (28). The objections to \"nigger,\" then, are not a consequence of the modern sensibility but had been common for a half century before Huckleberry Finn was published. The specific function of this term in the book, however, is neither to offend nor merely to provide linguistic authenticity. Much more importantly, it establishes a context against which Jim's specific virtues may emerge as explicit refutations of racist presuppositions.\n\nOf course, the concept of the \"nigger\" entails far more than just the deployment of certain vocabulary. Most of the attacks on the book focus on its alleged perpetuation of racial stereotypes. Twain does indeed use racial stereotypes here. That practice could be excused as characteristic of the genre of humor within which Twain works. Frontier humor relies upon the use of stock types, and consequently, racial stereotypes are just one of many types present in Huckleberry Finn. Yet while valid, such an appeal to generic convention would be unsatisfactory, because it would deny Twain the credit which he deserves for the sophistication of his perceptions (see Ellison, Hansen, Lynn).\n\nAs a serious critic of American society, Twain recognized that racial discourse depends upon the deployment of a system of stereotypes which constitute \"the Negro\" as fundamentally different from and inferior to Euro-Americans. As with his handling of \"nigger,\" Twain's strategy with racial stereotypes is to elaborate them in order to undermine them. To be sure, those critics are correct who have argued that Twain uses this narrative to reveal Jim's humanity. Jim, however, is just one individual. Much more importantly, Twain uses the narrative to expose the cruelty and hollowness of that racial discourse which exists only to obscure the humanity of all Afro-American people.\n\nOne aspect of Huckleberry Finn which has elicited copious critical commentary is Twain's use of superstition (see especially Hoffman, \"Jim's Magic\"). In nineteenth century racial discourse, \"the Negro\" was always defined as inherently superstitious.6 Many critics, therefore, have cited Jim's superstitious behavior as an instance of negative stereotyping. One cannot deny that in this respect Jim closely resembles the entire tradition of comic darkies (see Woodard and MacCann), but to observe this similarity is a negligible feat. The issue is, does Twain merely reiterate cliches, or does he use these conventional patterns to make an unconventional point? A close examination will show that in virtually every instance, Twain uses Jim's superstition to make points which undermine rather than revalidate the dominant racial discourse.\n\nThe first incident of this superstitious behavior occurs in Chapter 2, as a result of one of Tom Sawyer's pranks. When Jim falls asleep under a tree, Tom hangs his hat on a branch. Subsequently, Jim concocts an elaborate tale about having been hexed and ridden by witches. The tale grows more grandiose with subsequent retellings, and eventually Jim becomes a local celebrity, sporting a five-cent piece on a string around his neck as a talisman. \"Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it, and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country,\" the narrator reports. Jim's celebrity finally reaches the point that \"Jim was most ruined, for a servant, because he got so stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches.\" This is, no doubt, amusing. Yet whether Jim believes his own tale or not - and the \"superstitious Negro\" thesis requires us to assume that he does - the fact remains that Jim clearly benefits from becoming more a celebrity and less a \"servant.\" It is his owner, not Jim, who suffers when Jim's uncompensated labor diminishes.7\n\nThis incident has often been interpreted as an example of risible Negro gullibility and ignorance, as exemplified by blackface minstrelsy. Such a reading has more than a little validity, but can only partially account for the implications of this scene. If not for the final sentence, such an account might seem wholly satisfactory, but the information that Jim becomes, through his own storytelling, unsuited for life as a slave, introduces unexpected complications. Is it likely that Jim has been deceived by his own creative prevarications - especially given what we learn about his character subsequently? Or has he cleverly exploited the conventions of \"Negro superstition\" in order to turn a silly boy's prank to his own advantage?\n\nRegardless of whether we credit Jim with forethought in this matter, it is undeniable that he turns Tom's attempt to humiliate him into a major personal triumph. In other words, Tom gives him an inch, and he takes an ell. It is also obvious that he does so by exercising remarkable skills as a rhetorician. By constructing a fictitious narrative of his own experience, Jim elevates himself above his prescribed station in life. By becoming, in effect, an author, Jim writes himself a new destiny. Jim's triumph may appear to be dependent upon the gullibility of other \"superstitious\" Negroes, but since we have no direct encounter with them, we cannot know whether they are unwitting victims of Jim's ruse or not. A willing audience need not be a totally credulous one. In any case, it is intelligence, not stupidity, which facilitates Jim's triumph. Tom may have had his chuckle, but the last laugh, clearly, belongs to Jim.\nIn assessing Jim's character, we should keep in mind that forethought, creativity and shrewdness are qualities which racial discourse - see Thomas Jefferson - denies to \"the Negro.\" In that sense, Jim's darky performance here subverts the fundamental definition of the darky. For \"the Negro\" is defined to be an object, not a subject. Yet does an object construct its own narrative? Viewed in this way, the fact of superstition, which traditionally connotes ignorance and unsophistication, becomes far less important than the ends to which superstition is put. This inference exposes, once again, the inadequacy of a positivist epistemology, which holds, for example, that \"a rose is a rose is a rose.\" No one will deny the self-evidence of a tautology; but a rose derives whatever meaning it has from the context within which it is placed (including the context of traditional symbolism.) It is the contextualizing activity, not das Ding-an-sich, which generates meaning. Again and again, Twain attacks racial essentialism by directing our attention, instead, to the particularity of individual action. We find that Jim is not \"the Negro.\" Jim is Jim, and we, like Huck, come to understand what Jim is by attending to what he does in specific situations.\n\nIn another instance of explicitly superstitious behavior, Jim uses a hairball to tell Huck's fortune. One may regard this scene as a comical example of Negro ignorance and credulity, acting in concert with the ignorance and credulity of a fourteen-year-old white boy. That reading would allow one an unambiguous laugh at Jim's expense. If one examines the scene carefully, however, the inadequacy of such a reductive reading becomes apparent. Even if Jim does believe in the supernatural powers of this hairball, the fact remains that most of the transaction depends upon Jim's quick wits. For example, the soothsaying aside, much of the exchange between Huck and Jim is an exercise in wily and understated economic bartering. In essence, Jim wants to be paid for his services, while Huck wants free advice. Jim insists that the hairball will not speak without being paid. Huck, who has a dollar, will only admit to having a counterfeit quarter. Jim responds by pretending to be in collusion with Huck. He explains how to doctor the \"quarter\" so that \"anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball\" (Ch. 4). But obviously it is not the hair-ball who will benefit from acquiring and spending this counterfeit coin (cf. Weaver and Williams).\n\nIn this transaction, Jim serves his own interests while appearing to serve Huck's interests. He takes a slug which is worthless to Huck, and through the alchemy of his own cleverness, he contrives to make it worth twenty-five cents to himself. That, in antebellum America, is not a bad price for telling a fortune. But more importantly, Twain shows Jim self- consciously subverting the prescribed definition of \"the Negro,\" even as he performs within the limitations of that role. He remains the conventional \"Negro\" by giving the white boy what he wants, at no real cost, and by consistently appearing to be passive and subservient to the desires of Huck and the hair-ball. But in fact, he serves his own interests all along. Such resourcefulness is hardly consistent with the familiar, one-dimensional concept of \"the superstitious Negro.\"\n\nAnd while Jim's reading is formulaic, it is hardly simple-minded. He sees the world as a kind of Manichean universe, in which forces of light and darkness - white and black - vie for dominance. Pap, he says, is uncertain what to do, torn between his white and black angels. Jim's advice, \"to res' easy en let de ole man take his own way\" (Ch. 4), turns out to be good advice, because Huck greatly enjoys life in the cabin, despite Pap's fits of drunken excess. This mixture of pleasure and pain is precisely what Jim predicts. Admittedly, Jim's conceptual framework is not original. Nonetheless, his reading carries considerable force, because it corresponds so neatly to the dominant thematic patterns in this book, and more broadly, to the sort of dualistic thinking which informs much of Twain's work. (To take an obvious example, consider the role reversals and character contrasts in Pudd'n-head Wilson or The Prince and the Pauper). And most immediately, Jim's comments here reflect tellingly upon his situation as a black slave in racist America. The slave's fate is always torn between his master's will and his own.\n\nIn this reading and other incidents, Jim emerges as an astute and sensitive observer of human behavior, both in his comments regarding Pap and in his subtle remarks to Huck. Jim clearly possesses a subtlety and intelligence which \"the Negro\" allegedly lacks. Twain makes this point more clearly in the debate scene in Chapter 15. True enough, most of this debate is, as several critics have noted, conventional minstrel show banter. Nevertheless, Jim demonstrates impressive reasoning abilities, despite his factual ignorance. For example, in their argument over \"Poly-voo-franzy,\" Huck makes a category error by implying that the difference between languages is analogous to the difference between human language and cat language. While Jim's response - that man should talk like a man - betrays his ignorance of cultural diversity, his argument is perceptive and structurally sound. The humor in Huck' s conclusion, \"you can't learn a nigger how to argue,\" arises precisely from our recognition that Jim's argument is better than Huck's.\n\nThroughout the novel, Twain presents Jim in ways which render ludicrous the conventional wisdom about \"Negro character.\" As an intelligent, sensitive, wily and considerate individual, Jim demonstrates that one's race provides no useful index of one's character. While that point may seem obvious to many contemporary readers, it is a point rarely made by nineteenth-century Euro-American novelists. Indeed, except for Melville, J. W. DeForest, Albion Tourgee, and George Washington Cable, white novelists virtually always portrayed Afro-American characters as exemplifications of \"Negroness.\" In this regard, the twentieth century has been little better. By presenting us a series of glimpses which penetrate the \"Negro\" exterior and reveal the person beneath it, Twain debunks American racial discourse. For racial discourse maintains that the \"Negro\" exterior is all that a \"Negro\" really has.\n\nThis insight in itself is a notable accomplishment. Twain, however, did not view racism as an isolated phenomenon, and it was his effort to place racism within the context of other cultural traditions which produced the most problematic aspect of his novel. For it is in the final chapters - the Tom Sawyer section - which most critics consider the weakest part of the book, that Twain links his criticisms of slavery and Southern romanticism, condemning the cruelties which both of these traditions entail. (See Altenbernd). Critics have objected to these chapters on various grounds. Some of the most common are that Jim becomes reduced to a comic darky (e.g., Marx, Schmitz), that Tom's antics undermine the seriousness of the novel, and that these burlesque narrative developments destroy the structural integrity of the novel. Most critics see this conclusion as an evasion of the difficult issues which the novel has raised. There is no space here for a discussion of the structural issues, but it seems to me that as a critique of American racial discourse, these concluding chapters offer a harsh, coherent, and uncompromising indictment.\n\nTom Sawyer's absurd scheme to \"rescue\" Jim offends, because the section begins with Huck's justly celebrated crisis of conscience, which culminates in his resolve to free Jim, even if doing so condemns him to hell. The passage which leads to Huck's decision, as familiar as it is, merits reexamination:I'd see him standing my watch on top of his'n, stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around, and see that paper ....I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: 'All right, then, I'll go to hell' - and tore it up (Ch.31).The issue here is not just whether or not Huck should return a contraband8 - an escaped slave - to its proper owner. More fundamentally, Huck must decide whether to accept the conventional wisdom which defines \"Negroes\" as subhuman commodities, or the evidence of his own experience, which has shown Jim to be a good and kind man and a true friend.\n\nHuck makes the obvious decision, but his doing so represents more than simply a liberal choice of conscience over social convention. Twain explicitly makes Huck's choice a sharp attack on the Southern church. Huck scolds himself: \"Here was the Sunday school, you could a gone to it; and if you'd done it they'd a learnt you, there, that people that acts as I'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire\" (Ch. 31). Yet despite Huck's anxiety, his choice is obviously correct. Furthermore, by the time that Twain wrote these words, more than twenty years of national strife, including Civil War and Reconstruction, had established Huck's conclusion regarding slavery as a dominant national consensus. Not even reactionary Southerners advocated a reinstitution of slavery. Since the Southern church had taught that slavery was God's will, Huck's decision flatly repudiates the church's teachings regarding slavery. And implicitly, it also repudiates the church as an institution by suggesting that the church functions to undermine, not to encourage, a reliance on one's conscience. To define \"Negroes\" as subhuman removes them from moral consideration and therefore justifies the callous exploitation of them. This view of religion is consistent with the cynical iconoclasm which Twain expressed in Letters from the Earth and others of his \"dark\" works.9\n\nIn this context, Tom Sawyer appears to us as a superficially charming but fundamentally distasteful interloper. His actions are governed not by conscience but rather by romantic conventions and literary \"authorities.\" Indeed, while Tom may appear to be a kind of renegade, he is in essence thoroughly conventional in his values and proclivities. Despite all his boyish pranks, Tom represents a kind of solid respectability- a younger version of the Southern gentleman, as exemplified by the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons (see Hoffman, Form and Fable, 327-28). Hence, when Tom proposes to help Huck steal Jim, Huck laments that \"Tom Sawyer fell, considerable, in my estimation. Only I couldn't believe it. Tom Sawyer a nigger stealen\" (Ch. 33). Such liberating activity is proper for Huck, who is not respectable, but not for Tom, who is. As with the previous example, however, this one implies a deep criticism of the status quo. Huck's act of conscience, which most of us would now endorse, is possible only for an outsider. This hardly speaks well for the moral integrity of Southern (or American) \"civilization.\"\n\nTo examine Tom's role in the novel, let us begin at the end. Upon learning of the failed escape attempt and Jim's recapture, Tom cries out, self-righteously: \"turn him loose! He ain't no slave; he's as free as any creatur that walks this earth\" (Ch. 42). Tom has known all along that his cruel and ludicrous scheme to rescue the captured \"prisoner\" was being enacted upon a free man; and indeed, only his silence regarding Jim's status allowed the scheme to proceed with Jim's cooperation. Certainly, neither Huck nor Jim would otherwise have indulged Tom's foolishness. Tom's gratuitous cruelty here in the pursuit of his own amusement corresponds to his less vicious prank against Jim in Chapter 2 . And just as before, Twain converts Tom's callous mischief into a personal triumph for Jim.\n\nNot only has Jim suffered patiently, which would in truth represent a doubtful virtue. (Jim is not Uncle Tom.) Jim demonstrates his moral superiority by surrendering himself in order to assist the doctor in treating his wounded tormentor. This is hardly the behavior which one would expect from a commodity, and it is precisely Jim's status - man or chattel - which has been fundamentally at issue throughout the novel. It may be true that Tom's lengthy juvenile antics subvert the tone of the novel, but they also provide the necessary backdrop for Jim's noble act. Up to this point, we have been able to admire Jim's good sense and to respond sentimentally to his good character. This, however, is the first time that we see him making a significant (and wholly admirable) moral decision. His act sets him apart from everyone else in the novel except Huck. And modestly (if not disingenuously), he claims to be behaving just as Tom Sawyer would. Always conscious of his role as a \"Negro,\" Jim knows better than to claim personal credit for his good deed. Yet the contrast between Jim's behavior and Tom's is unmistakable. Huck declares that Jim is \"white inside\" (Ch. 40). He apparently intends this as a compliment, but Tom is fortunate that Jim does not behave like most of the whites in the novel.\n\nTwain also contrasts Jim's self-sacrificing compassion with the cruel and mean-spirited behavior of his captors, emphasizing that white skin does not justify claims of superior virtue. They abuse Jim, verbally and physically, and some want to lynch him as an example to other slaves. The moderates among them, however, resist, pointing out that they could be made to pay for the destruction of private property. As Huck observes: \"the people that's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain't done just right, is always the very ones that ain't the most anxious to pay for him when they've got their satisfaction out of him (Ch. 42). As if these enforcers of white supremacy did not appear contemptible enough already, Twain then has the doctor describe Jim as the best and most faithful nurse he has ever seen, despite Jim's \"resking his freedom\" and his obvious fatigue. These vigilantes do admit that Jim deserves to be rewarded, but their idea of a reward is to cease punching and cursing him. They are not even generous enough to remove Jim's heavy shackles. Ultimately, Huckleberry Finn renders a harsh judgment on American society. Freedom from slavery, the novel implies, is not freedom from gratuitous cruelty; and racism, like romanticism, is finally just an elaborate justification which the adult counterparts of Tom Sawyer use to facilitate their exploitation and abuse of other human beings. Tom feels guilty, with good reason, for having exploited Jim, but his final gesture of paying Jim off is less an insult to Jim than it is Twain's commentary on Tom himself. Just as slaveholders believe that economic relations (ownership) can justify their privilege of mistreating other human beings, Tom apparently believes that an economic exchange can suffice as atonement for his misdeeds. Perhaps he finds a forty-dollar token more affordable than an apology. But then, just as Tom could only \"set a free nigger free,\" considering, as Huck says, \"his bringing-up\" (Ch. 42), he similarly could hardly be expected to apologize for his pranks. Huck, by contrast, is equally rich, but he has apologized to Jim earlier in the novel. And this is the point of Huck's final remark, rejecting the prospect of civilization. To become civilized is not just to become like Aunt Sally. More immediately, it is to become like Tom Sawyer.\nJim is, indeed, \"as free as any creatur that walks this earth.\" In other words, he is a man, like all men, at the mercy of other men's arbitrary cruelties. In a sense, given Twain's view of freedom, to allow Jim to escape to the North or to have Tom announce Jim's manumission earlier would be an evasion of the novel's ethical insights. While one may escape from legal bondage, there is no escape from the cruelties of this \"civilization.\" There is no promised land, where one may enjoy absolute personal freedom. An individual's freedom is always constrained by one's social relations to other people. Being legally free does not spare Jim from gratuitous humiliation and physical suffering in the final chapters, precisely because Jim is still regarded as a \"nigger.\" Even if he were as accomplished as the mulatto from Ohio, he would not be exempt from mistreatment. Furthermore, since Tom represents the hegemonic values of his society, Jim's \"freedom\" amounts to little more than an obligation to live by his wits and to make the best of a bad situation.\n\nSlavery and racism, then, are social evils which take their places alongside various others which the novel documents, such as the insane romanticism that inspires the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons blithely to murder each other, generation after generation. Twain rejects entirely the mystification of race and demonstrates that Jim is in most ways a better man than the men who regard him as their inferior. But he also shows how little correlation there may be between the treatment one deserves and the treatment one receives.\n\nIf this conclusion sounds uncontroversial from the perspective of 1984, we would do well to remember that it contradicts entirely the overwhelming and optimistic consensus of 1884. And no other nineteenth-century novel so effectively locates racial discourse within the context of a general critique of American institutions and traditions. Indeed, the novel suggests that real individual freedom, in this land of the free, cannot be found. \"American civilization\" enslaves and exploits rather than liberates. It is hardly an appealing message.\n\nGiven the subtlety of Mark Twain's approach, it is not surprising that most of his contemporaries misunderstood or simply ignored the novel's demystification of race. Despite their patriotic rhetoric, they, like Pap, were unprepared to take seriously the implications of \"freedom, justice, and equality.\" They, after all, espoused an ideology and an explicit language of race which was virtually identical to Thomas Jefferson's. Yet racial discourse flatly contradicts and ultimately renders hypocritical the egalitarian claims of liberal democracy. The heart of Twain's message to us is that an honest person must reject one or the other. But hypocrisy, not honesty, is our norm. For too many of us continue to assert both racial distinction and liberal values, simultaneously. If we, a century later, continue to be confused about Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, perhaps it is because we remain more deeply committed to both racial discourse and a self-deluding optimism than we care to admit.\n\nWilliams College\nNotes\n\n1. The literature on the Abolition movement and on antebellum debates regarding the Negro is, of course, voluminous. George Fredrickson's excellent The Black Image in the White Mind is perhaps the best general work of its kind. Fredrickson's The Inner Civil War is also valuable, especialy pp. 53-64. Leon Litwack closely examines the ambivalence of Abolitionists regarding racial intermingling (214-46). Benjamin Quarles presents the most detailed examination of black Abolitionists, though Vincent Harding offers a more vivid (and overtly polemical) account of their relationships to white Abolitionists (101-194).\n\n2. The debate over Jefferson's relationship to Sally Hemings has raged for two centuries. The most thorough scholarly accounts are by Fawn Brodie, who suggests that Jefferson did have a prolonged involvement with Hemings, and by Virginius Dabney, who endeavors to exonerate Jefferson of such charges. Barbara Chase-Riboud presents a fictionalized version of this relationship in Sally Hemings. The first Afro-American novel, Clotel; Or the President's Daughter (1853) by William Wells Brown, was also based on this alleged affair.\n\n3. For dates of composition, see Blair. For a discussion of Melville's treatment of race, Carolyn Karchner's Shadow Over the Promised Land is especially valuable. Articles on Benito Cere\u00f1o by Joyce Adler and Jean Yellin are also noteworthy. Rayford Logan and Lawrence J. Friedman provide detailed accounts of the racist climate in Post-Reconstruction America, emphasizing the literary manifestations of such attitudes. Friedman's discussion of George Washington Cable (99-118), the outspoken Southern liberal, is very informative. For a general historical overview of the period, C. Vann Woodward's work remains unsurpassed. John W. Cell offers a provocative reconsideration of Woodward's arguments, and Joel Williamson's new book documents the excessively violent tendencies of Southern racism at the end of the century.\n\n4. My use of \"racial discourse\" has some affinities to Foucault's conception of \"discourse.\" This is not, however, a strictly Foucaultian reading. While Foucault's definition of discursive practices provides one of the most sophisticated tools presently available for cultural analysis, his conception of power seems to me problematic. I prefer an account of power which allows for a consideration of interest and hegemony. Theorists such as Marshall Berman (34-35) and Catherine MacKinnon (526) have indicated similar reservations. Frank Lentriccia, however, has made a provocative attempt to modify Foucaultian analysis, drawing upon Gramsci's analysis of hegemony. See Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, Power/ Knowledge (esp. 92-108), and The History of Sexuality, (esp. 92-102).\n\n5. This is not to discount the sufferings of other groups. But historically, the philosophical basis of Western racial discourse- which existed even before the European \"discovery\" of America- has been the equation of \"good\" and \"evil\" with light and darkness (or, white and black.) (See Derrida; Jordan, 1-40; and West, 47-65). Economically, the slave trade, chattel slavery, agricultural peonage, and color-coded wage differentials have made the exploitation of African-Americans the most profitable form of racism. Finally, Afro- Americans have long been the largest American \"minority\" group. Consequently, the primacy of \"the Negro\" in American racial discourse is, to use Althusser's term (87-126), \"Overdetermined.\" The acknowledgment of primary status, however, is hardly a claim of privilege.\n\n6. Even the allegedly scientific works on the Negro focused on superstition as a definitive trait. See, for example, W. D. Weatherford and Jerome Dowd. No one has commented more scathingly on Negro superstition than William H. Thomas, who was, by American definitions, a Negro himself.\n\n7. Hoffman in Form and Fable (331) reveals an implicit understanding of Jim's creativity, but he does not pursue the point in detail.\n\n8. This term became a part of the official military vocabulary during the Civil War, referring to a slave who had gone \"AWOL.\"\n\n9. A number of works comment on Twain's religious views and the relation between his critiques of religion and of racism. See Ensor; Pettit, \"Mark Train and the Negro\"; and Gollin.\n\n10. I would like to thank my colleagues, David Langston and Michael Bell, for the helpful suggestions which they offered to me regarding this essay.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAdler, Joyce. \"Melville's Benito Cere\u00f1o: Slavery and Violence in the Americas.\" Science and Society , 38 (1974), 19-48.\n\nAltenbernd, Lynn. \"Huck Finn, Emancipator.\" Criticism, 1 (1959), 298-307.\n\nAlthusser, Louis.

No, John said, there was little doubt in his mind that it was true. And then, by way of explanation, he launched into this parable.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nLet me tell you something I saw one time.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI should admit that at the time, this story was completely lost on me.\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nMe and Roger Price had went up to the truck stop together to get a little dinner. We came back by, and was passing by the South Forty trailer park. So Roger's one of these dudes, he's a darn transmission mechanic. He's not really talkative. He's a good dude, but he just\u2014you know, he only has one tooth. And it's really amusing to see how he can balance a cigarette on that one tooth. And the whole time he's talking\u2014\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n\u2014this cigarette is just bouncing around all over that one tooth, and he never loses that son of a bitch. So we're coming by this \"Welcome to South Forty\" sign, and there's this girl out there walking around in front of the damn sign holding a cell phone, and she's got on a pink top and nothing else\u2014no fucking panties, no goddamn socks, barefoot. And I remark that to Roger. I don't remember what I said. I probably said, \"my God, look at her,\" or something like that. And Roger's sage advice was, usually when you see jokers that look like that, they done something to get like that.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThat's the lesson?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nThat went just straight through you.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nLike so many things having to do with John, it took me a long time to understand the meaning of this story\u2014years. But I think I finally get it now. From Serial and This American Life, I'm Brian Reed. This is Shittown.\n\nMy second night in Alabama, I finally get to talk to Jake Goodson. Jake's the guy who'd originally told John that Kabrahm Burt had bragged to him outside the Little Caesars about beating a guy to death. I sit with Jake in John's kitchen, asking him to rack his brain for any extra details that could help me solve this. It was a while ago, he says. His memories are fuzzy. But he makes a suggestion that, I don't know, seems crazy to me.\n\nJAKE GOODSON:\nI don't know. I mean, I could get him and ask him, and he'll be able to tell me. He'd probably come up here and talk to you about it.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWho?\n\nJAKE GOODSON:\nKabrahm.\nBRIAN REED:\nKabrahm lives right nearby. Why not just get it from the horse's mouth?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nNo.\n\nJAKE GOODSON:\nProbably so.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThat makes no sense. I would stick a microphone in his face and he would tell me about a guy he killed?\n\nJAKE GOODSON:\nProbably. He's burnt up. He wouldn't know no better. He'd probably just laugh about it with you.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI told Jake no thanks, at least not now. I do not feel like I'm armed with enough information to confront Kabrahm yet. Aside from seeming far-fetched, the idea also just sounded potentially dangerous, for John, for Jake, and for me. But then the next night, a bunch of other people proposed the exact same thing.\n\nMAN 1:\nHe'll talk to you, dude.\n\nMAN 2:\nI mean, he's burnt out.\n\nMAN 1:\nHe's arrogant, dude. He don't give a fuck.\nBRIAN REED:\nHe would talk to me about it?\n\nMAN 3:\nI know he would. I'm pretty sure he would.\n\nMAN 1:\nHe'd probably tell you truth.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI'm chatting with a few guys in a tattoo parlor, all of whom have heard about the murder. Some are pretty sure they heard it from Kabrahm himself.\n\nMAN 4:\nYou want me to call him and ask him?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nNo, don't do that.\n\nMAN 4:\nWhy? I'm not a puss, dude. I don't give a fuck.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nApparently I'm the puss, because I do not want the dudes I'm talking to to call Kabrahm right now. Already, this tattoo shop does not feel like the safest place to walk into alone at night, trying to dig up info about a covered-up murder by a guy everyone seems to know, all of which are things I've just done. The last thing I want right now is for the alleged murderer to show up.\n\nI was invited here by Tyler Goodson, Jake's brother, whom I met in John's workshop while he was filing that chainsaw. He's one of the owners. Tyler knows Kabrahm. They're both in their early 20s, and I thought maybe some of Tyler's friends who hang out here might have more information about the possible murder. John didn't feel like coming with me because he doesn't like driving at night.\n\nWhen I walk in, at first it seems like a pretty small place, just a couple of tattooing stations and a little waiting area. But if you push the back wall of the shop, it swings open. It's a secret door, which leads into a hidden clubhouse in the back. There's a bar with some people around it, a pool table, a small stage with motorcycles parked there, and a brass stripper pole that's currently vacant.\n\nThe shop is called Black Sheep Ink, and I'll learn that the guys who hang out here take the name to heart. They see themselves as a collection of misfits, of self-proclaimed criminals and runaways and hillbillies. And Tyler has built this place as a haven for them, a place to swap their tales of getting jerked around by cops and judges and clerks and bosses, and to cultivate a sense of pride in their status as the outcasts of their world.\n\nThere's this gentleman, whose name I never do catch, who tells me, quote, \"I'm so fucking fat, I don't care no more,\" and lifts up his shirt to show me the giant words he has tattooed on his stomach\u2014\"Feed Me.\"\n\nMAN 4:\nTell him. Tell him. Give him a picture. I'm a 6-foot, 350-pound bearded man in a John Deere hat with \"Feed Me\" on my belly, just so y'all get a clear picture here.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThere's a guy who's been wearing the same trucker hat for seven years.\n\nMAN 5:\nSeven years, same hat.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThen there's this guy.\n\n[JACKHAMMER NOISE]\n\nPeople call him Razor.\n\nRAZOR:\nBeep, beep. Back it up. I was parked on the side of the road. I looked down there. I said, son of a bitch. He wakes up. You have Willard come by, see him laying in the yard, thought he died. Ambulance is there. They already called the ambulance, man. Bastard's laying out there in the yard, got an ounce of pot laying beside him, six beers. He's just shit-faced.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI believe he's telling a story about his friend Willard, who is impervious to death.\n\nRAZOR:\nYou know, I run over him three times in one fucking night. Three times, dude, one night. The bastard won't die.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nAnd then there's Tyler, who's been sleeping at the tattoo parlor lately because he can't afford anywhere else to spend the night, who's 23 years old and has three daughters with three different women, and who's been haunted his whole life by people assuming he's just like his father\u2014his father who abused him and his siblings and his mother, and who is a convicted sex offender for having sex with a minor. One day, Tyler will tell me that he often wakes up in the morning in a puddle of sweat, having dreamt during the night of killing his dad.\n\nTyler's friendly to me when I arrive, welcoming, but as I'm getting out my recording equipment, I hear murmurs from other people wondering who I am, wondering if I might be a cop. People are asking me questions, feeling me out. A few guys ask if I'll smoke a bowl with them out of some deer antlers. I don't want to be stoned, but I also don't want to seem like a narc, so I pretend to take a puff.\n\nI pretend to do a number of things that make me feel very uncomfortable in order to keep as low a profile as possible, such as act like I'm not shocked or upset or scared when someone says this to me, a radio producer with a microphone, in the first few minutes that we're talking. At the risk of ruining any surprise, the statement is racist and nonsensical, replete with multiple uses of a terrible word.\n\nBUBBA:\nYou know, we had a tax-free labor. It didn't have nothing to do with a bunch of niggers picking cotton. And we worked our ass off, and we got\u2014we earned everything we got.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThis is a tattoo artist who goes by Bubba.\n\nBUBBA:\nSo now we have no\u2014if you got a taxpaying job, you got to take care of some nigger's wife that's in jail because she's drawing a child support check\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nLater, Bubba will display a rather fluent knowledge of the differences between various white supremacy groups. Mind you, we're in a majority-black city right now, Bessemer, about 20 minutes from Bibb County, heading towards Birmingham. But everyone in here is white, including me. Someone mentions offhand that the small tattoo area in front is about as much shop as you want here in Bessemer. Otherwise, the place will be filled with black people who'll piss you off and won't pay anything\u2014hence the secret door.\n\nBefore I left for Alabama, my girlfriend, Solange\u2014now my wife\u2014who is black and whose family is from the South, had insisted I make my Facebook and Instagram accounts private, because they're filled with pictures of us together. I told her she was being silly, overly paranoid. Now I'm grateful I decided at the last minute to follow her advice.\n\nWhen someone asked me what the women looked like up in New York, I tell them they're all shapes, sizes, and colors. When someone asks what my ethnicity is, I tell them about the Italian part without mentioning the Russian Jew part. But there's no hiding the fact that I'm a Yankee.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhat's that?\n\nBUBBA:\nY'all just as racist as we are.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nIt's quieter.\n\nBUBBA:\nY'all left them the fuck down here.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBRIAN REED:\nIn an effort to change the subject, I turn the conversation to one of the few things I know I have in common with these guys\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nSo you guys know John?\n\nBRIAN REED:\n\u2014our mutual acquaintance, John B. McLemore.\n\nMAN 6:\nOh, yeah.\n\nMAN 1:\nHe's a character.\n\nMAN 5:\nI ain't never met nobody else like him.\n\nMAN 6:\nNobody. Nobody. Nobody like him.\n\nMAN 7:\n\u2014nobody else like that folk.\n\nMAN 6:\nHe been bugging the piss out of you?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhat's that?\n\nMAN 6:\nHas he been bugging the piss out of you?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI'm not there yet, but it's exhausting to hang out with him for a long day.\n\nMAN 6:\nDamn right.\n\nWOMAN:\n(AMUSED) Who says \"exhausting?\"\n\nMAN 2:\nHe's exhausted after all day.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWell, it's\u2014\n\nMAN 6:\nHe needs to slow the fuck down is what you want to tell him. Slow down.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThey tell me John comes around the tattoo parlor pretty often, and likes to lecture them and give them a hard time. He'll argue with them about their views on the South, on politics, on race. Bubba says he'll submit them to tirades about the coming climate and energy apocalypses.\n\nBUBBA:\nAbout how we was running out of fossil fuels and the world was going to come to a fucking end, and\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nJohn tells off their customers for talking about what he sees as inane shit, tells these guys that their lives are amounting to nothing, that they're examples in the flesh of what's wrong with this place.\n\nJOEL:\nHe thinks everybody's a failure. Everything that's going on is a failure.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThis is another tattoo artist, Joel.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nHe calls you guys failures?\n\nJOEL:\nFuck yeah, he calls us failures, you know what I mean?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nLike jokingly, or\u2014\n\nJOEL:\nNo. Everybody's a failure. Like in his brain, everybody's a failure. For all I know, you could be a failure. You know, sometimes I wish he'd kind of fail\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThese guys dish it out, too. They tease John for his many peculiarities, like how he'll devour whatever leftover food is around, no matter how old or rock-hard it is, his inability to buy new shoes to alleviate his athlete's foot, which he's allegedly had for three years, his extemporaneous solving of math problems, his utter aversion to being in a room with more than two or three people at a time, his living with his mom his whole life, his being a loner.\n\nIt's friendly, though. They like John. After all, John is the granddaddy of all black sheep, so this crew gets him. They truly seem to accept him, though that doesn't stop them from wondering\u2014\n\nMAN 4:\nLove to know what he's worth.\n\nBRIAN REED:\n\"I'd love to know what he's worth,\" the \"Feed Me\" guy says.\n\nMAN 4:\nJust not because I give a fuck, but just to know why does he live like that, you know what I mean?\n\nTYLER GOODSON:\n\u2014poor as a church mouse.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThat's Tyler saying he lives like he's poor as a church mouse. And Tyler would know. He and John are close. He's the only reason all these guys know John.\n\nTyler helped build John's maze. He's done all sorts of different odd jobs for him. He's over there all the time. And as far as the church mouse, I did notice that John's refrigerator is pretty bare. His mom invited me to stay for dinner one night so long as I didn't mind eating like po' folks, she told me, in a way where I couldn't tell if she was joking. They live without air conditioning, without TV.\n\nIt's mysterious to me, too, because at the same time, John has all these dogs he feeds and brings to the vet, this elaborate yard that requires constant upkeep. He mentioned to me that he spent more than $60,000 on the maze alone. \"Feed Me\" guy says to Tyler\u2014\n\nMAN 4:\nI don't understand why, if he's as loaded as you say\u2014\n\nTYLER GOODSON:\nOh, he's worth millions.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nMillions?\n\nMAN 4:\nHave you not done any research on John?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nTyler explains that John's family comes from money. He says that one of his grandpas was a judge, and that John got an inheritance, played the stock market with it, and made even more money. Plus, aside from all that, Tyler says John made good bank restoring old clocks. All of that sounds like it could be true enough. But then Tyler and his friends start listing off John's assets, and I can't tell if any of that is real, or if they're just letting their imaginations fill in the blanks about their local Boo Radley.\n\nThey claim John has $400,000 in cash, 100-some-odd thousand worth of tools in the workshop, all the antiques around his house. You're going to get $150,000 if you sell that old-ass shit, Bubba says. Rare books in the basement, a single clock worth $10,000 that's just sitting on the floor in a plastic storage bin. Not to mention, says Tyler\u2014\n\nTYLER GOODSON:\nGold that his granddaddy\u2014his granddaddy's gold, his daddy's gold.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nTyler's up on the counter of the bar, crouching. He has a brown briefcase he carries around with him. He calls it his minister's case. It has a sticker that says minister slapped on the outside, and it's filled with his tattoo machines and a gun and his welder's cap and some nipple jewelry, and his Black Sheep Ink business cards, and also his minister's license, which he got online because he wanted to found a non-denominational church, where people of all backgrounds could come together and talk it out.\n\nThis clubhouse is meant to be a version of that. He says it's his church. Tyler stares down at us from the corner of the bar, like he's about to divulge a secret. When it comes to John, he says, there's no telling\u2014\n\nTYLER GOODSON:\nWhat he's got, because there's a lot of shit that I'm sure I don't know about, because I've been finding stuff out slowly over the years. And there's secret little dungeons and shit under his damn house, man. I ain't playing. I've built gates for them. I've built gates for these secret dungeons.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI've built gates for the dungeons, Tyler's telling me\u2014dungeons in John's basement. He soon clarifies they're actually old crawlspaces, but the way John had him rig them up, Tyler says, with tiny doors and these locking iron gates inside, dividing them into sections\u2014what was the purpose of all that? It was creepy. But Tyler digs creepy stuff, so he also thought it was cool.\n\nThat guy Bubba, the one who's especially outspoken about his racist views, as the night goes on, I put together that he's the one who gave John all his tattoos, the tattoos that John showed me abruptly at his workshop that cover his whole chest. Bubba, he explains that being a tattoo artist is a lot like being a therapist. People sit in his chair for hours on end, and each person he works on is getting that tattoo for some specific reason.\n\nIt's his job, as he sees it, to uncover that reason. Maybe it's a meditation, a milestone, an excuse to get out of the house, a new girlfriend, a death. John's motivation was especially bewildering to Bubba, because John had made it clear almost every time he came in the shop how deeply he despised tattoos.\n\nBUBBA:\nIf you got a tattoo on you, he'd tell you you wasn't shit. You're a low life. You shouldn't have that on you.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nSo as shocking as it was to me when John lifted up his shirt to show me all his tattoos, it was far more shocking to Bubba when John strolled in one day at the age of 47 and asked him to start putting them there.\n\nBUBBA:\nI thought he was going to commit suicide. You know, that's what I thought in my mind.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhy?\n\nBUBBA:\nThis is something you're completely against. You think fucking failures have tattoos, you know what I'm saying? Why in the fuck would you just start tattooing your whole upper body like that, you know what I mean? And around your neck\u2014pistons. Tattooing pistons on him, you know? Redneck-ass tattoos, you know?\n\nSo I mean, first thought, I thought he was going to kill himself. I thought he was going to get tatted the fuck up and blow his brains out or something. Fuck, I don't know. And then the more I got to doing it, you know, I realized, you know, we're in a rut. You know, we need some money and he helped us out. I mean, he helped a lot.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nBubba and Tyler co-own Black Sheep Ink together. And Bubba started noticing, they'd have a bill about to come due for the business, they'd be wondering how they were going to pay it, and then conveniently, John would come in and hand over $300 or $400 and ask for another tattoo on his chest. Bubba says people around here don't throw down money like that. But John would, just in the nick of time, and then schedule another appointment for soon after.\n\nBUBBA:\nHe might not have said I'm helping you out, but when you sit down and pay me $2,000, $3,000 in a couple week span, you just helped me out. You know, you just got all my bills caught up. You just got everything back to where it needed to be, you know?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nYou think that's why he did it?\n\nBUBBA:\nNow I do. He keeps a book, man. He writes down everything. So he knows when we're having a bad time. He'd ask certain things, like what's the rent, you know, what's your power bill, when's it due? And he already knows this shit, because he writes shit down. And he just planned his tattoo out to where it pretty much paid everything up in increments.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWait, it was like that exact almost?\n\nBUBBA:\nYeah.\n\nIf it wasn't for John, we'd be shut the fuck down.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nIf it wasn't for John?\n\nBUBBA:\nYeah. If it weren't for John, I'd be tattooing at my kitchen table right now. And I think he sacrificed his skin to help us out.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nBubba says John is an emotional guy, and sure, a lot of that emotion is disgust, but there's also sympathy, in particular for Tyler. If he's helping the tattoo parlor, he's only doing it because of Tyler and his brother, Jake.\n\nBUBBA:\nHe's just watched them boys, man, and he knows how his daddy was. I mean, the kid was laying block at 5 years old.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nTyler, that is.\n\nBUBBA:\nYou know, on the job site working. Not going to school\u2014working. Go to school two days a week, work five days a week, you know what I mean? So he just seen it and he knows it wasn't right, sees what\u2014how Tyler's been programmed to be the way he is by his raising and his upbringing, you know, and feels sorry for him, I guess. I don't know. Or knows that he's smarter than what he's letting on. I mean, I don't know.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThat Tyler is?\n\nBUBBA:\nYeah.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhen John hires Tyler to chop down trees in his yard or build iron gates in his crawlspaces, he doesn't really need that stuff done, Bubba says. He's just trying to find an excuse to put money in Tyler's pocket. When Tyler gets caught driving with a suspended license and ends up in jail, something that happens now and again, Bubba knows John's the one to call because he'll bail him out.\n\nBUBBA:\nHe loves Tyler. I mean, Tyler's his boy. I mean, that's his boy. Tyler's brother, he cares about Tyler's little brother Jake, you know. John can say anything he wants to, but he loves Tyler probably just as much as you would your own son, your own flesh and blood. And I ain't figured it out.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWe're standing in the backyard as we're talking, behind the tattoo shop. A train whistle starts to blow in the distance. Eventually, someone comes out and tells me I might be interested to know that Kabrahm's sister, Kashion Burt, is here, like right inside, 15 feet away from me. Why don't we just go ask her about the murder?\n\nThis town. I go to the bar, leave $6 for my beer, and, careful to avoid Kabrahm's sister, head out the secret door, not knowing what I eventually will know months and months from now\u2014that Kabrahm Burt didn't murder anybody, but also that before this is all over, someone will end up dead.\n\nBUBBA:\nYou coming up here when you get off?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nMore in a minute.\n\n[AD]\n\nBRIAN REED:\nKabrahm? Hey, I'm Brian Reed.\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nNice to meet you, Brian.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nSo I'm doing a radio story. I'm a reporter. I'm here from New York. Is there somewhere quiet we could sit?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nIt's a year later, and I'm pulling into K3 Lumber on a Friday morning, nervously asking if Kabrahm's around. I feel comfortable doing this only because I have finally determined that the incident John contacted me about, where Kabrahm allegedly got into a fight and beat a guy to death, although it did, in fact, go down almost exactly as John and Jake and Skyler and others told me, was wrong in one relatively important detail\u2014the \"to death\" part. The guy Kabrahm beat up did not die. They just thought he did for a while. That's what I eventually gathered from talking to people more.\n\nOnce I heard that, I started contacting law enforcement to find out what did exactly happen. It turns out the incident in question actually took place in adjacent Tuscaloosa County. A chief at the sheriff's department there read to me from a detailed case file showing that the police had investigated the fight thoroughly, that no one had been killed, and that they had closed the case not because they were paid off or anything, but because none of the guys involved wanted to press charges. And so here I am at K3 Lumber to ask Kabrahm why he would go around bragging to people that he had killed a guy he had not killed. He's with some coworkers in the lumber yard in a plaid shirt, green trucker hat, and dark sunglasses.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nKabrahm? Hey, I'm Brian Reed.\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nNice to meet you, Brian.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThere's a particular philosophy I've encountered down here, and will continue to encounter. That is the fuck-it philosophy, a belief that there's no sense in worrying or thinking too much about any given decision, because life is going to be difficult and unfair regardless of what you do. It's more than a belief, really. It's a way of moving moment to moment through the world. And from the get-go, Kabrahm seems to be a subscriber. I show up with a microphone and ask if I can talk to him on the record about a matter I've yet to name, and he's immediately game. Fuck it. And we walk over behind some stacks of lumber to be alone.\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nWhat you want to talk about, Bud?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nSo basically, were you at one point going around telling people that you'd killed someone?\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nNo. A boy cut my buddy's neck right here with a knife. But no. Like, I beat the piss out of him. What happened was\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhat happened was, Kabrahm says, they were at a party, and he doesn't know how the fight started because he and almost everyone else were zonked out of their minds.\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nDrinking and doing everything else under the sun.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nLike substance-wise?\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nLike taking Xanax, and mixing speed with it and stuff.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nAccording to the police report, it was a clear, moonlit night, about 4:00, 4:30 in the morning, on August 4, 2012, just a few days outside the time window John had discerned from his records. Kabrahm says all he remembers is they were in the middle of the woods, chilling around a fire. A fight broke out, and then suddenly, this dude Dylan\u2014not Dylan Nichols, as John had told me\u2014he was not involved\u2014but another Dylan with a different last name, came up from behind with a knife and cut Kabrahm's buddy, Tim, in the neck. So Kabrahm went after him, held Dylan's head down, punched him, hit him with a beer bottle.\n\nTim got involved. He might have bit the guy in the cheek. Dylan kept swinging his knife the whole time. He stabbed Kabrahm, too\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nRight up here.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nUp in your thigh, there.\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nYeah, like almost cut my gooch meat.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBRIAN REED:\nAnd then it was over. Kabrahm thinks the whole thing lasted maybe 15 seconds. It wasn't some beautiful, drawn-out movie fight, he says. It was a real-life fight, which means it was scrappy, awkward, and quick, and left his friend Tim clutching a four-inch gash on his neck that was gushing blood.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nDid you think, like, Tim might be\u2014like, it might be life-threatening?\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nYes. That is the craziest shit I've ever seen in my life.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nKabrahm looked around and saw almost everyone at the party, maybe 30, 40 people, scattering. Tim was in a bad way, so someone had called 911, and now people were driving away or hiding in the woods before the police got there. The ambulance came, carted Kabrahm and Tim to the hospital, and after getting a few stitches near the meat of his gooch, Kabrahm went outside to smoke a cigarette and bumped into a group of random girls from the party.\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nTelling me all kinds of crazy shit, like somebody had died. Like, oh, that boy you got in a fight with died.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhat did you think?\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nI was thinking, I don't think that boy died. I said, you wouldn't think so. Hell, the fight didn't last that long.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nBut still, you had, like, this part of your brain that was like, maybe.\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nWell, yeah. I started coming down off them Xanaxes, you know, and you get to thinking like, oh God, I hope I didn't do something stupid. I don't think nobody died, but if they did, I ain't gonna hang around to find out.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nKabrahm says he was kind of wigging out wondering if he killed someone. He called a buddy of his to come pick him up at the hospital. That buddy was in a motel room full of methheads in Bessemer, Kabrahm says, and judging from police records and other sources, it seems possible the rumor that Dylan had been killed started in that motel room, and then spread from there.\n\nKabrahm says by the time he got to work on Monday, it had already taken hold. People were coming up to him at the lumberyard and other places around town asking if he killed a guy.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nAnd so you never\u2014I just want to ask you this again\u2014you never maybe were drunk one time and saying, yeah, I beat that guy to death to anyone? Because I heard that you were bragging about it from multiple people.\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nNumber one, that wouldn't even be something to brag about. It ain't like a deer or something, you know?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear you say that, I got to say. So where would people get that from?\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nJust a damn small town, man. Shit gets fucking twisted.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nBut saying that you told them directly to their face?\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nHell, I don't know, buddy.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI don't know either. I can't tell if what Kabrahm is saying to my face right now is true or not. I spoke to Kabrahm's father, too, Kendall Burt, and told him that John said he'd overheard him on the phone here at K3 one day saying something about how his son was guilty as hell, and he knew it. And Kendall told me he doesn't know what John heard him say, or if he heard him say anything, but that he's a tough-love kind of guy, and that if his son had done something like killed a person, he would never cover that up.\n\nAccording to Kabrahm, there is a moral to this story. He shares it with me after I wonder aloud to him about something one of the police officers told me. Why did his buddy Tim, rather than pressing charges against the man that almost killed him with a knife, decide instead to shove his middle finger in the face of the cops when they came to talk to him in his hospital bed?\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nI mean, nobody wants to be a tattletale.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI mean, dude almost died. He got stabbed in the neck.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nKabrahm takes a drag of his cigarette.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nYou're shrugging your shoulders.\n\nKABRAHM BURT:\nIf he gonna live like white trash and shit, then hell, you might as well not tell on nobody, because, you know, if that's the life you're trying to live, you can't be mad when, you know\u2014low-down, dirty shit like that happens when you hang out with low-down, dirty people.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nYou there?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nI'm here.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nCool.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nI'm waiting on tea to boil.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nDo you have time to talk? I have some stuff I'd love to talk to you about.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nI'm sitting here\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nAre you busy?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\n\u2014right now at 2:25 with my orange pants on, waiting for Tyler to get his ass back over here. I figured you was calling to lower the boom or some damn stuff\u2014go to town.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nYeah, it's my turn to talk a lot. I have a lot to catch you up on, actually.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI'm excited to tell John what I figured out, finally, after all this time. I now narrate the story of the real crime back to him, almost a year and a half after he first told me about it, with details colored in and facts illuminated, including the rather germane one that Kabrahm did not kill anybody. After I'm done, John summarizes my findings.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nA bunch of fussing and fighting, snaggletooth, stolen trucks, meth labs, stabbing, hooping, hollering, and going to jail? I can't believe how much you've worked on this son of a bitch, and at the same time\u2014\n\n[SIGH]\n\nMy God.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhat? Why the sigh?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nI'm sitting here looking out the window at the clouds going by, just in loathing disgust at the town that I live in and the fact that I didn't pack my bags and get the hell out of here decades ago. I think it's the part about hiding in the woods that did it. That's just so classic Bibb County. I don't know how many times I've heard that expression in my life\u2014\"hiding in the woods.\" I think hiding in the woods in Bibb County is like having your afternoon tea in London.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nYou know, there is another way John could have responded to all this news. I dare call it the normal way. That sigh he let out, rather than being one of despair, could have been one of relief\u2014relief that a young man has not been killed, that local officials have not been bought off by a powerful, rich family, and that, in fact, law enforcement has done what appears to be a competent job responding to this incident. Shittown, at least in this case, doesn't look so, so terrible to me.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI don't know. Progress, right?\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBRIAN REED:\nBut no. I've learned that sometimes you catch John in a spell of depression, sometimes you catch him in a bout of mania, and sometimes, like today, I think, you catch him in an alchemy of the two.\n\n[SIGH]\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nI'm trying to think of a snappy comeback to that.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nBecause what is it, if not progress?\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nOh my God. Oh, Lord, it's just a clusterfuck of sorrow, isn't it?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nA clusterfuck of sorrow.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nIt's kind of like progress as in ISIS is making progress. You know, it's that type of progress.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nIt's like ISIS, is all I can come up with. Oh, shit.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBRIAN REED:\nDamn, man. I'm over here busting my ass off. When you contacted me, you wanted to know what actually happened. So it's progress in that sense, right?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nIt's progress in that sense.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI am not saving the world over here. Climate change is\u2014\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nYou are definitely not saving the world.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nNo. Climate change\u2014\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nNot by a long shot.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nClimate change is not ending. I am not bringing jobs and sustainable employment to Alabama and lifting people out of poverty. But you asked me to try and figure out what happened here. On that front, I've made progress.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nI think you've done pretty goddamn good.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWell, thank you.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nI guess if I sound like I'm disinterested today, it's firstly because I'm tired and wore-ass out. And secondly because, you know, I just\u2014I'm not the most cheerful person. You know, I spend most spare time now either studying energy or climate change, and it's not looking good. So yes, sometimes it's hard for me to get focused back on something when the whole goddamned Arctic summer sea ice is going to be gone by 2017. And we're fixing to have heat waves in Siberia this year, and sometimes I feel like a total idiot because I'm worried about a goddamn crackhead out here in fucking Shittown, Alabama.\n\nSo yeah, that's just a personality disorder of mine. You know, sometimes when you call me, I'm kind of in an upbeat mood. And sometimes, like today, you caught me in one of these tired, somber, you know, reflective moods, where I've been, you know, sitting there mulling over climate change for about the past 10 damned hours. Oh, I mean, my God\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhen John says he's been mulling over climate change for the past 10 hours, what I think he means is that he's been mulling over climate change for the past 10 hours. I don't think he's exaggerating. It's like work for him, like he's made it his job.\n\nWe've now been talking to each other for a year and a half, and while some of that time we've discussed the murder, there's been so much other stuff John wants to chat about. It's interesting stuff, but it's all over the place. Even if I haven't talked to him in a while, nearly every day he sends me emails about all sorts of global calamities that he continues to keep up with, even though they've fallen out of the news.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nHow many people are still concerned today about the Philippines?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nHe's referring to Typhoon Haiyan from 2013. Or how about the tsunami in Sri Lanka in 2004, John says, or the terrible flood in Pakistan the year before last?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nNot hearing a lot about that, are you?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nHow about the fallout from the Ebola outbreak, or the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, or\u2014a deeper cut\u2014Chernobyl? The list goes on and on. And it's not just catastrophe. John also gives me lectures and sends reports on the systemic problems he sees leading to complete breakdown of the social contract\u2014problems in our food production chain, our health care industry, our monetary policy.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\n\u2014all the fucking hedonic regression, geometric weighting.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nHe also shares a variety of disturbing stories that he manages to dig up from all corners of the country, about the son of a US senator suffocating 21 dogs, or a KKK branch giving out bags of candy to children as a recruitment effort in South Carolina, or a guy down the street from John trying to kill his wife by running her over with a Bobcat.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nI was on Homefacts last night. The city of West Blocton has outdone Vance as being the child molester per capita capital of Alabama.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThis is another data point John likes to send me now and again\u2014the number of sex offenders per capita in his area. Vance and West Blocton are both towns in Bibb County.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nVance is now one child molester for every 192 citizens. West Blocton is for about over 63 or 4.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhy do you check that statistic so often?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nWhy do I check crude oil plus lease condensate production so often, or why do I go pore over the tables from the IPCC so often?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThe IPCC being the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\n\u2014and I've tied down a couple other people\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nFor the longest time, I thought the only connection between all of John's random interests was that it was all shitty. But the connection is deeper than that. He's distressed by the lack of outrage compared to the amount of shittiness in the world. To him, that ratio is totally out of whack.\n\nThat's why he was still upset about the Kabrahm rumor, even after I told him it wasn't true. Even though the murder and the cover-up weren't real, everyone sure did believe they were, and still they did nothing. That part, the inaction\u2014that's more disturbing to John than the idea of the murder itself.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nYou know, I really hate that these kids know all the things that they know, and they just accept them as normal.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI know. That seems to really bother you, huh?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nAccept it as something you can't do nothing about.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThe shitty misfortunes John fixates on, they're not a bunch of disparate things. They're all the same thing. His Shittown is part of Bibb County, which is part of Alabama, which is part of the United States, which is part of Earth, which is experiencing climate change, which no one is doing anything about. It maddens John. The whole world is giving a collective shrug of its shoulders and saying fuck it.\n\nWhat I admire about John is that in his own misanthropic way, he's crusading against one of the most powerful, insidious forces we face\u2014resignation, the numb acceptance that we can't change things. He's trying to shake people out of their stupor, trying to convince them that it is possible to make their world a better place.\n\nYes, that lady over there, she's barefoot and she's pantsless, but we can lend her shoes. We can give her some pants. Instead of just putting our heads down and speeding past her and muttering that she must have done something to get like that, we can ask her if she's in trouble, and we can offer her help. There is a different way.\n\nThat's why John rants and raves at the tattoo parlor. That's why John adopts dozens of stray dogs. That's why he devotes night after night to studying and writing about climate change. That's why he contacted a national radio show and asked me to come investigate. And that's why I now see John is devoting so much energy to what is arguably his most ambitious project of all\u2014radically altering the life of Tyler Goodson.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nTyler almost embodies everything I hate about this Shittown in one convenient package. Have you ever thought of it that way? I bet you haven't dared.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nAs the months have gone by since my trip to Alabama, I've heard more and more about Tyler. I've learned all about his tough childhood, the petty legal troubles that continue to dog him, his persistent financial problems, his struggle to support his three daughters, whom he had by the age of 21, and whom he loves dearly.\n\nJohn has devoted his life to restoring old clocks. Methodically and thoroughly, he sorts through the busted parts of these timepieces, trying to revive a sense of beauty and order. And in a way, that's what he's attempting to do with Tyler. Every time John picks up the phone and I ask what he's up to, Tyler's either there or he was just there, or he's waiting for him to get there. It seems like he's giving him consistent work.\n\nJohn's also been accompanying Tyler to court and hiring him a lawyer to help him clear up some misdemeanor charges and get his driver's license back. And Tyler's recently moved to the trailer park across the street from John, so now he can easily walk to John's place. John's even talking about writing Tyler and his brother Jake into his will.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nI don't want these two bastards to know this, but when I fall over dead, each one is going to get 20 ounces of gold each.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI'll keep that secret.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nThat's assuming the goddamn cops don't come in and steal it.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nBut John's relationship with Tyler is not just as a benefactor. I can tell that they get something more from one another. John will mention a walk he and Tyler took through the woods, or an expedition they made to the junkyard to search for treasures, or he'll recount some bit of their conversation. They like to spend time together.\n\nOne day, John was on the phone with me, and he looked out his window and started listing off the flowers that were in bloom in his yard, and the ones that were dying. He sighed and said,\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nIt's tedious and brief. That's a sundial motto\u2014tedious and brief.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nBefore we had clocks, we had sundials, and I never thought about this until I started talking to John, but watching a sundial, which could be as simple as a stick in the ground, as the shadow crept along, you were actually witnessing the rotation of the Earth. It's so much less abstracted than a clock, a level closer to time itself. Anyway, John told me sundials often have mottos engraved on them. John says \"tedious and brief\" is one.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhat do you mean, \"tedious and brief?\"\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nYour life is tedious and brief. All sundial mottos are sad like that.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThere are hundreds of these mottos. \"Life passes like this shadow.\" \"Make haste, but slowly.\" \"Use the hours, don't count them.\" \"Even as you watch, I'm fleeing.\" \"Soon comes night.\"\n\nThese little reminders are out there, hidden in crannies around the world. I recently happened upon a sundial in the cemetery of an old Catholic mission next to a grave. Because of John, I knew to look for the motto. It read, \"Nil boni hodie. Diem perdidi.\" \"I did nothing good today. I have lost a day.\"\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nYou know, I told you, I used to make sundials, but I made them for the mathematical exercise. You know, I would pick difficult dials to do as a test of my abilities of geometry and trigonometry. And these are things I wish Tyler and Jake could experience. There's a real excitement in geometry and trigonometry that's just, you know\u2014I think when we was building the swing\u2014you know, I built a swing for Tyler\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nThis is one of the ways John and Tyler have been passing the hours together lately. They've been constructing an adult swingset, a giant rectangular frame, to the side of John's house, not far from the apple trees, with a single John Deere tractor seat hanging from it. It has a 20-foot arc of action, John says, which I understand to mean it's a pretty gnarly swing. When John first told me about it, he'd said he was building it for himself. But now he amends that.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nI think I built a swing for Tyler, actually. I found out that an old man of 50, when he swings in a swing for about 20 minutes, his back hurts and his knees hurt, so I didn't build it for me after all. I done found that out. So I think I built it for Tyler. Fuck it.\n\nOh, and I built him a pull-up bar, because he wants to be strong. I told him, well, it's nice to be physically strong, but you need to be strong between the ears, because physical strength goes away. You know, you need to have strong neurons. And I told him, you need to have a little bit of general algebra. You should always have some trigonometry and you should have some geometry.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhat did he say?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nHe never\u2014I remember this conversation. He said he never saw how it is that had anything you could do much with.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI like imagining this odd pair, a polymathic, middle-aged clock restorer and a tatted-up kid in his 20s with a Harley and a revolver in his briefcase, out in John's yard on a summer's day, staking swingset poles into the ground, the dogs circling around them, maybe a butterfly fluttering by. I like imagining John interrupting their work for a minute to give Tyler a math lesson, feeling gratified that he has someone to give a math lesson to, and Tyler perhaps taking something from it, but at the very least humoring John, because he's grateful that John's helping him get his life together. I like knowing that this is how two people have chosen to spend an afternoon together in Bibb County, Alabama. \"Take the gifts of this hour,\" one sundial says. Another, \"It's later than you think.\"\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nAnd I point out the diagonal chain that was going to shore up the upright\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nOf the swing set?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nYeah. I told him that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the two sides. He hadn't used Pythagoras' theorem. So we could calculate the length of the chain without climbing up on the goddamn top of the pole and pulling it in diagonal with the tape measure. That was my answer.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nAnd what did he say?\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\n\"Mm,\" or something like that.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nMm.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nYeah. He has a lot of his daddy's mannerisms. \"Mm\" is often heard when there's not a significant answer. Hold on, hold on. I'm gonna piss in the sink. I hope that's politically incorrect. That's something that flips Tyler out. Yes, I just pissed in the kitchen sink, because\u2014\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI can't\u2014\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nIf the phone had enough signal, I would just go out there and piss near one of the gardenias or the azaleas or the camellias or the crepe myrtles because, you know they like acid.\n\n[BLOWING NOSE]\n\nBut I didn't think the phone had enough signal, so instead of wasting three or four gallons to flush the commode, I just peed here in the kitchen sink and used about 1 cupful of water to flush the sink. And I got a little short dick, but I got a pretty good aim, so I can usually aim right for the center of that damn thing without splashing everywhere.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nBRIAN REED:\nOh, man.\n\nJOHN B. McLEMORE:\nBut in any event\u2014what was the question? I forgot.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nI forgot too.\n\n[PHONE RINGING]\n\nSKYLER:\nHello?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nHey, is Jake around? Is this Skyler?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nIt's been a couple weeks since I last spoke to John, and I just got a text from Jake, Tyler's brother, asking me to call him when I get a chance.\n\nSKYLER:\nYeah, this is Skyler. I was the one that called you. Jake texted you for me.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nOh, hey.\n\nSKYLER:\nHas any\u2014hold on just one second. Has anybody called you?\n\nBRIAN REED:\nNo, not that I know of. I have a few missed calls, but I don't think they're from anybody down there.\n\nSKYLER:\nOh.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nWhy?\n\nSKYLER:\nWell, we have some bad news to tell you.\n\nBRIAN REED:\nOK.\n\nSKYLER:\nJohn B. killed himself Monday night.\n\n[MUSIC - THE ZOMBIES, \"A ROSE FOR EMILY]\n\nS-Town is produced by Julie Snyder and me, with editing from Ira Glass, Joel Lovell, Sarah Koenig, Neil Drumming, and Nancy Updike.

gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?\nBaby girl, I'm blue\n\n[Verse 1: Action Bronson]\nBecause you treat me like shit\nI paid for the bed and never even slept in it\nI paid for that crib I never stepped foot in\nAnd now somebody else is eating all the pudding\nThings change, now my dashboard wooden\nAll black Benz, like a young Doc Gooden\nDark shades, 'cause I'm stone crazy\nGirl, we grown, stop playin' on my phone, baby\nAll your childish attempts to make me angry fall short\nWhich only fuels the rage you have, because you have nothing\nUnderstandable, I'm shinin' brilliant with five Brazilians\nThere were times I used to hide my feelings\nNow I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini\nAnd motherfuckers can't see me\nWait 'til this chick see me on TV, I make the shit look easy\nWho would've thought I hit you right back?\n[Chorus: Action Bronson]\nWhy you always all on my back?\nWhy you gotta do me like that?\nWhy you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?\nBaby girl, I'm blue\n\n[Verse 2: Action Bronson]\nSo many women wanna call me 'baby'\nAnd you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately\nSome would say that I'm the symbol for sex and, uh\nOthers would hate, but I don't give 'em no breath\nGo on a date, I'm at the crib with the chef and, uh\nThat's me, and you could order whatever\nThe specialty is white snake and underwear sauce\nYou could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next\nAnd I understand that's only 'cause I'm popular\nI'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera\nAs Bocelli sings, the celly rings, I gotta go\nYou'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king\nI'm not exactly flawless, but I'm gorgeous, just like a horse is\nI know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous\nStill, I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish\n\n[Chorus: Action Bronson]\nWhy you always all on my back?\nWhy you gotta do me like that?\nWhy you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you?\nBaby girl, I'm blue\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]\nI hope you get a paper cut on your tongue\nFrom a razor in a paper cup\nI hope every soda you drink already shaken up\nI hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun\nI hope your titties all saggy in your early twenties\nI hope there's always snow in your driveway\nI hope you never get off Fridays\nAnd you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays\nI hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket\nI hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen\nI hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck\nAnd your headphones short, and your charger don't work\nAnd you spill shit on your shirt\nI hope your tears don't hurt, and I can smile in your face\nCut my losses, how Delilah changed my locks to a fade\nI hope you happy, I hope you happy\nI hope you ruined this shit for a reason, I hope you happy (Igh!)\n\n[Chorus: Action Bronson]\nWhy you always all on my back?\nWhy you gotta do me like that?\nWhy you

Lalah Hathaway]\nEverything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)\nI want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)\nSome white, some Black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)\nI want everything black (We don't believe)\nEverything black, want all things black\nI don't need black, want everything black\nDon't need black, our eyes ain't black\nI own black, own everything black\n\n[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]\nSix in the morn'\nFire in the street\nBurn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)\nThat's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)\nAnd sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain\nIt's such a shame, they may call me crazy\nThey may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'\nBut homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)\nBlack don't crack, my nigga\n[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nBeen feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses\nYou never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it\nI'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon\nHeritage of a small village, pardon my residence\nCame from the bottom of mankind\nMy hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide\nYou hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture\nYou're fuckin' evil\nI want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey\nYou vandalize my perception but can't take style from me\nAnd this is more than confession\nI mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion\nI'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it\nYou sabotage my community, makin' a killin'\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot\nSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $83You might also like[Chorus: Assassin]\nI said they treat me like a slave, cah' me Black\nWoi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we Black\nAnd man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we Black\nImagine now, big gold chains full of rocks\nHow you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back\nBut now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block\nAll them say we doomed from the start, cah' we Black\nRemember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat\n\n[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nOnce I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean\nI mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society\nThat's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me\nCurse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing\nThat I'ma be just another slave in my head\nInstitutionalized manipulation and lies\nReciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes\nYou hate me, don't you?\nI know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself\nJealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt\nWatchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out\nMuscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah\nBlack and successful, this black man meant to be special\nKatzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?\nHow can I tell you I'm making a killin'?\nYou made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga\n[Pre-Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice\nThe blacker the berry, the bigger I shoot\n[Chorus: Assassin]\nI said they treat me like a slave, cah' me Black\nWoi, we feel a whole heap of pain, cah' we Black\nAnd man a say they put me inna chains, cah' we Black\nImagine now, big gold chains full of rocks\nHow you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back\nBut now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block\nAll them say we doomed from the start, cah' we Black\nRemember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat\n\n[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]\nI'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015\nWhen I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree\nThis plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred\nIt's genocism, it's grimy, little justification\nI'm African-American, I'm African\nI'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan\nI'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French\nBut fuck you \u2014 no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets\nI know you hate me, don't you?\nYou hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you\nI can tell 'cause your ways deceitful\nKnow I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle\nThinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him\nIt's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war\nTwo tribal armies that wanna build and destroy\nRemind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door\nBeefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score\nSo don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers\nOr tell Georgia State \"Marcus Garvey got all the answers\"\nOr try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day\nOr eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays\nOr jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements\nOr watch BET 'cause urban support is important\nSo why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street\nWhen gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?\nHypocrite!\n[Instrumental Outro]\n[Produced by Boi-1da & Koz]1.6KEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 15, "api_path": "/songs/725310", "artist_names": "\u200btwenty one pilots",

with a dollar and got a milli\nJahlil Beats, holla at me!\nI'm like, \"Do it for the gram, ho! Do it for the gram, ho!\"\nShe don't want to bust it, I say, \"Do it for them bands, yo!\"\nI say, \"Do it for them bands\"\nFucking with that broke nigga, you should do it for your man\nLately, I've been on the low with a ho that you probably know\nTook her to the crib and met momma right at the door\nMomma started smiling like, \"Momma, I gotta go\"\nI done took so many trophies to momma\nMy momma know her son a real nigga\nI get that money, pay them bills, nigga\nMy momma told me, \"You a real nigga\"\nAnd I be hanging with them real killers\nNow, what a feeling\nWhen you looking at the latest whip and knowing you can cop it\nOr looking at the baddest bitch and knowing you could pop it\nThe youngest nigga in my city doing it, I got it\nOn that other line with Benjamin, and money is the topic, Lord!\n[Hook]\nThe money turned me into a monster (Hah!)\nThe money turned my noodles into pasta (Hah!)\nThe money turned my tuna into lobster (Whoa!)\nThey want to do me, I maneuver like a

deep (Never deep)\nDropping that nickel out something with leather seats\nI've been sitting on that money like a chair (Like a chair)\nI've been getting to that money all year (All year)\nAll year and my niggas all here\nBut we started from the bottom, we was selling hard squares\nBaddest bitch in the game wearing my chain, I'm ready\nSwitching lanes in that Mulsanne like Andretti (Skrt!)\nI do the Balmain, Balenciaga, no Giuseppe\nIf they sleep on Meek Milly, I kill these niggas like I'm Freddy, oh!\nI eat that pussy like a monster (Monster)\nShe gon' ride the dick, she need a sponsor

These days, Paul is not an introspective conscience-the characterization with which Stendahl wrestled-but a cultural critic, a community organizer, a political philosopher, or a hybrid subject under empire. Yet these very characterizations show that an interest in Paul-the-individual persists. Paul frequently still functions as a paradigmatic human, so that explorations of his theology, politics, and even his subjectivity become the grounds for contemporary meditations on the same.\n\nLet us juxtapose this interest in Paul's thought and actions with two stories that dramatically decenter him and thus begin to change the subject/s. ln his discussion of Paul and African American interpretation, Brian Blount recounts the report of Rev. J. Colcock Jones, a nineteenth-century Methodist missionary, to his missionary board: \"I was preaching to a large congregation [of slaves] on the Epistle to Philemon: and when I insisted on fidelity and obedience as Christian virtues in servants, and upon the authority of Paul, condemned the practice of running away, one-half of my audience deliberately rose up and walked off with themselves.\" 2 In her chapter on postcolonial and feminist biblical interpretation, Kwok Pui-lan tells a similar story about an early-twentieth-century. Chinese woman who could barely read, yet who nonetheless \"used a pin to cut from the Bible verses where Paul instructed women to be submissive and remain silent in the church.\"3\n\nIn both examples, the hearers of Paul's letters take center stage as  hinkers and actors. They interpret Paul (and those who try to interpret Paul for them) for themselves, voting with their feet and hands. Some of the slaves in Rev. Jones's audience stayed to debate. They did not question what Paul really meant, but whether there was such an epistle in the Bible or whether what they had heard was in fact the gospel. 4 Kwok similarly reclaims the interpretive agency of the uneducated woman who edits Paul's text. She notes that remembering the Chinese woman's interpretation can \"enliven the historical and moral imagination\" of feminist postcolonial interpreters because it \"demonstrates how oppressed women have turned the Bible, a product introduced by the colonial officials, missionaries, and educators, into a site of contestation and resistance for their own emancipation.\" 5\n\nIn this chapter, we will suggest that there is much to gain from reading the letters of Paul-in their writing, reception, and afterlives-as sites of debate, contestation, and resistance rather than as articulations of one individual's vision and heroic community-building efforts. 6 Such an approach takes seriously Paul's own writings, where he presents himself as one among many other apostles, teachers, and siblings who struggled together to puzzle out the meaning of being assemblies in Christ. Focusing on Paul alone often replicates his self-authorizing rhetoric and Acts' heroic depiction of him, rather than presenting him as one significant voice among many. 7 By shifting the lens from Paul alone to Paul among others, we gain a better understanding of differences of opinion and perspective, thereby opening debates and productive collaborations both ancient and contemporary, rather than limiting our understanding of the political vision and practices of the Christ assemblies to whatever Paul alone meant or means.\n\nOur discussion proceeds in two stages. First, we explore how politically  engaged Euro-American Pauline scholarship 8 has focused largely on Paul, whether as an anti-imperial hero, an imperial collaborator, or, now, something in between. 9 Despite the attention given to diverse voices in feminist and postcolonial scholarship, Paul's identity, politics, and voice remain the focus of both theological-philosophical engagement and historical reconstruction. Second, we demonstrate the potential of decentering Paul by exploring one theme from postcolonial biblical studies-the idea of travel-and by questioning the constructions of Paul as a heroic traveling missionary in 1 Thessalonians and Acts. At the end, we propose some fruitful areas of inquiry for a decolonizing feminist 10 approach to a politically and communally focused Pauline studies.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Heroic Political Paul\n\n\nThe persistence of a heroic Paul and the magnification of his voice as the voice of the Christ-assemblies with which he was associated result not only from a Western predilection for individualism but also from a process of identification spurred by Paul's rhetoric. From epistle to epistle, Paul offers himself as a model for imitation. 11 even as his self-presentation shifts from community to community-sometimes within a single letter. He is father and nurse (1 Cor 4:15; 1 Thess 2:7), apostle and slave (Gal 1:1; Rom 1:1), both under the law and outside the law (1 Cor 9:20-21). This Paul mediates self and other while negotiating his own particularity and his universal connection to others. Paul offers this rhetorically constructed in-between self as a model for, and an argument to, his inscribed audiences. In this larger context, the hos me injunctions in 1 Cor 7:29-31, where Paul talks about how to live \"as if not\" in a particular condition, and the self-wrestling ego speech in Rom 7:13-25, in which Paul seems tortured about his own actions, can be and have been read as simultaneously Paul and not Paul. That is, they have been read both as windows onto Paul's religious and/or ethnic subjectivity and as compelling expressions of human subjectivity in any place and age. 12\n\nSeveral contemporary discussions about power, difference, religion, and politics have taken up this theme of Paul-as-subject. Despite their differences, we find that the books emerging from the Paul and Politics section of the Society of Biblical Literature and those of continental philosophers thinking about unity and diversity share a tendency to think with and about Paul in the context of contemporary politics. This interest is apparent also in certain scholars from the \"New Perspective\" on Paul. Such approaches are not necessarily problematic. As we will show, they use Paul to think about challenging contemporary issues such as diversity and inclusion. But by centering on Paul rather than situating Paul among those to whom he wrote, they-and we-miss an opportunity to engage with true diversity and the multiple struggles concomitant with it. Such works tend to emphasize one aspect of difference or to whitewash difficult and exclusionary passages in Paul's letters that function in churches today to condemn Judaism as a sin, 13 to deny women's leadership, and to exclude gays and lesbians from full participation in Christian community.\n\nAs is apparent from the title, Paul takes center stage in Pamela Eisenbaum's Paul Was Not a Christian: The Real Message of a Misunderstood Apostle. Building on the New Perspective on Paul, Eisenbaum explains how Paul's writings make more sense if one reads him as a Jew called to apostleship and not as a converted Christian. At the heart of her project is an effort to plumb Paul's logic of how, with the pressure of the end of time, individual salvation is not a key issue but rather the means by which both Jews and Gentiles alike can enter into God's redemption. Paul's particular struggles have contemporary resonance for Eisenbaum: \"I have come to regard Paul as a Jew who wrestled with an issue with which many modern American Jews wrestle: how to reconcile living as aJew with living in and among the rest of the non-Jewish world.'' 14 Focusing on Paul's own relation to difference, Eisenbaum suggests that his writings can provide insights for contemporary engagement with religious difference and pluralism. 15\n\nIn a similar way, Daniel Boyarin's earlier book, A Radical Jew: Paul and the Politics of Identity, takes seriously the New Perspective on Paul, resituating him as a first-century Jewish thinker. Boyarin also finds that Paul's rhetorical stance between particularity and universality helps him to think about the challenges of contemporary identity politics.\n\nIn his very extremity and marginality, Paul is in a sense paradigmatic of \"the Jew.\" He represents the interface between Jew as a self-identical essence and Jew as a construction constantly remade. The very tension in his discourse, indeed in his life, between powerful self-identification as a Jew ... and an equally powerful, or even more powerful, identification of self as everyman is emblematic of Jewish selfhood. 16\n\nFor Boyarin, the Jewish dilemma of the self is one that is characteristic of both our time and Paul's. 17 The particularity of the figure of Paul thus connects the past and present, so that contemporary politics are engaged through a reading of the life and thought of Paul. Boyarin's Paul is complex but also politically heroic, as we see in much of the politically attuned Pauline scholarship of today. Conceding that \"in the reception history of Paul, his texts have generally served what might be broadly called conservative cultural-political interests; they have been used as props in the fight against liberation of slaves and women as well as major supports for theological anti-Judaism,\" Boyarin argues, like many other recent scholars, that \"Paul need not be read this way, indeed, ... his texts support, at least equally well, an alternative reading, one that makes him a passionate striver for human Jiberation and equality.\" 18 In a similar way, much of the recent empire-critical scholarship on Paul presents him as resisting or reversing imperial discourses and structures. 19 The four volumes emerging from the Paul and Politics section of the Society of Biblical Literature, for example, feature several explications of Paul's subversive efforts to overturn the logic and power relations of empire. 20 Many scholars have taken as the hermeneutical key to all of Paul's writings the pre-Pauline baptismal statement in Gal 3:28 (\"there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and female:') rather than Romans 13, in which Paul appears to urge quiescence to empire, or 1 Corinthians 11, where women's voices in prayer or prophecy are circumscribed by the act of veiling. 21 In this way Paul is read as a culturalpolitical visionary who is relevant.to those of us with a particular political bent-not perfect, but still savvy, a subtle revolutionary in the midst of a hierarchical empire. 22\n\nWhere New Testament scholars generally privilege Paul's historical particularity and sometimes draw larger analogies between Paul's writings and contemporary identity politics or struggles with/against American empire, European scholars like Slavoj Zizek, Alain Badiou, and Giorgio Agamben approach the themes of Paul's thought as timeless philosophical categories. 23 Thus, Paul the solitary political subject moves beyond the fields of biblical studies and Christian theology to engage with continental philosophy and cultural criticism, where he becomes a heroic philosopher of universalism and love. 24 For Zizek, for example, Paul argues for a nation and culturetranscending agape, a love \"that enjoins us to 'unplug' from the organic community into which we were born-or, as Paul puts it, for a Christian, there are neither men nor women, neither Jews nor Greeks. 25 While these conversations aim to energize new communal secular-political visions, they do so without the chorus of New Testament scholars who have worked to expose the Christian supersessionism and anti-Semitism of many interpretations of Paul. 26 Such a decontextualization allows secular authors to rehabilitate an authoritative (Christian) Paul as a loving Everyman who successfully and rightly supersedes his (Jewish) particularity.\n\nIn our opinion, these varied depictions of a political Paul and his politics, whether created by biblical scholars or European cultural critics and philosophers, fail to articulate adequately the fact that Paul was and continues to be one among many, part of a community that is diverse and multicentered. 27 Where political debate is theorized, it is most often framed as a dialogue either between the historical Paul and his (usually wrongheaded) epistolary audiences or between a political Paul and contemporary beliefs about religious exclusivism/ capitalism/ empire. 28 As Boyarin notes, \"When Paul says, there is no Jew or Greek, no male and female in Christ, he is raising an issue with which we still struggle. Are the specificities of human identity, the differences, of value, or are they only an obstacle in the striving for justice?\" 29 We could extend this discussion to the ancient ekklesia that first heard the letter or even to communities today by imagining that they might debate the issues raised in Paul's letters rather than simply accepting or rejecting Paul's words on the subject.\n\nTo some extent our critique-the belief that we should turn the scholarly focus from a reconstruction or use of Paul alone to consideration of Paul's letters as sites of contestation and debate-has already been enacted and heard. In each of the SBL's Paul and Politics sessions, a feminist scholar has disrupted or mitigated the focus on a heroic anti-imperial Paul by calling for serious consideration of the perspectives and contributions of his comrades and interlocutors in both the ancient ekklesiai and the history of interpretation. 30 Some of the hearers have acted on these constructive critiques. 31 For example, in The Arrogance of Nations: Reading Romans in the Shadow of Empire, Neil Elliott-a longtime champion of the anti-imperial Paul-engages some feminist interpretations of Paul and draws on the writings of Fredric Jameson and Antonio Gramsci to map both the context and the limitations of Paul's political discourse. Elliott concludes that Paul's hierarchical and messianic political solution is the only thinkable or utterable counterpoint to the extreme violence and claims to universal sovereignty that characterize imperial rule. His approach thus helps to trace the inscription of kyriarchal logic in Romans-that is, how Paul's vision of God's victory is a political counterpoint to Roman imperial systems of domination that simultaneously replicates aspects of imperial logic. However, Arrogance of Nations does not explore whether any nascent or alternative political responses to empire might have been present in Paul's communities or activated by diverse interpreters of Paul.\n\nElliottt's Judean political Paul disrupts impenal and capitalist Euro-American Christianity. 32 Paul's Gentile audience in Romans is loosely correlated with \"modern, comfortable, more-or-less secularized first-world Christians who remain the primary consumers of Pauline scholarship.\" 33 With important prompting from Latin American liberation theologians and the struggles against poverty and injustice in Haiti, Elliott reads Paul's God-talk in Romans as giving voice to the human struggle for justice and freedom, what Fredric Jameson calls the \"single vast unfinished plot\" of history. 34\n\nElliott makes an important step forward by beginning his book with Haitian women and Latin American martyrs and theologians. Yet these figures do not play a role in the main part of the book, with the result that their multivocality is made univocal: within the ekklesiai of Christ, Paul alone becomes the voice of those struggling under empire. In the end, it seems the arrogant Gentiles and the political Paul are the worst and best sides of (white, liberal) U.S. Christianity. 35\n\nHow might these contemporary figures-the voices of Haitians, Latin Americans, others-be foregrounded in the project of historical reconstruction so that they add to our understanding of how the letter to the Romans might have been heard in the imperial metro pole? 36 Incorporating such voices does not mean that historians necessarily risk having less precision in their reconstructions of the ancient world; such voices rather \"enliven our historical imaginations,\" as Kwok suggests, regarding the possible range of responses of those who first received Paul's letter. Such voices also disrupt a center-and-margins view of contemporary political discourse; they open up the possibility that the women in Haiti might have political visions that complicate, contest, reframe, or even discard Paul's vision (and thus Elliott's and our own). The meaning of Romans might then be varied and its possibilities and limitations more fully unfolded. 37 Such an approach takes Paul's letters as partial inscriptions of the political visions and debates of the Christ-assemblies rather than as a repository for Paul's thought alone.\nThe persistence of the Paul-centered habit in politically engaged Pauline studies is apparent even among postcolonial feminist and gender-critical scholars. Both Davina Lopez and Joseph Marchal, for example, situate their work in a complex nexus of empire-critical, postcolonial, feminist, and gender-critical interpretations of Paul. Each is clear about the need to confront the intertwined sexist, racist, and colonialist legacies of the Pauline tradition. Reading them side by side, however, does not produce a unified feminist or postcolonial view of Paul. Instead, two different portraits of Paul emerge: the rhetorical-textual Paul is either the organizer of the empire's subjugated nations or their imperial subjugator. Paul either undermines or wields dominant notions of masculinity.\n\nIn her preface, Lopez states, \"this book seeks to re-imagine Paul's consciousness and communities as critically liberationist in orientatiop. and transformative in potential.\" 38 She situates her project as intervening in contemporary debates that draw on an authoritative figure of Paul in order to exclude and dehumanize society's marginalized. She asks:\n\nWho can claim Paul as authoritative? ... With whom does Paul side? I re-imagine Paul as occupying a vulnerable, subversive social position of solidarity among others and as part of a useable past for historically dominated and marginalized peoples in the present. 39\n\nThe framework of Apostle to the Conquered is thus defined by an intentionally Paul centered approach that sees Paul's solidarity with the conquered and marginalized as part of \"building a more just human and earth community.\" 40\n\nLopez's book does not explore the complexities of Paul's self-construction across his letters, 41 nor the possibility that the \"nations\" to which he wrote might not desire or uniformly appreciate his particular form of rescue and resurrection. In reality, they might have debated with him or even ignored him, as it appears some did in Galatians. In addition, this authoritative Paul functions importantly as a model for political conversion (or, more accurately, consciousness raising) in the U.S. context, that is, for those who need to recognize and repent of their complicity with imperial politics. If we ignore Paul's conversation partners and his shifting self-presentation in response to them, the diverse subjects in the Pauline assemblies become the recipients of Paul's mission rather than subjects with political agency and imagination.\n\nMarchal's Paul is defined with similar sharpness. 42 In his view, however, Paul did not offer liberation to the communities to which he wrote, but rather a new form of colonialism. Marchal's intersectional analysis shows clearly that empire-critical work cannot sidestep the fundamental hierarchical structures of gender, sexuality, race, and nation that are embedded in imperial discourse on their way to an anti-imperial Paul. Throughout the book, Marchal applies to Paul's letter to the Philippians the four broad questions posed by Musa Dube in Postcolonial Feminist Interpretation of the Bible for identifying the influence of imperial and/or colonial ideologies ([1] Does this text have a clear stance against the political imperialism of its time? [2] Does this text encourage travel to distant and inhabited lands, and if so, how does it justify itself? [3] How does this text construct difference: does it promote dialogue and liberating independence or condemnation of all that is foreign? [4] Does this text employ gender and divine representations to construct relationships of subordination and domination?). 43 He concludes that \"both Paul's letters and Pauline interpretation are the results ofimperially gendered rhetorical activities.\" 44 Marchal thus locates the political-rhetorical Paul and his interpreters on an undifferentiated trajectory stretching from Roman to EuroAmerican Christian imperialism. Marchal writes in order to challenge the empirecritical scholarship discussed above, so that the scholarly production of the singularly anti-imperial Paul births its opposite: a singularly imperial Paul. This single-minded focus on Paul is not Marchal's intent; 45 the application of Dube's questions to Paul functions primarily to enact a feminist, postcolonial critique of the heroic political Paul. Thus, while it makes sense to begin with Dube's questions, developing them with a concern for multiple contexts and interpretations of imperial rhetoric might tell a different story (or complicate a single one). In short, we need to ask whether Paul's selfauthorizing rhetoric (and its reinscriptions) might be better understood in the context of debates within the ekklesiai of Christ and the history of interpretation rather than as a general will to imperial power.\n\nEmpire-critical approaches to Paul confront imperialist and capitalist Euro-American Christianity either by opposing it with Paul's obscured and now revealed anti-imperial gospel or by exposing the complicity of Paul's rhetoric with imperial ideologies. At the same time, they construct Western Christianity and U.S. politics as religious-political monoliths, obscuring the ways in which each has been and continues to be a complex site of oppression, liberation, and local contestation. As Schussler Fiorenza has argued, a Paul-centered approach accepts Paul's self-construction as founder and authoritative teacher, thus limiting our ability to imagine the diverse communities of women and men that supported, shaped, and even differed from Paul without thereby being imperialistic themselves. 46\n\nWe propose that an approach that is both feminist and decolonizing should interpret the letters of Paul as embedded in a contested, complex, and shifting context that includes both ancient empire and modern neocolonialism, thus allowing an engagement with the present to revise our approach to the past and vice versa. These epistles-produced, read, and debated by multiple voices and dialogical in their very nature, even if we lack half of the correspondence and all of the oral communications-inscribe a variety of communities that were engaged in negotiating, contesting, and colluding in the context of empire. An approach that decenters Paul requires that we interrogate Paul's arguments in light of their silenced or elided counter-arguments, interpreting Paul's self-construction as reacting to and against various other self-understandings. Such an approach also allows us to recognize the diversity of Pauls after Paul, as letters written under Paul's name and narratives that feature Paul the heroic Christian missionary add to the diversity and richness of our understanding of the contestation and debates that took place in early Christian communities.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Disrupting the Heroic Traveling Missionary:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01 Thessalonians and Acts as Test Cases\n\n\nHow can we begin to enact such a program of feminist and decolonizing interpretation? Following Marchal, let us consider one of Dube's programmatic questions for bringing postcolonial analnis to bear on biblical studies: \"Does this text encourage travel to distant and inhabited lands, and how does it justify itself ?\" 47 Putting this question to 1 Thessalonians produces some interesting observations for an ekklesia-focused interpretation. Ostensibly, the letter narrates the travels of Paul and his co-workers from Philippi (2:2) to Thessalonica (2:2-13) to Athens (3:1), while constructing Paul's imitative readers (1:6) as self-sufficient (2:9), heroic travelers who bravely face danger (2:2, 15; 3:7). The justification and the measure of Paul's success are sacralized: \"We have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak not to please people but to please God\" (2:4). Such a missionary needs no invitation. God wills his territorial presence, and his aggressive persistence (2:18) is coded as perseverance against sinfulness (2:14-16) and godlessness (1:9).\n\nWe need not search far to trace some possible effects of Paul's self-construction. 48 In a sermon entitled \"The Qualities of a Great Missionary,\" the popular American evangelical preacher John MacArthur draws on the brief description of Paul's experience in Philippi in 1 Thessalonians 2:2 to claim Paul's missionary boldness as a \"quality with no substitute\" for both Paul and contemporary Christians: 49\n\nEven after they had been beaten up and were treated shamefully, they were still bold. Paul could never be daunted, there just wasn't any way to stop him ... When you want to start something for God, you get organized first and then say, \"Here I go, God. I'm doing this for you.\" But as soon as you take one step, Satan is there. Now you have a test. If you have boldness, you go right through to victory. Boldness is essential to victory because it is the quality that makes you go through the test when you' re being resisted... If you have the opportunity on your job to share Jesus Christ, and your supervisor says, \"Shut up or you'll be fired,\" in your heart say, \"Good,\" and then continue to declare Jesus Christ. If you are fired for sharing Christ, go to a new job and you will have some new territory for declaring Jesus Christ. And if your neighbor can't stand your testimony, she will move away and a new one will come. Boldness makes for greater opportunity, and it always did in the Book of Acts. They were bold and people got upset. They would be thrown out of places and they would go to new places ... Don't be ashamed. Boldness is basic because there will always be resistance. Boldness is the only capacity that says, \"I will not succumb to the resistance.\" Now that doesn't mean that you should be a bull in a china closet, stomping all over people's necks and becoming terribly offensive. 50 But it does mean that nobody should be allowed to stop you in a ministry that you believe the Spirit of God has called you to. 51\nThis interpretation of Paul as a heroic missionary is not being used for authorizing a foreign missionary society. 52Yet the language of competing for territory-the job and the neighborhood-and the expectation of victory easily evoke that history and locate the daily struggles of the addressee-the emboldened \"you\" -within it.\n\nRegardless of Paul's context or intent, the heroic Paul takes on a life of his own with the help of the book of Acts and contemporary interpreters who shape buld and territorially minded Christians through an identification with the figure of Paul. Many New Testament scholars could easily provide an effective and even convincing historical counterpoint to MacArthur's reading of Paul. For example, they could critique MacArthur's individualizing, religious, self-authorizing reading with a reading of Paul as \"other\" with a communal outlook and a countercultural politics. This process, however, would also replicate the tendency to cast Paul as a hero and to draw on his life and thinking to address contemporary social, political, and religious issues. 53\n\nFirst Thessalonians' construction of Paul as a heroic, tramping traveler is, however, just that: a construction. Thus we might also think about the letter's image of Paul as a suffering and triumphant apostle in relation to the text's construction of the ancient ekklesia in Thessalonica, asking what such a construction attempts to produce or hide and how it might take on different force in different contexts 54The heroic apostolic traveler contrasts with the construction of the Thessalonians in the letter. It is Paul and his co-workers who faced trouble in Philippi, and Paul who is lonely in Athens but prevented by Satan from returning. The community members are not called to be imitators of Paul by actively traveling and preaching; rather, they imitate Paul and Jesus when they receive the word (1:7). Combined with Paul's advice to the community to live quietly and mind their own affairs, the narration of the traveling Paul rhetorically renders the Thessalonians passive, localizing them to smaller spheres of movement and influence and minimizing their suffering by smoothing their relations with the larger society. While Paul appears as the counter-cultural persecuted hero for the gospel, the community should \"command the respect of outsiders\" (4:11).\n\nBut perhaps the community was not so insular. The letter does not describe how the word about the Thessalonians had spread through the region. But by mentioning that they already love all the communities throughout Macedonia, the letter points to existing networks of information and economic exchange. Such connections were likely maintained not by traveling apostles or missionaries but through the travel of various ordinary men and women-slave messengers, poor artisans and agricultural laborers seeking work in the cities, and members of households connected by various informal and formal familial ties such as marriage, adoption, inheritance, and other factors. 55 As the rhetoric of the self-sufficient traveler draws on imperial discourses, so also these communal networks emerge from the realities of empire, including the system of Roman roads and the increase in mobility and urban populations that resulted from economic and social displacement. 56 If we privilege the apostolic traveler, we hear the prelude to ideologies of colonization and the centralization of leadership around a few heroic men. If we privilege a much wider range of travelers and social networks, we see structures of economic survival and diverse efforts to create distinctive communities in Christ in the context of an expanding empire. 57\n\nDespite Paul's construction of apostolic independence and lonely suffering, he himself is fully a part of these networks of support. He has received financial support from the Philippians (Phil 4:16), and he must make the case that he supported himself while he was living among the Thessalonians (1 Thess 2:9). Paul's economic dependence is problematic for him because it can easily be spun as greedy and self-promoting (2:5). Moreover, in the context of hegemonic imperial constructions of masculinity, it also signals his weakness. Thus, in 1 Thessalonians Paul masks his economic need through claims to economic self-sufficiency and imagery that speaks of caretaking rather than dependence - \"we were gentle among you, like a nurse taking care of her children\" (2:7) and \"like a father with his children\" (2:11 ). In this gender-slipping self-presentation, we see an example of community leaders in colonized positions constructing their own relative weakness as power. But Paul's rhetoric also serves to infantilize the community and thus to subordinate any community leadership to his own. 58\n\nPaul's status and authority with the community are evidently at stake. Although 1 Thessalonians is widely characterized as a letter of encouragement or consolation, it is Paul who sends Timothy to confirm that the community has not lost its regard for Paul in light of the afflictions he faced when among them (3:1-5). If anything, their message (sent through Timothy) was a message of encouragement to Paul. This reading of Paul among others restores Paul to sociality as a participant in networks of women and men who promote, resist, or ignore him while he is away. 59\n\nThus, the Pauline letters represent the creation of structures of interdependence and identity among competing but subordinated subjectivities in the context of empire. They also contribute to the construction of powerful configurations of outsiders and foreignness that drew new maps in the context of Western territorial expansion. 60 The \"mission to the gentiles\" in the Pauline letters is not the same as the nineteenth-century Western missionary movement. 61 If we fail to see these complex negotiations ofidentity in the particular context of the Roman Empire, then Paul-the-Jew becomes a colonizer of the Gentiles (despite their being the dominant culture) and our interpretations replicate the anti-Judaism that has long characterized triumphalist Christianity. 62 When this happens, we are effectively reading Paul's letters through Acts.\n\nDespite more than a century of cautions about using Acts to read Paul, scholars continue to do this in an effort to make sense of the order and content of Paul's epistles. Frequently Acts 16-17, the account of Paul in Philippi and Thessalonike, is used to explain both 1 Thessalonians and Paul's stance toward the Roman Empire. We suggest that a decolonizing feminist analysis should take into account not only \"the genuine Paul\" but also his afterlife in pseudepigraphical letters and narrative representations. Investigation of the politics and rhetoric of Paul-after-Paul can sensitize us to what is occluded and revealed when we read Paul through these later lenses. Viewed in this framework, Acts is one of the earliest interpretations of the Pauline traditions, an interpretation that famously ignores the-weak and letter-writing Paul while weaving from various strands in Paul's own rhetorical self-construction a larger-than-life hero.\n\nThe issue of space and geography, introduced so powerfully in Acts 2, 63 recurs throughout the book as the narrative moves from Jerusalem to Rome with Paul collecting cities for the Christian Way. 64 Acts participates in a kind of urban and imperial network building that was common at the time as subjected Greek cities sought to find their place in the oikoumene (\"inhabited world\") of the Roman Empire. The Roman emperor Hadrian, for instance, sponsored and encouraged such coalitions of Greek city-states in the form of a Panhellenion, centered in Athens, that engaged in religious and judicial activities, maintaining that they had ancient ethnic ties to Athens, on the one hand, and current ties to Rome through politics and benefactions, on the other. 65\n\nLuke uses a logic similar to that of the Panhellenion to craft a coalition of Christian cities from across the oikoumene, most of which were brought into this network by the mapping movement of Paul's body. In Paul's own letters we see a plurality of apostles; in other New Testament texts, including the beginning of Acts, we see a diversity of co-workers and theological ideas within earliest Christianity. Yet the narrative of Acts funnels the reader's focus ever narrower. This is similar to other stories of travel from this period, which reflect Rome's interest in geographical expansion and conquest, on the one hand, and the model of ancient Greek travelers, on the other. Men are cast in the mold of the Odysseus of old, bravely making their way through exotic regions with different customs, wealth, and dangers. Acts likewise narrows its focus from an initial interest in various apostolic (and other) travelers to center increasingly on Paul as a quintessential traveler. Philologically and ideologically, Luke effectively reduces the plural Christian ekklesiai or civic assemblies of Paul's letters (the plural appears only once in Acts) to a singular ekklesia (mentioned twenty-two times in Acts) and thus to one univocal church. Local networks of support and contested leadership are erased by the attention on Paul's dangerous, heroic, relentless move across much of the Roman oikoumene.\n\nIn the sections of Acts that are set in Philippi and Thessalonica, there seem to be tensions between Paul and the Roman Empire. In Philippi, Paul and his cohort are accused of being Jews (Ioudaioi) who are disturbing the city: \"They advocate customs which it is not lawful for us Romans to accept or practice\" (16:20-21 RSV). Yet Paul the traveler, despite being accused of sedition against the empire, uses the standards of empire to trump the acts of empire: he asserts his Roman citizenship to humiliate local officials who have imprisoned and humiliated him. In Thessalonica, too, Paul's cohort is dragged into the street and accused: \"These who have turned the world (oikoumene) upside down have come here also, and Jason has received them; and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus\" (Acts 17:6-7). Yet Paul slips off safely even while under threat, though the threat involves Jewish violence toward Jewish followers of Christ, not Roman injustice or even judicial proceedings. When Paul and Silas are accused by Jews in Thessalonica, they slip away by night to Beroea, where high-status Greek women as well as men, along with Jews more noble than those in Thessalonica, accept their message (17:10-13).\n\nIn creating this heroic and unifying Paul, the writer of Acts seeks to distance the one true ekklesia and the one true Paul from contemporaneous Jews who might be seen as seditious toward the empire, especially after the events of 70 C.E. and in light of the upcoming Bar Kokhba revolts. 66 Luke crafts Paul in the image of contemporary elites who seamlessly combined Greek and Roman identities while appealing to both. As Lawrence Wills and Shelly Matthews have shown, the majority of Jews in Acts are portrayed as chaotic and moblike, while Roman justice is generally straightforward and fair. Paul is able to rehearse the narratives of ancient Judaism while remaining different from rabble-rousing contemporary Jews; he is embraced by Romans and by those of high status. In a similar way, Luke's Paul, unlike the Paul of Romans 16 and other Pauline texts, has no female traveling companions and meets no female co-apostles, troublesome authoritative women who might disturb the oikonomia of empire.\n\nLuke is one of the earliest sources to frame the question that is still contested in Pauline scholarship: Was Paul a rebel against Rome and thus a postcolonial hero? For Luke, the answer is no. Nothing comes of the accusations of sedition against Rome. Luke carefully constructs a Way that has no place for sedition, and charges of resistance and rebellion eventually melt away. Paul and his cohort never agree that such accusations are true, and the canonical Acts suggests that the Roman authorities actually like Paul. As we know, the end of Acts leaves the reader hanging and Paul involved in what seems to be a pleasant house arrest.\n\nActs must therefore have been written in response to a lively conversation-argument, really-about the relationship of emerging Christian communities to Jewish communities and to the Roman Empire. In response, Luke chose to foreground not the communities that housed and supported Paul, but Paul himself. In 1 Thessalonians, Paul's rhetorical focus on his own brave body and its travels does not fully mask the possibility of resistance to that focus. Acts, building on Paul's rhetorical self-construction, goes beyond Paul's own letters, further limiting what we know about early communities in Christ. Once we see how Acts narrows its focus primarily to Paul, we are in a better position to recognize and oppose the genealogy of interest in Paul's heroic identity.\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Conclusions\n\n\nEmpire-critical, postcolonial, and feminist work in Pauline studies has too often become stuck in individualistic debate-replicating the historiographical model of great men who stood alone to change history-over whether Paul was a liberator or an oppressor of women, slaves, and Gentiles. Scholars disagree over whether his letters attest a creative and radical subversion of imperial discourse and structures or whether they appropriate imperial language and logic and thus collaborate with empire. Decolonizing feminist scholarship can and should interrogate and disrupt this legacy through various strategies.\n\nOne such strategy is to recenter attention on Paul's letters as sites of vision and debate. Such work begins with privileging the ancient communities to which Paul wrote-groups that struggled with, alongside, and sometimes against him-while simultaneously tracing the diverse communities that have interpreted Paul throughout history. Such an approach can imagine and articulate both the ancient \"in Christ\" assemblies and contemporary sites of interpretation as contested spaces more readily than an approach that begins with Paul himself.\n\nAnother strategy is to turn away from the question of whether the ancient Paul was a hero or a villain and instead to imagine him and his interpreters as fully engaged in the messier political subjectivities of the diverse communities to which he wrote and those that have subsequently interpreted him. Taking seriously the differences, the rifts, and the discontinuities between our own identities and those of our contemporaries (as well as the overlaps and the possibilities for solidarity) can facilitate our reconstruction of similar differences in antiquity. Conversely, a disciplined intimacy with ancient texts and contexts provides an ethical and intellectual pattern that can facilitate a similar attentiveness to the politics, conditions, and textures of situations and persons in the present. Feminists often speak of the importance of reading texts in community or in the \"contact zone\" where an awareness of our differing perspectives can both challenge and expand our readings. Focusing on the diversity within and around the Pauline assemblies both then and now can provide a site for such engagement.\n\nA third strategy is to trace the effects of different reconstructions of Paul. A story of Paul the ancient hero (masked as an authoritative, historical account) can weave into community life Paul's justifications of his subordination of women or his apparent disregard for transforming the master-slave ideology of the ancient world. Similarly, a story of Paul the collaborator (masked as the only historically viable reading) can also silence the survival, movement, vision, vitality, and open dissent and debate that occurred in the Pauline ekklesiai, as well as the struggles that various men and women, ancient and modern-including Paul-have faced as unwelcome or imprisoned travelers.\n\nWhen we examine Paul's letters alongside his afterlife in the Acts of the Apostles (as well as other texts such as the Acts of Thecla), we enact a decolonizing feminist historiography that interrogates not only the Pauline correspondence and its earliest interpretation but also the legacy of the Pauline tradition as a \"base text\" for Western imperialism and diverse patriarchies. We do not seek to exonerate or free Paul's letters from Acts and its legacy of imperial collusion. Instead, we assume a history of resistance and rereading of Paul through time and in different contexts. Stories of resistant Georgia slaves and uneducated Chinese women are fully a part of this history and can be used to imagine a similar agency and voice for the members of Paul's audiences and for early Christians in the time of Acts. This sort of feminist and decolonizing historiography recognizes the complex and diverse strategies of resistance, adaptation, and transformation that characterize individual and corporate negotiations of subjectivity and survival in the context of empire. It also takes up the dual task of articulating an ethics of interpretation, 67 on the one hand, and working for liberating interdependence and justice, on the other, even if it is difficult to determine precisely what those might be in a given context.\n\nEngaging the Pauline letters as rhetorical instruments that construct both Paul and his audience in various ways might leave us less certain about what Paul the individual thought or accomplished. But it will give us more clarity about how a particular construction of Paul serves to authorize, valorize, or erase particular agendas and voices. More importantly, if we place the assemblies at the center and hear Paul's letters as one voice among many, we can imaginatively reconstruct and reclaim a richer history of interpretation of Paul, a history populated with subjects struggling in different ways within the varied contexts of empire.\n\n\nFOOT NOTES :\n\n\n1 Krister Stendahl, \"The Apostle Paul and the Introspective Conscience of the West,\" Harvard Theological Review 56 (1963): 199-215.\n\n2 Cited in Brian K.

Essays in Honor of Krister Stendahl ed. Richard A. Horsley (Harrisburg, Pa.: Trinity Press International, 2000).

Cosgrove, Herold Weiss, and Khiok-Khng Yeo, Crosscultural Paul: Journeys to Others, Journeys to Ourselves (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2005 ).\n\n7 Our review of a range of politically engaged Pauline scholarship suggests that Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza's original assessment of Paul-centered scholarly discourse remains true today: \"A full paradigm shift from an individualistic Euro-American malestream framework of interpretation to a fully political and communal paradigm of Pauline studies has not yet been accomplished. The reason for this, I suggest, is the hegemonic politics of interpretation. The rhetoric of Pauline interpreters continues not only to identify themselves with Paul but also to see Paul as identical with 'his' communities, postulating that Paul was the powerful creator and unquestioned leader of the communities of whom he writes\" (\"Paul and the Politics of Interpretation,\" 44). See also eadem, Rhetoric and Ethic: The Politics of Biblical Studies (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1999 ), 180-88; and Power of the Word, 83-89. In an early essay, Randall C. Bailey questioned this process of identification among AfricanAmericans (\"The Danger of ignoring One's Own Cultural Bias in Interpreting the Text,\" in The Bible andPostcolonialism, ed. R. S. Sugircharajah [Sheffield: Sheffield Academic, 1998], 79).\n\n8 By this we mean scholars who frame their work as informed by and somehow interested in contemporary politics, in contrast to those who have ethical-political concerns but do not foreground them. Insofar a's this scholarship articulates political and cultural valences of what has traditionally been read as (purely) religious discourse, it can make an important contribution to the already politically forthright feminist and postcolonial conversations. Richard Horsley and Neil Elliott have been influential in framing a trajectory of Pauline scholarship that articulates the political rather than religious context and meaning of Paul's letters (now called an \"empire-critical\" approach).\n\n9 See Robert C.

For an extended treatment of the politics of difference, see 228-60.\n\n17 Ibid., 9. In a similar way, much recent empire-critical scholarship on Paul's letters regards Roman and American imperialism as comparable contexts that both Paul and contemporary people must navigate. This view of interactivity between the past and the present is valuable and productive, but it also poses challenges both for writing history that takes seriously the otherness of the past and for interpreting the distinctiveness of the present situation.\n\n18 Boyarin,Radical Jew, 9.\n\n19 Elliott locates Boyarin within New Perspective scholarship that is still driven by a religious reading of Paul's categories and interests (\"Paul and the Politics of Empire: Problems and Prospects,\" in Horsley, Paul and Politics, 20, 33-34). In reality, however, Boyarin's Paul is political insofar as cultural-ethnic-religious-gendered discourses are also political. Equating \"political readings\" with readings that are attentive to the Roman empire seems a narrow and monolithic understanding of politics-see the response of Simon Price in Paul and the Roman Imperial Order, ed. Richard A. Horsley (Harrisburg, Pa.: Trinity Press International, 2004), 182-83. A primary and not insignificant difference between the two is that Boyarin's politics are informed by feminist and cultural criticism while Elliott's are shaped by Marxism.\n\n20 See the three volumes edited by Horsley: Paul and Politics; Paul and the Roman Imperial Order; and Paul and Empire: Religion and Power in Roman Imperial Society (Harrisburg, Pa.: Trinity Press International, 1997), especially the articles by Elliott, Robert Jewett, Horsley, N. T. Wright, Sze-kar Wan, Abraham Smith, Rollin A. Ramsaran, Efrain Agosto, Erik M. Heen, and Allen Dwight Callahan. Horsley has long been an important advocate for a (re)politicized reading of the New Testament that takes seriously the socioeconomic structures of the Judean temple-state and the Roman Empire. While Horsley rightly .criticizes the Lutheran-theological Paul as homo religiosus and the \"hero of justification by faith,\" Horsley's Paul frequently looks like homo politicus, the hero of anti-imperialism.\n\n21 For a critique of Paul-centered readings of Gal 3:28 (that is, reading it as Paul's theology and not that of the ekklesia), see Schussler Fiorenza, Rhetoric and Ethic, 165-69.\n\n22 Working from an exploration of Paul's ethnically based vision of human unity, Sze-kar Wan calls Paul's vision \"subtly anti-imperial.\" Although he does not explore the topic further, Wan does open a small space for subjects to speak back to this construction of Paul: \"Rather than eschew universal claims, a move postcolonial readers would have liked him to make, he unabashedly constructs a metanarrative based on his own ethnicity, an eschatological universalism\" (\"Collection for the Saints as Anticolonial Act: Implications of Paul's Ethnic Reconstruction,\" in Horsley, Paul and Politics, 209-10). It is this Jewish universalism that Boyarin critiques, thus opening a dialogue with Paul's politics rather than reclaiming them. However, Boyarin does not imagine that Paul's audience similarly engaged, resisted, or revised Paul's political vision.\n\n23 See Slavoj Zizek, The Fragile Absolute: Or, Why Is the Christian Legacy Worth Fighting For (London: Verso, 2000); Alain Badiou, Saint Paul: The Foundation of Universalism, trans. Ray Brassier, Cultural Memory in the Present (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2003); Giorgio Agamben, The Time that Remains: A Commentary on the Letter to the Romans, Meridian, Crossing Aesthetics (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2005).\n\n24 For example, for Zizek, Christianity becomes a religion of love that insists on conversion; Judaism becomes the sign of constant particularity, while Christianity stands for a passage into universality \"that achieves Redemption by coming to terms with its traumatic Origins, by ritualistically enacting the founding Crime and the Sacrifice that erases its traces, by bringing about reconciliation in the medium of the Word\" (Fragile Absolute, 99).\n\n25 Ibid., 120. See also Badiou, Saint Paul, 9, 14.\n\n26 These philosophers have done their work with little or no regard for Pauline scholarship. For a reading of Paul's political philosophy that presupposes the work of the New Perspective on Paul, see Theodore W. Jennings, Jr., Reading Derrida/Thinking Paul: On justice, Cultural Memory in the Present (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2006). There is much to recommend in this reading, but Jennings, too, focuses almost exclusively on Paul's thought, thus rendering Paul's political discourse timeless and without rhetorical context or dialogical contestation.\n\n27 Allen Dwight Callahan suggests that 1 Corinthians represents Paul's directions \"in emancipatory theory and practice,\" a \"project inherently political because manumission, morality, and mutualismare by definition communal practices, collective concerned action\" (\"Paul, Ekklesia, and Emancipation in Corinth: A Coda on Liberation Theology; in Horsley, Paul and Politics, 223). Like Yung Suk Kim (Christ's Body in Corinth), Callahan roots Paul's politics in his identification with those who suffer at the bottom of Roman imperial structures. For both, Paul leads the way in theorizing beyond liberation theology toward a truly emancipatory politics. See also the work of Davina Lopez discussed below.\n\n28 Abraham Smith counters popular North American apocalypticism with an anti-imperial reading of 1 and 2 Thessalonians. He disrupts dichotomous and monolithic constructions of Paul by noting that Brazilian apocalypticism differs from North American versions and by discussing the way in which Paul's sexual othering in 1 Thess 4:3 reinscribes imperial ideologies (\"The First and Second Letters to the Thessalonians; in A Postcolonial Commentary on the New Testament Writings, ed. Fernando F. Segovia and R. S. Sugirtharajah, Bible and Postcolonialism 13 [London and New York: T & T Clark, 2007], 308, 315-16).\n\n29 Boyarin, Radical Jew, 3.\n\n30 See the articles by Schussler Fiorenza, Wire, Kittredge, and Briggs in Horsley, Paul and Politics, and the article by Jennifer Wright Knust in Horsley, Paul and the Roman Imperial Order (\"Paul and the Politics of Virtue and Vice\"). See also Marchal, Politics of Heaven, ch. 1. As Kittredge notes, \"Those who seek to interpret Paul in an imperial context have thus far restricted themselves to emphasizing Paul's radical stance and underplaying the ways in which Paul's language replicates and reinscribes imperial power relations. In doing so, they continue to operate within the traditional paradigm in which Paul's position, now 'correctly' interpreted within his imperial context, is the only important one and other voices must be subordinated to his. The strength of this paradigm testifies to the effectiveness of Paul's rhetoric as it has been amplified throughout the history of interpretation\" (\"Corinthian Women Prophets,\" 108-9).\n\n31 While he does not discuss sexual othering in his article in Horsley, Paul and the Roman Imperial Order, Abraham Smith does incorporate the work of Knust into his postcolonial commentary article on 1 and 2 Thessalonians.\n\n32 Elliott is explicit about this interest: \"No legitimate reading of Romans in our contemporary situation can remain oblivious to the effects of empire today\" (The Arrogance of Nations: Reading Romans in the Shadow of Empire, Paul in Critical Contexts [Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2008], 9). See also Brad R. Braxton, \"Paul and Racial Reconciliation: A Postcolonial Approach to 2 Corinthians 3: 12-18,\" in Scripture and Traditions: Essays on Early Judaism and Christianity in Honor of Carl R. Holladay, ed. Patrick Gray and Gail R. O'Day, Supplements to Novum Testamentum 129 (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 413.\n\n33 Elliott, Arrogance of Nations, 8.\n\n34 Ibid.,3.\n\n35 Although Elliott notes his interest in letting \"first-century Judeans, Paul above all, speak for themselves\" (Arrogance of Nations, 16), it is clear throughout his book that he also identifies with Paul's anti-imperial critique and gives it voice precisely to engage the contemporary U.S. context (p. 9).\n\n36 See Peter Oakes (Reading Romans in Pompeii: Paul's Letter at Ground Level [Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2009]), who brings together archaeological remains from Pompeii's insulae with Paul's letter to the Romans to imagine how four \"Christians,\" all of low status but at various levels, might have interpreted the letter. Oakes largely upholds Paul's authority throughout his analysis; while the responses vary, none of the persons whom Oakes invenrs in his project of historical reconstruction questions Paul's letter, even the slave woman who struggles with her ongoing requirement of sexual slavery, which is in tension with Paul's injunctions regarding purity (see especially p. 143).\n\n37 A sustained consideration of the diverse perspectives of Haitian women and Latin American theologians would also take our eyes off the problem of whether we are the ones prophetically challenging Paul or the status-obsessed Gentiles. In Arrogance of Nations, all of the Judeans in Rome are \"weak\" and all the Gentiles are status-conscious (p. 158). As with Marxist analysis, these kinds of dichotomies can romanticize the oppressed and leave the category of the oppressor equally undifferentiated.\n\n38 Davina C. Lopez, Apostle to the Conquered: Reimagining Paul's Mission, Paul in Critical Contexts (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2008), xi, xiii.\n\n39 Ibid., xii.\n\n40 Ibid., 3. Wire notes that Paul's vision of liberation for Gentiles (including women and slaves) is more apparent in Galatians than in 1 Corinthians, suggesting that Paul's politics, like his theology, should be seen as contextual, rhetorical, and intersubjective (\"Response: Paul and Those Outside Power: 226).\n\n41 For example, Lopez argues that Paul recognized his top-down hegemonic stance as he sought to ravage or destroy the ekklesia and that he was transformed after his travels to Arabia. During that time, he became vulnerable and even pursued a \"life of penetrated, defeated masculinity\" (Apostle to the Conquered, 138). Certainly in Galatians and elsewhere Paul presents his body as homologous to Christ's abused body. But is it possible, as some feminist scholars have argued, that Paul's assertion of his homology between his body and Christ's might be an authorizing move and thus another assertion of power, even if cast in a key different from that of the imperial masculinity depicted in statuary such as the Prima Porta Augustus? If we decenter Paul and assume that his subjectivity is embedded in his multiple relationships, should we not ask about the variety of modes of employing gender and one's own gender mutability for the purposes of persuasion? Paul's assertion of maternal status in relation to the Galatians would then need to be placed alongside his image of himself as a nurse in 1 Thessalonians and his self-depiction as a father with a punishing rod in 1 Corinthians.\n\n42 He, too, locates his writing in the context of the American empire, but he is less explicit than Lopez about producing a view of Paul that is useful in public debates and more concerned with crafting an analysis that will further nuance politically-attuned Pauline scholarship. See Marchal, Politics of Heaven, vii-viii.\n\n43 Ibid., 44.\n\n44 Ibid., 111.\n\n45 Ibid., 11.\n\n46 Although Kim (Christ's Body in Corinth) claims to agree with Wire that the women in Corinth are claiming voice and agency in the ekklesia, his reconstruction of Paul's opponents in Corinth as imperially minded elites with oppressive views renders the women's voices silent in 1 Corinthians, which is figured primarily as a dialogue between Paul (as he identifies with the oppressed) and his oppressive and triumphalist opponents.\n\n47 Marchal applies this question to Paul alone, concluding that he positions \"himself as a provincial governor or colonial administrator for the divine imperator\" (Politics of Heaven, 51 ). However, if we consider the social and economic status of both Paul and the communities to which he writes, might Paul's travels look more like the circumambulations of a migrant worker than the visits of a Roman imperial governor? Might they look that way to some contemporary communities, too?\n\n48 For the notion of tracing the effective history of Paul's rhetoric, see Smith, \"First and Second Letters to the Thessalonians,\" 307-9.\n\n49 MacArthur is the pastor of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, Idaho. He has a regular radio program (Grace to You), appeared frequently on Larry King Live, and in 2006 was named one of the twenty-five most influential preachers in America by Christianity Today (see http://www.christianitytoday.com/anniversary/features/top25preachers.html ).\n\n50 This self-conscious caveat both recognizes the history of violence in Christian missions and dismisses it as avoidable through benevolent moderation.\n\n51 John MacArthur, \"The Qualities of a Great Missionary-Part 1; http://www.biblebb.com/files/mac/sgl747.htm (accessed May 29, 2010).\n\n52 To our knowledge, not much work has been done to trace the place of Pauline literature in the history of European missionary expansion in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (though see the article by Robert Seesengood in the present volume). For some brief references, see R. S. Sugirtharajah, \"A Postcolonial Exploration of Collusion and Construction in Biblical Interpretation,\" in The Postcolonial Bible, ed. R. S. Sugirtharajah, Bible and Postcolonialism 1 (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic, 1998). 91-117, especially 96-98.\n\n53 Smith begins to get beyond this problem with his treatment of the Pauline assemblies as alternative communities of resistance. These are not, however, sites of struggle and debate around the challenges of empire so much as the result of Paul's work in the Greek cities (\"The First and Second Letters to the Thessalonians,\" 311-13).\n\n54 For an extended example of interrogating Paul's rhetorical construct of a community, see Antoinette Clark Wire, The Corinthian Women Prophets: A Reconstruction through Paul's Rhetoric (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1990).\n\n55 See Colin Adams and Ray Laurence, ed., Travel and Geography in the Roman Empire (London and New York: Routledge, 2005).

Stephen D. Moore and Mayra Rivera, Transdisciplinary Theological Colloquia (New York: Fordham University Press, 2011).\n\n57 See John S. Kloppenborg and Stephen G. Wilson, eds., Voluntary Associations in the GraecoRoman World (London and New York: Routledge, 1996); and Richard S. Ascough, Paul's Macedonian Associations: The Social Context of Philippians and 1 Thessalonians, Wissenschaftliche Untersuchungen zum Neuen Testament 2/161 (T\u00fcbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2003).\n\n58 For a discussion of the Thessalonian ekklesia as a voluntary association and the economic and gendered imagery in 1 Thessalonians, see Melanie Johnson-DeBaufre, \"'Gazing Upon the Invisible': Archaeology, Historiography, and the Elusive Women of 1 Thessalonians,\" in From Roman to Early Christian Thessalonike: Studies in Religion and Archaeology, ed. Laura Nasrallah, Charalambos Bakirtzis, and Steven J. Friesen, Harvard Theological Studies 64 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2010).\n\n59 In his sermon on 1 Thess 2:l-6 (\"Leading the Charge: Fail-Proof Spiritual Leadership\"), MacArthur replicates Paul's politics of othering and thus constructs his own audience as standing in need of the preacher's (and Paul's) guidance: \"Somehow and in some way not known to us, the church in Thessalonica was being told lies about Paul. Someone was attacking his integrity and someone or some group was attacking his sincerity. They were doing evetything they could to be hostile toward the church and one way to tear up the church was to destroy its confidence in the one that God used to found it, namely Paul. This group may have included the Jews who were so utterly hostile to the gospel, it may also have included pagan Gentiles who would be hostile to it as well.\" The audience is thus identified with a community that faces hostile religious Others bent on disrupting the proper relations between the assembly and its leader and founder.\n\n60 Marchal (Politics of Heaven, 119) warns that a reconstruction of a political Paul who opposes the Roman imperial cult can become an anti-pagan missionary Paul who is thus available to support the missionary ambitions of European empires against Africa and the Americas.\n\n61 See Lopez, Apostle to the Conquered. Dube's first question asks about \"distant and inhabited lands,\" while her third question asks, \"How does this text construct difference: does it promote dialogue and liberating interdependence or condemnation of all that is foreign?\" In the case of 1 Thessalonians, Paul, Timothy, and Silvanus travel to inhabited cities, but the cities are not figured as distant nor foreign. The construction of difference is cast not geographically or in terms of foreignness but in terms of allegiances-the Thessalonians are to be different from Gentiles who are \"not of God\" (4:5). In this, they are like Jews who are \"in Christ.\" Gentiles who are \"not of God\" are painted with the usual sexual slanders ( 4:5). In the same way, the outsider Jews in faraway Judea are murderous and have killed the Lord and abused Paul (both insider Jews).\n\n62 See Elliott, Arrogance of Nations.

What are you talking about?)\nWhen it comes to girls I'm like GSP\nI dominate from the top cause they're out of breath and they're gasping\nWith girls you're like Dan Hardy cause you'll never end up tapping\nSee I'm skinny and smart, love pictures of art and I'm sick at guitar\nI realize people pick me apart cause they don't think that I'm hard\nBut Knamelis told me in high school you were picked on and scarred\nYou were gifted and smart with riveting marks\nAnd ate lunch in the library with the kids that were really bizarre\nSo I realize I'm a nerd and I just live with the card\nSo you're battling the person you're afraid to admit that you are\n\n[Round 3: Arcane]\nI said yo, son\nIf all you gon' be spitting, is rehearsed writtens\nI hope he brought more than that last weak verse with him\nI swear to God you can bring a team of researchers with him\nThis dude can't even fucking find a t-shirt that fits him\nYo, and you can keep calling me a wigger\nBut you saying you taking his cash, its like you saying you clapping triggers\nSon, you ain't stacking figures, you still playing with action figures\nQuit bringing the same lame ass crackers with ya\nCause all of y'all seem like a bunch of rejects from ya high school volleyball team\nBut yo listen\nI know I'm that dude that everybody loves to hate\nYeah, I choked and still won, gave y'all something to debate\nThen I came back to clean up ya big brother Jake\nSo after this, you can tell Pesci I'm coming for the cake\nYou ain't hip hop ya fake, now you done pissed off at Drake\nAntawn Jamison, I might just Chris Bosh ya face\nSee, cause everything I touch is ether\nI should put you in a fucking freezer\nYou be almost like just like Justin Bieber but you never touched a beaver\nYo, and you ain't never hustled neither\nSo I don't know what this little guy about\nBut this some grown man business\nI'ma have to put this little kid on timeout\n\n[Round 3: Charron]\nYo, I came to spit flames, I'm here to bust the ether\nYou compare me to Justin Bieber?\nBut you have so many ugly features\nIt looks like as a kid you were beat more than Russell Peters\nYo, and you talk like, \"Yo, I'm Chris Bosh\" basketball when you're making a rhyme\nWell I fucked your girl she's the craziest dime\nI left her legs more spread open than Lebron James when he's taking a stride\nListen, and you said I stayed at Knamelis's house the last battle you rapped in\nWell the night before I stayed at your house I'll tell the people what actually happened\nI showed up to his house in a red shirt, he was puzzled and confused\nLike, \"Corey, this is Hamilton! You can't wear that the Crips are coming over soon.\"\nI watched you post up at Zellers from 12:00 to 6:00\nWith your arms crossed like that and foot on the wall like this\nAt your house I met your twin brother Mike\nI said, \"Wow, you guys are identical, you look exactly alike.\"\nHe said, \"Man, what the fuck do you mean we look exactly alike?\"\n[?] wrapping salad for supper and rolled out the futon\nAs soon as you took a bite of it you choked on the croutons\nI said, \"Can I get you something to drink? Perhaps a cup of juice?\"\nHe said, \"Man, what the fuck is juice? I want some grape drink baby. Hmmm. Spurt and stuff.\"\nIt was bedtime and he said, \"Boy, you ain't dressed like a rapper.\"\nHe brought me some 2Pac underwear and Exco pajamas\nThere was no blankets I was cold up on Arcane's sofa\nHe said, \"Don't use the sheets on my windows. Here's one of my Scarface posters.\"\nI looked at your Get Rich Or Die Trying wallpaper as I laid on your couch\nAnd said, \"Fuck. This. Shit. I'm going to Knamelis' house.\"\nJust look at you, Jesus fucking Christ\nYou're 32 and wearing Exco...you suck at lifeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/4704884", "artist_names": "Matt McAndrew", "full_title": "The Blower's Daughter by\u00a0Matt\u00a0McAndrew", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c087b6a813b1e1f2f5c4fc48f037825e.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c087b6a813b1e1f2f5c4fc48f037825e.959x959x1.jpg", "id": 4704884, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 3272884, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1563305060, "path": "/Matt-mcandrew-the-blowers-daughter-lyrics", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Matt-mcandrew-the-blowers-daughter-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/c087b6a813b1e1f2f5c4fc48f037825e.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c087b6a813b1e1f2f5c4fc48f037825e.959x959x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "The Blower\u2019s Daughter", "title_with_featured": "The Blower's Daughter", "updated_by_human_at": 1563305060, "url": "https://genius.com/Matt-mcandrew-the-blowers-daughter-lyrics", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/288826", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c087b6a813b1e1f2f5c4fc48f037825e.959x959x1.jpg", "id": 288826, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c087b6a813b1e1f2f5c4fc48f037825e.959x959x1.jpg", "index_character": "m", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Matt McAndrew", "slug": "Matt-mcandrew", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Matt-mcandrew"}, "artist": "Matt McAndrew", "lyrics": "The Blower\u2019s Daughter LyricsAnd so it is\nJust like you said it would be\nLife goes easy on me\nMost of the time\n\nAnd so it is\nThe shorter story\nNo love, no glory\nNo hero in her sky\n\nI can't take my eyes off you\nI can't take my eyes off you\nI can't take my eyes off you\nI can't take my eyes\nAnd so it is\nThe colder water\nThe blower's daughter\nThe pupil in denial\n\nI can't take my eyes off you\nI can't take my eyes off you\nI can't take my eyes off you\nI can't take my eyes\n\nDid I say that I loathe you?\nDid I say that I want to\nLeave it all behind?\n\nI can't take my mind off you\nI can't take my mind off you\nI can't take my mind off you\nI can't take my mindYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/7204575", "artist_names": "Christian Genius", "full_title": "July 2022 Singles Release Calendar by\u00a0Christian\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5ea087093a6cd298fe56ed7fbb99b0f4.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5ea087093a6cd298fe56ed7fbb99b0f4.866x866x1.png", "id": 7204575, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 2430266, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1660222183, "path": "/Christian-genius-july-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Christian-genius-july-2022-singles-release-calendar-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2022, "month": 7, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "July 2022", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Jul. 2022", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/5ea087093a6cd298fe56ed7fbb99b0f4.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/5ea087093a6cd298fe56ed7fbb99b0f4.866x866x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "July 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "title_with_featured": "July 2022 Singles Release Calendar", "updated_by_human_at": 1660222183, "url": "https://genius.com/Christian-genius-july-2022-singles-release-calendar-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/528115", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/c57db1ca677a272a4dfdadd7b701ce29.262x262x1.jpg", "id": 528115, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0fae0945bbc7dd4920ee70a9419c10ef.262x262x1.png", "index_character": "c", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": true, "name": "Christian Genius", "slug": "Christian-genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Christian-genius", "iq": 20392}, "artist": "Christian Genius", "lyrics": "July 2022 Singles Release Calendar Lyrics7/1Alexander Pappas -

their Government, you have assembled at a time when the strength and excellence of our free institutions and the fitness of our citizens to enjoy popular rule have been again made manifest. A political contest involving momentous consequences, fraught with feverish apprehension, and creating aggressiveness so intense as to approach bitterness and passion has been waged throughout our land and determined by the decree of free and independent suffrage without disturbance of our tranquillity or the least sign of weakness in our national structure.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0When we consider these incidents and contemplate the peaceful obedience and manly submission which have succeeded a heated clash of political opinions, we discover abundant evidence of a determination on the part of our countrymen to abide by every verdict of the popular will and to be controlled at all times by an abiding faith in the agencies established for the direction of the affairs of their Government.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Thus our people exhibit a patriotic disposition which entitles them to demand of those who undertake to make and execute their laws such faithful and unselfish service in their behalf as can only be prompted by a serious appreciation of the trust and confidence which the acceptance of public duty invites.\n\u00a0 \u00a0In obedience to a constitutional requirement I herein submit to the Congress certain information concerning national affairs, with the suggestion of such legislation as in my judgment is necessary and expedient. To secure brevity and avoid tiresome narration I shall omit many details concerning matters within Federal control which, though by no means unimportant, are more profitably discussed in departmental reports. I shall also further curtail this communication by omitting a minute recital of many minor incidents connected with our foreign relations which have heretofore found a place in Executive messages, but are now contained in a report of the Secretary of State, which is herewith submitted.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0At the outset of a reference to the more important matters affecting our relations with foreign powers it would afford me satisfaction if I could assure the Congress that the disturbed condition in Asiatic Turkey had during the past year assumed a less hideous and bloody aspect and that, either as a consequence of the awakening of the Turkish Government to the demands of humane civilization or as the result of decisive action on the part of the great nations having the right by treaty to interfere for the protection of those exposed to the rage of mad bigotry and cruel fanaticism, the shocking features of the situation had been mitigated. Instead, however, of welcoming a softened disposition or protective intervention, we have been afflicted by continued and not unfrequent reports of the wanton destruction of homes and the bloody butchery of men, women, and children, made martyrs to their profession of Christian faith.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0While none of our citizens in Turkey have thus far been killed or wounded, though often in the midst of dreadful scenes of danger, their safety in the future is by no means assured. Our Government at home and our minister at Constantinople have left nothing undone to protect our missionaries in Ottoman territory, who constitute nearly all the individuals residing there who have a right to claim our protection on the score of American citizenship. Our efforts in this direction will not be relaxed; but the deep feeling and sympathy that have been aroused among our people ought not to so far blind their reason and judgment as to lead them to demand impossible things. The outbreaks of the blind fury which lead to murder and pillage in Turkey occur suddenly and without notice, and an attempt on our part to force such a hostile presence there as might be effective for prevention or protection would not only be resisted by the Ottoman Government, but would be regarded as an interruption of their plans by the great nations who assert their exclusive right to intervene in their own time and method for the security of life and property in Turkey.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Several naval vessels are stationed in the Mediterranean as a measure of caution and to furnish all possible relief and refuge in case of emergency.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0We have made claims against the Turkish Government for the pillage and destruction of missionary property at Harpoot and Marash during uprisings at those places. Thus far the validity of these demands has not been admitted, though our minister, prior to such outrages and in anticipation of danger, demanded protection for the persons and property of our missionary citizens in the localities mentioned and notwithstanding that strong evidence exists of actual complicity of Turkish soldiers in the work of destruction and robbery.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The facts as they now appear do not permit us to doubt the justice of these claims, and nothing will be omitted to bring about their prompt settlement.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0A number of Armenian refugees having arrived at our ports, an order has lately been obtained from the Turkish Government permitting the wives and children of such refugees to join them here. It is hoped that hereafter no obstacle will be interposed to prevent the escape of all those who seek to avoid the perils which threaten them in Turkish dominions.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Our recently appointed consul to Erzerum is at his post and discharging the duties of his office, though for some unaccountable reason his formal exequatur from the Sultan has not been issued.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I do not believe that the present somber prospect in Turkey will be long permitted to offend the sight of Christendom. It so mars the humane and enlightened civilization that belongs to the close of the nineteenth century that it seems hardly possible that the earnest demand of good people throughout the Christian world for its corrective treatment will remain unanswered.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The insurrection in Cuba still continues with all its perplexities. It is difficult to perceive that any progress has thus far been made toward the pacification of the island or that the situation of affairs as depicted in my last annual message has in the least improved. If Spain still holds Havana and the seaports and all the considerable towns, the insurgents still roam at will over at least two-thirds of the inland country. If the determination of Spain to put down the insurrection seems but to strengthen with the lapse of time and is evinced by her unhesitating devotion of largely increased military and naval forces to the task, there is much reason to believe that the insurgents have gained in point of numbers and character and resources and are none the less inflexible in their resolve not to succumb without practically securing the great objects for which they took up arms. If Spain has not yet reestablished her authority, neither have the insurgents yet made good their title to be regarded as an independent state. Indeed, as the contest has gone on the pretense that civil government exists on the island, except so far as Spain is able to maintain it, has been practically abandoned. Spain does keep on foot such a government, more or less imperfectly, in the large towns and their immediate suburbs; but that exception being made, the entire country is either given over to anarchy or is subject to the military occupation of one or the other party. It is reported, indeed, on reliable authority that at the demand of the commander in chief of the insurgent army the putative Cuban government has now given up all attempt to exercise its functions, leaving that government confessedly (what there is the best reason for supposing it always to have been in fact) a government merely on paper.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Were the Spanish armies able to meet their antagonists in the open or in pitched battle, prompt and decisive results might be looked for, and the immense superiority of the Spanish forces in numbers, discipline, and equipment could hardly fail to tell greatly to their advantage. But they are called upon to face a foe that shuns general engagements, that can choose and does choose its own ground, that from the nature of the country is visible or invisible at pleasure, and that fights only from ambuscade and when all the advantages of position and numbers are on its side. In a country where all that is indispensable to life in the way of food, clothing, and shelter is so easily obtainable, especially by those born and bred on the soil, it is obvious that there is hardly a limit to the time during which hostilities of this sort may be prolonged. Meanwhile, as in all cases of protracted civil strife, the passions of the combatants grow more and more inflamed and excesses on both sides become more frequent and more deplorable. They are also participated in by bands of marauders, who, now in the name of one party and now in the name of the other, as may best suit the occasion, harry the country at will and plunder its wretched inhabitants for their own advantage. Such a condition of things would inevitably entail immense destruction of property, even if it were the policy of both parties to prevent it as far as practicable; but while such seemed to be the original policy of the Spanish Government, it has now apparently abandoned it and is acting upon the same theory as the insurgents, namely, that the exigencies of the contest require the wholesale annihilation of property that it may not prove of use and advantage to the enemy.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It is to the same end that, in pursuance of general orders, Spanish garrisons are now being withdrawn from plantations and the rural population required to concentrate itself in the towns. The sure result would seem to be that the industrial value of the island is fast diminishing and that unless there is a speedy and radical change in existing conditions it will soon disappear altogether. That value consists very largely, of course, in its capacity to produce sugar--a capacity already much reduced by the interruptions to tillage which have taken place during the last two years. It is reliably asserted that should these interruptions continue during the current year, and practically extend, as is now threatened, to the entire sugar-producing territory of the island, so much time and so much money will be required to restore the land to its normal productiveness that it is extremely doubtful if capital can be induced to even make the attempt.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The spectacle of the utter ruin of an adjoining country, by nature one of the most fertile and charming on the globe, would engage the serious attention of the Government and people of the United States in any circumstances. In point of fact, they have a concern with it which is by no means of a wholly sentimental or philanthropic character. It lies so near to us as to be hardly separated from our territory. Our actual pecuniary interest in it is second only to that of the people and Government of Spain. It is reasonably estimated that at least from $30,000,000 to $50,000,000 of American capital are invested in plantations and in railroad, mining, and other business enterprises on the island. The volume of trade between the United States and Cuba, which in 1889 amounted to about $64,000,000, rose in 1893 to about $103,000,000, and in 1894, the year before the present insurrection broke out, amounted to nearly $96,000,000. Besides this large pecuniary stake in the fortunes of Cuba, the United States finds itself inextricably involved in the present contest in other ways, both vexatious and costly.\n\u00a0 \u00a0Many Cubans reside in this country, and indirectly promote the insurrection through the press, by public meetings, by the purchase and shipment of arms, by the raising of funds, and by other means which the spirit of our institutions and the tenor of our laws do not permit to be made the subject of criminal prosecutions. Some of them, though Cubans at heart and in all their feelings and interests, have taken out papers as naturalized citizens of the United States--a proceeding resorted to with a view to possible protection by this Government, and not unnaturally regarded with much indignation by the country of their origin. The insurgents are undoubtedly encouraged and supported by the widespread sympathy the people of this country always and instinctively feel for every struggle for better and freer government, and which, in the case of the more adventurous and restless elements of our population, leads in only too many instances to active and personal participation in the contest. The result is that this Government is constantly called upon to protect American citizens, to claim damages for injuries to persons and property, now estimated at many millions of dollars, and to ask explanations and apologies for the acts of Spanish officials whose zeal for the repression of rebellion sometimes blinds them to the immunities belonging to the unoffending citizens of a friendly power. It follows from the same causes that the United States is compelled to actively police a long line of seacoast against unlawful expeditions, the escape of which the utmost vigilance will not always suffice to prevent.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0These inevitable entanglements of the United States with the rebellion in Cuba, the large American property interests affected, and considerations of philanthropy and humanity in general have led to a vehement demand in various quarters for some sort of positive intervention on the part of the United States. It was at first proposed that belligerent rights should be accorded to the insurgents--a proposition no longer urged because untimely and in practical operation dearly perilous and injurious to our own interests. It has since been and is now sometimes contended that the independence of the insurgents should be recognized; but imperfect and restricted as the Spanish government of the island may be, no other exists there, unless the will of the military officer in temporary command of a particular district can be dignified as a species of government. It is now also suggested that the United States should buy the island--a suggestion possibly worthy of consideration if there were any evidence of a desire or willingness on the part of Spain to entertain such a proposal. It is urged finally that, all other methods failing, the existing internecine strife in Cuba should be terminated by our intervention, even at the cost of a war between the United States and Spain--a war which its advocates confidently prophesy could neither be large in its proportions nor doubtful in its issue.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The correctness of this forecast need be neither affirmed nor denied. The United States has, nevertheless, a character to maintain as a nation, which plainly dictates that right and not might should be the rule of its conduct. Further, though the United States is not a nation to which peace is a necessity, it is in truth the most pacific of powers and desires nothing so much as to live in amity with all the world. Its own ample and diversified domains satisfy all possible longings for territory, preclude all dreams of conquest, and prevent any casting of covetous eyes upon neighboring regions, however attractive. That our conduct toward Spain and her dominions has constituted no exception to this national disposition is made manifest by the course of our Government, not only thus far during the present insurrection, but during the ten years that followed the rising at Yara in 1868. No other great power, it may safely be said, under circumstances of similar perplexity, would have manifested the same restraint and the same patient endurance. It may also be said that this persistent attitude of the United States toward Spain in connection with Cuba unquestionably evinces no slight respect and regard for Spain on the part of the American people. They in truth do not forget her connection with the discovery of the Western Hemisphere, nor do they underestimate the great qualities of the Spanish people nor fail to fully recognize their splendid patriotism and their chivalrous devotion to the national honor.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0They view with wonder and admiration the cheerful resolution with which vast bodies of men are sent across thousands of miles of ocean and an enormous debt accumulated that the costly possession of the gem of the Antilles may still hold its place in the Spanish crown. And yet neither the Government nor the people of the United States have shut their eyes to the course of events in Cuba or have failed to realize the existence of conceded grievances which have led to the present revolt from the authority of Spain--grievances recognized by the Queen Regent and by the Cortes, voiced by the most patriotic and enlightened of Spanish statesmen, without regard to party, and demonstrated by reforms proposed by the executive and approved by the legislative branch of the Spanish Government. It is in the assumed temper and disposition of the Spanish Government to remedy these grievances, fortified by indications of influential public opinion in Spain, that this Government has hoped to discover the most promising and effective means of composing the present strife with honor and advantage to Spain and with the achievement of all the reasonable objects of the insurrection.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It would seem that if Spain should offer to Cuba genuine autonomy--a measure of home rule which, while preserving the sovereignty of Spain, would satisfy all rational requirements of her Spanish subjects--there should be no just reason why the pacification of the island might not be effected on that basis. Such a result would appear to be in the true interest of all concerned. It would at once stop the conflict which is now consuming the resources of the island and making it worthless for whichever party may ultimately prevail. It would keep intact the possessions of Spain without touching her honor, which will be consulted rather than impugned by the adequate redress of admitted grievances. It would put the prosperity of the island and the fortunes of its inhabitants within their own control without severing the natural and ancient ties which bind them to the mother country, and would yet enable them to test their capacity for self-government under the most favorable conditions. It has been objected on the one side that Spain should not promise autonomy until her insurgent subjects lay down their arms; on the other side, that promised autonomy, however liberal, is insufficient, because without assurance of the promise being fulfilled.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0But the reasonableness of a requirement by Spain of unconditional surrender on the part of the insurgent Cubans before their autonomy is conceded is not altogether apparent. It ignores important features of the situation--the stability two years' duration has given to the insurrection; the feasibility of its indefinite prolongation in the nature of things, and, as shown by past experience, the utter and imminent ruin of the island unless the present strife is speedily composed; above all, the rank abuses which all parties in Spain, all branches of her Government, and all her leading public men concede to exist and profess a desire to remove. Facing such circumstances, to withhold the proffer of needed reforms until the parties demanding them put themselves at mercy by throwing down their arms has the appearance of neglecting the gravest of perils and inviting suspicion as to the sincerity of any professed willingness to grant reforms. The objection on behalf of the insurgents that promised reforms can not be relied upon must of course be considered, though we have no right to assume and no reason for assuming that anything Spain undertakes to do for the relief of Cuba will not be done according to both the spirit and the letter of the undertaking.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Nevertheless, realizing that suspicions and precautions on the part of the weaker of two combatants are always natural and not always unjustifiable, being sincerely desirous in the interest of both as well as on its own account that the Cuban problem should be solved with the least possible delay, it was intimated by this Government to the Government of Spain some months ago that if a satisfactory measure of home rule were tendered the Cuban insurgents and would be accepted by them upon a guaranty of its execution the United States would endeavor to find a way not objectionable to Spain of furnishing such graranty. While no definite response to this intimation has yet been received from the Spanish Government, it is believed to be not altogether unwelcome, while, as already suggested, no reason is perceived why it should not be approved by the insurgents. Neither party can fail to see the importance of early action, and both must realize that to prolong the present state of things for even a short period will add enormously to the time and labor and expenditure necessary to bring about the industrial recuperation of the island. It is therefore fervently hoped on all grounds that earnest efforts for healing the breach between Spain and the insurgent Cubans upon the lines above indicated may be at once inaugurated and pushed to an immediate and successful issue. The friendly offices of the United States, either in the manner above outlined or in any other way consistent with our Constitution and laws, will always be at the disposal of either party.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Whatever circumstances may arise, our policy and our interests would constrain us to object to the acquisition of the island or an interference with its control by any other power.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It should be added that it can not be reasonably assumed that the hitherto expectant attitude of the United States will be indefinitely maintained. While we are anxious to accord all due respect to the sovereignty of Spain, we can not view the pending conflict in all its features and properly apprehend our inevitably close relations to it and its possible results without considering that by the course of events we may be drawn into such an unusual and unprecedented condition as will fix a limit to our patient waiting for Spain to end the contest, either alone and in her own way or with our friendly cooperation.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0When the inability of Spain to deal successfully with the insurrection has become manifest and it is demonstrated that her sovereignty is extinct in Cuba for all purposes of its rightful existence, and when a hopeless struggle for its reestablishment has degenerated into a strife which means nothing more than the useless sacrifice of human life and the utter destruction of the very subject-matter of the conflict, a situation will be presented in which our obligations to the sovereignty of Spain will be superseded by higher obligations, which we can hardly hesitate to recognize and discharge. Deferring the choice of ways and methods until the time for action arrives, we should make them depend upon the precise conditions then existing; and they should not be determined upon without giving careful heed to every consideration involving our honor and interest or the international duty we owe to Spain. Until we face the contingencies suggested or the situation is by other incidents imperatively changed we should continue in the line of conduct heretofore pursued, thus in all circumstances exhibiting our obedience to the requirements of public law and our regard for the duty enjoined upon us by the position we occupy in the family of nations.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0A contemplation of emergencies that may arise should plainly lead us to avoid their creation, either through a careless disregard of present duty or even an undue stimulation and ill-timed expression of feeling. But I have deemed it not amiss to remind the Congress that a time may arrive when a correct policy and care for our interests, as well as a regard for the interests of other nations and their citizens, joined by considerations of humanity and a desire to see a rich and fertile country intimately related to us saved from complete devastation, will constrain our Government to such action as will subserve the interests thus involved and at the same time promise to Cuba and its inhabitants an opportunity to enjoy the blessings of peace.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Venezuelan boundary question has ceased to be a matter of difference between Great Britain and the United States, their respective Governments having agreed upon the substantial provisions of a treaty between Great Britain and Venezuela submitting the whole controversy to arbitration. The provisions of the treaty are so eminently just and fair that the assent of Venezuela thereto may confidently be anticipated.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Negotiations for a treaty of general arbitration for all differences between Great Britain and the United States are far advanced and promise to reach a successful consummation at an early date.\n\u00a0 \u00a0The scheme of examining applicants for certain consular positions to test their competency and fitness, adopted under an Executive order issued on the 20th of September, 1895, has fully demonstrated the usefulness of this innovation. In connection with this plan of examination promotions and transfers of deserving incumbents have been quite extensively made, with excellent results.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0During the past year 35 appointments have been made in the consular service, 27 of which were made to fill vacancies caused by death or resignation or to supply newly created posts, 2 to succeed incumbents removed for cause, 2 for the purpose of displacing alien consular officials by American citizens, and 4 merely changing the official title of incumbent from commercial agent to consul. Twelve of these appointments were transfers or promotions from other positions under the Department of State, 4 of those appointed had rendered previous service under the Department, 8 were made of persons who passed a satisfactory examination, 7 were appointed to places not included in the order of September 20, 1895, and 4 appointments, as above stated, involved no change of incumbency. The inspection of consular offices provided for by an appropriation for that purpose at the last session of the Congress has been productive of such wholesome effects that I hope this important work will in the future be continued. I know of nothing that can be done with the same slight expense so improving to the service.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I desire to repeat the recommendation contained in my last annual message in favor of providing at public expense official residences for our ambassadors and ministers at foreign capitals. The reasons supporting this recommendation are strongly stated in the report of the Secretary of State, and the subject seems of such importance that I hope it may receive the early attention of the Congress.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0We have during the last year labored faithfully and against unfavorable conditions to secure better preservation of seal life in the Bering Sea. Both the United States and Great Britain have lately dispatched commissioners to these waters to study the habits and condition of the seal herd and the causes of their rapid decrease. Upon the reports of these commissioners, soon to be submitted, and with the exercise of patience and good sense on the part of all interested parties, it is earnestly hoped that hearty cooperation may be secured for the protection against threatened extinction of seal life in the Northern Pacific and Bering Sea.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Secretary of the Treasury reports that during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, the receipts of the Government from all sources amounted to $409,475,408.78. During the same period its expenditures were $434,678,654.48, the excess of expenditures over receipts thus amounting to $25,203,245.70. The ordinary expenditures during the year were $4,015,852.21 less than during the preceding fiscal year. Of the receipts mentioned there was derived from customs the sum of $160,021,751.67 and from internal revenue $146,830,615.66. The receipts from customs show an increase of $7,863,134.22 over those from the same source for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1895, and the receipts from internal revenue an increase of $3,584,537.91.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The value of our imported dutiable merchandise during the last fiscal year was $369,757,470 and the value of free goods imported $409,967,470, being an increase of $6,523,675 in the value of dutiable goods and $41,231,034 in the value of free goods over the preceding year. Our exports of merchandise, foreign and domestic, amounted in value to $882,606,938, being an increase over the preceding year of $75,068,773. The average ad valorem duty paid on dutiable goods imported during the year was 39.94 per cent and on free and dutiable goods taken together 20.55 per cent.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The cost of collecting our internal revenue was 2.78 per cent, as against 2.81 per cent for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895. The total production of distilled spirits, exclusive of fruit brandies, was 86,588,703 taxable gallons, being an increase of 6,639,108 gallons over the preceding year. There was also an increase of 1,443,676 gallons of spirits produced from fruit as compared with the preceding year. The number of barrels of beer produced was 35,859,250, as against 33,589,784 produced in the preceding fiscal year, being all increase of 2,269,466 barrels.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The total amount of gold exported during the last fiscal year was $112,409,947 and of silver $60,541,670, being an increase of $45,941,466 of gold and $13,246,384 of silver over the exportations of the preceding fiscal year. The imports of gold were $33,525,065 and of silver $28,777,186, being $2,859,695 less of gold and $8,566,007 more of silver than during the preceding year.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The total stock of metallic money in the United States at the close of the last fiscal year, ended on the 30th day of June, 1896, was $1,228,326,035, of which $599,597,964 was in gold and $628,728,071 in silver.\n\nOn the 1st day of November, 1896, the total stock of money of all kinds in the country was $2,285,410,590, and the amount in circulation, not including that in the Treasury holdings, was $1,627,055,641, being $22.63 per capita upon an estimated population of 71,902,000.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The production of the precious metals in the United States during the calendar year 1895 is estimated to have been 2,254,760 fine ounces of gold, of the value of $46,610,000, and 55,727,000 fine ounces of silver, of the commercial value of $36,445,000 and the coinage value of $72,051,000. The estimated production of these metals throughout the world during the same period was 9,688,821 fine ounces of gold, amounting to $200,285,700 in value, and 169,189,249 fine ounces of silver, of the commercial value of $110,654,000 and of the coinage value of $218,738,100 according to our ratio.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The coinage of these metals in the various countries of the world during the same calendar year amounted to $232,701,438 in gold and $121,996,219 in silver.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The total coinage at the mints of the United States during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, amounted to $71,188,468.52, of which $58,878,490 was in gold coins and $12,309,978.52 in standard silver dollars, subsidiary coins, and minor coins\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The number of national banks organized from the time the law authorizing their creation was passed up to October 31, 1896, was 5,051, and of this number 3,679 were at the date last mentioned in active operation, having authorized capital stock of $650,014,895, held by 288,902 shareholders, and circulating notes amounting to $211,412,620.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The total outstanding circulating notes of all national banks on the 31st day of October, 1896, amounted to $234,553,807, including unredeemed but fully secured notes of banks insolvent and in process of liquidation. The increase in national-bank circulation during the year ending on that day was $21,099,429. On October 6, 1896, when the condition of national banks was last reported, the total resources of the 3,679 active institutions were $3,263,685,313.83, which included $1,893,268,839.31 in loans and discounts and $362,165,733.85 in money of all kinds on hand. Of their liabilities $1,597,891,058.03 was due to individual depositors and $209,944,019 consisted of outstanding circulating notes.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0There were organized during the year preceding the date last mentioned 28 national banks, located in 15 States, of which 12 were organized in the Eastern States, with a capital of $1,180,000, 6 in the Western States, with a capital of $875,000, and 10 in the Southern States, with a capital of $1,190,000. During the year, however, 37 banks voluntarily abandoned their franchises under the national law, and in the case of 27 others it was found necessary to appoint receivers. Therefore, as compared with the year preceding, there was a decrease of 36 in the number of active banks.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The number of existing banks organized under State laws is 5,708. The number of immigrants arriving in the United States during the fiscal year was 343,267, of whom 340,468 were permitted to land and 2,799 were debarred on various grounds prescribed by law and returned to the countries whence they came at the expense of the steamship companies by which they were brought in. The increase in immigration over the preceding year amounted to 84,731. It is reported that with some exceptions the immigrants of the past year were of a hardy laboring class, accustomed and able to earn a support for themselves, and it is estimated that the money brought with them amounted to at least $5,000,000, though it was probably much in excess of that sum, since only those having less than $30 are required to disclose the exact amount, and it is known that many brought considerable sums of money to buy land and build homes. Including all the immigrants arriving who were over 14 years of age, 28.63 per cent were illiterate, as against 20.37 per cent of those of that age arriving during the preceding fiscal year. The number of immigrants over 14 years old, the countries from which they came, and the percentage of illiterates among them were as follows: Italy, 57,515, with 54.59 per cent; Ireland, 37,496, with 7 per cent; Russia, 35,188, with 41.14 per cent; Austria-Hungary and provinces, 57,053, with 38.92 per cent; Germany, 25,334, with 2.96 per cent; Sweden, 18,821, with 1.16 per cent; while from Portugal there came 2,067, of whom 77.69 per cent were illiterate. There arrived from Japan during the year only 1,110 immigrants, and it is the opinion of the immigration authorities that the apprehension heretofore existing to some extent of a large immigration from Japan to the United States is without any substantial foundation.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0From the Life-Saving Service it is reported that the number of disasters to documented vessels within the limits of its operations during the year was 437. These vessels had on board 4,608 persons, of whom 4,595 were saved and 13 lost. The value of such vessels is estimated at $8,880,140 and of their cargoes $3,846,380, making the total value of property imperiled $12,726,520. Of this amount $11,292,707 was saved and $1,432,750 was lost. Sixty-seven of the vessels were totally wrecked. There were besides 243 casualties to small undocumented craft, on board of which there were 594 persons, of whom 587 were saved and 7 were lost. The value of the property involved in these latter casualties is estimated at $119,265, of which $114,915 was saved and $4,350 was lost. The life-saving crews during the year also rescued or assisted numerous other vessels and warned many from danger by signals, both by day and night. The number of disasters during the year exceeded that of any previous year in the history of the service, but the saving of both life and property was greater than ever before in proportion to the value of the property involved and to the number of persons imperiled.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The operations of the Marine-Hospital Service, the Revenue-Cutter Service, the Steamboat-Inspection Service, the Light-House Service, the Bureau of Navigation, and other branches of public work attached to the Treasury Department, together with various recommendations concerning their support and improvement, are fully stated in the report of the Secretary of the Treasury, to which the attention of the Congress is especially invited.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The report of the Secretary of War exhibits satisfactory conditions in the several branches of the public service intrusted to his charge.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The limit of our military force as fixed by law is constantly and readily maintained. The present discipline and morale of our Army are excellent, and marked progress and efficiency are apparent throughout its entire organization.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0With the exception of delicate duties in the suppression of slight Indian disturbances along our southwestern boundary, in which the Mexican troops cooperated, and the compulsory but peaceful return, with the consent of Great Britain, of a band of Cree Indians from Montana to the British possessions, no active operations have been required of the Army during the year past.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Changes in methods of administration, the abandonment of unnecessary posts and consequent concentration of troops, and the exercise of care and vigilance by the various officers charged with the responsibility in the expenditure of the appropriations have resulted in reducing to a minimum the cost of maintenance of our military establishment.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0During the past year the work of constructing permanent infantry and cavalry posts has been continued at the places heretofore designated. The Secretary of War repeats his recommendation that appropriations for barracks and quarters should more strictly conform to the needs of the service as judged by the Department rather than respond to the wishes and importunities of localities. It is imperative that much of the money provided for such construction should now be allotted to the erection of necessary quarters for the garrisons assigned to the coast defenses, where many men will be needed to properly care for and operate modern guns. It is essential, too, that early provision be made to supply the necessary force of artillery to meet the demands of this service.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The entire Army has now been equipped with the new magazine arms, and wise policy demands that all available public and private resources should be so employed as to provide within a reasonable time a sufficient number to supply the State militia with these modern weapons and provide an ample reserve for any emergency.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The organized militia numbers 112,879 men. The appropriations for its support by the several States approximate $2,800,000 annually, and $400,000 is contributed by the General Government. Investigation shows these troops to be usually well drilled and inspired with much military interest, but in many instances they are so deficient in proper arms and equipment that a sudden call to active duty would find them inadequately prepared for field service. I therefore recommend that prompt measures be taken to remedy this condition and that every encouragement be given to this deserving body of unpaid and voluntary citizen soldiers, upon whose assistance we must largely rely in time of trouble.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0During the past year rapid progress has been made toward the completion of the scheme adopted for the erection and armament of fortifications along our seacoast, while equal progress has been made in providing the material for submarine defense in connection with these works.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It is peculiarly gratifying at this time to note the great advance that has been made in this important undertaking since the date of my annual message to the Fifty-third Congress at the opening of its second session, in December, 1893. At that time I informed the Congress of the approaching completion of nine 12-inch, twenty 10-inch, and thirty-four 8-inch high-power steel guns and seventy-five 12-inch rifled mortars.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0This total then seemed insignificant when compared with the great work remaining to be done. Yet it was none the less a source of satisfaction to every citizen when he reflected that it represented the first installment of the new ordnance of American design and American manufacture and demonstrated our ability to supply from our own resources guns of unexcelled power and accuracy.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0At that date, however, there were practically no carriages upon which to mount these guns and only thirty-one emplacements for guns and sixty-four for mortars. Nor were all these emplacements in condition to receive their armament. Only one high-power gun was at that time in position for the defense of the entire coast.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Since that time the number of guns actually completed has been increased to a total of twenty-one 12-inch, fifty-six 10-inch, sixty-one 8-inch high-power breech-loading steel guns, ten rapid-fire guns, and eighty 12-inch rifled mortars. In addition there are in process of construction one 16-inch-type gun, fifty 12-inch, fifty-six 10-inch, twenty-seven 8-inch high-power guns, and sixty-six 12-inch rifled mortars; in all, four hundred and twenty-eight guns and mortars.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0During the same year, immediately preceding the message referred to, the first modern gun carriage had been completed and eleven more were in process of construction. All but one were of the nondisappearing type. These, however, were not such as to secure necessary cover for the artillery gunners against the intense fire of modern machine rapid-fire and high-power guns.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The inventive genius of ordnance and civilian experts has been taxed in designing carriages that would obviate this fault, resulting, it is believed, in the solution of this difficult problem. Since 1893 the number of gun carriages constructed or building has been raised to a total of 129, of which 90 are on the disappearing principle, and the number of mortar carriages to 152, while the 95 emplacements which were provided for prior to that time have been increased to 280 built and building.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0This improved situation is largely due to the recent generous response of Congress to the recommendations of the War Department.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Thus we shall soon have complete about one-fifth of the comprehensive system the first step in which was noted in my message to the Congress of December 4, 1893.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0When it is understood that a masonry emplacement not only furnishes a platform for the heavy modern high-power gun, but also in every particular serves the purpose and takes the place of the fort of former days, the importance of the work accomplished is better comprehended.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0In the hope that the work will be prosecuted with no less vigor in the future, the Secretary of War has submitted an estimate by which, if allowed, there will be provided and either built or building by the end of the next fiscal year such additional guns, mortars, gun carriages, and emplacements as will represent not far from one-third of the total work to be done under the plan adopted for our coast defenses, thus affording a prospect that the entire work will be substantially completed within six years. In less time than that, however, we shall have attained a marked degree of security.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The experience and results of the past year demonstrate that with a continuation of present careful methods the cost of the remaining work will be much less than the original estimate.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0We should always keep in mind that of all forms of military preparation coast defense alone is essentially pacific in its nature. While it gives the sense of security due to a consciousness of strength, it is neither the purpose nor the effect of such permanent fortifications to involve us in foreign complications, but rather to guarantee us against them. They are not temptation to war, but security against it. Thus they are thoroughly in accord with all the traditions of our national diplomacy.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Attorney-General presents a detailed and interesting statement of the important work done under his supervision during the last fiscal year.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The ownership and management by the Government of penitentiaries for the confinement of those convicted in United States courts of violations of Federal laws, which for many years has been a subject of Executive recommendation, have at last to a slight extent been realized by the utilization of the abandoned military prison at Fort Leavenworth as a United States penitentiary.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0This is certainly a movement in the right direction, but it ought to be at once supplemented by the rebuilding or extensive enlargement of this improvised prison and the construction of at least one more, to be located in the Southern States. The capacity of the Leavenworth penitentiary is so limited that the expense of its maintenance, calculated at a per capita rate upon the number of prisoners it can accommodate, does not make as economical an exhibit as it would if it were larger and better adapted to prison purposes; but I am thoroughly convinced that economy, humanity, and a proper sense of responsibility and duty toward those whom we punish for violations of Federal law dictate that the Federal Government should have the entire control and management of the penitentiaries where convicted violators are confined.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It appears that since the transfer of the Fort Leavenworth Military Prison to its new uses the work previously done by prisoners confined there, and for which expensive machinery has been provided, has been discontinued. This work consisted of the manufacture of articles for army use, now done elsewhere. On all grounds it is exceedingly desirable that the convicts confined in this penitentiary be allowed to resume work of this description.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It is most gratifying to note the satisfactory results that have followed the inauguration of the new system provided for by the act of May 28, 1896, under which certain Federal officials are compensated by salaries instead of fees. The new plan was put in operation on the 1st day of July, 1896, and already the great economy it enforces, its prevention of abuses, and its tendency to a better enforcement of the laws are strikingly apparent. Detailed evidence of the usefulness of this long-delayed but now happily accomplished reform will be found clearly set forth in the Attorney-General's report.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Our Post-Office Department is in good condition, and the exhibit made of its operations during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, if allowance is made for imperfections in the laws applicable to it, is very satisfactory. The total receipts during the year were $82,499,208.40. The total expenditures were $90,626,296.84, exclusive of the $1,559,898.27 which was earned by the Pacific Railroad for transportation and credited on their debt to the Government. There was an increase of receipts over the previous year of $5,516,080.21, or 7.1 per cent, and an increase of expenditures of $3,836,124.02, or 4.42 per cent. The deficit was $1,679,956.19 less than that of the preceding year. The chief expenditures of the postal service are regulated by law and are not in the control of the Postmaster-General. All that he can accomplish by the most watchful administration and economy is to enforce prompt and thorough collection and accounting for public moneys and such minor savings in small expenditures and in letting those contracts, for post-office supplies and star service, which are not regulated by statute.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0An effective cooperation between the Auditor's Office and the Post-Office Department and the making and enforcement of orders by the Department requiring immediate notification to their sureties of all delinquencies on the part of postmasters, and compelling such postmasters to make more frequent deposits of postal funds, have resulted in a prompter auditing of their accounts and much less default to the Government than heretofore.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The year's report shows large extensions of both star-route service and railway mail service, with increased postal facilities. Much higher accuracy in handling mails has also been reached, as appears by the decrease of errors in the railway mail service and the reduction of mail matter returned to the Dead-Letter Office.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The deficit for the last year, although much less than that of the last and preceding years, emphasizes the necessity for legislation to correct the growing abuse of second-class rates, to which the deficiency is mainly attributable. The transmission at the rate of 1 cent a pound of serial libraries, advertising sheets,\" house organs\" (periodicals advertising some particular \"house\" or institution), sample copies, and the like ought certainly to be discontinued. A glance at the revenues received for the work done last year will show more plainly than any other statement the gross abuse of the postal service and the growing waste of its earnings.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The free matter carried in the mails for the Departments, offices, etc., of the Government and for Congress, in pounds, amounted to 94,480,189.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0If this is offset against buildings for post-offices and stations, the rental of which would more than compensate for such free postal service, we have this exhibit:\n\nWeight of mail matter (other than above) transmitted through the mails for the year ending June 30, 1896.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Class \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Weight \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Revenue\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Pounds\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 1.

If we concede the public policy of carrying weekly newspapers free in the county of publication, and even the policy of carrying at less than one-tenth of their cost other bona fide newspapers and periodicals, there can be no excuse for subjecting the service to the further immense and increasing loss involved in carrying at the nominal rate of 1 cent a pound the serial libraries, sometimes including trashy and even harmful literature, and other matter which under the loose interpretation of a loose statute have been gradually given second-class rates, thus absorbing all profitable returns derived from first-class matter, which pays three or four times more than its cost, and producing a large annual loss to be paid by general taxation. If such second-class matter paid merely the cost of its handling, our deficit would disappear and a surplus result which might be used to give the people still better mail facilities or cheaper rates of letter postage. I recommend that legislation be at once enacted to correct these abuses and introduce better business ideas in the regulation of our postal rates.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Experience and observation have demonstrated that certain improvements in the organization of the Post-Office Department must be secured before we can gain the full benefit of the immense sums expended in its administration. This involves the following reforms, which I earnestly recommend:\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0There should be a small addition to the existing inspector service, to be employed in the supervision of the carrier force, which now numbers 13,000 men and performs its service practically without the surveillance exercised over all other branches of the postal or public service. Of course such a lack of supervision and freedom from wholesome disciplinary restraints must inevitably lead to imperfect service. There should also be appointed a few inspectors who could assist the central office in necessary investigation concerning matters of post-office leases, post-office sites, allowances for rent, fuel, and lights, and in organizing and securing the best results from the work of the 14,000 clerks now employed in first and second class offices.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I am convinced that the small expense attending the inauguration of these reforms would actually be a profitable investment.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I especially recommend such a recasting of the appropriations by Congress for the Post-Office Department as will permit the Postmaster-General to proceed with the work of consolidating post-offices. This work has already been entered upon sufficiently to fully demonstrate by experiment and experience that such consolidation is productive of better service, larger revenues, and less expenditures, to say nothing of the further advantage of gradually withdrawing post-offices from the spoils system.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Universal Postal Union, which now embraces all the civilized world and whose delegates will represent 1,000,000,000 people, will hold its fifth congress in the city of Washington in May, 1897. The United States may be said to have taken the initiative which led to the first meeting of this congress, at Berne in 1874, and the formation of the Universal Postal Union, which brings the postal service of all countries to every man's neighborhood and has wrought marvels in cheapening postal rates and securing absolutely safe mail communication throughout the world. Previous congresses have met in Berne, Paris, Lisbon, and Vienna, and the respective countries in which they have assembled have made generous provision for their accommodation and for the reception and entertainment of the delegates.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0In view of the importance of this assemblage and of its deliberations and of the honors and hospitalities accorded to our representatives by other countries on similar occasions, I earnestly hope that such an appropriation will be made for the expenses necessarily attendant upon the coming meeting in our capital city as will be worthy of our national hospitality and indicative of our appreciation of the event.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The work of the Navy Department and its present condition are fully exhibited in the report of the Secretary.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The construction of vessels for our new Navy has been energetically prosecuted by the present Administration upon the general lines previously adopted, the Department having seen no necessity for radical changes in prior methods, under which the work was found to be progressing in a manner highly satisfactory. It has been decided, however, to provide in every shipbuilding contract that the builder should pay all trial expenses, and it has also been determined to pay no speed premiums in future contracts. The premiums recently earned and some yet to be decided are features of the contracts made before this conclusion was reached.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0On March 4, 1893, there were in commission but two armored vessels--the double-turreted monitors Miantonomoh and Monterey. Since that date, of vessels theretofore authorized, there have been placed in their first commission 3 first-class and 2 second-class battle ships, 2 armored cruisers, 1 harbor-defense ram, and 5 double-turreted monitors, including the Maine and the Puritan, just completed. Eight new unarmored cruisers and 2 new gunboats have also been commissioned. The Iowa, another battle ship, will be completed about March 1, and at least 4 more gunboats will be ready for sea in the early spring.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It is gratifying to state that our ships and their outfits are believed to be equal to the best that can be manufactured elsewhere, and that such notable reductions have been made in their cost as to justify the statement that quite a number of vessels are now being constructed at rates as low as those that prevail in European shipyards.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Our manufacturing facilities are at this time ample for all possible naval contingencies. Three of our Government navy-yards--those at Mare Island, Cal., Norfolk, Va., and Brooklyn, N. Y.--are equipped for shipbuilding, our ordnance plant in Washington is equal to any in the world, and at the torpedo station we are successfully making the highest grades of smokeless powder. The first-class private shipyards at Newport News, Philadelphia, and San Francisco are building battle ships; eleven contractors, situated in the States of Maine, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia, and the State of Washington, are constructing gunboats or torpedo boats; two plants are manufacturing large quantities of first-class armor, and American factories are producing automobile torpedoes, powder, projectiles, rapid-fire guns, and everything else necessary for the complete outfit of naval vessels.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0There have been authorized by Congress since March, 1893, 5 battle ships, 6 light-draft gunboats, 16 torpedo boats, and 1 submarine torpedo boat. Contracts for the building of all of them have been let. The Secretary expresses the opinion that we have for the present a sufficient supply of cruisers and gunboats, and that hereafter the construction of battle ships and torpedo boats will supply our needs.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Much attention has been given to the methods of carrying on departmental business. Important modifications in the regulations have been made, tending to unify the control of shipbuilding as far as may be under the Bureau of Construction and Repair, and also to improve the mode of purchasing supplies for the Navy by the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts. The establishment under recent acts of Congress of a supply fund with which to purchase these supplies in large quantities and other modifications of methods have tended materially to their cheapening and better quality.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The War College has developed into an institution which it is believed will be of great value to the Navy in teaching the science of war, as well as in stimulating professional zeal in the Navy, and it will be especially useful in the devising of plans for the utilization in case of necessity of all the naval resources of the United States.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Secretary has persistently adhered to the plan he found in operation for securing labor at navy-yards through boards of labor employment, and has done much to make it more complete and efficient. The naval officers who are familiar with this system and its operation express the decided opinion that its results have been to vastly improve the character of the work done at our yards and greatly reduce its cost.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Discipline among the officers and men of the Navy has been maintained to a high standard and the percentage of American citizens enlisted has been very much increased.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Secretary is considering and will formulate during the coming winter a plan for laying up ships in reserve, thereby largely reducing the cost of maintaining our vessels afloat. This plan contemplates that battle ships, torpedo boats, and such of the cruisers as are not needed for active service at sea shall be kept in reserve with skeleton crews on board to keep them in condition, cruising only enough to insure the efficiency of the ships and their crews in time of activity.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The economy to result from this system is too obvious to need comment.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Naval Militia, which was authorized a few years ago as an experiment, has now developed into a body of enterprising young men, active and energetic in the discharge of their duties and promising great usefulness. This establishment has nearly the same relation to our Navy as the National Guard in the different States bears to our Army, and it constitutes a source of supply for our naval forces the importance of which is immediately apparent.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The report of the Secretary of the Interior presents a comprehensive and interesting exhibit of the numerous and important affairs committed to his supervision. It is impossible in this communication to do more than briefly refer to a few of the subjects concerning which the Secretary gives full and instructive information.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The money appropriated on account of this Department and for its disbursement for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, amounted to more than $157,000,000, or a greater sum than was appropriated for the entire maintenance of the Government for the two fiscal years ended June 30, 1861.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Our public lands, originally amounting to 1,840,000,000 acres, have been so reduced that only about 600,000,000 acres still remain in Government control, excluding Alaska. The balance, being by far the most valuable portion, has been given away to settlers, to new States, and to railroads or sold at a comparatively nominal sum. The patenting of land in execution of railroad grants has progressed rapidly during the year, and since the 4th day of March, 1893, about 25,000,000 acres have thus been conveyed to these corporations.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I agree with the Secretary that the remainder of our public lands should be more carefully dealt with and their alienation guarded by better economy and greater prudence.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The commission appointed from the membership of the National Academy of Sciences, provided for by an act of Congress, to formulate plans for a national forestry system will, it is hoped, soon be prepared to present the result of thorough and intelligent examination of this important subject.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The total Indian population of the United States is 177,235, according to a census made in 1895, exclusive of those within the State of New York and those comprising the Five Civilized Tribes. Of this number there are approximately 38,000 children of school age. During the year 23,393 of these were enrolled in schools. The progress which has attended recent efforts to extend Indian-school facilities and the anticipation of continued liberal appropriations to that end can not fail to afford the utmost satisfaction to those who believe that the education of Indian children is a prime factor in the accomplishment of Indian civilization.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It may be said in general terms that in every particular the improvement of the Indians under Government care has been most marked and encouraging.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Secretary, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the agents having charge of Indians to whom allotments have been made strongly urge the passage of a law prohibiting the sale of liquor to allottees who have taken their lands in severalty. I earnestly join in this recommendation and venture to express the hope that the Indian may be speedily protected against this greatest of all obstacles to his well-being and advancement.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The condition of affairs among the Five Civilized Tribes, who occupy large tracts of land in the Indian Territory and who have governments of their own, has assumed such an aspect as to render it almost indispensable that there should be an entire change in the relations of these Indians to the General Government. This seems to be necessary in furtherance of their own interests, as well as for the protection of non-Indian residents in their territory. A commission organized and empowered under several recent laws is now negotiating with these Indians for the relinquishment of their courts and the division of their common lands in severalty and are aiding in the settlement of the troublesome question of tribal membership. The reception of their first proffers of negotiation was not encouraging, but through patience and such conduct on their part as demonstrated that their intentions were friendly and in the interest of the tribes the prospect of success has become more promising. The effort should be to save these Indians from the consequences of their own mistakes and improvidence and to secure to the real Indian his rights as against intruders and professed friends who profit by his retrogression. A change is also needed to protect life and property through the operation of courts conducted according to strict justice and strong enough to enforce their mandates.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0As a sincere friend of the Indian, I am exceedingly anxious that these reforms should be accomplished with the consent and aid of the tribes and that no necessity may be presented for radical or drastic legislation I hope, therefore, that the commission now conducting negotiations will soon be able to report that progress has been made toward a friendly adjustment of existing difficulties.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It appears that a very valuable deposit of gilsonite or asphaltum has been found on the reservation in Utah occupied by the Uncompahgre Ute Indians. Every consideration of care for the public interest and every sensible business reason dictate such management or disposal of this important source of public revenue as will except it from the general rules and incidents attending the ordinary disposition of public lands and secure to the Government a fair share at least of its advantages in place of its transfer for a nominal sum to interested individuals.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I indorse the recommendation made by the present Secretary of the Interior, as well as his predecessor, that a permanent commission, consisting of three members, one of whom shall be an army officer, be created to perform the duties now devolving upon the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner of Indian Affairs. The management of the Bureau involves such numerous and diverse details and the advantages of an uninterrupted policy are so apparent that I hope the change suggested will meet the approval of the Congress.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The diminution of our enormous pension roll and the decrease of pension expenditure, which have been so often confidently for told, still fail in material realization. The number of pensioners on the polls at the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1896, was 970,678. This is the largest number ever reported. The amount paid exclusively for pensions during the year was $138,214,761.94, a slight decrease from that of the preceding year, while the total expenditures on account of pensions, including the cost of maintaining the Department and expenses attending pension distribution, amounted to $142,206,550.59, or within every small fraction of one-third of the entire expense of supporting the Government during the same year. The number of new pension certificates issued was 90,640. Of these, 40,374 represent original allowances of claims and 15,878 increases of existing pensions.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The number of persons receiving pensions from the United States, but residing in foreign countries, at the close of the last fiscal year was 3,781, and the amount paid to them during the year was $582,735.38.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The sum appropriated for the payment of pensions for the current fiscal year, ending June 30, 1897, is $140,000,000, and for the succeeding year it is estimated that the same amount will be necessary.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Commissioner of Pensions reports that during the last fiscal year 339 indictments were found against violators of the pension laws. Upon these indictments 167 convictions resulted.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0In my opinion, based upon such statements as these and much other information and observation, the abuses which have been allowed to creep into our pension system have done incalculable harm in demoralizing our people and undermining good citizenship. I have endeavored within my sphere of official duty to protect our pension roll and make it what it should be, a roll of honor, containing the names of those disabled in their country's service and worthy of their country's affectionate remembrance. When I have seen those who pose as the soldiers' friends active and alert in urging greater laxity and more reckless pension expenditure, while nursing selfish schemes, I have deprecated the approach of a situation when necessary retrenchment and enforced economy may lead to an attack upon pension abuses so determined as to overlook the discrimination due to those who, worthy of a nation's care, ought to live and die under the protection of a nation's gratitude.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Secretary calls attention to the public interests involved in an adjustment of the obligations of the Pacific railroads to the Government. I deem it to be an important duty to especially present this subject to the consideration of the Congress.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0On January 1, 1897, with the amount already matured, more than $13,000,000 of the principal of the subsidy bonds issued by the United States in aid of the construction of the Union Pacific Railway, including its Kansas line, and more than $6,000,000 of like bonds issued in aid of the Central Pacific Railroad, including those issued to the Western Pacific Railroad Company, will have fallen due and been paid or must on that day be paid by the Government. Without any reference to the application of the sinking fund now in the Treasury, this will create such a default on the part of these companies to the Government as will give it the right to at once institute proceedings to foreclose its mortgage lien. In addition to this indebtedness, which will be due January 1, 1897, there will mature between that date and January 1, 1899, the remaining principal of such subsidy bonds, which must also be met by the Government. These amount to more than $20,000,000 on account of the Union Pacific lines and exceed $21,000,000 on account of the Central Pacific lines.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The situation of these roads and the condition of their indebtedness to the Government have been fully set forth in the reports of various committees to the present and prior Congresses, and as early as 1887 they were thoroughly examined by a special commission appointed pursuant to an act of Congress. The considerations requiring an adjustment of the Government's relations to the companies have been clearly presented and the conclusion reached with practical uniformity that if these relations are not terminated they should be revised upon a basis securing their safe continuance.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Under section 4 of the act of Congress passed March 3, 1887, the President is charged with the duty, in the event that any mortgage or other incumbrance paramount to the interest of the United States in the property of the Pacific railroads should exist and be lawfully liable to be enforced, to direct the action of the Departments of Treasury and of justice in the protection of the interest of the United States by redemption or through judicial proceedings, including foreclosures of the Government liens.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0In view of the fact that the Congress has for a number of years almost constantly had under consideration various plans for dealing with the conditions existing between these roads and the Government, I have thus far felt justified in withholding action under the statute above mentioned.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0In the case of the Union Pacific Company, however, the situation has become especially and immediately urgent. Proceedings have been instituted to foreclose a first mortgage upon those aided parts of the main lines upon which the Government holds a second and subordinate mortgage lien. In consequence of those proceedings and increasing complications, added to the default occurring on the 1st day of January, 1897, a condition will be presented at that date, so far as this company is concerned, that must emphasize the mandate of the act of 1887 and give to Executive duty under its provisions a more imperative aspect. Therefore, unless Congress shall otherwise direct or shall have previously determined upon a different solution of the problem, there will hardly appear to exist any reason for delaying beyond the date of the default above mentioned such Executive action as will promise to subserve the public interests and save the Government from the loss threatened by further inaction.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Department of Agriculture is so intimately related to the welfare of our people and the prosperity of our nation that it should constantly receive the care and encouragement of the Government. From small beginnings it has grown to be the center of agricultural intelligence and the source of aid and encouragement to agricultural efforts. Large sums of money are annually appropriated for the maintenance of this Department, and it must be confessed that the legislation relating to it has not always been directly in the interest of practical farming or properly guarded against waste and extravagance. So far, however, as public money has been appropriated fairly and sensibly to help those who actually till the soil, no expenditure has been more profitably made or more generally approved by the people.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Under the present management of the Department its usefulness has been enhanced in every direction, and at the same time strict economy has been enforced to the utmost extent permitted by Congressional action. From the report of the Secretary it appears that through careful and prudent financial management he has annually saved a large sum from his appropriations, aggregating during his incumbency and up to the close of the present fiscal year nearly one-fifth of the entire amount appropriated. These results have been accomplished by a conscientious study of the real needs of the farmer and such a regard for economy as the genuine farmer ought to appreciate, supplemented by a rigid adherence to civil-service methods in a Department which should be conducted in the interest of agriculture instead of partisan politics.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Secretary reports that the value of our exports of farm products during the last fiscal year amounted to $570,000,000, an increase of $17,000,000 over those of the year immediately preceding. This statement is not the less welcome because of the fact that, notwithstanding such increase, the proportion of exported agricultural products to our total exports of all descriptions fell off during the year. The benefits of an increase in agricultural exports being assured, the decrease in its proportion to our total exports is the more gratifying when we consider that it is owing to the fact that such total exports for the year increased more than $75,000,000.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The large and increasing exportation of our agricultural products suggests the great usefulness of the organization lately established in the Department for the purpose of giving to those engaged in farming pursuits reliable information concerning the condition, needs, and advantages of different foreign markets. Inasmuch as the success of the farmer depends upon the advantageous sale of his products, and inasmuch as foreign markets must largely be the destination of such products, it is quite apparent that a knowledge of the conditions and wants that affect those markets ought to result in sowing more intelligently and reaping with a better promise of profit. Such information points out the way to a prudent foresight in the selection and cultivation of crops and to a release from the bondage of unreasoning monotony of production, a glutted and depressed market, and constantly recurring unprofitable toil.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0In my opinion the gratuitous distribution of seeds by the Department as at present conducted ought to be discontinued. No one can read the statement of the Secretary on this subject and doubt the extravagance and questionable results of this practice. The professed friends of the farmer, and certainly the farmers themselves, are naturally expected to be willing to rid a Department devoted to the promotion of farming interests of a feature which tends so much to its discredit.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Weather Bureau, now attached to the Department of Agriculture, has continued to extend its sphere of usefulness, and by an uninterrupted improvement in the accuracy of its forecasts has greatly increased its efficiency as an aid and protection to all whose occupations are related to weather conditions.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Omitting further reference to the operations of the Department, I commend the Secretary's report and the suggestions it contains to the careful consideration of the Congress.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The progress made in civil-service reform furnishes a cause for the utmost congratulation. It has survived the doubts of its friends as well as the rancor of its enemies and has gained a permanent place among the agencies destined to cleanse our politics and to improve, economize, and elevate the public service.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0There are now in the competitive classified service upward of 84,000 places, more than half of these having been included from time to time since March 4, 1893. A most radical and sweeping extension was made by Executive order dated the 6th day of May, 1896, and if fourth-class postmasterships are not included in the statement it may be said that practically all positions contemplated by the civil-service law are now classified. Abundant reasons exist for including these postmaster-ships, based upon economy, improved service, and the peace and quiet of neighborhoods. If, however, obstacles prevent such action at present, I earnestly hope that Congress will, without increasing post-office appropriations, so adjust them as to permit in proper eases a consolidation of these post-offices, to the end that through this process the result desired may to a limited extent be accomplished.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The civil-service rules as amended during the last year provide for a sensible and uniform method of promotion, basing eligibility to better positions upon demonstrated efficiency and faithfulness. The absence of fixed rules on this subject has been an infirmity in the system more and more apparent as its other benefits have been better appreciated.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The advantages of civil-service methods in their business aspects are too well understood to require argument. Their application has become a necessity to the executive work of the Government. But those who gain positions through the operation of these methods should be made to understand that the nonpartisan scheme through which they receive their appointments demands from them by way of reciprocity nonpartisan and faithful performance of duty under every Administration and cheerful fidelity to every chief. While they should be encouraged to decently exercise their rights of citizenship and to support through their suffrages the political beliefs they honestly profess, the noisy, pestilent, and partisan employee, who loves political turmoil and contention or who renders lax and grudging service to an Administration not representing his political views, should be promptly and fearlessly dealt with in such a way as to furnish a warning to others who may be likewise disposed.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The annual report of the Commissioners will be duly transmitted, and I commend the important matter they have in charge to the careful consideration of the Congress.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The Interstate Commerce Commission has during the last year supplied abundant evidence of its usefulness and the importance of the work committed to its charge.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Public transportation is a universal necessity, and the question of just and reasonable charges therefor has become of vital importance not only to shippers and carriers, but also to the vast multitude of producers and consumers. The justice and equity of the principles embodied in the existing law passed for the purpose of regulating these charges are everywhere conceded, and there appears to be no question that the policy thus entered upon has a permanent place in our legislation.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0As the present statute when enacted was in the nature of the case more or less tentative and experimental, it was hardly expected to supply a complete and adequate system. While its wholesome effects are manifest and have amply justified its enactment, it is evident that all desired reforms in transportation methods have not been fully accomplished. In view of the judicial interpretation which some provisions of this statute have received and the defects disclosed by the efforts made for its enforcement, its revision and amendment appear to be essential, to the end that it may more effectually reach the evils designed to be corrected. I hope the recommendations of the Commission upon this subject will be promptly and favorably considered by the Congress.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I desire to recur to the statements elsewhere made concerning the Government's receipts and expenditures for the purpose of venturing upon some suggestions touching our present tariff law and its operation.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0This statute took effect on the 28th day of August, 1894. Whatever may be its shortcomings as a complete measure of tariff reform, it must be conceded that it has opened the way to a freer and greater exchange of commodities between us and other countries, and thus furnished a wider market for our products and manufactures.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The only entire fiscal year during which this law has been in force ended on the 30th day of June, 1896. In that year our imports increased over those of the previous year more than $6,500,000, while the value of the domestic products we exported and which found markets abroad was nearly $70,000,000 more than during the preceding year.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Those who insist that the cost to our people of articles coming to them from abroad for their needful use should only be increased through tariff charges to an extent necessary to meet the expenses of the Government, as well as those who claim that tariff charges may be laid upon such articles beyond the necessities of Government revenue and with the additional purpose of so increasing their price in our markets as to give American manufacturers and producers better and more profitable opportunities, must agree that our tariff laws are only primarily justified as sources of revenue to enable the Government to meet the necessary expenses of its maintenance. Considered as to its efficiency in this aspect, the present law can by no means fall under just condemnation. During the only complete fiscal year of its operation it has yielded nearly $8,000,000 more revenue than was received from tariff duties in the preceding year. There was, nevertheless, a deficit between our receipts and expenditures of a little more than $25,000,000 This, however, was not unexpected.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The situation was such in December last, seven months before the close of the fiscal year, that the Secretary of the Treasury foretold a deficiency of $17,000,000. The great and increasing apprehension and timidity in business circles and the depression in all activities intervening since that time, resulting from causes perfectly well understood and entirely disconnected with our tariff law or its operation, seriously checked the imports we would have otherwise received and readily account for the difference between this estimate of the Secretary and the actual deficiency, as well as for a continued deficit. Indeed, it must be confessed that we could hardly have had a more unfavorable period than the last two years for the collection of tariff revenue. We can not reasonably hope that our recuperation from this business depression will be sudden, but it has already set in with a promise of acceleration and continuance.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I believe our present tariff law, if allowed a fair opportunity, will in the near future yield a revenue which, with reasonably economical expenditures, will overcome all deficiencies. In the meantime no deficit that has occurred or may occur need excite or disturb us. To meet any such deficit we have in the Treasury in addition to a gold reserve of one hundred millions a surplus of more than $128,000,000 applicable to the payment of the expenses of the Government, and which must, unless expended for that purpose, remain a useless hoard, or, if not extravagantly wasted, must in any event be perverted from the purpose of its exaction from our people. The payment, therefore, of any deficiency in the revenue from this fund is nothing more than its proper and legitimate use. The Government thus applying a surplus fortunately in its Treasury to the payment of expenses not met by its current revenues is not at all to be likened to a man living beyond his income and thus incurring debt or encroaching on his principal.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It is not one of the functions of our Government to accumulate and make additions to a fund not needed for immediate expenditure. With individuals it is the chief object of struggle and effort. The application of an accumulated fund by the Government to the payment of its running expenses is a duty. An individual living beyond his income and embarrassing himself with debt or drawing upon his accumulated fund of principal is either unfortunate or improvident. The distinction is between a government charged with the duty of expending for the benefit of the people and for proper purposes all the money it receives from any source, and the individual, who is expected to manifest a natural desire to avoid debt or to accumulate as much as possible and to live within the income derived from such accumulations, to the end that they may be increased or at least remain unimpaired for the future use and enjoyment of himself or the objects of his love and affection who may survive him.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It is immeasurably better to appropriate our surplus to the payment of justifiable expenses than to allow it to become an invitation to reckless appropriations and extravagant expenditures.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I suppose it will not be denied that under the present law our people obtain the necessaries of a comfortable existence at a cheaper rate than formerly. This is a matter of supreme importance, since it is the palpable duty of every just government to make the burdens of taxation as light as possible. The people should not be required to relinquish this privilege of cheaper living except under the stress of their Government's necessity made plainly manifest.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0This reference to the condition and prospects of our revenues naturally suggests an allusion to the weakness and vices of our financial methods. They have been frequently pressed upon the attention of Congress in previous Executive communications and the inevitable danger of their continued toleration pointed out. Without now repeating these details, I can not refrain from again earnestly presenting the necessity of the prompt reform of a system opposed to every rule of sound finance and shown by experience to be fraught with the gravest peril and perplexity. The terrible Civil War, which shook the foundations of our Government more than thirty years ago, brought in its train the destruction of property, the wasting of our country's substance, and the estrangement of brethren. These are now past and forgotten. Even the distressing loss of life the conflict entailed is but a sacred memory which fosters patriotic sentiment and keeps alive a tender regard for those who nobly died. And yet there remains with us to-day in full strength and activity, as an incident of that tremendous struggle, a feature of its financial necessities not only unsuited to our present circumstances, but manifestly a disturbing menace to business security and an ever-present agent of monetary distress.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Because we may be enjoying a temporary relief from its depressing influence, this should not lull us into a false security nor lead us to forget the suddenness of past visitations.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0I am more convinced than ever that we can have no assured financial peace and safety until the Government currency obligations upon which gold may be demanded from the Treasury are withdrawn from circulation and canceled. This might be done, as has been heretofore recommended, by their exchange for long-term bonds bearing a low rate of interest or by their redemption with the proceeds of such bonds. Even if only the United States notes known as greenbacks were thus retired it is probable that the Treasury notes issued in payment of silver purchases under the act of July 14, 1890, now paid in gold when demanded, would not create much disturbance, as they might from time to time, when received in the Treasury by redemption in gold or otherwise, be gradually and prudently replaced by silver coin.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0This plan of issuing bonds for the purpose of redemption certainly appears to be the most effective and direct path to the needed reform. In default of this, however, it would be a step in the right direction if currency obligations redeemable in gold whenever so redeemed should be canceled instead of being reissued. This operation would be a slow remedy, but it would improve present conditions.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0National banks should redeem their own notes. They should be allowed to issue circulation to the par value of bonds deposited as security for its redemption and the tax on their circulation should be reduced to one-fourth of 1 per cent.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0In considering projects for the retirement of United States notes and Treasury notes issued under the law of 1890, I am of the opinion that we have placed too much stress upon the danger of contracting the currency and have calculated too little upon the gold that would be added to our circulation if invited to us by better and safer financial methods. It is not so much a contraction of our currency that should be avoided as its unequal distribution.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0This might be obviated and any fear of harmful contraction at the same time removed by allowing the organization of smaller banks and in less populous communities than are now permitted, and also authorizing existing banks to establish branches in small communities under proper restrictions.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0The entire case may be presented by the statement that the day of sensible and sound financial methods will not dawn upon us until our Government abandons the banking business and the accumulation of funds and confines its monetary operations to the receipt of the money contributed by the people for its support and to the expenditure of such money for the people's benefit.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Our business interests and all good citizens long for rest from feverish agitation and the inauguration by the Government of a reformed financial policy which will encourage enterprise and make certain the rewards of labor and industry.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Another topic in which our people rightfully take a deep interest may be here briefly considered. I refer to the existence of trusts and other huge aggregations of capital the object of which is to secure the monopoly of some particular branch of trade, industry, or commerce and to stifle wholesome competition. When these are defended, it is usually on the ground that though they increase profits they also reduce prices, and thus may benefit the public. It must be remembered, however, that a reduction of prices to the people is not one of the real objects of these organizations, nor is their tendency necessarily in that direction. If it occurs in a particular case it is only because it accords with the purposes or interests of those managing the scheme.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Such occasional results fall far short of compensating the palpable evils charged to the account of trusts and monopolies. Their tendency is to crush out individual independence and to hinder or prevent the free use of human faculties and the full development of human character. Through them the farmer, the artisan, and the small trader is in danger of dislodgment from the proud position of being his own master, watchful of all that touches his country's prosperity, in which he has an individual lot, and interested in all that affects the advantages of business of which he is a factor, to be relegated to the level of a mere appurtenance to a great machine, with little free will, with no duty but that of passive obedience, and with little hope or opportunity of rising in the scale of responsible and helpful citizenship.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0To the instinctive belief that such is the inevitable trend of trusts and monopolies is due the widespread and deep-seated popular aversion in which they are held and the not unreasonable insistence that, whatever may be their incidental economic advantages, their general effect upon personal character, prospects, and usefulness can not be otherwise than injurious.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0Though Congress has attempted to deal with this matter by legislation, the laws passed for that purpose thus far have proved ineffective, not because of any lack of disposition or attempt to enforce them, but simply because the laws themselves as interpreted by the courts do not reach the difficulty. If the insufficiencies of existing laws can be remedied by further legislation, it should be done. The fact must be recognized, however, that all Federal legislation on this subject may fall short of its purpose because of inherent obstacles and also because of the complex character of our governmental system, which, while making the Federal authority supreme within its sphere, has carefully limited that sphere by metes and bounds that can not be transgressed. The decision of our highest court on this precise question renders it quite doubtful whether the evils of trusts and monopolies can be adequately treated through Federal action unless they seek directly and purposely to include in their objects transportation or intercourse between States or between the United States and foreign countries.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0It does not follow, however, that this is the limit of the remedy that may be applied. Even though it may be found that Federal authority is not broad enough to fully reach the case, there can be no doubt of the power of the several States to act effectively in the premises, and there should be no reason to doubt their willingness to judiciously exercise such power.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0In concluding this communication its last words shall be an appeal to the Congress for the most rigid economy in the expenditure of the money it holds in trust for the people. The way to perplexing extravagance is easy, but a return to frugality is difficult. When, however, it is considered that those who bear the burdens of taxation have no guaranty of honest care save in the fidelity of their public servants, the duty of all possible retrenchment is plainly manifest.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0When our differences are forgotten and our contests of political opinion are no longer remembered, nothing in the retrospect of our public service will be as fortunate and comforting as the recollection of official duty well performed and the memory of a constant devotion to the interests of our confiding fellow-countrymen.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 GROVER CLEVELAND1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 398, "api_path": "/songs/5380202", "artist_names": "Genius Qu\u00e9bec", "full_title": "Discographie 2020 \u2014 Pop & Rock by\u00a0Genius\u00a0Qu\u00e9bec", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e62cd130cbf4d8f876028dd429d7c652.300x300x1.png", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e62cd130cbf4d8f876028dd429d7c652.300x300x1.png", "id": 5380202, "instrumental": false, "language": "fr", "lyrics_owner_id": 1201983, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1659878814, "path": "/Genius-quebec-discographie-2020-pop-and-rock-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Genius-quebec-discographie-2020-pop-and-rock-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2020, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "2020", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "2020", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/e62cd130cbf4d8f876028dd429d7c652.300x300x1.png", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e62cd130cbf4d8f876028dd429d7c652.300x300x1.png", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false}, "title": "Discographie 2020 \u2014 Pop & Rock", "title_with_featured": "Discographie 2020 \u2014 Pop & Rock", "updated_by_human_at": 1667023322, "url": "https://genius.com/Genius-quebec-discographie-2020-pop-and-rock-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/2699408", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e62cd130cbf4d8f876028dd429d7c652.300x300x1.png", "id": 2699408, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e62cd130cbf4d8f876028dd429d7c652.300x300x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Genius Qu\u00e9bec", "slug": "Genius-quebec", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Genius-quebec"}, "artist": "Genius Qu\u00e9bec", "lyrics": "Discographie 2020 \u2014 Pop & Rock LyricsCalendrier 2020JANF\u00c9VMARAVRMAIJUNJULAO\u00dbSEPOCTNOVD\u00c9CJanvier\n* 03/01 : Blackguard -

your eyes, I can't deny\nThen there's me inside a sinking boat, runnin' out of time\nWithout you, I'll never make it out alive\nBut I know, yes, I know we'll be alright\nThere's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me\nAnd every time I turn around, it's only gaining speed\nThere's a moment when you finally realise\nThere's no way you can change the rolling tide\nBut I know, yes, I know that I'll be fine\n[Chorus: All]\nThis time, I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)\nEscape from the city and follow the Sun\n'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?\nI don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night\nThis time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)\nWherever you are is the place I belong\n'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young\nI will never look back, now I'm ready to run\n\n[Post-Chorus: All, Harry]\nOoh-ooh-ooh\nI'm ready to run\nOoh-ooh-ooh\n\n[Verse 2: Niall, Louis]\nThere's a future in my life I can't foresee\nUnless, of course, I stay on course and keep you next to me\nThere will always be the kind that criticize\nBut I know, yes, I know we'll be alright\n\n[Chorus: All]\nThis time, I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)\nEscape from the city and follow the Sun\n'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?\nI don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night\nThis time I'm ready to run (Oh-oh)\nWherever you are is the place I belong\n'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young\nI will never look back, now I'm ready to run\nYou might also like[Bridge: Zayn, All]\nThis time, I'm ready to run (Ready to run)\nI'd give everything that I've got for your love\n\n[Chorus: Harry, All, Zayn]\nThis time, I'm ready to run\nEscape from the city and follow the Sun\n'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine?\nI don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night\nThis time I'm ready to run (This time I'm ready to run)\nWherever you are is the place I belong\n'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young\nI will never look back, now I'm ready to run55Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

yeah, yeah) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\n\n[Chorus]\nTwo bottles of Bud\nTwo speakers in the trunk\nTwo people in love\nJust bumpin' the night\nTwo crazy hearts\nLooking in the dark for a place to park it to their life\nFind an old school way-and-bee\nAnd put a little shine on the bottle seat\nTwo bottles of Bud\nTwo speakers in the trunk\nTwo people in love\nJust bumpin' the night\n[Verse 2]\nThe night is young, the night is free, and so are we\nSo let it out and let me stay inside your drink\nLipstick all along\nNext sipping star lie on the window tripping down\nOff in the distance the lights of town\nCan you see it now?\n\n[Chorus]\nTwo bottles of Bud\nTwo speakers in the trunk\nTwo people in love\nJust bumpin' the night\nTwo crazy hearts\nLooking in the dark for a place to park it to

slowly let them shut\nFor they're designed to be together, oh\nWith your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one\nAnd we're set alight, we're afire love\nOh love\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd things were all good yesterday\nBut then the devil took your breath away\nAnd now, we're left here in the pain\nBlack suit, black tie, standing in the rain\nAnd now, my family is one again\nStapled together with

16 - Eumaeus) LyricsPreparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion, which he very badly needed. His (Stephen's) mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom, in view of the hour it was and there being no pumps of Vartry water available for their ablutions, let alone drinking purposes, hit upon an expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabman's shelter, as it was called, hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt Bridge, where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral. But how to get there was the rub. For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned. So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition, both of them being e. d. ed, particularly Stephen, always assuming that there was such a thing to be found. Accordingly, after a few such preliminaries, as, in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line, brushing, they both walked together along Beaver street, or, more properly, lane, as far as the farrier's and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens Street round by the corner of Dan Bergin's. But, as he confidently anticipated, there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler, probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree, outside the North Star Hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom, who was anything but a professional whistler, endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle, holding his arms arched over his head, twice.\n\nThis was a quandary but, bringing commonsense to bear on it, evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did. So, bevelling around by Mullet's and the Signal House, which they shortly reached, they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus, Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had, to vary the timehonoured adage, gone the way of all buttons, though, entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing, he heroically made light of the mischance. So, as neither of them were particularly pressed for time, as it happened, and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius, they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey. As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company's sandstrewer happening to be returning the elder man recounted to his companion \u00e0 propos of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back. They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station, the starting point for Belfast, where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour, and, passing the back door of the morgue (a not very enticing locality, not to say gruesome to a degree, more especially at night), ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street, famous for its C division police station. Between this point and the high, at present unlit, warehouses of Beresford Place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen, associated with Baird's, the stonecutter's, in his mind somehow in Talbot Place, first turning on the right, while the other, who was acting as his fidus Achates, inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke's city bakery, situated quite close to where they were, the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread, of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable. Bread, the staff of life, earn your bread, O tell me where is fancy bread? At Rourke's the baker's, it is said.\n\nEn route, to his taciturn, and, not to put too fine a point on it, not yet perfectly sober companion, Mr Bloom, who at all events, was in complete possession of his faculties, never more so, in fact disgustingly sober, spoke a word of caution re the dangers of nighttown, women of ill fame and swell mobsmen, which, barely permissible once in a while, though not as a habitual practice, was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little juijitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn't look out. Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious that, but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour, the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward, or, failing that, the Bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias, or, he being the solicitor, rather old Wall, he meant to say, or Malony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about. The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen, whom he cordially disliked, were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and, as Mr Bloom put it, recalling a case or two in the A Division in Clanbrassil street, prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot. Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the City, Pembroke Road, for example, the guardians of the law were well in evidence, the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes. Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description, liable to go off at any time, which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall nut over anything. You frittered away your time, he very sensibly maintained, and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing, fast women of the demimonde ran away with a lot of #. s. d. into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though, touching the much vexed question of stimulants, he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and blood-making and possessing aperient virtues (notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in) still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically. Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting confr\u00e8res but one, a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs.\n\n\u2014And that one was Judas, said Stephen, who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind.\n\nDiscussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge when a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox, or something like one, attracted their rather lagging footsteps. Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox. He began to remember that this had happened, or had been mentioned as having happened, before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a quondam friend of his father's Gumley. To avoid a meeting be drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge.\n\n\u2014Someone saluted you, Mr Bloom said.\nA figure of middle height on the prowl, evidently, under the arches saluted again, calling: Night! Stephen, of course, started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment. Mr Bloom, actuated by motives of inherent delicacy, inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business, moved off but nevertheless remained on the qui vive with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least. Although unusual in the Dublin area, he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be about waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper, famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moments notice, your money or your life, leaving you there to point a moral, gagged and garotted.\n\nStephen, that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters, though he was not in any over sober state himself, recognised Corley's breath redolent of rotten cornjuice. Lord John Corley, some called him, and his genealogy came about in this wise. He was the eldest son of Inspector Corley of the G Division, lately deceased, who had married a certain Katherine Brophy, the daughter of a Louth farmer. His grandfather, Patrick Michael Corley, of New Ross, had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine (also) Talbot. Rumour had it, though not proved, that she descended from the house of the Lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion, really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing, his mother or aunt or some relative had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen. This, therefore, was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley.\n\nTaking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell. Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night's lodgings. His friends had all deserted him. Furthermore, he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of other uncalled-for expressions. He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God's earth he could get something, anything at all to do. No, it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way, both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn't a complete fabrication from start to finish. Anyhow, he was ill in.\n\n\u2014I wouldn't ask you, only, pursued he, on my solemn oath and God knows I'm on the rocks.\n\n\u2014There'll be a job tomorrow or the next day, Stephen told him, in a boys' school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher. Mr Garret Deasy. Try it. You may mention my name.\n\n\u2014Ah, God, Corley replied, sure I couldn't teach in a school, man. I was never one of your bright ones, he added with a half laugh. Got stuck twice in the junior at the Christian Brothers.\n\n\u2014I have no place to sleep myself, Stephen informed him.\n\nCorley, at the first go-off, was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street. There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street, Mrs Maloney's, but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M'Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street (which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon) for a bob. He was starving too though he hadn't said a word about it.\n\nThough this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen's feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley's brandnew rigmarole, on a par with the others, was hardly deserving of much credence. However, haud ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco, etcetera, as the Latin poet remarks, especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished. But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it Out of Corley's head that he was living in affluence and hadn't a thing to do but hand out the needful - whereas. He put his hand in a pocket anyhow, not with the idea of finding any food there, but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat. But the result was in the negative for, to his chagrin, he found his cash missing. A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation. He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost, as well he might have, or left, because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout, very much the reverse, in fact. He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect about biscuits he dimly remembered. Who now exactly gave them, or where was, or did he buy? However, in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies, erroneously, however, as it turned out.\n\n\u2014Those are halfcrowns, man, Corley corrected him.\n\nAnd so in point of fact they turned out to be. Stephen lent him one of them.\n\n\u2014Thanks, Corley answered. You're a gentleman. I'll pay you back some time. Who's that with you? I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker. You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there. I'd carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they're full up for the next three weeks, man. God, you've to book ahead, man, you'd think it was for the Carl Rosa. I don't give a shite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeper.\n\nSubsequently, being not quite so down in the mouth after the two-and-six he got, he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam's, the shipchandler's bookkeeper there, that used to be often round in Nagle's back with O'Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe. Anyhow, he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable.\nMr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman's sentrybox, who, evidently a glutton for work, it struck him, was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept. He threw an odd eye at the same time now and then at Stephen's anything but immaculately attired interlocutor as if he had seen that nobleman somewhere or other though where he was not in a position to truthfully state nor had he the remotest idea when. Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation, he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally, testifying to a chronic impecuniosity. Probably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his next door neighbour all round, in every deep, so to put it, a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude, with or without the option of a fine, would be a very rara avis altogether. In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning. Pretty thick that was certainly.\n\nThe pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom, who, with his practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite. Alluding to the encounter he said, laughingly, Stephen, that is:\n\n\u2014He's down on his luck. He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.\n\nAt this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucket dredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana, moored alongside Customhouse Quay and quite possibly Out of repair, whereupon he observed evasively:\n\n\u2014Everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. Now you mention it his face was familiar to me. But leaving that for the moment, how much did you part with, he queried, if I am not too inquisitive?\n\n\u2014Half-a-crown, Stephen responded. I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere.\n\n\u2014Needs, Mr Bloom ejaculated, professing not the least surprise at the intelligence, I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does. Everyone according to his needs and everyone according to his deeds. But talking about things in general, where, added he with a smile, will you sleep yourself? Walking to Sandycove is Out of the question and, even supposing you did, you won't get in after what occurred at Westland Row station. Simply fag out there for nothing. I don't mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father's house?\n\n\u2014To seek misfortune, was Stephen's answer.\n\n\u2014I met your respected father on a recent occasion, Mr Bloom diplomatically returned. Today, in fact, or, to be strictly accurate, on yesterday. Where does he live at present? I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved.\n\n\u2014I believe he is in Dublin somewhere, Stephen answered unconcernedly. Why?\n\n\u2014A gifted man, Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior, in more respects than one and a born raconteur if ever there was one. He takes great pride, quite legitimately, Out of you. You could go back, perhaps, he hazarded, still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two, Mulligan, that is, and that English tourist friend of his, who eventually euchred their third companion, were patently trying, as if the whole bally station belonged to them, to give Stephen the slip in the confusion.\n\nThere was no response forthcoming to the suggestion, however, such as it was, Stephen's mind's eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it, with his sister, Dilly, sitting by the ingle, her hair hanging down, waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmeal water for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny, with an egg apiece for Maggy, Boody and Katey, the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded, it being quarter tense or, if not, ember days or something like that.\n\n\u2014No, Mr Bloom repeated again, I wouldn't personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element, Dr Mulligan, as a guide, philosopher, and friend, if I were in your shoes. He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals. Of course you didn't notice as much as I did but it wouldn't occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object.\nHe understood, however, from all he heard, that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man, by no means confined to medicine only, who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and, if the report was verified, bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries, or Malahide was it? was, he was bound to admit, an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise, so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy, pure and simple.\n\n\u2014Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains, he ventured to throw out.\n\nThe guarded glance of half solicitude, half curiosity, augmented by friendliness, which he gave at Stephen's at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light, none at all in fact, on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled, to judge by two or three low spirited remarks he let drop, or, the other way about, saw through the affair, and, for some reason or other best known to himself, allowed matters to more or less... Grinding poverty did have that effect and he more than conjectured that, high educational abilities though he possessed, he experienced no little difficulty in making both ends meet.\n\nAdjacent to the men's public urinal he perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way, there being some little differences between the parties.\n\n\u2014Putana madonna, che ci dia i quattrini! Ho ragione? Culo rotto!\n\n\u2014Intendiamoci. Mezzo sovrano pi\u00f9\n\n\u2014Dice lui, pero.\n\n\u2014Farabutto! Mortacci sui!\n\nMr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman's shelter, an unpretentious wooden structure, where, prior to then, he had rarely, if ever, been before; the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it, said to be the once famous Skin-the-Goat, Fitzharris, the invincible, though he wouldn't vouch for the actual facts, which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in. A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner, only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus homo, already there engaged in eating and drinking, diversified by conversation, for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity.\n\n\u2014Now touching a cup of coffee, Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice, it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food, say a roll of some description.\n\nAccordingly his first act was with characteristic sangfroid to order these commodities quietly. The hoi polloi of jarvies or stevedores, or whatever they were, after a cursory examination, turned their eyes, apparently dissatisfied, away, though one redbearded bibulous individual, a portion of whose hair was greyish, a sailor, probably, still stared for some appreciable time before transferring his rapt attention to the floor.\n\nMr Bloom, availing himself of the right of free speech, he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though, to be sure, rather in a quandary over voglio, remarked to his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in an audible tone of voice, apropos of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious:\n\n\u2014Beautiful language. I mean for singing purposes. Why do you not write your poetry in that language? Bella Poetria! it is so melodious and full. Belladonna voglio.\n\nStephen, who was trying his dead best to yawn, if he could, suffering from dead lassitude generally, replied:\n\n\u2014To fill the ear of a cow elephant. They were haggling over money.\n\n\u2014Is that so? Mr Bloom asked. Of course, he subjoined pensively, at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary, it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it.\n\nThe keeper of the shelter in the middle of this t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate put a boiling swimming cup of a choice concoction labelled coffee on the table and a rather antediluvian specimen of a bun, or so it seemed, after which he beat a retreat to his counter. Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to... for which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him.\n\n\u2014Sounds are impostures, Stephen said after a pause of some little time. Like names, Cicero, Podmore, Napoleon, Mr Goodbody, Jesus, Mr Doyle. Shakespeares were as common as Murphies. What's in a name?\n\n\u2014Yes, to be sure, Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred. Of course. Our name was changed too, he added, pushing the socalled roll across.\n\nThe redbearded sailor, who had his weather eye on the newcomers, boarded Stephen, whom he had singled out for attention in particular, squarely by asking:\n\n\u2014And what might your name be?\n\nJust in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion's boot but Stephen, apparently disregarding the warm pressure, from an unexpected quarter, answered:\n\n\u2014Dedalus.\n\nThe sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes, rather bunged up from excessive use of boose, preferably good old Hollands and water.\n\n\u2014You know Simon Dedalus? he asked at length.\n\n\u2014I've heard of him, Stephen said.\n\nMr Bloom was all at sea for a moment, seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too.\n\n\u2014He's Irish, the seaman bold affirmed, staring still in much the same way and nodding. All Irish.\n\n\u2014All too Irish, Stephen rejoined.\n\nAs for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor, of his own accord, turned to the other Occupants of the shelter with the remark: I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder. The left hand dead shot.\n\nThough he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain.\n\n\u2014Bottle Out there, say. Fifty yards measured. Eggs on the bottles. Cocks his gun over his shoulder. Aims.\n\nHe turned his body half round, shut up his right eye completely, then he screwed his features up some way sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance.\n\n\u2014Pom, he then shouted once.\n\nThe entire audience waited, anticipating an additional detonation, there being still a further egg.\n\n\u2014Pom, he shouted twice.\n\nEgg two evidently demolished, he nodded and winked, adding bloodthirstily:\n\nBuffalo Bill shoots to kill,\nNever missed nor he never will.\n\nA silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness' sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley.\n\n\u2014Beg pardon, the sailor said.\n\n\u2014Long ago? Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor replied, relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond, it might be a matter of ten years. He toured the wide world with Hengler's Royal Circus. I seen him do that in Stockholm.\n\n\u2014Curious coincidence, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively.\n\n\u2014Murphy's my name, the sailor continued, W. B. Murphy, of Carrigaloe. Know where that is?\n\n\u2014Queenstown Harbour, Stephen replied.\n\n\u2014That's right, the sailor said. Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle. That's where I hails from. My little woman's down there. She's waiting for me, I know. For England, home and beauty. She's my own true wife I haven't seen for seven years now, sailing about.\n\nMr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene - the homecoming to the mariner's roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones - a rainy night with a blind moon. Across the world for a wife. Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic, Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O'Leary, a favourite and most trying declamation piece, by the way, of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way? Never about the runaway wife coming back, however much devoted to the absentee. The face at the window! Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half, wrecked in his affections. You little expected me but I've come to stay and make a fresh start. There she sits, a grass widow, at the selfsame fireside. Believes me dead. Rocked in the cradle of the deep. And there sits uncle Chubb or Tomkin, as the case might be, the publican of the Crown and Anchor, in shirtsleeves, eating rumpsteak and onions. No chair for father. Boo! The wind! Her brandnew arrival is on her knee, post mortem child. With a high ro! and a randy ro! and my galloping tearing tandy O! Bow to the inevitable. Grin and bear it. I remain with much love your brokenhearted husband, W. B. Murphy.\n\nThe sailor, who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident, turned to one of the jarvies with the request:\n\n\u2014You don't happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you, do you?\n\nThe jarvey addressed, as it happened, had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand.\n\n\u2014Thank you, the sailor said.\n\nHe deposited the quid in his gob and, chewing, and with some slow stammers, proceeded:\n\n\u2014We come up this morning eleven o'clock. The threemaster Rosevean from Bridgwater with bricks. I shipped to get over. Paid off this afternoon. There's my discharge. See? W. B. Murphy, A. B. S.\n\nIn confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbours a not very clean looking folded document.\n\n\u2014You must have seen a fair share of the world, the keeper remarked, leaning on the counter.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor answered, upon reflection upon it, I've circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on. I was in the Red Sea. I was in China and North America and South America. I seen icebergs plenty, growlers. I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea, the Dardanelles, under Captain Dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship. I seen Russia. Gospodi pomilooy. That's how the Russians prays.\n\n\u2014You seen queer sights, don't be talking, put in a jarvey.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor said, shifting his partially chewed plug, I seen queer things too, ups and downs. I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid.\n\nHe took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and, lodging it between his teeth, bit ferociously.\n\n\u2014Khaan! Like that. And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses. Look here. Here they are. A friend of mine sent me.\n\nHe fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket, which seemed to be in its way a species of repository, and pushed it along the table. The printed matter on it stated: Choza de Indios. Beni, Bolivia.\n\nAll focused their attention on the scene exhibited, at a group of savage women in striped loincloths, squatted, blinking, suckling, frowning, sleeping, amid a swarm of infants (there must have been quite a score of them) outside some primitive shanties of osier.\n\n\u2014Chews coca all day long, the communicative tarpaulin added. Stomachs like breadgraters. Cuts off their diddies when they can't bear no more children. See them there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse's liver raw.\n\nHis postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes, if not more.\n\n\u2014Know how to keep them off? he inquired genially.\n\nNobody volunteering a statement, he winked, saying:\n\n\u2014Glass. That boggles 'em. Glass.\n\nMr Bloom, without evincing surprise, unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark. It ran as follows: Tarjeta Postal. Se\u00f1or A. Boudin, Galeria Becche, Santiago, Chile. There was no message evidently, as he took particular notice. Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated (or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo-Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in Maritana on which occasion the former's ball passed through the latter's hat), having detected a discrepancy between his name (assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q.t. somewhere) and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend's bona fides, nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London via long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest. Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through. But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd's heart it was not so dear, purse permitting, a few guineas at the outside, considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back. The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable, especially for a chap whose liver was out of order, seeing the different places along the route, Plymouth, Falmouth, Southampton and so on, culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis, the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower, abbey, wealth of Park Lane to renew acquaintance with. Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts, Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas, Eastbourne, Scarborough, Margate and so on, beautiful Bournemouth, the Channel islands and similar bijou spots, which might prove highly remunerative. Not, of course, with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job, witness Mrs C. P. M'Coy type - lend me your valise and I'll post you the ticket. No, something top notch, an all star Irish cast, the Tweedy-Flower grand opera company with its own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody-Manners, perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success, providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure. But who? That was the rub.\n\nAlso, without being actually positive, it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times apropos of the Fishguard-Rosslare route which, it was mooted, was once more on the tapis in the Circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally. A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large, the average man, i.e. Brown, Robinson and Co.\n\nIt was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street, when the system really needed toning up, for a matter of a couple of paltry pounds, was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always cooped up since my old stick-in-the-mud took me for a wife. After all, hang it, they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of venue after the grind of city life in the summertime, for choice, when Dame Nature is at her spectacular best, constituting nothing short of a new lease of life. There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island, delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation, offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs, even, Poulaphouca, to which there was a steam tram, but also farther away from the madding crowd, in Wicklow, rightly termed the garden of Ireland, an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen, so long as it didn't come down, and in the wilds of Donegal, where if report spoke true, the coup d'oeil was exceedingly grand, though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it, while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise, Silken Thomas, Grace O'Malley, George IV, rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men, especially in the spring when young men s fancy, though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally, usually, by the way, on their left leg, it being only about three quarters of an hour's run from the pillar. Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy, so to speak, and the accommodation left much to be desired. Interesting to fathom, it seemed to him, from a motive of curiosity pure and simple, was whether it was the traffic that created the route or vice-versa or the two sides in fact. He turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to Stephen.\n\n\u2014I seen a Chinese one time, related the doughty narrator, that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened, and every pill was something different. One was a ship, another was a house, another was a flower. Cooks rats in your soup, he appetisingly added, the Chinese does.\n\nPossibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces, the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures.\n\n\u2014And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap. Knife in his back. Knife like that.\n\nWhilst speaking he produced a dangerous looking clasp knife, quite in keeping with his character, and held it in the striking position.\n\n\u2014In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers. Fellow hid behind a door, come up behind him. Like that. Prepare to meet your God, says he. Chuck! It went into his back up to the butt.\n\nHis heavy glance, drowsily roaming about, kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to. That's a good bit of steel, repeated he, examining his formidable stiletto.\n\nAfter which harrowing d\u00e9nouement sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors, otherwise pocket.\n\n\u2014They're great for the cold steel, somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all. That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives.\n\nAt this remark, passed obviously in the spirit of where ignorance is bliss, Mr Bloom and Stephen, each in his own particular way, both instinctively exchanged meaning glances, in a religious silence of the strictly entre nous variety however, towards where Skin-the-Goat, alias the keeper, was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair. His inscrutable face, which was really a work of art, a perfect study in itself, beggaring description, conveyed the impression that he didn't understand one jot of what was going on. Funny very.\n\nThere ensued a somewhat lengthy pause. One man was reading by fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal; another, the card with the natives choza de; another, the seaman's discharge. Mr Bloom, so far as he was personally concerned, was just pondering in pensive mood. He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday, some score of years previously, in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm, figuratively speaking, early in the eighties, eightyone to be correct, when he was just turned fifteen.\n\n\u2014Ay, boss, the sailor broke in. Give us back them papers.\n\nThe request being complied with, he clawed them up with a scrape.\n\n\u2014Have you seen the Rock of Gibraltar? Mr Bloom inquired.\n\nThe sailor grimaced, chewing, in a way that might be read as yes, ay, or no.\n\n\u2014Ah, you've touched there too, Mr Bloom said, Europa point, thinking he had, in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so, simply letting spurt a jet of spew into the sawdust, and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn.\n\n\u2014What year would that be about? Mr Bloom interpolated. Can you recall the boats?\n\nOur soi-disant sailor munched heavily awhile, hungrily, before answering.\n\n\u2014I'm tired of all them rocks in the sea, he said, and boats and ships. Salt junk all the time.\n\nTired, seemingly, he ceased. His questioner, perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer, fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe. Suffice it to say that, as a casual glance at the map revealed, it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant, to rule the waves. On more than one occasion - a dozen at the lowest - near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt, evidently derelict, seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall, staring quite obliviously at it and it at him, dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings. And it left him wondering why. Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself, floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under - well, not exactly under, tempting the fates. And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all. Nevertheless, without going into the minutiae of the business, the eloquent fact remained that the sea was there in all its glory and in the natural course of things somebody or other had to sail on it and fly in the face of providence though it merely went to show how people usually contrived to load that sort of onus on to the other fellow like the hell idea and the lottery and insurance, which were run on identically the same lines so that for that very reason, if no other, lifeboat Sunday was a very laudable institution to which the public at large, no matter where living, inland or seaside,-is the case might be, having it brought home to them like that, should extend its gratitude also to the harbourmasters and coastguard service who had to man the rigging and push off and out amid the elements, whatever the season, when duty called Ireland expects that every man and so on, and sometimes had a terrible time of it in the wintertime not forgetting the Irish lights, Kish and others, liable to capsize at any moment rounding which he once with his daughter had experienced some remarkably choppy, not to say stormy, weather.\n\n\u2014There was a fellow sailed with me in the Rover, the old seadog, himself a rover, proceeded. Went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman's valet at six quid a month. Them are his trousers I've on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife. I'm game for that job, shaving and brushup. I hate roaming about. There's my son now, Danny, run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper's in Cork where he could be drawing easy money.\n\n\u2014What age is he? queried one hearer who, by the way, seen from the side, bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell, the townclerk, away from the carking cares of office, unwashed, of course, and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage.\n\n\u2014Why, the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance. My son Danny? He'd be about eighteen now, way I figure it.\n\nThe Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink, intended to represent an anchor.\n\n\u2014There was lice in that bunk in Bridgwater, he remarked. Sure as nuts. I must get a wash tomorrow or next day. It's them black lads I objects to. I hate those buggers. Sucks your blood dry, they does.\n\nSeeing they were all looking at his chest, he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that, on top of the time honoured symbol of the mariner's hope and rest, they had a full view of the figure 16 and a young man's sideface looking frowningly rather.\n\n\u2014Tattoo, the exhibitor explained. That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton Fellow the name of Antonio done that. There he is himself, a Greek.\n\n\u2014Did it hurt much doing it? one asked the sailor.\n\nThat worthy, however, was busily engaged in collecting round the someway in his. Squeezing or...\n\n\u2014See here, he said, showing Antonio. There he is, cursing the mate. And there he is now, he added. The same fellow, pulling the skin with his fingers, some special knack evidently, and he laughing at a yarn.\n\nAnd in point of fact the young man named Antonio's livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody, including Skin-the-Goat who this time stretched over.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, sighed the sailor, looking down on his manly chest. He's gone too. Ate by sharks after. Ay, ay.\n\nHe let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before.\n\n\u2014Neat bit of work, longshoreman one said.\n\n\u2014And what's the number for? loafer number two queried.\n\n\u2014Eaten alive? a third asked the sailor.\n\n\u2014Ay, ay, sighed again the latter personage, more cheerily this time, with some sort of a half smile, for a brief duration only, in the direction of the questioner about the number. A Greek he was.\n\nAnd then he added, with rather gallowsbird humour, considering his alleged end:\n\n\u2014As bad as old Antonio,\nFor he left me on my ownio.\n\nThe face of a streetwalker, glazed and haggard under a black straw hat, peered askew round the door of the shelter, palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill. Mr Bloom, scarcely knowing which way to look, turned away on the moment, flusterfied but outwardly calm, and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey, if such he was, had laid aside, he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink? His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond Quay, the partially idiotic female, namely, of the lane, who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you (Mrs B.), and begged the chance of his washing. Also why washing, which seemed rather vague than not?\n\nYour washing. Still, candour compelled him to admit that he had washed his wife's undergarments when soiled in Holles Street and women would and did too a man's similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper's marking ink (hers were, that is) if they really loved him, that is to say. Love me, love my dirty shirt. Still, just then, being on tenterhooks, he desired the female's room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off. Round the side of the Evening Telegraph he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there, viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round Skipper Murphy's nautical chest and then there was no more of her.\n\n\u2014The gunboat, the keeper said.\n\n\u2014It beats me, Mr Bloom confided to Stephen, medically I am speaking, how a wretched creature like that from the Lock Hospital, reeking with disease, can be barefaced enough to solicit or how any man in his sober senses, if he values his health in the least. Unfortunate creature! Of course, I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition. Still no matter what the cause is from...\n\nStephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders, merely remarking:\n\n\u2014In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade. Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul. She is a bad merchant. She buys dear and sells cheap.\n\nThe elder man, though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude, said that it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to instanter to say that women of that stamp (quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject), a necessary evil, were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities, a thing he could truthfully state he, as a paterfamilias, was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start. Whoever embarked on a policy of that sort, he said, and ventilated the matter thoroughly would confer a lasting boon on everybody concerned.\n\n\u2014 You, as a good catholic, he observed, talking of body and soul, believe in the soul. Or do you mean the intelligence, the brainpower as such, as distinct from any outside object, the table, let us say, that cup? I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter. Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays, for instance. Do you?\n\nThus cornered, Stephen had to make a superhuman effort of memory to try and concentrate and remember before he could say:\n\n\u2014They tell me on the best authority it is a simple substance and therefore incorruptible. It would be immortal, I understand, but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause, Who, from all I can hear, is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes, corruptio per se and corruptio per accidens both being excluded by court etiquette.\n\nMr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple, promptly rejoining:\n\n\u2014Simple? I shouldn't think that is the proper word. Of course, I grant you, to concede a point, you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon. But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays R\u00f6ntgen did, Or the telescope like Edison, though I believe it was before his time, Galileo was the man I mean. The same applies to the laws, for example, of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it's a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God.\n\n\u2014O, that, Stephen expostulated, has been proved conclusively by several of the best known passages in Holy Writ, apart from circumstantial evidence. On this knotty point, however, the views of the pair, poles apart as they were, both in schooling and everything else, with the marked difference in their respective ages, clashed.\n\n\u2014Has been? the more experienced of the two objected, sticking to his original point. I'm not so sure about that. That's a matter of every man's opinion and, without dragging in the sectarian side of the business, I beg to differ with you in toto there. My belief is, to tell you the candid truth, that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it's the big question of our national poet over again, who precisely wrote them, like Hamlet and Bacon, as you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I, of course I needn't tell you. Can't you drink that coffee, by the way? Let me stir it and take a piece of that bun. It's like one of our skipper's bricks disguised. Still, no one can give what he hasn't got. Try a bit.\n\n\u2014Couldn't, Stephen contrived to get out, his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further.\n\nFaultfinding being a proverbially bad hat, Mr Bloom thought well to stir, or try to, the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance (and lucrative) work. To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good. Shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night, concerts, dramatic evenings, and useful lectures (admittance free) by qualified men for the lower orders. On the other hand, he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time, a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying. The idea, he was strongly inclined to believe, was to do good and net a profit, there being no competition to speak of. Sulphate of copper poison, SO4 or something in some dried peas he remembered reading of in a cheap eatinghouse somewhere but he couldn't remember when it was or where. Anyhow, inspection, medical inspection, of all eatables, seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble's Vi-Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved.\n\n\u2014Have a shot at it now, he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred.\n\nThus prevailed on to at any rate taste it, Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle - it clopped out of it when taken up - by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage.\n\n\u2014Still, it's solid food, his good genius urged, I'm a stickler for solid food, his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the sine qua non for any kind of proper work, mental or manual. You ought to eat more solid food. You would feel a different man.\n\n\u2014Liquids I can eat, Stephen said. But oblige me by taking away that knife. I can't look at the point of it. It reminds me of Roman history.\n\nMr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article, a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye, observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it.\n\n\u2014Our mutual friend's stories are like himself, Mr Bloom, apropos of knives, remarked to his confidente sotto voce. Do you think they are genuine? He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots. Look at him.\n\nYet still, though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air, life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel.\n\nHe had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up, ever since he clapped eyes on him. Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina, if a trifle prone to baldness, there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity. He might even have done for his man, supposing it was his own case he told, as people often did about others, namely, that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage (no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen Of our national poet) who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described. On the other hand he might be only bluffing, a pardonable weakness, because meeting unmistakable mugs, Dublin residents, like those jarvies waiting news from abroad, would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner Hesperus and etcetera. And when all was said and done, the lies a fellow told about himself couldn't probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him.\n\nMind you, I'm not saying that it's all a pure invention, he resumed. Analogous scenes are occasionally, if not often, met with. Giants, though, that is rather a far cry you see once in a way. Marcella, the midget queen. In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs, as they are called, sitting bowlegged. They couldn't straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here, you see, he proceeded, indicating on his companion the brief outline, the sinews, or whatever you like to call them, behind the right knee, were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up, being adored as gods. There's an example again of simple souls.\n\nHowever, reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures (who reminded him a bit of Ludwig, alias Ledwidge, when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the Flying Dutchman, a stupendous success, and his host of admirers came in large numbers, everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort, phantom or the reverse, on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains), there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it, he conceded. On the contrary, that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those Italianos, though candidly he was none the less free to admit those ice creamers and friers in the fish way, not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth, over in little Italy there, near the Coombe, were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuck in with garlic de rigueur off him or her next day on the quiet and, he added, on the cheap.\n\n\u2014Spaniards, for instance, he continued, passionate temperaments like that, impetuous as Old Nick, are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus double quick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen. It comes from the great heat, climate generally. My wife is, so to speak, Spanish, half, that is. Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted, having been born in (technically) Spain, i.e. Gibraltar. She has the Spanish type. Quite dark, regular brunette, black. I, for one, certainly believe climate accounts for character. That's why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian.\n\n\u2014The temperaments at the door, Stephen interposed with, were very passionate about ten shillings. Roberto ruba roba sua.\n\n\u2014Quite so, Mr Bloom dittoed.\n\n\u2014Then, Stephen said, staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere, we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle, Miss Portinari, he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino.\n\n\u2014It's in the blood, Mr Bloom acceded at once. All are washed in the blood of the sun. Coincidence, I just happened to be in the Kildare street Museum today, shortly prior to our meeting, if I can so call it, and I was just looking at those antique statues there. The splendid proportions of hips, bosom. You simply don't knock against those kind of women here. An exception here and there. Handsome, yes, pretty in a way you find, but what I'm talking about is the female form. Besides, they have so little taste in dress, most of them, which greatly enhances a woman's natural beauty, no matter what you say. Rumpled stockings - it may be, possibly is, a foible of mine, but still it's a thing I simply hate to see.\n\nInterest, however, was starting to flag somewhat all round and the others got on to talking about accidents at sea, ships lost in a fog, collisions with icebergs, all that sort of thing. Shipahoy, of course, had his own say to say. He had doubled the Cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon, a kind of wind, in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing, he declared, stood to him, or words to that effect, a pious medal he had that saved him.\n\nSo then after that they drifted on to the wreck of Daunt's rock, wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque - nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it, Palme, on Booterstown Strand, that was the talk of the town that year (Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish Times) breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror. Then someone said something about the case of the s. s. Lady Cairns of Swansea, run into by the Mona, which was on an Opposite tack, in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck. No aid was given. Her master, the Mona's, said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way. She had no water, it appears, in her hold.\n\nAt this stage an incident happened. It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef, the sailor vacated his seat.\n\n\u2014Let me cross your bows, mate, he said to his neighbour, who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful dose.\n\nHe made tracks heavily, slowly, with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door, stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left. While he was in the act of getting his bearings, Mr Bloom, who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship's rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior, saw him produce a bottle and uncork it, or unscrew, and, applying its nozzle to his lips, take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise. The irrepressible Bloom, who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manoeuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female, who, however, had disappeared to all intents and purposes, could, by straining, just perceive him, when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit, gazing up at the piers and girders of the Loop Line, rather out of his depth, as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved. Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but, after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme, the sailor, evidently giving it a wide berth, eased himself close at hand, the noise of his bilge-water some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently woke a horse of the cabrank.\n\nA hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled. Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brasier of live coke, the watcher of the corporation, who, though now broken down and fast breaking up, was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid, now practically on the parish rates, given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability, from dictates of humanity, knowing him before - shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in the arms of Morpheus. A truly amazing piece of hard times in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool #100 a year at one time which of course the double-barrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of. And there he was at the end of his tether after having often painted the town tolerably pink, without a beggarly stiver. He drank, needless to be told, and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if - a big if, however - he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality.\n\nAll, meantime, were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping, coastwise and foreign as well, which was all part and parcel of the same thing. A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra Basin, the only launch that year. Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called.\n\nThere were wrecks and wrecks, the keeper said, who was evidently au fait.\n\nWhat he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway Bay when the Galway Harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that, eh? Ask her captain, he advised them, how much palmoil the British Government gave him for that day's work. Captain John Lever of the Lever line.\n\n\u2014Am I right, skipper? he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions.\n\nThat worthy, picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words, growled in wouldbe music, but with great vim, some Kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds. Mr Bloom's sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably (which it was), so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question. Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation-cum-potation, introducing an atmosphere of drink into the soir\u00e9e, boisterously trolling, like a veritable son of a seacook:\n\n\u2014The biscuits was as hard as brass,\nAnd the beef as salt as Lot's wife's arse.\nO Johnny Lever!\nJohnny Lever, O!\n\nAfter which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and, regaining his seat, he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided.\n\nSkin-the-Goat, assuming he was he, evidently with an axe to grind, was airing his grievances in a forcible-feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland, or something of that sort, which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God's earth, far and away superior to England, with coal in large quantities, six million pounds' worth of pork exported every year, ten millions between butter and eggs, and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always, and gobbling up the best meat in the market, and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein. Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact. You could grow any mortal thing in Irish soil, he stated, and there was Colonel Everard down there in Cavan growing tobacco. Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon? But a day of reckoning, he stated crescendo with no uncertain voice - thoroughly monopolising all the conversation - was in store for mighty England, despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes. There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history. The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin, he affirmed. The Boers were the beginning of the end. Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland, her Achilles heel, which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles, the Greek hero - a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot. His advice to every Irishman was: stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland. Ireland, Parnell said, could not spare a single one of her sons.\n\nSilence all round marked the termination of his finale. The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed.\n\n\u2014Take a bit of doing, boss, retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism.\n\nTo which cold douche, referring to downfall and so on, the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view.\n\n\u2014Who's the best troops in the army? the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated. And the best jumpers and racers? And the best admirals and generals we've got? Tell me that.\n\n\u2014The Irish for choice, retorted the cabby like Campbell, facial blemishes apart.\n\n\u2014That's right, the old tarpaulin corroborated. The Irish catholic peasant. He's the backbone of our empire. You know Jem Mullins?\n\nWhile allowing him his individual opinions, as every man, the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire, ours or his, and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it. Then they began to have a few irascible words, when it waxed hotter, both, needless to say, appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn't indulge in recriminations and come to blows.\n\nFrom inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for, pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for, he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel, unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for, rather concealed their strength than the opposite. It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if, as time went On, that turned Out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies, equally relevant to the issue, might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries, even though poles apart. Another little interesting point, the amours of whores and chummies, to put it in common parlance, reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her, more so, in fact. And now, why? So the scene between the pair of them, the licensee of the place, rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris, the famous invincible, and the other, obviously bogus, reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick, supposing, that is, it was prearranged, as the lookeron, a student of the human soul, if anything, the others seeing least of the game. And as for the lessee or keeper, who probably wasn't the other person at all, he (Bloom) couldn't help feeling, and most properly, it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting, there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen's evidence - or king's now - like Denis or Peter Carey, an idea he utterly repudiated. Quite apart from that, he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle. Yet, though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form, he certainly did feel, and no denying it (while inwardly remaining what he was), a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife, cold steel, with the courage of his political convictions though, personally, he would never be a party to any such thing, off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south - have her or swing for her - when the husband frequently, after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal (the man having had the pair watched), inflicted fatal injuries on\n\nhis adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial liaison by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that Fitz, nicknamed Skin-the-Goat, merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not, if he was reliably informed, actually party to the ambush which, in point of fact, was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on. In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend, the pseudo Skin-the-etcetera, he had transparently outlived his welcome. He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high. Like actresses, always farewell - positively last performance then come up smiling again. Generous to a fault, of course, temperamental, no economising or any idea of the sort, always snapping at the bone for the shadow. So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some #. s. d. in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the Old Ireland tavern, come back to Erin and so on. Then as for the others, he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo, as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender.\n\nHe took umbrage at something or other, that much injured but on the whole eventempered person declared, I let slip. He called me a jew, and in a heated fashion, offensively. So I, without deviating from plain facts in the least, told him his God, I mean Christ, was a jew too, and all his family, like me, though in reality I'm not. That was one for him. A soft answer turns away wrath. He hadn't a word to say for himself as everyone saw. Am I not right?\n\nHe turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment, with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn't all exactly.\n\n\u2014Ex quibus, Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent, their two or four eyes conversing, Christus or Bloom his name is, or, after all, any other, secundum carnem.\n\n\u2014Of course, Mr Bloom proceeded to stipulate, you must look at both sides of the question. It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country, they say, our own distressful included, has the government it deserves. But with a little goodwill all round. It's all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality? I resent violence or intolerance in any shape or form. It never reaches anything or stops anything. A revolution must come on the due instalments plan. It's a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular, so to speak.\n\n\u2014Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes' war, Stephen assented, between Skinner's alley and Ormond market.\n\n\u2014Yes, Mr Bloom thoroughly agreed, entirely endorsing the remark, that was overwhelmingly right and the whole world was overwhelmingly full of that sort of thing.\n\n\u2014You just took the words out of my mouth, he said. A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn't remotely.\n\nAll those wretched quarrels, in his humble opinion, stirring up bad blood - bump of combativeness or gland of some kind, erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag - were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything, greed and jealousy, people never knowing when to stop.\n\n\u2014They accuse - remarked he audibly. He turned away from the others, who probably... and spoke nearer to, so as the others... in case they...\n\n\u2014Jews, he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen's ear, are accused of ruining. Not a vestige of truth in it, I can safely say. History - would you be surprised to learn? - proves up to' the hilt Spain decayed when the Inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell, an uncommonly able ruffian, who, in other respects, has much to answer for, imported them. Why? Because they are practical and are proved to be so. I don't want to indulge in any... because you know the standard works on the subject, and then, orthodox as you are... But in the economic, not touching religion, domain, the priest spells poverty. Spain again, you saw in the war, compared with goahead America. Turks, it's in the dogma. Because if they didn't believe they'd go straight to heaven when they die they'd try to live better - at least, so I think. That's the juggle on which the p.p.'s raise the wind on false pretences. I'm, he resumed, with dramatic force, as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone, concluded he, all creeds and classes pro rata having a comfortable tidysized income, in no niggard fashion either, something in the neighbourhood of #300 per annum That's the vital issue at stake and it's feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man. At least that's my idea for what it's worth. I call that patriotism. Ubi patria, as we learned a small smattering of in our classical day in Alma Mater, vita bene. Where you can live well, the sense is, if you work.\n\nOver his untasteable apology for a cup of coffee, listening to this synopsis of things in general, Stephen stared at nothing in particular. He could hear, of course, all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning, burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to. Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn't say the words the voice he heard said - if you work.\n\n\u2014Count me out, he managed to remark, meaning to work.\n\nThe eyes were surprised at this observation, because as he, the person who owned them pro. tem. observed, or rather, his voice speaking did: All must work, have to, together.\n\n\u2014I mean, of course, the other hastened to affirm, work in the widest possible sense. Also literary labour, not merely for the kudos of the thing. Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays. That's work too. Important work. After all, from the little I know of you, after all the money expended on your education, you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price. You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has. What? You both belong to Ireland, the brain and the brawn. Each is equally important.\n\n\u2014You suspect, Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh, that I may be important because I belong to the faubourg Saint Patrice called Ireland for short.\n\n\u2014I would go a step farther, Mr Bloom insinuated.\n\n\u2014But I suspect, Stephen interrupted, that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me.\n\n\u2014What belongs? queried Mr Bloom, bending, fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension. Excuse me. Unfortunately I didn't catch the latter portion. What was it you?...\n\nStephen, patently crosstempered, repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee, Or whatever you like to call it, none too politely, adding:\n\n\u2014We can't change the country. Let us change the subject.\n\nAt this pertinent suggestion, Mr Bloom, to change the subject, looked down, but in a quandary, as he couldn't tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry. The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part. Needless to say, the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way, foreign to his sober state. Probably the home life, to which Mr Bloom attached the utmost importance, had not been all that was needful or he hadn't been familiarised with the right sort of people. With a touch of fear for the young man beside him, whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris, the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister, failing to throw much light on the subject, however, he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly, nipped in the bud of premature decay, and nobody to blame but themselves. For instance, there was the case of O'Callaghan, for one, the half crazy faddist, respectably connected, though of inadequate means, with his mad vagaries, among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper (a fact). And then the usual d\u00e9nouement after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends, after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard, so as not to be made amenable under section two of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, certain names of those subpoenaed being handed in but not divulged, for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains. Briefly, putting two and two together, six sixteen, which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to, Antonio and so forth, jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts, even In the House of Lords, because early in life the occupant of the throne, then heir apparent, the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state, he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature, a thing good Mrs Grundy as the law stands was terribly down on, though not for the reason they thought they were probably, whatever it was, except women chiefly, who were always fiddling more or less at one another, it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it. Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should, and every well tailored man must, trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine fillip to acts of impropriety between the two, she unbuttoned his and then he untied her, mind the pin, whereas savages in the cannibal islands, say, at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental. However, reverting to the original, there were on the other hand others who had forced their way to the top from the lowest rung by the aid of their bootstraps. Sheer force of natural genius, that. With brains, sir.\n\nFor which and further reasons he felt it was interest and duty even to wait on and profit by the unlooked for occasion, though why, he could not exactly tell, being, as it was, already several shillings to the bad, having, in fact, let himself in for it. Still, to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small... Intellectual stimulation as such was, he felt, from time to time a firstrate tonic for the mind. Added to which was the coincidence of meeting, discussion, dance, row, old salt, of the here today and gone tomorrow type, night loafers, the whole galaxy of events, all went to make up a miniature cameo of the world we live in, especially as the lives of the submerged tenth, viz., coalminers, divers, scavengers, etc., were very much under the microscope lately. To improve the shining hour he wondered whether he might meet with anything approaching the same luck as Mr Philip Beaufoy if taken down in writing. Suppose he were to pen something out of the common groove (as he fully intended doing) at the rate of one guinea per column, My Experiences, let us say, in a Cabman's Shelter.\n\nThe pink edition, extra sporting, of the Telegraph, tell a graphic lie, lay, as luck would have it, beside his elbow and as he was just puzzling again, far from satisfied, over a country belonging to him and the preceding rebus the vessel came from Bridgwater and the postcard was addressed to A. Boudin, find the captain's age, his eyes went aimlessly over the respective captions which came under his special province, the allembracing give us this day our daily press. First he got a bit of a start but it turned out to be only something about somebody named H. du Boyes, agent for typewriters or something like that. Great battle Tokio. Lovemaking in Irish #200 damages. Gordon Bennett. Emigration swindle. Letter from His Grace William. Ascot Throwaway recalls Derby of '92 when Captain Marshall's dark horse, Sir Hugo , captured the blue riband at long odds. New York disaster, thousand lives lost. Foot and Mouth. Funeral of the late Mr Patrick Dignam.\n\nSo to change the subject he read about Dignam, R.I.P., which, he reflected, was anything but a gay sendoff.\n\n\u2014This morning (Hynes put it in, of course), the remains of the late Mr Patrick Dignam were removed from his residence, no 9 Newbridge Avenue, Sandymount, for internment in Clasnevin. The deceased gentleman was a most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise, after a brief illness, came as great shock to citizens of all classes by whom he is deeply regretted. The obsequies, at which many friends of the deceased were present, were carried out (certainly Hynes wrote it with a nudge from Corny) by Messrs. H. J. O'Neill & Son, 164 North Strand road. The mourners included: Patk. Dignam (son), Bernard Corrigan (motherinlaw), John Henry Menton, solr., Martin Cunningham, John Power eatondph 1/8 ador dorador douradora (must be where he called Monks the dayfather about Keyes's ad), Thomas Kernan, Simon Dedalus, Stephen Dedalus, B. A., Edward J. Lambert, Cornelius Kelleher, Joseph M'C. Hynes, L. Boom, C. P. M'Coy, - M'Intosh, and several others.\n\nNettled not a little by L. Boom (as it incorrectly stated) and the line of bitched type, but tickled to death simultaneously by C. P. M'Coy and Stephen Dedalus, B. A., who were conspicuous, needless to say, by their total absence (to say nothing of M'Intosh), L. Boom pointed it out to his companion B. A., engaged in stifling another yawn, half nervousness, not forgetting the usual crop of nonsensical howlers of misprints.\n\n\u2014Is that first epistle to the Hebrews, he asked, as soon as his bottom jaw would let him, in? Text: open thy mouth and put thy foot in it.\n\n\u2014It is, really, Mr Bloom said (though first he fancied he alluded to the archbishop till he added about foot and mouth with which there could be no possible connection) overjoyed to set his mind at rest and a bit flabbergasted at Myles Crawford's after all managing the thing, there.\n\nWhile the other was reading it on page two Boom (to give him for the nonce his new misnomer) whiled away a few odd leisure moments in fits and starts with the account of the third event at Ascot on page three, his sidevalue 1,000 sovs., with 3,000 sovs. In specie added for entire colts and fillies, Mr F. Alexander's Throwaway, b.h. by Rightaway, 5 yrs, 9 st 4 lbs, Thrale (W. Lane) 1. Lord Howard de Walden's Zinfandel (M. Cannon) 2. Mr W. Bass's Sceptre, 3. Betting 5 to 4 on Zinfandel, 20 to 1 Throwaway (off). Throwaway and Zinfandel stood close order. It was anybody's race then the rank outsider drew to the fore got long lead, beating lord Howard de Walden's chestnut colt and Mr W. Bass's bay filly Sceptre on a 2 1/2 mile course. Winner trained by Braine so that Lenehan's version of the business was all pure buncombe. Secured the verdict cleverly by a length. 1,000 sovs., with 3,000 in specie. Also ran J. de Bremond's (French horse Bantam Lyons was anxiously inquiring after not in yet but expected any minute) Maximum II. Different ways of bringing off a coup. Lovemaking damages. Though that halfbaked Lyons ran off at a tangent in his impetuosity to get left. Of course, gambling eminently lent itself to that sort of thing though, as the event turned out, the poor fool hadn't much reason to congratulate himself on his pick, the forlorn hope. Guesswork it reduced itself to eventually.\n\n\u2014There was every indication they would arrive at that, Mr Bloom said.\n\n\u2014Who? the other, whose hand by the way was hurt, said.\n\nOne morning you would open the paper, the cabman affirmed, and read, Return of Parnell. He bet them what they liked. A Dublin fusilier was in that shelter one night and said he saw him in South Africa. Pride it was killed him. He ought to have done away with himself or lain low for a time after Committee Room No. 15 until he was his old self again with no-one to point a finger at him. Then they would all to a man have gone down on their marrowbones to him to come back when he had recovered his senses. Dead he wasn't. Simply absconded somewhere. The coffin they brought over was full of stones. He changed his name to De Wet, the Boer general. He made a mistake to fight the priests. And so forth and so on.\n\nAll the same Bloom (properly so dubbed) was rather surprised at their memories for in nine cases out of ten it was a case of tarbarrels, and not singly but in their thousands, and then complete oblivion because it was twenty odd years. Highly unlikely, of course, there was even a shadow of truth in the stories and, even supposing, he thought a return highly inadvisable, all things considered. Something evidently riled them in his death. Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands. Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before, there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the Alice, where art thou order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart, so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility. Naturally then, it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men, which undoubtedly he was, and a commanding figure, a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet, whereas Messrs So-and-So who, though they weren't even a patch on the former man, ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between. It certainly pointed a moral, the idol with feet of clay. And then seventytwo of his trusty henchmen rounding on him with mutual mudslinging. And the identical same with murderers. You had to come back - that haunting sense kind of drew you - to show the understudy in the title r\u00f4le how to. He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the Insuppressible or was it United Ireland, a privilege he keenly appreciated, and, in point of fact, handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said Thank you, excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid expression notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip - what's bred in the bone. Still, as regards return, you were a lucky dog if they didn't set the terrier at you directly you got back. Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed. Tom for and Dick and Harry against. And then, number one, you came up against the man in possession and had to produce your credentials, like the claimant in the Tichborne case, Roger Charles Tichborne. Bella was the boat's name to the best of his recollection he, the heir, went down in, as the evidence went to show, and there was a tattoo mark too in Indian ink, Lord Bellew, was it? As he might very easily have picked up the details from some pal on board ship and then, when got up to tally with the description given, introduce himself with, Excuse me, my name is So-and-So or some such commonplace remark. A more prudent course, Mr Bloom said to the not over effusive, in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him, would have been to sound the lie of the land first.\n\n\u2014That bitch, that English whore, did for him, the shebeen proprietor commented. She put the first nail in his coffin.\n\n\u2014Fine lump of a woman, all the same, the soi-disant town-clerk, Henry Campbell remarked, and plenty of her. I seen her picture in a barber's. Her husband was a captain or an officer.\n\n\u2014Ay, Skin-the-Goat amusingly added. He was, and a cottonball one.\n\nThis gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his entourage. As regards Bloom, he, without the faintest suspicion of a smile, merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts, to make matters worse, were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them, full of sweet nothings. First, it was strictly platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them, till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however, who were resolved upon encouraging his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into. Sino their names were coupled, though, since he was her declared favourite, where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops, the fact namely, that he had shared her bedroom, which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel, having gained admittance in the same fashion, a fact that the weeklies, addicted to the lubric a little, simply coined shoals of money out of. Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene, strong to the verge of weakness, falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties. The usual sequel, to bask in the loved one's smiles. The eternal question of the life connubial, needless to say, cropped up. Can real love, supposing there happens to be another chap in the case, exist between married folk? Though it was no concern of theirs absolutely if he regarded her with affection carried away by a wave of folly. A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly, augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary, that is (who was just the usual everyday farewell, my gallant captain kind of an individual in the light dragoons, the 18th hussars to be accurate), and inflammable doubtless (the fallen leader, that is, not the other) in his own peculiar way which she of course, woman, quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame, which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole, his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations, very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose, thereby heaping coals of fire on his head, much in the same way as the fabled ass's kick. Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement, all seemed a kind of dream. And the coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times. Why, as he reflected, Irishtown Strand, a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years, looked different somehow since, as it happened, he went to reside on the north side. North or south however, it was just the wellknown case of hot passion, pure and simple, upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying, as she also was Spanish or half so, types that wouldn't do things by halves, passionate abandon of the south, casting every shred of decency to the winds.\n\n\u2014Just bears out what I was saying, he with glowing bosom said to Stephen. And, if I don't greatly mistake, she was Spanish too.\n\n\u2014The king of Spain's daughter, Stephen answered, adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many.\n\n\u2014Was she? Bloom ejaculated surprised, though not astonished by any means. I never heard that rumour before. Possible, especially there it was, as she lived there. So, Spain.\n\nCarefully avoiding a book in his pocket Sweets of, which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date, he took out his pocketbook and, turning over the various contents rapidly, finally he.\n\n\u2014Do you consider, by the by, he said, thoughtfully selecting a fades photo which he laid on the table, that a Spanish type?\n\nStephen, obviously addressed, looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady, with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion, as she was in the full bloom of womanhood, In evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom, with more than vision of breasts, her full lips parted, and some perfect teeth, standing near, ostensibly with gravity, a piano, on the rest of which was In old Madrid, a ballad, pretty in its way, which was then all the vogue. Her (the lady's) eyes, dark, large, looked at Stephen, about to smile about something to be admired, Lafayette of Westmoreland street, Dublin's premier photographic artist, being responsible for the esthetic execution.\n\nMrs Bloom, my wife the prima donna, Madam Marion Tweedy, Bloom indicated. Taken a few years since. In or about '96. Very like her then.\n\nBeside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who, he intimated, was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen. As for the face, it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure, which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup She could without difficulty, he said, have posed for the ensemble, not to dwell on certain opulent curves of the... He dwelt, being a bit of an artist in his spare time, on the female form in general developmentally because, as it so happened, no later than that afternoon, he had seen those Grecian statues, perfectly developed as works of art, in the National Museum. Marble could give the original, shoulders, back, all the symmetry. All the rest, yes, Puritanism. It does though, St Joseph's sovereign... whereas no photo could, because it simply wasn't art, in a word.\n\nThe spirit moving him, he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar's good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he... so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself, her stage presence being, frankly, a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to. But it was scarcely professional etiquette so, though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering, for sunshine after storm... And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion. Nevertheless, he sat tight, just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves, none the worse for wear, however, and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other's possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving embonpoint. In fact, the slight soiling was only an added charm, like the case of linen slightly soiled, good as new, much better, in fact, with the starch out. Suppose she was gone when he?... I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses (sic) in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray.\n\nThe vicinity of the young man he certainly relished, educated, distingu\u00e9, and impulsive into the bargain, far and away the pick of the bunch, though you wouldn't think he had it in him... yet you would. Besides he said the picture was handsome which, say what you like, it was, though at the moment she was distinctly stouter. And why not? An awful lot of make-believe went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of letterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business. How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions, leaving no loophole, to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations, when the thing ran its normal course, became in due course intimate. Then the decree nisi and the King's Proctor to show cause why and, he failing to quash it, nisi was made absolute. But as for that, the two misdemeanants, wrapped up as they largely were in one another, could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor, who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course. He, Bloom, enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin's uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred in the historic fracas when the fallen leader's - who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery - (leader's) trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the Insuppressible or no it was United Ireland (a by no means, by the by, appropriate appellative) and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O'Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation, reflecting on the erstwhile tribune's private morals. Though palpably a radically altered man, he was still a commanding figure, though carelessly garbed as usual, with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay, after placing him upon a pedestal, which she, however, was the first to perceive. As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap's elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach, fortunately not of a grave character. His hat (Parnell's) was inadvertently knocked off and, as a matter of strict history, Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him (and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity) who, panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time, being a gentleman born with a stake in the country, he, as a matter of fact, having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else, what's bred in the bone, instilled into him in infancy at his mother's knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect aplomb, saying: Thank you, sir though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day, history repeating itself with a difference; after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave.\n\nOn the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabmen and so on, who passed it all off as a jest, laughing immoderately, pretending to understand everything, the why and the wherefore, and in reality not knowing their own minds, it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones, who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another's arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones, with tears in her eyes, though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time, as quite possibly there were several others. He personally, being of a sceptical bias, believed, and didn't make the smallest bones about saying so either, that man, or men in the plural, were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady, even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument, when, neglecting her duties, she chose to be tired of wedded life, and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent, the upshot being that her affections centred on another, the cause of many liaisons between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men, no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt.\n\nIt was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains, as his neighbour obviously was, should waste his valuable time with profligate women, who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime. In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies' society was a conditio sine qua non though he had the gravest possible doubts, not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson (who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning), as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi- or tri-weekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentpaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers' ways and flowers and chocs. To think of him house and homeless, rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother, was really too bad at his age. The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other's senior or like his father. But something substantial he certainly ought to eat, were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or, failing that, the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled.\n\n\u2014At what o'clock did you dine? he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face.\n\n\u2014Some time yesterday, Stephen said.\n\n\u2014Yesterday, exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow, Friday. Ah, you mean it's after twelve!\n\n\u2014The day before yesterday, Stephen said, improving on himself.\n\nLiterally astounded at this piece of intelligence, Bloom reflected. Though they didn't see eye to eye in everything, a certain analogy there somehow was, as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the one train of thought. At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. For instance, when the evicted tenants' question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in people's minds though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldn't exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle, at all events, was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession, as voicing the trend of modern Opinion, a partiality, however, which, realising his mistake, he was subsequently partially cured of, and even was twitted with going a step further than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander, which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan's so that he, though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals, be it repeated, departed from his customary habit to give him (metaphorically) one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned, he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows, chiefly, destruction of the fittest, in a word.\n\nAnyhow, upon weighing the pros and cons, getting on for one as it was, it was high time to be retiring for the night. The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue (somebody having a temper of her own sometimes) and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog (breed unknown) with a lame paw, not that the cases were either identical or the reverse, though he had hurt his hand too, to Ontario Terrace, as he very distinctly remembered, having been there, so to speak. On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives... Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity, all things considered. His initial impression was that he was a bit standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway. For one thing he mightn't what you call jump at the idea, if approached, and what mostly worried him was he didn't know how to lead up to it or word it exactly, supposing he did entertain the proposal, as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe, if found suitable. At all events he wound up by concluding, eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent, a cup of Epps's cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow. At least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet. He failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up. A move had to be made because that merry old soul, the grasswidower in question, who appeared to be glued to the spot, didn't appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger's bawdyhouse of retired beauties off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character's whereabouts for a few days to come, alternately racking their feelings (the mermaids') with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody's bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let XX equal my right name and address, as Mr Algebra remarks passim. At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his God being a jew. People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep. The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles, your God was a jew, because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick-on-Shannon or somewhere about in the county Sligo.\n\n\u2014I propose, our hero eventually suggested, after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo, as it's rather stuffy here, you just come with me and talk things over. My diggings are quite close in the vicinity. You can't drink that stuff. Wait, I'll just pay this lot.\n\nThe best plan clearly being to clear out, the remainder being plain sailing, he beckoned, while prudently pocketing the photo, to the keeper of the shanty, who didn't seem to...\n\n\u2014Yes, that's the best, he assured Stephen, to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less.\n\nAll kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his (Bloom's) busy brain. Education (the genuine article), literature, journalism, prize titbits, up to date billing, hydros and concert tours in English watering resorts packed with theatres, turning money away, duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things, no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck. An opening was all was wanted. Because he more than suspected he had his father's voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well, by the way no harm, to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to.\n\nThe cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy, earl Cadogan, had presided at the cabdrivers' association dinner in London somewhere. Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement. Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that Sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary's lodge or words to that effect. To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why. - Give us a squint at that literature, grandfather, the ancient mariner put in, manifesting some natural impatience.\n\n\u2014And welcome, answered the elderly party thus addressed.\n\nThe sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears.\n\n\u2014Are you bad in the eyes? the sympathetic personage like the town clerk queried.\n\n\u2014Why, answered the seafarer with the tartan beard, who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way, staring out of sea-green portholes as you might well describe them as, I uses goggles reading. Sand in the Red Sea done that. One time I could read a book in the dark, manner of speaking. The Arabian Nights' Entertainment was my favourite and Red as a Rose is She.\n\nThereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what, found drowned or the exploits of King Willow, Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts, during which time (completely regardless of Ire) the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him, as he muttered against whoever it was sold it, all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions, that is to say, either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark.\n\nTo cut a long story short Bloom, grasping the situation, was the first to rise to his feet so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost, being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion, taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming, making a grand total of fourpence (the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers, literally the last of the Mohicans) he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite to him in unmistakable figures, coffee 2d., confectionery do., and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way, as Wetherup used to remark. - Come, he counselled, to close the s\u00e9ance.\n\nSeeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear, they left the shelter or shanty together and the \u00e9lite society of oil skin and company whom nothing short Of an earthquake would move out of their dolce far niente. Stephen, who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out, paused at the, for a moment... the door to...\n\n\u2014One thing I never understood, he said, to be original on the spur of the moment, why they put tables upside down at night, I mean chairs upside down on the tables In cafes.\n\nTo which impromptu the never failing Bloom replied without a moment's hesitation, saying straight off:\n\n\u2014To sweep the floor in the morning.\n\nSo saying he skipped around nimbly, considering frankly, at the same time apologetic, to get on his companion's right, a habit of his, by the by, the right side being, in classical idiom, his tender Achilles. The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins.\n\n\u2014It will (the air) do you good, Bloom said, meaning also the walk, in a moment. The only thing is to walk then you'll feel a different man. It's not far. Lean on me.\n\nAccordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen's right and led him on accordingly.\n\n\u2014Yes, Stephen said uncertainly, because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him, sinewless and wobbly and all that.\n\nAnyhow, they passed the sentrybox with stones, brazier, etc. where the municipal supernumerary, ex-Gumley, was still to all intents and purposes wrapped in the arms of Murphy, as the adage has it, dreaming of fresh fields and pastures new. And apropos of coffin of stones, the analogy was not at all bad, as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class, probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings.\n\nSo they passed on to chatting about music, a form of art for which Bloom, as a pure amateur, possessed the greatest love, as they made tracks arm-in-arm across Beresford place. Wagnerian music, though confessedly grand in its way, was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go-off but the music of Mercadante's Huguenots, Meyerbeer's Seven Last Words on the Cross, and Mozart's Twelfth Mass, he simply revelled in, the Gloria in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such, literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat. He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or Bid me to live and I will live thy protestant to be. He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini's Stabat Mater, a work simply abounding in immortal numbers, in which his wife, Madam Marion Tweedy, made a hit, a veritable sensation, he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers' church in Upper Gardiner street, the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos, or virtuosi rather. There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and, suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character, there was a generally voiced desire for an encore. On the whole, though favouring preferably light opera of the Don Giovanni description, and Martha, a gem in its line, he had a penchant, though with only a surface knowledge, for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn. And talking of that, taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites, he mentioned par excellence Lionel's air in Martha, M'appari, which, curiously enough, he heard, or overheard, to be more accurate, on yesterday, a privilege he keenly appreciated, from the lips of Stephen's respected father, sung to perfection, a study of the number, in fact, which made all the others take a back seat. Stephen, in reply to a politely put query, said he didn't but launched out into praises of Shakespeare's songs, at least of in or about that period, the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter Lane near Gerard the herbalist, who anno ludendo hausi, Doulandus, an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch, whom Bloom did not quite recall, though the name certainly sounded familiar, for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their dux and comes conceits and Byrd (William), who played the virginals, he said, in the Queen's Chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull.\n\nOn the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swing chain, a horse, dragging a sweeper, paced on the paven ground, brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught a right the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull. He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk, as it struck him, the two identical names, as a striking coincidence.\n\nBy the chains, the horse slowly swerved to turn, which perceiving Bloom, who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other's sleeve gently, jocosely remarking:\n\n\u2014Our lives are in peril tonight. Beware of the steamroller.\n\nThey thereupon stopped. Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas, suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near, so that it seemed new, a different grouping of bones and even flesh, because palpably it was a fourwalker, a hipshaker, a blackbuttocker, a taildangler, a headhanger, putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch, busy with his thoughts. But such a good poor brute, he was sorry he hadn't a lump of sugar but, as he wisely reflected, you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up. He was just a big foolish nervous noodly kind of a horse, without a second care in the world. But even a dog, he reflected, take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan's, of the same size, would be a holy horror to face. But it was no animal's fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel, ship of the desert, distilling grapes into potheen in his hump. Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained, nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees; whale with a harpoon hairpin, alligator, tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke; chalk a circle for a rooster; tiger, my eagle eye. These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind, somewhat distracted from Stephen's words, while the ship of the street was manoeuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old...\n\n\u2014What's this I was saying? Ah, yes! My wife, he intimated, plunging in medias res, would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind.\n\nHe looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen, image of his mother, which was not quite the same as the usual blackguard type they unquestionably had an indubitable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built.\n\nStill, supposing he had his father's gift, as he more than suspected, it opened up new vistas in his mind, such as Lady Fingall's Irish industries concert on the preceding Monday, and aristocracy in general.\n\nExquisite variations he was now describing on an air Youth here has End by Jans Pieter Sweelinck, a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from. Even more he liked an old German song of Johannes Jeep about the clear sea and the voices of sirens, sweet murderers of men, which boggled Bloom a bit:\n\nVon der Sirenen Listigkeit\nTun die Poeten dichten.\n\nThese opening bars he sang and translated extempore. Bloom, nodding, said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means, which he did.\n\nA phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that, the rarest of boons, which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out, could easily, if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain, command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an entr\u00e9e into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B. A. (a huge ad in its way) and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success, being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites, if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he, a youthful tyro in- society's sartorial niceties, hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you. It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic conversaziones during the festivities of the Christmas season, for choice, causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation, cases of which, as he happened to know, were on record - in fact, without giving the show away, he himself once upon a time, if he cared to, could easily have. Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at, going hand in hand with his tuition fees. Not, he parenthesised, that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time. But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped. Besides, though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree, original music like that, different from the conventional rut, would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin's musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their genus omne. Yes, beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city's esteem where he could command a stiff figure and, booking ahead, give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house, given a backerup, if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs, so to speak, a big if however, with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped-up a too much feted prince of good fellows. And it need not detract from the other by one iota as, being his own master, he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone. In fact, he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other, possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort, hung on to him at all.\n\nThe horse was just then. And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed (Bloom did), without anyway prying into his private affairs on the fools step in where angels principle, advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who, he noticed, was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present, deprecate him, or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom's humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person's character, no pun intended.\n\nThe horse having reached the end of his tether, so to speak, halted\nand, rearing high a proud feathering tail, added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish, three smoking globes of turds. Slowly three times, one after another, from a full crupper he mired. And humanely his driver waited till he (or she) had ended, patient in his scythed car.\n\nSide by side Bloom, profiting by the contretemps, with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains, divided by the upright, and, stepping over a strand of mire, went across towards Gardiner street lower, Stephen singing more boldly, but not loudly, the end of the ballad.\n\nUnd alle Schiffe br\u00fccken.\n\nThe driver never said a word, good, bad or indifferent, but merely\nwatched the two figures, as he sat on his lowbacked car, both black, one full, one lean, walk towards the railway bridge, to be married by Father Maher. As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their t\u00e9te \u00e0 t\u00e9te (which, of course, he was utterly out of) about sirens enemies of man's reason, mingled with a number of other topics of the same category, usurpers, historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn't possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street and looked after their lowbacked car.2Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 3, "api_path": "/songs/211942", "artist_names": "Robert Kenner", "full_title": "Food Inc - transcript by\u00a0Robert\u00a0Kenner", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "id": 211942, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 227037, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1620008285, "path": "/Robert-kenner-food-inc-transcript-annotated", "pyongs_count": null, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Robert-kenner-food-inc-transcript-sample", "release_date_components": null, "release_date_for_display": null, "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": null, "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "song_art_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_cover_image.png?1669926949", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 3, "hot": false}, "title": "Food Inc - transcript", "title_with_featured": "Food Inc - transcript", "updated_by_human_at": 1620008285, "url": "https://genius.com/Robert-kenner-food-inc-transcript-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/68563", "header_image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "id": 68563, "image_url": "https://assets.genius.com/images/default_avatar_300.png?1669926949", "index_character": "r", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Robert Kenner", "slug": "Robert-kenner", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Robert-kenner"}, "artist": "Robert Kenner", "lyrics": "Food Inc - transcript LyricsMichael Pollan: The way we eat has changed more in the last 50 years than in the previous 10,000. But the image that\u2019s used to sell the food, it is still the imagery of agrarian America. You go into the supermarket and you see pictures of farmers, the picket fence, the silo, the \u201930s farmhouse and the green grass. It\u2019s the spinning of this pastoral fantasy.\n\nThe modern American supermarket has on average 47,000 products. There are no seasons in the American supermarket. Now there are tomatoes all year round, grown halfway around the world, picked when it was green, and ripened with ethylene gas. Although it looks like a tomato, it\u2019s kind of a notional tomato. I mean, it\u2019s the idea of a tomato. In the meat aisle, there are no bones anymore. Eric Schlosser: There is this deliberate veil, this curtain, that\u2019s dropped between us and where our food is coming from. The industry doesn\u2019t want you to know the truth about what you\u2019re eating, because if you knew, you might not want to eat it.\n\nPollan: If you follow the food chain back from those shrink-wrapped packages of meat, you find a very different reality. The reality is a factory. It\u2019s not a farm. It\u2019s a factory. That meat is being processed by huge multinational corporations that have very little to do with ranches and farmers.\n\nSchlosser: Now our food is coming from enormous assembly lines where the animals and the workers are being abused. And the food has become much more dangerous in ways that are being deliberately hidden from us. Troy Roush: You\u2019ve got a small group of multinational corporations who control the entire food system. From seed to the supermarket, they\u2019re gaining control of food.\n\nSchlosser: This isn\u2019t just about what we\u2019re eating. This is about what we\u2019re allowed to say, what we\u2019re allowed to know. It\u2019s not just our health that\u2019s at risk. Carole Morison: The companies don\u2019t want farmers talking. They don\u2019t want this story told. How about a nice chicken club sandwich made with fresh cooked chicken? You know, that\u2019s a nice idea, but I think what I\u2019d really like\n\nSchlosser\u2019s voice: My favorite meal to this day remains a hamburger and french fries. I had no idea that a handful of companies had changed what we eat and how we make our food. I\u2019ve been eating this food all my life without having any idea where it comes from, any idea how powerful this industry is. And it was the idea of this world deliberately hidden from us. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why I became an investigative reporter, was to take the veil\u2013 lift the veil away from important subjects that are being hidden. (film projector clicking)\nSchlosser: The whole industrial food system really began with fast food. In the 1930s, a new form of restaurant arose and it was called the drive-in. The McDonald brothers had a very successful drive-in, but they decided to cut costs and simplify. So they fired all their carhops, they got rid of most of the things on the menu and they created a revolutionary idea to how to run a restaurant. They basically brought the factory system to the back of the restaurant kitchen. They trained each worker to just do one thing again and again and again. By having workers who only had to do one thing, they could pay them a low wage and it was very easy to find someone to replace them. It was inexpensive food, it tasted good and this McDonald\u2019s fast food restaurant was a huge huge success. That mentality of uniformity, conformity and cheapness applied widely and on a large scale has all kinds of unintended consequences. (mooing) When McDonald\u2019s is the largest purchaser of ground beef in the United States and they want their hamburgers to taste, everywhere, exactly the same, they change how ground beef is produced. The McDonald\u2019s corporation is the largest purchaser of potatoes and one of the largest purchasers of pork, chicken, tomatoes, lettuce, even apples. These big big fast food chains want big suppliers. And now there are essentially a handful of companies controlling our food system. In the 1970s, the top five beef-packers controlled only about 25% of the market. Today, the top four control more than 80% of the market. You see the same thing happening now in pork. Even if you don\u2019t eat at a fast food restaurant, you\u2019re now eating meat that\u2019s being produced by this system. You look at the labels and you see Farmer this, Farmer that\u2013 it\u2019s really just three or four companies that are controlling the meat. We\u2019ve never had food companies this big and this powerful in our history. Tyson, for example, is the biggest meat-packing company in the history of the world. The industry changed the entire way that chicken are raised. Birds are now raised and slaughtered in half the time they were 50 years ago, but now they\u2019re twice as big. People like to eat white meat, so they redesigned the chicken to have large breasts. \u2013 They not only changed the chicken, they changed the farmer. Today, chicken farmers no longer control their birds. (thudding) A company like Tyson owns the birds from the day they\u2019re dropped off until the day that they\u2019re slaughtered. (buzzes) Let me go to the top. \u2013 Man: This is the Chicken\u2013 The chicken industry has really set a model for the integration of production, processing and marketing of the products that other industries are now following because they see that we have achieved tremendous economies. In a way, we\u2019re not producing chickens; we\u2019re producing food. It\u2019s all highly mechanized. So all the birds coming off those farms have to be almost exactly the same size. What the system of intensive production accomplishes is to produce a lot of food on a small amount of land at a very affordable price. Now somebody explain to me what\u2019s wrong with that. (sniffs) Smells like money to me. (chuckles) 16 chicken houses sit here. And Chuck\u2019s son has four over the top of this hill. The chicken industry came in here and it\u2019s helped this whole community out. Here\u2019s my chicken houses here. I have about 300,000 chickens. (barks) We have a contract with Tyson. They\u2019ve been growing chickens for many many years. It\u2019s all a science. They got it figured out. If you can grow a chicken in 49 days, why would you want one you gotta grow in three months? More money in your pocket. (chickens clucking) These chickens never see sunlight. They\u2019re pretty much in the dark all the time. Man: So you think they just want to keep us out? I don\u2019t know. If I knew, I\u2019d tell you. It would be nice if y\u2019all could see what we really do, but as far as y\u2019all going in, we can\u2019t let you do that. I understand why farmers don\u2019t want to talk\u2013 because the company can do what it wants to do as far as pay goes since they control everything. But it\u2019s just gotten to the point that it\u2019s not right what\u2019s going on and I\u2019ve just made up my mind. I\u2019m gonna say what I have to say. I understand why others don\u2019t want to do it. And I\u2019m just to a point that it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Something has to be said. (loud clucking)\n\nIt is nasty in here. There\u2019s dust flying everywhere. There\u2019s feces everywhere. This isn\u2019t farming. This is just mass production, like an assembly line in a factory. (fans whirring) When they grow from a chick and in seven weeks you\u2019ve got a five-and-a-half- pound chicken, their bones and their internal organs can\u2019t keep up with the rapid growth. A lot of these chickens here, they can take a few steps and then they plop down. It\u2019s because they can\u2019t keep up all the weight that they\u2019re carrying. (wheezes) That\u2019s normal. There\u2019s antibiotics that\u2019s put into the feed and of course that passes through the chicken. The bacteria builds up a resistance, so antibiotics aren\u2019t working anymore. I have become allergic to all antibiotics and can\u2019t take \u2018em. (clucking)\n\nMorison: When it\u2019s dark inside the houses, the chickens lay down. It\u2019s less resistance when they\u2019re being caught. Traditionally, it\u2019s been African-American men. Now we\u2019re seeing more and more Latino catchers\u2013 undocumented workers. From their point of view, they don\u2019t have any rights and they\u2019re just not gonna complain. The companies like these kind of workers. It doesn\u2019t matter if the chickens get sick. All of the chickens will go to the plant for processing. The companies keep the farmers under their thumb because of the debt that the farmers have. To build one poultry house is anywhere from $280,000 to $300,000 per house. And once you make your initial investment, the companies constantly come back with demands of upgrades for new equipment, and the grower has no choice. They have to do it or you\u2019re threatened with loss of a contract. This is how they keep the farmers under control. It\u2019s how they keep them spending money, going to the bank and borrowing more money. The debt just keeps building. To have no say in your business, it\u2019s degrading. It\u2019s like being a slave to the company. Pollan: The idea that you would need to write a book telling people where their food came from is just a sign of how far removed we\u2019ve become. It seems to me that we\u2019re entitled to know about our food\u2013 \u201cWho owns it? How are they making it? Can I have a look in the kitchen?\u201d\n\nWhen I wanted to understand the industrial food system, what I set about doing was very simple. I wanted to trace the source of my food. When you go through the supermarket, what looks like this cornucopia of variety and choice is not. There is an illusion of diversity. There are only a few companies involved and there\u2019re only a few crops involved. What really surprised me most as I followed that food back to its source, I kept ending up in the same place, and that was a cornfield in Iowa. So much of our industrial food turns out to be clever rearrangements of corn. Corn has conquered the world in a lot of ways. It is a remarkable plant. 100 years ago, a farmer in America could grow maybe 20 bushels of corn on an acre. Today, 200 bushels is no problem. That\u2019s an astonishing achievement for which breeders deserve credit, for which fertilizer makers deserve credit, for which pesticide makers all deserve credit.\n\nRoush: In the United States today, 30% of our land base is being planted to corn. That\u2019s largely driven by government policy, government policy that, in effect, allows us to produce corn below the cost of production. The truth of the matter is we\u2019re paid to overproduce, and it was caused by these large multinational interests. The reason our government\u2019s promoting corn\u2013 the Cargills, the ADMs, Tyson, Smithfield\u2013 they have an interest in purchasing corn below the cost of production. They use that interest and that extensive amount of money they have to lobby Congress to give us the kind of farm bills we now have.\n\nPollan: A \u201cfarm bill,\u201d which should really be called a \u201cfood bill,\u201d codifies the rules of the entire food economy. Farm policy is always focused on these commodity crops because you can store them. We encourage farmers to grow as much corn as they can grow, to get big, to consolidate. We subsidize farmers by the bushel. Roush: We produced a lot of corn and they came up with uses for it.\n\nLarry Johnson: We are now engineering our foods. We know where to turn to for certain traits like mouth feel and flavor. And we bring all of these pieces together and engineer new foods that don\u2019t stale in the refrigerator, don\u2019t develop rancidity. Of course the biggest advance in recent years was high-fructose corn syrup. You know, I would venture to guess if you go and look on the supermarket shelf, I\u2019ll bet you 90% of them would contain either a corn or soybean ingredient, and most of the time will contain both.\n\nPollan: Corn is the great raw material. You get that big fat kernel of starch and you can break that down and reassemble it. You can make high-fructose corn syrup. You can make maltodextrin and diglycerides and xanthan gum and ascorbic acid. All those obscure ingredients on the processed food\u2013 it\u2019s remarkable how many of them can be made from corn. Plus, you can feed it to animals. Roush: Corn is the main component in feed ingredients whether it\u2019s chicken, hogs, cattle\u2013 you name it.\n\nPollan: Increasingly, we\u2019re feeding the corn to the fish whether we\u2019re eating the tilapia or the farmed salmon. We\u2019re teaching fish how to eat corn. The fact that we had so much cheap corn really allowed us to drive down the price of meat. I mean, the average American is eating over 200 lbs of meat per person per year. That wouldn\u2019t be possible had we not fed them this diet of cheap grain. Since you\u2019re selling corn at below the price of production, the feedlot operator can buy corn at a fraction of what it costs to grow, so that all the animals are sucked off of all the farms in the Midwest. There is a spiderweb of roads and train tracks all around the country moving corn from where it\u2019s being grown to these CAFOs. Cows are not designed by evolution to eat corn. They\u2019re designed by evolution to eat grass. And the only reason we feed them corn is because corn is really cheap and corn makes them fat quickly. (cow moos) Man: Where are you putting your hand? I\u2019m actually inside the rumen\u2013 that first compartment of the stomach. And it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s not\u2013 it\u2019s kind of hard to see. You can see the liquid part here.\n\nMan: Wow. There\u2019s microorganisms\u2013 bacteria in the rumen, millions of \u2018em. The animals evolved on consuming grass. There\u2019s some research that indicates that a high-corn diet results in E. coli that are acid-resistant. And these would be the more harmful E. coli.\n\nPollan: So you feed corn to cattle and E. coli, which is a very common bug, evolves, a certain mutation occurs and a strain called the \u201cE. coli 0157:h7\u2033 appears on the world stage. And it\u2019s a product of the diet we\u2019re feeding cattle on feedlots and it\u2019s a product of feedlot life. The animals stand ankle deep in their manure all day long. So if one cow has it, the other cows will get it. When they get to the slaughterhouse, their hides are caked with manure. And if the slaughterhouse is slaughtering 400 animals an hour, how do you keep that manure from getting onto those carcasses? And that\u2019s how the manure gets in the meat. And now this thing that wasn\u2019t in the world is in the food system. A fast-food nightmare may be getting worse. A two-year-old child died today in Seattle. And the killer? Tainted meat from Jack In The Box hamburgers. A nationwide recall today for more than 140 tons of ground beef. Man: A half a million pounds of ground beef\u2013 of Con Agra ground beef.\n\nSchlosser: E. coli isn\u2019t just in ground beef now\u2013 it\u2019s been found in spinach, apple juice\u2013 and this is really because of the runoff from our factory farms. 90 confirmed cases of E. coli poisoning. Central to it all\u2013 raw, bagged spinach. E. coli outbreak with leafy greens in just the last decade. Schlosser: For years during the Bush administration, the chief of staff at the USDA was the former chief lobbyist to the beef industry in Washington; the head of the F.D.A. was the former executive vice president of the National Food Processors Association. These regulatory agencies are being controlled by the very companies that they\u2019re supposed to be scrutinizing. Woman: ConAgra, which recently recalled peanut butter contaminated with salmonella, was aware of problems in its plant two years ago.\n\nSchlosser: There\u2019s always been food poisoning. As more and more technology is being applied to the production of food, you would think it would be getting safer, not more contaminated. But the processing plants have gotten bigger and bigger. it\u2019s just perfect for taking bad pathogens and spreading them far and wide. Woman: The recall of frozen hamburger now includes 22 million pounds. Enough meat to make a fast-food hamburger for every adult in America is being recalled.\nSchlosser: In the 1970s, there were literally thousands of slaughterhouses in the United States. Today we have 13 slaughterhouses that process the majority of beef that is sold in the United States. The hamburger of today, it has pieces of thousands of different cattle ground up in that one hamburger patty. The odds increase exponentially that one of those animals was carrying a dangerous pathogen. It\u2019s remarkable how toothless our regulatory agencies are when you look closely at it, and that\u2019s how the industry wants it.\n\nPatricia Buck: This is the USDA building up here. Did Josh say how much time he thought we\u2019d get? Well, maybe as much as 15. Got to be on time for that meeting. \u2013 It starts a 4:00. So if I start going like that \u2013 or start shuffling papers, it\u2019s time. \u2013 I know, it\u2019s time. Thank you! Thank you. Kowalcyk: I\u2019m a registered Republican. I\u2019ve always been fairly conservative. I never thought I would be doing this and I certainly never thought I would be working so closely with my mom. Made a mistake\u2013 I think that\u2019s the way we want to go.\n\nKowalcyk: My mom and I, our relationship has taken on a whole new dimension. 2421? 2421. Here we are. \u2013 I\u2019m Pat. to establish food standards, people just got complacent. We reduced funding for the FDA. We\u2019ve relied increasingly on self-policing for all of these industries. And now we just have, really, lost our system. You\u2019re really one of the champions on the hill for food safety and it\u2019s a very important cause. It\u2019s very personal to me and my family. Our food safety advocacy work started six years ago when my two-and- a-half-year-old son Kevin was stricken with E. coli 0157:h7 and went from being a perfectly healthy beautiful little boy\u2013 and I have a small picture with me today that was taken two weeks before he got sick. He went from that to being dead in 12 days. In July 2001, our family took a vacation. Had we known what was in store for us, we would have never gone home. We ended up eating three hamburgers before he got sick. We started to see blood in Kevin\u2019s diarrhea, so we took him to the emergency room. And they said, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten the culture back from Kevin\u2019s stool, and he has hemorrhagic E. coli.\u201d They came in and informed us that Kevin\u2019s kidneys were starting to fail. Kevin received his first dialysis treatment. He was not allowed to really drink water. We had these little sponges and we were allowed to dip that into a cup of water and then give him that. He bit the head off of one of them. You\u2019ve never seen someone beg. He begged for water. It was all he could talk about. They wouldn\u2019t let anybody bring any beverage into the room because\u2013 I mean, it was all he would talk about, was\u2026 water. (waves lapping) I don\u2019t know if he knew what was happening to him\u2026 and I hope\u2013 I don\u2019t know. To watch this beautiful child go from being perfectly healthy to dead in 12 days\u2013 it was just unbelievable that this could happen from eating food. What was kind of adding more insult to injury\u2013 it took us almost two or three years and hiring a private attorney to actually find out that we matched a meat recall. On August 1st, my son was already in the hospital. They did an E. coli test at the plant that was positive. They didn\u2019t end up recalling that meat until August 27th, 16 days after he died. If we have some more hearings\u2013 which I\u2019m sure we will\u2013 I\u2019d love to have you come and testify.\n\nKowalcyk: You never get over the death of your child. You find a new normal. \u2013 We\u2019re going this way? Kowalcyk: We put faith in our government to protect us, and we\u2019re not being protected at a most basic level. In 1998, the USDA implemented microbial testing for salmonella and E. coli 0157:h7. The idea was that if a plant repeatedly failed these tests, that the USDA would shut the plant down because they obviously had an ongoing contamination problem. The meat and poultry associations immediately took the USDA to court. The courts basically said the USDA didn\u2019t have the authority to shut down the plants. What it meant was that you could have a pound of meat or poultry products that is a petri dish of salmonella and the USDA really can\u2019t do anything about it. A new law was introduced in direct response and this law became known as Kevin\u2019s Law. It seems like such a clear-cut, common sense type thing.\n\nKowalcyk: We\u2019ve been working for six years and it still hasn\u2019t passed. I sense that there may be an opportunity\u2013 an enhanced opportunity\u2013 to get this signed into law this time. I think that from the standpoint of the consumer, a lot of people would support the idea of paying a little more if they could be guaranteed a higher standard of safety. that there are other players \u2026that tend to worry about that, because it\u2019s gonna be seen as an add-on to their costs. I think the advantage here is\u2013\n\nKowalcyk: Sometimes it does feel like industry was more protected than my son. That\u2019s what motivated me to become an advocate. In the past year alone, there have been a multitude of food-borne illness outbreaks which have resulted in significant losses. Clearly our current approach to food oversight and protection is not meeting the needs of American families. It\u2019s really hard for me to tell Kevin\u2019s story. But the only way I\u2019m going to be able to prevent it from happening to other people is to go out there and speak about it. Yeah. Six are elementary school students, one is a sibling, and there\u2019s another one in another county in Kentucky, so\u2026\n\nKowalcyk: It will be seven years since my son died. All I wanted the company to do was say \u201cWe\u2019re sorry. We produced this defective product that killed your child, and this is what we\u2019re going to do to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d That\u2019s all we wanted, and they couldn\u2019t give us that.\n\nPollan: The industrial food system is always looking for greater efficiency, but each new step in efficiency leads to problems. If you take feedlot cattle off of their corn diet, give them grass for five days, they will shed 80% of the E. coli in their gut. But of course that\u2019s not what the industry does. The industry\u2019s approach is\u2013 when it has a systematic problem like that\u2013 is not to go back and see what\u2019s wrong with the system, it\u2019s to come up some high-tech fixes that allow the system to survive. Man: The 5\u00d75 product surge tank\u2013 low level. Low level. (man speaks over radio)\n\nEldon Roth: This is our operations center. We control all of our plants from here. Where\u2019s Chicago? Here\u2019s Chicago, Georgia, Utah, Kansas, Nebraska, Texas, L.A., Ohio. We control all levels of the gearboxes, the speed of motors\u2013 we can change those all from here. We built something that\u2013 from a food-safety standpoint, we think we\u2019re ahead of everybody. We think we can lessen the incidents of E. coli 0157:h7. (beeps) But I just started working with ammonia and ammonia hydroxide. Ammonia kills bacteria, so it became a processing tool. I\u2019m really a mechanic. That\u2019s really what I am. We design our own machinery. (whirring)\n\nRoth: This is our finished product. Man: Is your meat in most of the hamburgers in the country?\n\nRoth: 70%. In five years, we think we\u2019ll be in 100%. We do have some competitors. I think we\u2019re gonna beat them. -\n\nRoth: Again, it\u2019s a marriage of science and technology. (man speaking over radio) I want dollar meal\u2013 \u2026two chicken sandwich. \u2013 Man: Two small drinks, and give me a large Dr. Pepper. \u2013 $11.48. First window. Thank you. Maria Gonzalez: We didn\u2019t even think about healthy eating because we used to think everything was healthy. Maria: Now that I know that the food is really unhealthy for us, I feel guilty giving it to my kids. But we don\u2019t have time to cook because we leave at 6:00. We don\u2019t get home until 9:00, 10:00 at night. When you have only a dollar to spend and you have two kids to feed, either you go to the market and try to find something that\u2019s cheap or just go straight through a drive-thru and get two small hamburgers for them and \u201cOkay, here. Eat them.\u201d This is what\u2019s gonna fill her up, not that one single item at the market. Look at the broccoli. It\u2019s too expensive, man. First check to see how many are there for a pound. \u2013 Uh, we\u2019re not getting it. You\u2019d only get two or three. \u2013 Aww! Maria: We can find candy that\u2019s cheaper. We can find chips that are cheaper. The sodas are really cheap. Sometimes you look at a vegetable and say \u201cOkay, we can get two hamburgers over here for the same amount of price.\u201d\n\nPollan: Why is it that you can buy a double-cheeseburger at McDonald\u2019s for 99\u00a1\u00e9, and you can\u2019t even get a head of broccoli for 99\u00a1\u00e9? \u2013 We\u2019ve skewed our food system to the bad calories and it\u2019s not an accident. I mean, the reasons that those calories are cheaper is because those are the ones we\u2019re heavily subsidizing. And this is directly tied to the kind of agriculture that we\u2019re practicing and the kind of farm policies we have. All those snack-food calories are the ones that come from the commodity crops\u2013 from the wheat, from the corn and from the soybeans. By making those calories really cheap, that\u2019s one of the reasons that the biggest predictor of obesity is income level. Over the course of human history, we were struggling to make sure we had enough food and enough calories for a sizable percentage of the human race. Now the problem is too many calories. The industry blames obesity on a crisis of personal responsibility. But when you\u2019re engineering foods you are pressing our evolutionary buttons. The fact is we\u2019re hardwired to go for three tastes\u2013 salt, fat and sugar. These things are very rare in nature Now sugar is available 24/7 in tremendous quantities. We\u2019re eating hundreds of pounds of the stuff a year. This diet of high-fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates leads to these spikes of insulin and, gradually, a wearing down of the system by which our body metabolizes sugar. Maria: My husband\u2019s diabetic. One of my main concerns is he could lose his sight. He does get into\u2013 sometimes he\u2019s shaking, so I\u2019m afraid that he\u2019s gonna start not being able to drive, \u2019cause that\u2019s what he does for a profession. We have to consider his medicine. What is it, $70? 50 pills costs me about $130. Maria: But he\u2019s on two different types of pills. $100-and-something for one pill and then $100- and-something for another. That takes a lot of our income away. We\u2019re really tight from either paying for his medicine to be healthy or buying vegetables to be healthy. So which one should we do? It\u2019s hard to see my dad suffer with diabetes and stuff like that. And it\u2019s really sad to see that my sister might have it. There\u2019s something that\u2019s going on in the way that we live our lives, where we play, where we buy our food and the types of food that we\u2019re able to buy that is causing this epidemic. It\u2019s not just our community. It\u2019s not just Baldwin Park. It\u2019s everywhere. How many of us know one person in our family with diabetes? How about two? Three? Keep your hand\u2013 It used to be that type 2 diabetes only affected adults. And now it\u2019s affecting children at epidemic proportions. (kids laughing) (birds chirping) (chickens clucking)\nJoel Salatin: Everything we\u2019ve done in modern industrial agriculture is to grow it faster, fatter, bigger, cheaper. Nobody\u2019s thinking about E. coli, type 2 diabetes and the ecological health of the whole system. We\u2019re outsourcing autonomous farmer decision making\u2013 we\u2019re outsourcing that to corporate boardrooms in big cities 1,000 miles away where people make decisions and don\u2019t live with the consequences of those decisions. (cows mooing) Everything is grass based. You know, they don\u2019t eat corn, dead cows or chicken manure like they feed right here in the valley\u2013 or dead chickens. They actually eat grass, forage\u2013 you know, clover, grass, herbs. They\u2019re herbivores. If they were eating corn, you\u2019re gonna have to harvest that corn, transport that corn, then you\u2019re gonna have to haul all that manure somewhere that comes out the back end. Here\u2026 it\u2019s\u2013 there\u2013 there is the whole thing. I mean the cow is\u2013 she\u2019s fertilizing. She\u2019s mowing. We don\u2019t have to spread any manure. We don\u2019t have to harvest it\u2013 she\u2019s harvesting it. It\u2019s all real time\u2013 real solar dollars. The industrial food system gradually became so noisy, smelly, not a person-friendly place, that the people who operate those plants don\u2019t want anybody to go there, because then people would see the ugly truth. When that occurred, then we lost all the integrity and all the accountability in the food system. If we put glass walls on all the megaprocessing facilities, we would have a different food system in this country. (knife zinging)\n\nSalatin: We have allowed ourselves to become so disconnected and ignorant \u2013 \u2026as the food that we eat. What a difference this is to be out here in the fresh air, sunshine, birds singing in the trees, you know? But you see, according to the U.S.D.A, this is unsanitary because it\u2019s open to the air. They tried to close us down. One of the biggest showdowns we had was when they tried to close us down because this was unsanitary. Can you imagine? So we had them cultured at a local microbiology lab. Ours averaged 133 C.F.U. and the ones from the store averaged 3600. Of course, those have been through 40 trillion baths. Ours haven\u2019t seen any chlorine. A lot of people wonder \u201cIs this real? I mean, can you really feed the world?\u201d That whole thing is such a specious argument because, yes, we\u2019re every bit as efficient, especially if you plug in all of the inefficiencies of the industrial system. I\u2019ve had people come up at farmer\u2019s markets and say \u201cWhat? $3 a dozen for eggs?\u201d And they\u2019re drinking a 75\u00a1\u00e9 can of soda. Hey, pig. Hey, piggles. (snorting)\n\nHey, pigs. I\u2019m always struck by how successful we have been at hitting the bull\u2019s-eye of the wrong target. I mean we have learned\u2013 for example, in cattle we have learned how to\u2013 how to plant, fertilize and harvest corn using global positioning satellite technology, and nobody sits back and asks \u201cBut should we be feeding cows corn?\u201d We\u2019ve become a culture of technicians. We\u2019re all into\u2013 we\u2019re all into the how of it and nobody\u2019s stepping back and saying \u201cBut why?\u201d (laughs) I mean, a culture that just views a pig as a pile of protoplasmic inanimate structure to be manipulated by whatever creative design that humans can foist on that critter will probably view individuals within its community and other cultures in the community of nations with the same type of disdain, disrespect and controlling-type mentality. (snorting)\n\nEduardo Pe?a: The town where the plant is located is a small town called Tar Heel in the middle of a very economically-depressed area. Smithfield has mastered the art of picking and choosing a workforce that they can exploit, initially from the local workforce\u2013 the poor whites, the poor black. They went through that workforce very quickly. Now they have to bus their workers all the way from Dentsville, South Carolina, to Clinton, North Carolina. You have to draw a circle 100 miles in diameter, and that\u2019s where all of your workers are coming from. (people chatting)\n\nMan: They have the same mentality towards workers as they do towards the hogs. (squealing) Man: You know, the hog, they don\u2019t really have to worry about their comfort because they\u2019re temporary. They\u2019re gonna be killed. And they have the same viewpoint to the worker. You\u2019re not worried about the longevity of the worker because, to them, everything has an end. Man: When you\u2019ve got 2000 hogs an hour going through employees, because they\u2019re handling these guts so much, they get infections in their fingernails and all. All their fingernails separate from their fingers. with blood, feces, urine. It\u2019s easy to get hurt down there. Man: You\u2019re doing that same movement for that same piece of the hog and it\u2019s nonstop, you know. Basically you\u2019re treated as a human machine. You get people that can\u2019t afford to leave from out there, and Smithfield knows this. And that\u2019s what they hold over you.\n\nSchlosser: 100 years ago when Upton Sinclair wrote The Jungle there was a beef trust that wielded enormous power. Immigrants from Eastern Europe were being abused in the absence of any kind of government regulation There were horrible disfiguring injuries and even deaths.\n\nPollan: Things got better. They slowly got better.\n\nSchlosser: Teddy Roosevelt took on the beef trust. Labor unions slowly organized meatpacking workers and turned it into one of the best industrial jobs in the United States. By the 1950s to be a meatpacking worker was like being an auto worker who has a good wage, good benefits, pension. And then what happened? Well, the meat-packing companies got bigger in order to serve the needs of the fast-food industry, which was its biggest customer. Some of the meat-packing companies like IBP borrowed the same sort of labor practices from the fast food industry\u2013 cutting wages, making sure there were no unions, speeding up production, and having the worker do the same task again and again and again. And meat-packing is now one of the most dangerous jobs in the United States. The meat-packing industry also recruited a new set of immigrants\u2013 illegal immigrants and recent immigrants from Mexico. Many of the illegal immigrants coming to America were corn farmers in Mexico. NAFTA led to a flooding of the Mexican market with cheap American corn. It\u2019s put more than a million and a half Mexican farmers out of work. They couldn\u2019t compete with this cheap corn coming from America. (yelling)\n\nPollan: So what happens to those million and a half Mexican farmers?\n\nSchlosser: Meat packers like IBP, National Beef and Monfort began actively recruiting in Mexico. Companies advertised on the radio and in newspapers. IBP set up a bus service in Mexico to bring workers into the United States. For years the government turned a blind eye to the recruitment of immigrants by the meat-packing industry. But now, when there\u2019s an anti-immigrant movement, they\u2019re cracking down all of a sudden, but they\u2019re not cracking down on these companies. The government\u2019s cracking down on the workers. (clears throat) Pe?a: Immigration agents are arresting Smithfield workers Pe?a: This is an agreement between Smithfield and Immigrations authorities. They get rid of 15 workers per day, but you don\u2019t see any massive raids. That way it doesn\u2019t affect the production line. \u2013 Sir, we are trying\u2013 She is asking us questions, not you. I don\u2019t see anybody arresting no Smithfield managers. Nobody in the plant that had anything to do with the fact that those workers were hired is being arrested. What we see today is workers who were producing for this company and working hard\u2013 those are the people who get arrested. (man yelling in Spanish) Pe?a: We want to pay the cheapest price for our food. We don\u2019t understand that that comes at a price. These workers, they\u2019ve been here for 10, 15 years processing your bacon, your holiday ham and now they\u2019re getting picked up like they\u2019re criminals. (car starts) And these companies are making billions of dollars.\n\nSalatin: Is cheapness everything that there is? Who wants to buy the cheapest car? We\u2019re willing to subsidize the food system to create the \u201cmystique\u201d of cheap food, when actually it\u2019s very expensive food when you add up the environmental costs societal costs, health costs. The industrial food is not honest food. It\u2019s not priced honestly. It\u2019s not produced honestly. It\u2019s not processed honestly. There\u2019s nothing honest about that food. I can\u2019t think of a better use for a Smithfield box. Man: It was about a five-hour drive maybe 300, 400 miles. So yeah. It\u2019s worth it.\n\nSalatin: I have no desire to scale up or get bigger. My desire is to produce the best food in the world and heal. And if in doing so more people come to our corner and want stuff, then heaven help me figure out how to meet the need without compromising the integrity. That\u2013 that\u2019s where I am. I have absolutely no desire to be at Wal-Mart. As soon as you grasp for that growth, you\u2019re gonna view your customer differently, you\u2019re gonna view your product differently, you\u2019re gonna view your business differently. You\u2019re gonna view everything that is the most important\u2013 you\u2019re gonna view that differently. (snorting) (people chatting) This is our new organic line of popcorn. This is Vitasoy soy milk, the best soy milk in the entire world. This entire show when it first started was the size of this column right here.\n\nMan: Uh-huh. Several of us were sleeping in our booths. We couldn\u2019t afford hotel rooms. Organic\u2019s been growing over 20% annually. It\u2019s one of the fastest-growing segments in the food industry. My God! Ah! We\u2019re not gonna get rid of capitalism. Certainly we\u2019re not gonna get rid of it in the time that we need to arrest global warming and reverse the toxification of our air, our food and our water. We need to be much more urgent. If we attempt to make perfect the enemy of the good and say we\u2019re only going to buy food from the most-perfect system within 100 miles of us, we\u2019re never gonna get there. As an environmentalist, it was pretty clear to me that business was the source of all the pollution, business was the source of basically all the things that were destroying this world. In college I came across this little institute called New Alchemy Institute, which was a group of renegade biologists. My hope is to give you\u2013\n\nHirshberg: We were preaching a kind of a new religion, trying to develop food and waste-treatment alternatives, but we were preaching to the convinced. We were depending on sources of support that were dried up and we weren\u2019t reaching the audience that really needed these messages. I realized we need to not be David up against Goliath. We need to be Goliath. (clacking)\n\nHirshberg: When we started out, we were a seven-cow farm. We wanted to prove that business could be part of the solution to the globe\u2019s environmental problems. At the same time we had to prove that we could be highly profitable. Today in 2008, not only are in America, but we\u2019re among the most profitable. See, this is the interesting thing. A little company like this is now Kraft, but you don\u2019t have any idea that it\u2019s Kraft. This is now Pepsi. That\u2019s now Kellogg\u2019s. \u2013 Man: Kashi is Kellogg\u2019s? Yeah, this is one of those companies that started like us. \u2013 Well, it\u2019s\u2013 Make them successful, basically. The jury is out. I have to put it that way.\n\nHirshberg: These large companies don\u2019t grow organically. They grow by acquisition. Coke, Pepsi, Kellogg\u2019s, General Mills\u2013 all of them are running, not walking, into the organic food business.\n\nHirshberg: For me, when a Wal-Mart enters the organic space, I\u2019m thrilled. It\u2019s absolutely one of the most exciting things. I have dreamed of the day when I could sit with corporate titans and have conversations about organics and sustainability. \u2013 Hi Amanda. I\u2019m Rand. Okay, help me figure out where\u2013 \u2013 You\u2019re with Wal-Mart. Yup. Do you know that we don\u2019t go to Wal-Mart? \u2013 We\u2019ve never been. \u2013 Isn\u2019t that amazing? Yeah, we\u2019ve never been. We just started boycotting a long time ago and we just kept riding on that.\n\nHirshberg: Wal-Mart is terribly sensitive to their reputation. They\u2019ve obviously been vilified, probably more than any retailer in our current economy. Actually, it\u2019s a pretty easy decision to try to support things like organic, or whatever it might be, based on what the customer wants. We see that and react to it. So if it\u2019s clear the customer wants it, it\u2019s really easy to get behind it, to push forward and try to make that happen.\n\nHirshberg: When I run into my old environmental friends, many are initially horrified by the kinds of company that I\u2019m keeping these days. But when I then go on to explain what the impact of one purchase order from Wal-Mart is, in terms of not pounds but tons of pesticide, tons of herbicide, tons of chemical fertilizer, the discussion\u2013 we get away from the emotion and we get down to the facts. This is really key, though, what you guys are doing here. I have no illusions about this. I don\u2019t believe that Wal-Mart has come here because they\u2019ve suddenly had a moral enlightenment. It\u2019s because of economics. I can debate with my radical friends all day long, but nobody can challenge the fact that a sale of another million dollars to Wal-Mart helps to save the world.\n\nPollan: Back around the turn of the last century, the average farmer could feed six or eight people. Now the average American farmer can feed 126 people, okay? These are the most productive humans that have ever lived. The changes down on the farm have been momentous and radical but invisible to most of us, \u2019cause who knows a farmer anymore? But their way of life has been revolutionized. Roush: 10,000 years ago, farmers started saving their best seeds and planted again in the following year. That\u2019s how seeds have been developed. That\u2019s how corn was developed from a useless grass for the most part to the extremely productive plant it is today.\n\nPollan: The idea that any corporation could own a food crop is a very new idea. It wasn\u2019t until the 1980s that the Supreme Court said you could patent life. And that opened the floodgates\u2013 efforts to patent the most valuable parts of life, which is to say the crops on which we depend.\n\nRoush: Monsanto is a chemical company. They produced DDT, Agent Orange in Vietnam, and then they developed a product called \u201cRoundup.\u201d We started hearing rumblings about genetically-engineered soybeans that could resist the application of Roundup. When the Roundup was sprayed over top of it, it killed every weed out there except for this Roundup Ready soybean.\n\nRoush: I can remember when the first prohibition against seed saving came into being. Most farmers were just absolutely disgusted with the whole concept. It\u2019s been interesting over the course of 11 years to watch us go from utter contempt for the notion that we can\u2019t save our own seed to acceptance. Man: What happens if a farmer saves the seeds? (chuckles) Well, you know, really there\u2019s only one company involved in this now and that\u2019s Monsanto. Monsanto is\u2026 They\u2019ve got a team of private investigators that kind of roam the country and they\u2019ve got a little 1-800 hotline they take calls on. If they get a call and somebody alleges that somebody saved seed, they\u2019ll send an investigator out to look into the matter. If you save your own seed, you\u2019re gonna get a call from somebody from Monsanto. David Runyon: Two men drove in my driveway at 7:00, 7:30 at night, presented a black card to me and they never told me that they were from Monsanto. Man: They said that they had had a surveillance team, caught me cleaning beans. Moe Parr: I found it necessary to get up at 3:00 and 4:00 in the morning before the investigators are on the road following me.\n\nRunyon: They were\u2013 I\u2019m gonna say maybe ex-military or ex-police. They were large and they were intimidating. Man: I don\u2019t know whether they had their surveillance team or whether it was my neighbor that turned me in. I don\u2019t know. Now as I turned to walk in the house, one of them said\u2013 I could hear in the back\u2013 He\u2019s guilty.\n\nRunyon: It\u2019s a real ingenious device designed back in the 1800s, and Monsanto\u2019s gonna close all of them out. So how many seed cleaners are out there in the country do you think? In the state of Indiana, there may be six. Maybe. I\u2019m not aware of\u2013 Have they all been put out of business? There\u2019s nobody left.\n\nRunyon: When Monsanto soybeans first came on the market, I just never really switched over. I was getting pretty good yield with the conventional soybeans I\u2019d been using, so I thought \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just stay where I\u2019m at.\u201d My neighbors all around me are all GMOs. If the pollen goes in, if the seed moves in, I am still held accountable. Pollan: When you genetically modify a crop, you own it. We\u2019ve never had this in agriculture.\n\nRoush: Used to be that your land-grant universities, they developed what was called public seed. The vast majority of the plant breeding was actually done in these public institutions Pollan: Monsanto is very much like Microsoft. The same way Microsoft owns the intellectual property behind most computers in America, they set out to own the intellectual property behind most of the food in America.\n\nRoush: Public plant breeding is a thing of the past. There virtually are no public seeds anymore. Runyon: There\u2019s only like four or five varieties that I can actually plant. Now I have some of the last soybeans coming out of the state of Illinois\u2013 When it comes to the point that I can\u2019t buy any more certified seed, what do I do? What are my options? I acquired this list that was mailed to me. The black list here is Monsanto\u2019s unauthorized growers list. Wow. Either farmers that have judgments against them, or businesses, or else it\u2019s\u2013 or it\u2019s farmers that have not submitted their paperwork, will not turn over their records. For my case, that\u2019s why I\u2019m on there\u2013 \u2019cause I would not turn over my records. Wow. I see two of the farmers that I work for on here. This list\u2013 now it comes down to the point where I cannot buy Monsanto products, okay? Right. So it\u2019s coming down to What can I plant? Parr: Monsanto is suing me on the basis that I\u2019m encouraging the farmer to break the patent law by cleaning their own seed. I haven\u2019t been in a courtroom yet and my bill is already $25,000. People that were friends of mine now are reticent to even talk with me. We\u2019ve been friends for 50 years, and now we can hardly be seen together. Right. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m really guilty, but it was cheaper to pay the fine than it was to try to fight it. \u2026because if you think you\u2019re right at something, but yet you admit you\u2019re wrong.\n\nRoush: Monsanto falsely accused us of violating their patent and breach of contract. None of it was true. You go into a market, you find a dominant farmer and if you can ruin them, you scare the rest of them to following the line. My family spent $400,000 fighting the battle, pretrial. And we were told it would take another million to take the thing to trial. We settled out of court. The way the system appeared to work to me was Lady Justice had the scales and you piled cash on the scales and the one that piled the most cash on the scales, hired the most experts and was most willing to tell the biggest lies, that was the winner. That seems to be how our justice system functions now. It\u2019s terrible. It\u2019s terrible. How can a farmer defend himself against a multinational corporation like Monsanto? I talked to a young man just three days ago. They\u2019d been to his farm, you know? And this poor kid, he\u2019s just starting out. His fianc\u00a8\u00a6e was there. I talked to her and tried to give them the best advice I could. Unfortunately the best advice I could give them was \u201cTry to get out of this thing with your skin intact. Don\u2019t fight \u2018em. You\u2019ve got to roll over and give them what they want, \u2019cause you can\u2019t defend yourself.\u201d In the case of Monsanto, their control is so dominant. If you want to be in production agriculture, you\u2019re gonna be in bed with Monsanto. They own the soybean. They are going to control that product from seed to the supermarket. They are, in effect, gaining control of food.\n\nPollan: There has been this revolving door between Monsanto\u2019s corporate offices and the various regulatory and judicial bodies that have made the key decisions.\n\nRoush: Justice Clarence Thomas was a Monsanto attorney. That wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal if it weren\u2019t for one court case that really decided this whole seed-saving issue. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion in a case that allowed these companies to prevent farmers from saving their own seed. Pollan: Monsanto had very close ties to the Bush administration\u2026 and the Clinton administration. This goes to why we haven\u2019t had much political debate over this radical change to our food system.\n\nPollan: For the last 25 years, our government has been dominated by the industries that it was meant to be regulating.\n\nSchlosser: The challenge is as soon as you have people with expertise in industry, they may turn out to be very good regulators. It\u2019s really about what interests they decide to represent. You\u2019re talking about power\u2013 centralized power and that power is being used against the people who are really producing the food like the farmers. It\u2019s being used against the workers who work for these companies and it\u2019s being used against consumers who are deliberately being kept in the dark about what they\u2019re eating, where it comes from and what it\u2019s doing to their bodies. (kids laughing)\n\nWoman: Good afternoon, Madame Chair and members. SB-63 is a consumer right-to-know measure. It simply requires that all foods that are cloned must be labeled as cloned foods. These cloned animals are a fundamentally new thing. But I find it incredible that the FDA not only wants to allow the sale of meat from cloned animals without further research, but also wants to allow the sale of this meat without any labeling. How many witnesses in opposition, please? Noelle Cremers with California Farm Bureau. And if I can point out\u2013 the reason that we are concerned with labeling is it creates unnecessary fear in a consumer\u2019s mind. Until the industry has an opportunity to educate why we want to use this technology and the value of the technology, we don\u2019t feel that consumers just having a warning label will help them. (chatting)\n\nPollan: These companies fight tooth and nail against labeling. The fast food industry fought against giving you the calorie information. They fought against telling you if there\u2019s trans fat in their food. The meat packing industry for years prevented country-of-origin labeling. They fought not to label genetically modified foods, and now 78% of the processed food in the supermarket has some genetically- modified ingredient. I think it\u2019s one of the most important battles for consumers to fight\u2013 is the right to know what\u2019s in their food and how it was grown. Not only do they not want you to know what\u2019s in it, they have managed to make it against the law to criticize their products. Man: Can you tell me how you\u2019ve changed how you eat? Yeah, we\u2013 you\u2019ll probably have to talk to an attorney before you would put this in there. What? You can say this is\u2013 we\u2019ve stopped\u2013 I know, but\u2013 I could have the meat and poultry industry coming after me and I really\u2013 Seriously? For saying\u2013 that it\u2019s so\u2013 It depends on the context. You\u2019re not saying Someone else don\u2019t eat it. Yeah, I\u2019m sorry, Robbie, but I get asked this all the time. Initially, my reaction was \u201cI don\u2019t care. Let them sue me. Let them try and sue the mother of a dead child and see.\u201d It\u2019s pretty amazing that you can\u2019t say \u2013 how you and your family have changed\u2013 (stammers) are different. The food industry has different protections than other industries do. We have a lot of questions about this mad cow disease.\n\nKowalcyk: If you recall the case where Oprah was sued by the meat industry for something she said on her show. It has just stopped me cold from eating another burger. \u2013 Good morning, y\u2019all. it\u2019s finally winding down? Well, I think I can say that, right? I can say that, yeah. I can see the end in sight.\n\nSchlosser: In Colorado it\u2019s a felony if you\u2019re convicted under a veggie libel law. So you could go to prison for criticizing the ground beef that\u2019s being produced in the state of Colorado. There is an effort in several farm states to make it illegal to publish a photo of any industrial food operation, any feedlot operation.\n\nSchlosser: At the same time, they\u2019ve also gotten bills passed that are called cheeseburger bills that make it very very difficult for you to sue them. These companies have legions of attorneys and they may sue even though they know they can\u2019t win just to send a message. Man: We are on record for the deposition of Maurice Parr in the matter of Monsanto Company and Monsanto Technology versus Maurice Parr. your bank records in this case. Do you know that? Parr: I\u2019ll tell you, what really scared me the most today was the fact that they have every check that I have written from every bank account that I\u2019ve used in the last 10 years. Mr. Parr? Three. this Dell computer? Which ones are soybean seed cleaning customers? Parr: These people are not just customers, they\u2019re personal friends. It\u2019s extremely heart-wrenching for me to know that this list is in the possession of Monsanto. Harold Sinn? Beans only. Stephen Pennell: This is the first case in which a seed company is suing the person who does the cleaning of the seed. So if Monsanto\u2019s claims are upheld in this case, that would not only put Moe out of business, but it would prohibit every grower in the country from doing what Moe does as a precedent in future cases. Have any of these customers specifically told you that they are not going to use Parr\u2019s voice: This essentially puts me out of business. \u2013 Parr\u2019s voice: I\u2019m finished. Jerry Kaufman. Bill Zeering. Robert Duvall.\n\nPollan: We\u2019ve had a food system that\u2019s been dedicated to the single virtue of efficiency, so we grow a very small number of crops, a very small number of varieties, a very small number of companies. And even though you achieve efficiencies, the system gets more and more precarious. You will have a breakdown eventually. And where the breakdown comes in the system we don\u2019t always know.\n\nRoush: Modern production agriculture is highly dependent on large amounts of petroleum. Our farm, we\u2019re going to use about 40,000 gallons of diesel fuel a year.\n\nPollan: We eat a lot of oil without knowing it. To bring a steer to slaughter, it\u2019s 75 gallons of oil. So what we\u2019re seeing is that this highly-efficient machine does not have the resilience to deal with shocks such as the spike in oil prices. Food prices last month were 3.9% higher than they were a year ago. Take corn, another basic source of food, up to a 12-year high.\n\nPollan: For a while, we could sell grains so cheaply anywhere in the world, farmers in other countries who aren\u2019t being subsidized could not compete with us. So their capacity to grow food for themselves was compromised.\n\nRoush: The world\u2019s running out of food and nobody\u2019s talking about it. We have no reserves. Man: There have been protests around the world. The food crisis has already brought down one government.\n\nPollan: A month doesn\u2019t go by where there isn\u2019t a story in the news that peels back the curtain on how that industrial food is made. (mooing pitifully) Man: Downer cows\u2013 too ill or lame to walk\u2013 being brutalized to get them to their feet for slaughter. Woman: Millions of gallons of concentrated hog manure flushing their contents downriver. Government\u2019s food czar reported that there are no tools in place to track the origin of the latest salmonella outbreak.\n\nPollan: Every time one of these stories comes out, America learns a little bit more\u2013 what\u2019s going on in the kitchen where their food is being prepared. And every time they turn away in revulsion and start looking for alternatives.\n\nHirshberg: The irony is that the average consumer does not feel very powerful. They think they are the recipients of whatever industry has put out there for them to consume. Trust me, it\u2019s the exact opposite. When we run an item past the supermarket scanner, we\u2019re voting for local or not, organic or not. At Wal-Mart, we made a decision about a year ago to go through a process of becoming rBST-free in our milk supply. We made that decision based on customer preference.\n\nHirshberg: Individual consumers changed the biggest company on earth and in so doing, probably put the last nail in the coffin for synthetic growth hormone.\n\nPollan: To eat well in this country costs more than to eat badly. It will take more money and some people simply don\u2019t have it. And that\u2019s one of the reasons that we need changes at the policy level, so that the carrots are a better deal than the chips.\n\nSchlosser: People think \u201cThese companies are so big and so powerful, how are we ever going to change things?\u201d But look at the tobacco industry. It had huge control over public policy and that control was broken. The battle against tobacco is a perfect model of how an industry\u2019s irresponsible behavior can be changed. (people talking)\n\nSalatin: Imagine what it would be if, as a national policy, we said we would be only successful if we had fewer people going to the hospital next year than last year. How about that for success? The idea then would be to have such nutritionally dense unadulterated food that people who ate it actually felt better, had more energy, and weren\u2019t sick as much. Now see, that\u2019s a noble goal.\n\nKowalcyk: I can\u2019t change the fact that Kevin\u2019s dead. When you tell somebody you\u2019ve lost a child, I really don\u2019t like that look of pity that comes into their eyes, that they feel sorry for me. I can have a pity party all by myself very well, thank you. I don\u2019t need it from other people. What I need them to do is listen and help me effect a change. Roush: You have to understand that we farmers, we\u2019re gonna deliver to the marketplace what the marketplace demands. If you want to buy $2 milk, you\u2019re gonna get a feedlot in the backyard. It\u2019s that simple. People have got to start demanding good, wholesome food of us. And we\u2019ll deliver. I promise you. We\u2019re very ingenious people. We\u2019ll deliver. That\u2019s all I had to say. (\u201cThis Land is Your Land\u201d playing) (audience cheering)\n\nWhen I rode that ribbon highway\n\nI saw above me\n\nThe endless skyway\n\nI saw below me\n\nThe golden valley\n\nWell, this land was made for you and me\n\nI roamed and rambled\n\nI followed my footsteps\n\nThrough the sparkling sands of\n\nHer diamond deserts\n\nAnd all around me\n\nA voice was calling\n\nIt said \u201cThis

said \u201cThis land was made for you and me\u201d\n\nThis land is your land\n\nThis land is my land\n\nFrom California\n\nTo the New York islands\n\nFrom the redwood forest\n\nTo the Gulf Stream

mummified\nSometimes I feel so isolated, I wanna die\nAnd I'll take it from you if you got it every time\nSo baby, bring your body here next to mine, next to mine\nWhen I don't wanna a thing, I just wanna live it\nSo baby, let's not miss this thing\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThe big, big bang\nThe reason I'm alive\nWhen all the stars collide\nIn this universe inside\nThe big, big bang\nThe
