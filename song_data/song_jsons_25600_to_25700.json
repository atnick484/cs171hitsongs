day\nLetting you down every day\nWhy do I keep on running away?\n\n[Verse 1: JAY-Z]\nLook, I apologize, often womanize\nTook for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes\nTook for these natural twins to believe in miracles\nTook me too long for this song, I don't deserve you\nI harassed you out in Paris\n\"Please come back to Rome, you make it home\"\nWe talked for hours when you were on tour\n\"Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!\"\nI said: \"Don't embarrass me\" instead of \"Be mine\"\nThat was my proposal for us to go steady\nThat was your 21st birthday\nYou matured faster than me, I wasn't ready\nSo I apologize\nI seen the innocence leave your eyes\nI still mourn its death and\nI apologize for all the stillborns\n'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it\nI apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions\n'Cause I was emotionless\nAnd I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love\nAnd because I fall short of what I say I'm all about\nYour eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed\nAnd you stare blankly into space\nThinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit\nSo I apologize\n[Chorus: Kim Burrell]\nI'm never gonna treat you\nI'm never gonna treat you like I should\nOh\n\n[Verse 2: JAY-Z]\nI apologize\nOur love was one for the ages and I contained us\nAnd all this ratchet shit and we more expansive\nNot meant to cry and die alone in these mansions\nOr sleep with our back turned\nWe supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn\nWe're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops\nAnd then meet in a space where the dark stop\nAnd let love light the way\nLike the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face\nI never wanted another woman to know\nSomething about me that you didn't know\nI promised, I cried, I couldn't hold\nI suck at love, I think I need a do-over\nI will be emotionally available if I invited you over\nI stew over; \"What if\u2014\"\n\"You over my shit?\"\n\n[Chorus: Kim Burrell]\nI'm never gonna treat you\nI'm never gonna treat you like I should\nOh\nYou might also like[Verse 3: JAY-Z]\nAnd if my children knew\nI don't even know what I would do\nIf they ain't look at me the same\nI would prob'ly die with all the shame\n\"You did what with who?\"\nWhat good is a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois when you have a soulmate?\n\"You risked that for Blue?\"\nIf I wasn't a superhero in your face\nMy heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes\nAnd the mask goes away\nAnd Santa Claus is fake\nAnd you go online and see\nFor Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay\n\n[Chorus: Hannah Williams]\nI'm never gonna treat you like I should75Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 28, "api_path": "/songs/3099469", "artist_names": "Gucci Mane (Ft.

chance\nAnd breaks this, I won't be the one\nNo, I won't be the one\n[Verse 2]\nI know it's pathetic\nFuck it, yeah, I said it\nTried to tell it like it is\nThere's a chance that I'll regret it, so\nLet's go, let's end this\nI delete before I send it\nAnd we can play pretend\nLike we haven't reached the end yet\n\n[Chorus]\nDown and down we go\nAnd we'll torch this place we know\nBefore one

read-through\nYeah, all of my brothers, we equal\nI play my part too, like a sequel\nYou tell your niggas you got 'em on anything\nQuestion is, do they believe you?\n'Specially when you never come through\nSo much hate inside your heart\nWe don't even know what we done to you\nWe just know shit gettin' run through\nNever chase it, let it come to you\nYou out here tellin' everybody everything\nYou niggas move like the one-two, yeah\n[Refrain: Jorja Smith]\nWhen you see them fall down\nBut you pick 'em up\nYou still let them touch the ground\nDon't worry, I swear\nThey'll know you're trying to help 'em\nThey'll know you're trying to help 'em\nThey'll know you're trying to help 'em\nThey'll know you're trying to help 'em\nThey'll know, they'll know\n\n[Outro: Drake]\nAnd

stylin\u2019 though\nDissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though\nAll the things you need, you still want problems though\nAll the things I know, I still been silent though\nYeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo\nUsed to be in lunchroom, playin\u2019 dominoes\nI don't want to have to go to funerals\nI gotta start sleepin' at the studio\nI don't have no time to be no Romeo\nAll the love I need is at the rodeo\nAll the love I need is here at OVO, yeah\nAll the girls I know are there with E and Tho\nWho knows where I end up when that shit gets old?\nMaybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes\nLast table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone\nI take a glass of Domina to go with me home\nMight move our annual shit to the 'Dome\nI need forty-thousand people to see what I'm on\nYeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves\nI was an angry yute while I was writin\u2019 Views\nSaw a side of myself that I just never knew\nI\u2019ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do\nSteady doin' double shifts\n1da doin\u2019 the beat and I open up like a double click\nMore blessings because I'm generous\nThirty-seater plane for like ten of us\nRemember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet\nShe knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it\nNowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it\nCan't describe what my life is like when she asks about it\nScary whenever I close my eyes at night\nWakin\u2019 up to public statements about my private life\nI can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights\nBut you can rest assured that my mind is right\nGet no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days\nNever stick around to see shit change\nGet lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'\nSeasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'\nWent from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV\nTo not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'\nI can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this\nDistractions will do you in, in the truest sense\nEspecially people that want to lecture me\nAnd frame it like they just want the best for me\nOr they check for me, whatever splits it up\nSo there's more for them and there's less for me\nThey don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me\nNo one's done it successfully\n7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me\nLast verse that I gotta do is always like surgery\nAlways tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me\nThat's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency\nLast chance I get to make sure that you take it personally\nTake this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly\nIf we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me\nYou overnight celebrity, you one day star\nSwear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity\nI am a reflection of all of your insecurities\nBehind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping\nDone talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me\nThere's real ones around me\nI want to make sure they learn from me\nI want to see my dawg, but his grandmother's his surety\nHe can't even dip out to see me in an emergency\nMy life is centered 'round competition and currency\nTakin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery\nMaybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me\nI'll be back 2018 to give you the summary\nMore LifeSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might

But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated.

Cole]\nMy intuition is telling me there'll be better days, yeah\nMy intuition is telling me there'll be better days\nI like this tone\n\n[Verse 1: J. Cole]\nYeah, my intuition is telling me there'll be better days\nI sit in silence and find whenever I meditate\nMy fears alleviate, my tears evaporate\nMy faith don't deviate, ideas don't have a date\nBut see I'm growing and getting stronger with every breath\nBringing me closer to Heaven's doors with every step\nAs we speak I'm at peace, no longer scared to die\nMost niggas don't believe in God and so they terrified\nIt's either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell\nAsking the Father for forgiveness, got 'em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)\nAs if He's spiteful like them white folks that control the jail\nSee I believe if God is real, He'd never judge a man\nBecause He knows us all and therefore He would understand\nThe ignorance that make a nigga take his brother life\nThe bitterness and pain that got him beating on his wife\n[Chorus: J. Cole]\nI know you desperate for a change let the pen glide\nBut the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)\nBut the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)\nBut the only real change come from\u2014\nIn cemeteries or in chains I see men cry\nBut the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)\nBut the only real change come from inside (Come from inside)\nBut the only real change come from\u2014\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nYeah, my chosen religion\nJesus piece frozen from sinnin'\nDoin' dirt, hoping to God, He know my intentions\nTo see a million 'fore I see a casket\nI got a baby on the way, know he gon' be a bastard\nI'm living fast like I'm in a drag race, how that cash taste\nWhen I was a senior, I was ballin' on my classmates\nNiggas put three bullets in my car, one hit the gas tank\nKnow I got a angel cause I'm supposed to have a halo\nRight now, my lifestyle destined for a federal facility\nFor my ability to make them birds fly\nFiends wanna get higher than a bird's eye view\nAnd who am I to tell a nigga what to do?\nI just supply, it's economics\nMy business ain't got the suit and tie\nKeep a pistol at all times, niggas want what's mine\nI can't oblige, dog, I work too hard\nSo reach for it, get referred to God, I'm going hard, nigga\nYou might also like[Chorus: J.

Cole]\nYeah, prodigal son, got a new gun\nThis one don't run out of ammo\nLately been working on my handles\nCan I ball, become a star and remain my self?\nIf I fall, dust it off and regain my self\nFuck 'em all, they don't know all the pain I felt\nI'm in awe, after all the fame I felt, I evolved\nI no longer bury demons, I be a vessel for the truth until I'm barely breathing, I'm singing\n\n[Bridge: Ari Lennox & J. Cole]\nLife is all about the evolution\nI give up, I give in, I move back a little\nI live up, I look up, now I'm back for more\nYou can dream but don't neglect the execution\nI give up, I give in, I move back a little\nI live up, I look up, now I'm back for more\nTime is short that's what somebody told me\nI give up, I give in, I move back a little\nI live up, I look up, now I'm back for more\nToo short to keep following your homies\nI give up, I give in, I move back a little\nI live up, I look up, now I'm back for more\n[Bridge: J. Cole]\nI reminisce back to a time where niggas threw they hands\nAll of a sudden niggas pop a trunk and then we scram\nFinger on trigger make a little nigga understand\nWhat it's like to finally be the motherfuckin' man\nEyes wide that's from the power that the coward feels\nNiggas die over bitches, disrespect, and dollar bills\nBloodshed that turned the city to a battlefield\nI call it poison, you call it real (pop, pop, pop, pop)\nThat's how you feel?\n\n[Verse 4: J. Cole]\nPistols be poppin' and niggas drop in a heartbeat\nScattered like roaches, a body laid on the concrete\nA body laid on the concrete\nLook, somebody laid on the concrete\nNo time for that, ain't no lookin' back, cause I'm running too\nI made it home, I woke up and turned on the morning news\nOvercame with a feeling I can't explain\nCause that was my nigga James that was slain, he was 22\n(Last night at around...) He was 22\n(22 year old black male, suspect, reporting live...)\n\n[Outro: J.

when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies\nFeel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries\nThen bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it\nHe was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement\nHe let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment\nThen he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission\nWe probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him\nFeel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know\nFeel like the difference between us really startin' to show\nI'm lookin at they first week numbers like, \"What are those?\"\nI mean, you boys not even coming close\nI gave niggas like you a reason for celebration\nYou number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places\nLook in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear\nCreepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care\nNo tender love and care, no love and affection\nI got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting\nI might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson\nFeel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together\nYeah, but here we are and it's a new semester\n40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure\nA couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'\nA lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation\nYour best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day\nYou treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday\nYou don't be scorin' perfect\nYou don't be workin' like how we be workin'\nYou platinum like wrappers\nOn Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless\nYou get the message over and over like it was urgent\nAnd then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person\nThe only thing I did to end up here was put the work in\nAnd did it with a purpose\nUsed to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships\nNowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension\nA lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned\nShout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention\nIt's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder\nThe most successful rapper 35 and under\nI'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under\nThat's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded\nYeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin\nShe violated, I sent her back where it all started\nHow quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment\nLeave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness\nTold my momma that I found a lady in the east\nCancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite\nDon Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free\nI get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me\nYou wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique\nLast time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats\nI used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat\nNow the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE\nThe best ever, don't ever question, you know better\nBut shit ain\u2019t always how it seems when it\u2019s sewn together\nYeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it\nWeston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled\nDon't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal\nDon't let your newfound fame fool you\nOr cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this\nBeen flowin' stupid since Vince Carter\nWas on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit\nDrinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it\nY'all was so afraid to lay claim to it\nToo busy face screwin' on waste movements\nYou was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'\nFirst take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it\nAnd they still take to it\nBig Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid\nAnd we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it\nBut money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful\nBut I'm happiest when I can buy what I want\nGet high when I want\n[Outro]\nYeah, that's right, yeahSee Drake LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like34Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

trying to be there and to care\nAnd you're caught up in your permanent emotions\nAnd all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed\nIt's just floating in the air, lookie there\nAre you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?\nIf I wasn't me, would you still feel me?\nLike on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?\nI don't care about the lights or the beams\nSpend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me\nOnly way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain\nYou, you, you, you and me could calm a war down\nYou, you, you, you and me could make it rain now\nYou, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought\n\n[Verse 2]\nNine times out of ten, I'm in my feelings\nBut ten times out of nine, I'm only human\nTell me, what did I do wrong?\nFeel like that question has been posed, I'm movin' on\nI always been committed, I been focused\nI always paid attention, been devoted\nTell me, what did I do wrong?\nOh, already asked that, my bad\nBut you my lifeline, think you tryna kill me\nIf I wasn't B, would you still feel me?\nLike on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?\nI don't care about the lights or the beams\nSpend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me\nOnly way to go is up, them old bitches so wack\nI'm so tough, wassup?\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain\nYou, you, you, you and me could calm a war down\nYou, you, you, you and me could make it rain now\nAnd you, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought\nYou might also like[Outro]\nYou, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought\nYou, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought33Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 12, "api_path": "/songs/2412668", "artist_names": "Kanye West (Ft.

stressing you that blessing that's sent from heaven\nThese days start to feel like hours and hours feel more like seconds\nPeople judged us they couldn't see the connection\nWhen I look at you, it's like I'm looking back at my reflection\nI don't see nothing different, our pigments they coincide\nWe hold each other so tight they couldn't break us if they tried\nMy eyes are are those of the blind, I see no color or size\nI feel the love in your touch and I trust what's inside your mind, okay\nI know that we've been through a lot\nI know that we both grew up\nYou know I missed you a lot\nWhen I was young I was dumb\nDidn't think you'd fit in my plot\nAnd I appreciate the break because I love what we got now\nYou give me chills and I can't imagine you leaving\nIf I could build a perfect person honestly you would be it\nAnd you know nobody knows you like I know you\nI can't wait to come back home so I can hold you, yeah\nYou might also like[Chorus: A Great Big World]\nSomething

there's nothing left in mine\nI feel myself runnin' out of time\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Louis, Louis & Liam]\nAnd now I'm one step closer to being\nTwo steps far from you\nWhen everybody wants you\nEverybody

I'm not really sure what else you expected\nWhen the higher-ups have all come together as a collective\nWith conspiracies to end my run and send me a message\n40, did you get the message?\n'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it\nI mean, I'll say hats off for a solid effort\nBut we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together (6)\nYeah, not here to fight wars\nBut niggas wanna talk high scores\nPARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche\nAnd I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for\nBut I got bigger fish to fry\nI'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I\nKids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine\nAnd if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified\nWrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night\nFlyin' over Chattanooga, out here tryna spread the movement\nI just got me the Mercedes Pullman\nYou niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google, yeah\nBack in the city, shit is gettin' brutal\nThese kids'll hit your noodle, then take a girl to the movies\nThey been droppin' out on both sides\nWe ain't in it, we just ghostride\nThe pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines\nI thought you wanted yours like I want mine\nI guess you just makin' moves on your own time\nBut just know it'll be January in no time\nAnd your absence is very concernin'\nIt's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin'\nShit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30\nBanners are ready case we need to retire your jersey, yeah\nI got a club in the Raptors arena\nChampionship celebrations durin' regular season\nPaternity testin' for women that I never slept with\nI'm legally obligated if they request it\nSo much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson\nLuckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction\nUsed to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting\nAw, nigga, that shit gotta go platinum\nI just listened to \"Closer to My Dreams\"\nWide-eyed and uneducated at nineteen\nI can't rap like that, all young and na\u00efve\nNot after all the shit I seen and the things I believe\nDrastically changin', thank you for all your patience\nI'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it\nFour thousand square feet just isn't as spacious\nYou loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it\nI'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways\nTired of champagne toasts with people that look away\nPeyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother\nThe season start and I don't wanna see you end up with nothin'\nY'all throw the word \"family\" around too much in discussion\nRookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'\nThey knees give out and they passin' to you all of the sudden\nNow you the one gettin' buckets\nThey put they arm around you, now you becomin' the crutches\nKids got on your number 'cause you the one they look up to\nAnd women that you seen on TV look better in person\nAnd either they wanna fuck you\nOr convince you that they care and see where it goes from there, but\nThese ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action\nThe hate is just bringin' me and my people closer, actually\nWhat happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?\nAre we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?\nWe just supposed to get the pie, then split it in two?\nSupposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?\nMy plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf\nAnd treat the money like secrets, keep the shit to ourself\nPapi champ\u00fa, young Pablito de seis dios\n6 G-O-D, I think I\nWas destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I.\nAnd Young Dro was poppin' off with \"Ain't I\"\nWay before niggas had they hands out like they doin' macarena\nBut, who am I to complain

Dre]\nYou are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nStraight outta Compton!\nCrazy motherfucker named Ice Cube\nFrom the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes\nWhen I'm called off, I got a sawed-off\nSqueeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off\nYou too, boy, if you fuck with me\nThe police are gonna have to come and get me\nOff your ass, that's how I'm going out\nFor the punk motherfuckers that's showing out\nNiggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble\nMix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo\nGoing off on the motherfucker like that\nWith a gat that's pointed at your ass\nSo give it up smooth\nAin't no telling when I'm down for a jack move\nHere's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'\nWith a crime record like Charles Manson\nAK-47 is the tool\nDon't make me act a motherfucking fool\nMe you can go toe to toe, no maybe\nI'm knocking niggas out the box, daily\nYo, weekly, monthly and yearly\nUntil them dumb motherfuckers see clearly\nThat I'm down with the capital C-P-T\nBoy, you can't fuck with me\nSo when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck\n\u2018Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck\nAs I leave, believe I'm stompin'\nBut when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton\n(Compton Compton Compton)\n(City of Compton, City of Compton)\n[Interlude 1: Eazy-E & MC Ren]\nYo, Ren!

Fuck her!\nYou think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker\nThis is an autobiography of the E\nAnd if you ever fuck with me\nYou'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother\nWord to the motherfucker, straight outta

1]\nCruisin' down the street in my 6-4\nJockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough\nWent to the park to get the scoop\nKnuckle-heads out there cold-shootin' some hoops\nA car pulls up, who can it be?\nA fresh El Camino rollin' Kilo G\nHe rolled down his window and he started to say\nIt's all about makin' that GTA\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit\n[Scratches]\nYo, man!\nGet the fuck out!\nPump that bass!\nMothafucker, say what?\n\n[Verse 2]\nDonald B's in the place to give me the pace\nHe said my man JD is on freebase\nThe boy JD was a friend of mine\n'Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal an Alpine\nChased him up the streets to call a truce\nThe silly cluckhead pulls out a deuce deuce\nLittle did he know I had a loaded 12-gauge\nOne sucka dead, LA Times front page\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit\n\n[Scratches]\nYo, Leroy!\nBeer drinkin', breath stinkin', sniffin' glue\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nBored as hell and I wanna get ill\nSo I went to a place where my homeboys chill\nThe fellas out there makin' that dollar\nI pulled up in my 6-4 Impala\nThey greet me with a 40 and I started drinkin'\nAnd from the 8-ball my breath started stinkin'\nLeft to get my girl to rock that body\nBefore I left I hit the Bacardi\nWent to her house to get her out of the pad\nDumb ho said somethin' that made me mad\nShe said somethin' that I couldn't believe\nSo I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy-ass weave\nShe started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?\nReached back like a pimp, slapped the ho\nHer father jumped up and he started to shout\nSo I threw a right cross, cold-knocked him out\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit\n\n[Scratches]\nWho do you think you are, Mr. big stuff?\nRock this mothafucker like Three the Hard Way\n[Verse 4]\nI'm rollin' hard, now I'm under control\nThen wrapped my 6-4 around a telephone pole\nI looked at my car and I said \"Oh, brother.\"\nI throw it in the gutter, and go buy another\nWalkin' home, I see the G ride\nNow Cat is drivin', Kilo on the side\nAs they busted a U, they got pulled over\nAn undercover cop in a dark green Nova\nCat got beat for resistin' arrest\nHe socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess\nNow G is caught for doin' the crime\nFourth offense on the boy he'll do some time\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit\n\n[Scratches]\nL.A. playa\nBig Drum Beater\n\n[Verse 5]\nI went to get them out, but there was no bail\nThe fellas causin' a riot in the county jail\nTwo days later in the municipal court\nKilo G on trial cold cut a fart\n\"Disruption of the court,\" said the judge\nOn a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge\nBaliff came over to turn him in\nKilo G looked up and gave a grin\nHe yelled out \"Fire!\", then came Suzy\nThe bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi\nPolice shot the girl but didn't hurt her\nBoth upstate for attempted murder\n\n[Chorus]\n'Cause the boys in the hood are always hard\nYou come talkin' the trash, we'll pull your card\nKnowin' nothin' in life, but to be legit\nDon't quote me, boy, 'cause I ain't said shit\n\n[Scratches]\nGet busy, y'all!\nAw\nYou

really put in\nTalking about pistols I put on my hip\nAnd I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip\nThat I really done drove\nReally was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit\nReally was chose, came up from nothing\nAnd now they like, \"How he made millions so quick?\"\nI'm in the back and it feel like a sofa\nI done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah\nIn my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa\nA brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca, no way\n[Chorus: Tory Lanez]\nAll I wanted was a new Mercedes\nBending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it\nWomen love me

boxes for 'em\nI want everything, got my own boxers on\nOwn headphones to get my popping on\nI got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em\nStick and moving on these niggas, get my boxing on\nAll I ever hear from niggas is what they prolly doing\nBut they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing\nAll black Rottweiler, that Givenchy on\nDrop top Rolls Royce but the top is on\nAnd the windows down like see y'all later\nMirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating\nChampagne cork pop like we all made it\nYa'll looking from the sideline we all hate it\nMoney don't make it real\nDon't give a fuck if its eighty mill', pussy\nAnd just cause you got a Bentley\nThat Bentley won't make you thorough, pussy\nStill hating me from my city\nI'm thinking is they for real, pussies\nCause all I got to say is kill\nThey'll come in like Navy Seals\nThat's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block\nAnd we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking\nLately I've been on this money\nDon't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin\nI heard you said you was running this city\nI seen you in traffic and you was just walking\nNiggas be popping that shit like they

Somebody give a prescription\nI guess I gotta learn to live with regrets\nPay for mistakes and your exes take a commission\nBut what's a percent off the top when you hit the bottom\nAfter you break up wondering how to live without 'em?\nNeed solutions, less problems\nCause if love will drive you crazy I belong in the insane asylum\nHear the rain, feel the pain inside 'em\nKinda lost, need someone to guide 'em\nIt's nothin' worse than feelin' alone\nBut I'll admit to feelin' better when I'm hearing this song, it goes\n\n[Chorus: Miguel]\nI need some real good lovin'\n'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see\nI need some real good lovin'\n'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me\nYou might also like[Bridge: Miguel]\nSo I, dwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat, baby\nPlaying empty songs when I'm blowing my high\nFeeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed\nOn an empty bed\nDwelling on the past, all the moments on repeat\nPlaying empty songs when I'm blowing my high\nFeeding my heart to a lion called guilt on an empty bed\nWhile I lose my mind\nSo you know what I need\n\n[Chorus: Miguel]\nI need some real good lovin'\n'Cause I'm troubled by the things that I see\nI need some real good lovin'\n'Cause ain't nobody been around here lovin' on me89Embed"}]
