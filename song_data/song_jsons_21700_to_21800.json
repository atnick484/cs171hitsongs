now, king Agamemnon?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThou shalt hear.\n\nATTENDANT\nI am all eagerness. 'Tis little enough sleep old age allows me and keenly it watches o'er my eyes.\nAGAMEMNON\nWhat can that star be, steering his course yonder?\n\nATTENDANT\nSirius, still shooting o'er the zenith on his way near the Pleiads' sevenfold track.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThe birds are still at any rate and the sea is calm; hushed are the winds, and silence broods o'er this narrow firth.\n\nATTENDANT\nThen why art thou outside thy tent, why so restless, my lord Agamemnon? All is yet quiet here in Aulis, the watch on the walls is not yet astir. Let us go in.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nI envy thee, old man, aye, and every man who leads a life secure, unknown and unrenowned; but little I envy those in office.\n\nATTENDANT\nAnd yet 'tis there we place the be-all and end-all of existence.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nAye, but that is where the danger comes; and ambition, sweet though it seems, brings sorrow with its near approach. At one time the unsatisfied claims of Heaven upset our life, at another the numerous peevish fancies of our subjects shatter it.\n\nATTENDANT\nI like not these sentiments in one who is a chief. It was not to enjoy all blessings that Atreus begot thee, O Agamemnon; but thou must needs experience joy and sorrow alike, mortal as thou art. E'en though thou like it not, this is what the gods decree; but thou, after letting thy taper spread its light abroad, writest the letter which is still in thy hands and then erasest the same words again, sealing and re-opening the scroll, then flinging the tablet to the ground with floods of tears and leaving nothing undone in thy aimless behaviour to stamp thee mad. What is it troubles thee? what news is there affecting thee, my liege? Come, share with me thy story; to a loyal and trusty heart wilt thou be telling it; for Tyndareus sent me that day to form part of thy wife's dowry and to wait upon the bride with loyalty.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nLeda, the daughter of Thestius, had three children, maidens, Phoebe, Clytaemnestra my wife, and Helen; this last it was who had for wooers the foremost of the favoured sons of Hellas; but terrible threats of spilling his rival's blood were uttered by each of them, should he fail to win the maid. Now the matter filled Tyndareus, her father, with perplexity; at length this thought occurred to him; the suitors should swear unto each other and join right hands thereon and pour libations with burnt sacrifice, binding themselves by this curse, \"Whoever wins the child of Tyndareus for wife, him will we assist, in case a rival takes her from his house and goes his way, robbing her husband of his rights; and we will march against that man in armed array and raze his city to the ground, Hellene no less than barbarian.\"\nNow when they had once pledged their word and old Tyndareus with no small cleverness had beguiled them by his shrewd device, he allowed his daughter to choose from among her suitors the one towards whom the breath of love might fondly waft her. Her choice fell on Menelaus; would she had never taken him! Anon there came to Lacedaemon from Phrygia's folk the man who, legend says, adjudged the goddesses' dispute; in robes of gorgeous hue, ablaze with gold, in true barbaric pomp; and he, finding Menelaus gone from home, carried Helen off with him to his steading on Ida, a willing paramour. Goaded to frenzy Menelaus flew through Hellas, invoking the ancient oath exacted by Tyndareus and declaring the duty of helping the injured husband. Whereat the chivalry of Hellas, brandishing their spears and donning their harness, came hither to the narrow straits of Aulis with armaments of ships and troops, with many a steed and many a car, and they chose me to captain them all for the sake of Menelaus, since I was his brother. Would that some other had gained that distinction instead of me! But after the army was gathered and come together, we still remained at Aulis weather-bound; and Calchas, the seer, bade us in our perplexity sacrifice my own begotten child Iphigenia to Artemis, whose home is in this land, declaring that if we offered her, we should sail and sack the Phrygians' capital, but if we forbore, this was not for us. When I heard this, I commanded Talthybius with loud proclamation to disband the whole host, as I could never bear to slay daughter of mine. Whereupon my brother, bringing every argument to bear, persuaded me at last to face the crime; so I wrote in a folded scroll and sent to my wife, bidding her despatch our daughter to me on the pretence of wedding Achilles, it the same time magnifying his exalted rank and saying that he refused to sail with the Achaeans, unless a bride of our lineage should go to Phthia. Yes, this was the inducement I offered my wife, inventing, as I did, a sham marriage for the maiden. Of all the Achaeans we alone know the real truth, Calchas, Odysseus, Menelaus and myself; but that which I then decided wrongly, I now rightly countermand again in this scroll, which thou, old man, hast found me opening and resealing beneath the shade of night. Up now and away with this missive to Argos, and I will tell thee by word of mouth all that is written herein, the contents of the folded scroll, for thou art loyal to my wife and house.\n\nATTENDANT\nSay on and make it plain, that what my tongue utters may accord with what thou hast written.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n\"Daughter of Leda, in addition to my first letter I now send thee word not to despatch thy daughter to Euboea's embosomed wing, to the to the waveless bay of Aulis; for after all we wiltlelebrate our child's wedding at another time.\"\n\nATTENDANT\nAnd how will Achilles, cheated of his bride, curb the fury of his indignation against thee and thy wife?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHere also is a danger.\n\nATTENDANT\nTell me what thou meanest.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nIt is but his name, not himself, that Achilles is lending, knowing nothing of the marriage or of my scheming or my professed readiness to betroth my daughter to him for a husband's embrace.\n\nATTENDANT\nA dreadful venture thine king Agamemnon! thou that, by promise of thy daughter's hand to the son of the goddess, wert for bringing the maid hither to be sacrificed for the Danai.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nWoe is me! ah woe! I am utterly distraught; bewilderment comes o'er me. Away hurry thy steps, yielding nothing to old age.\nATTENDANT\nIn haste I go, my liege.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nSit not down by woodland founts; scorn the witcheries of sleep.\n\nATTENDANT\nHush!\n\nAGAMEMNON\nAnd when thou passest any place where roads diverge, cast thine eyes all round,-taking heed that no mule-wain pass by on rolling wheels, bearing my daughter hither to the ships of the Danai, and thou see it not.\n\nATTENDANT\nIt shall be so.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nStart then from the bolted gates, and if thou meet the escort, start them back again, and drive at full speed to the abodes of the Cyclopes.\n\nATTENDANT\nBut tell me, how shall my message find credit with thy wife or child?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nPreserve the seal which thou bearest on this scroll. Away! already the dawn is growing grey, lighting the lamp of day yonder and the fire of the sun's four steeds; help me in my trouble.\nExit ATTENDANT.\nNone of mortals is prosperous or happy to the last, for none was ever born to a painless life.\nExit AGAMEMNON.\nEnter CHORUS OF WOMEN OF CHALCIS.\n\nCHORUS\nTo the sandy beach of sea-coast Aulis I came after a voyage through the tides of Euripus, leaving Chalcis on its narrow firth, my city which feedeth the waters of far-famed Arethusa near the sea, that I might behold the army of the Achaeans and the ships rowed by those god-like heroes; for our husbands tell us that fair-haired Menelaus and high-born Agamemnon are leading them to Troy on a thousand ships in quest of the lady Helen, whom herdsman Paris carried off from the banks of reedy Eurotas-his guerdon from Aphrodite, when that queen of Cyprus entered beauty's lists with Hera and Pallas at the gushing fount.\n\nThrough the grove of-Artemis, rich with sacrifice, I sped my course, the red blush mantling on my cheeks from maiden modesty, in my eagerness to see the soldiers' camp, the tents of the mail-clad Danai, and their gathered steeds. Two chieftains there I saw met together in council; one was Aias, son of Oileus; the other Aias, son of Telamon, crown of glory to the men of Salamis; and I saw Protesilaus and Palamedes, sprung from the son of Poseidon, sitting there amusing themselves with intricate figures at draughts; Diomedes too at his favourite sport of hurling quoits; and Meriones, the War-god's son, a marvel to mankind, stood at his side; likewise I beheld the offspring of Laertes, who came from his island hills, and with him Nireus, handsomest of all Achaeans; Achilles next, that nimble runner, swift on his feet as the wind, whom Thetis bore and Chiron trained; him I saw upon the beach, racing in full armour along the shingle and straining every nerve to beat a team of four horses, as he sped round the track on foot; and Eumelus, the grandson of Pheres, their driver, was shouting when I saw him. goading on his goodly steeds, with their bits of chased goldwork; whereof the centre pair, that bore the yoke, had dappled coats picked out with white, while the trace-horses, on the outside, facing the turning-post in the course, were bays with spotted fetlocks. Close beside them Peleus' son leapt on his way, in all his harness, keeping abreast the rail by the axle-box.\n\nNext I sought the countless fleet, a wonder to behold, that I might fill my girlish eyes with gazing, a sweet delight. 'the warlike Myrmidons from Phthia held the right wing with fifty swift cruisers, upon whose sterns, right at the ends, stood Nereid goddesses in golden-effigy, the ensign of Achilles' armament. Near these were moored the Argive ships in equal numbers, o'er which Mecisteus' son, whom Taulaus his grandsire reared, and Sthenelus, son of Capaneus, were in command; next in order, Theseus' son was stationed at the head of sixty ships from Attica, having the goddess Pallas set in a winged car drawn by steeds with solid hoof, a lucky sight for mariners. Then I saw Boeotia's fleet of fifty sails decked with ensigns; these had Cadmus at the stern holding a golden dragon at the beaks of the vessels, and earth-born Leitus was their admiral. Likewise there were ships from Phocis; and from Locris came the son of Oileus with an equal contingent, leaving famed Thronium's citadel; and from Mycenae, the Cyclopes' town, Atreus' son sent a hundred wellmanned galleys, his brother being with him in command, as friend with friend, that Hellas might exact on her, who had fled her home to wed a foreigner. Also I saw upon Gerenian Nestor's prows twelve from Pylos the sign of his neighbor Alpheus, four-footed like a bull. Moreover there was a squadron of Aenianian sail under King and next the lords of Elis, stationed near'-them, whom all the people named Epeians; and Eurytus was lord of these; likewise he led the Taphian warriors with the white oar-blades, the subjects of Meges, son of Phyleus, who had left the isles of the Echinades, where sailors cannot land. Lastly, Aias, reared in Salamis, was joining his right wing to the left of those near whom he was posted, closing the line with his outermost ships-twelve barques obedient to the helm-as I heard and then saw the crews; no safe return shall he obtain, who bringeth his barbaric boats to grapple Aias. There I saw the naval armament, but some things I heard at home about the gathered host, whereof I still have a recollection.\nEnter MENELAUS and ATTENDANT.\n\nATTENDANT As MENELAUS wrests a letter from him\nStrange daring thine, Menelaus, where thou hast no right.\n\nMENELAUS\nStand back! thou carriest loyalty to thy master too far.\n\nATTENDANT\nThe very reproach thou hast for me is to my credit.\n\nMENELAUS\nThou shalt rue it, if thou meddle in matters that concern thee not.\n\nATTENDANT\nThou hadst no right to open a letter, which I was carrying.\n\nMENELAUS\nNo, nor thou to be carrying sorrow to all Hellas.\n\nATTENDANT\nArgue that point with others, but surrender that letter to me.\n\nMENELAUS\nI shall not let go.\n\nATTENDANT\nNor yet will I let loose my hold.\n\nMENELAUS\nWhy then, this staff of mine will be dabbling thy head with blood ere long.\n\nATTENDANT\nTo die in my master's cause were a noble death.\n\nMENELAUS\nLet go! thou art too wordy for a slave.\n\nATTENDANT Seeing AGAMEMNON approaching\nMaster, he is wronging me; he snatched thy letter violently from my grasp, Agamemnon, and will not heed the claims of right.\nEnter AGAMEMNON.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHow now? what means this uproar at the gates, this indecent brawling?\n\nMENELAUS\nMy tale, not his, has the better right to be spoken.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThou, Menelaus! what quarrel hast thou with this man, why art thou haling him hence?\nExit ATTENDANT.\n\nMENELAUS\nLook me in the face! Be that the prelude to my story.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nShall I, the son of Atreus, close my eyes from fear?\n\nMENELAUS\nSeest thou this scroll, the bearer of a shameful message?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nI see it, yes; and first of all surrender it.\n\nMENELAUS\nNo, not till I have shewn its contents to all the Danai.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nWhat! hast thou broken the seal and dost know already what thou shouldst never have known?\n\nMENELAUS\nYes, I opened it and know to thy sorrow the secret machinations of thy heart.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nWhere didst thou catch my servant? Ye gods what a shameless heart thou hast!\n\nMENELAUS\nI was awaiting thy daughter's arrival at the camp from Argos.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nWhat right hast thou to watch my doings? Is not this a of shamelessness?\n\nMENELAUS\nMy wish to do it gave the spur, for I am no slave to thee.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nInfamous! Am I not to be allowed the management of my own house?\n\nMENELAUS\nNo, for thou thinkest crooked thoughts, one thing now, another formerly, and something different presently.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nMost exquisite refining on evil themes! A hateful thing the tongue of cleverness!\n\nMENELAUS\nAye, but a mind unstable is an unjust possession, disloyal to friends. Now I am anxious to test thee, and seek not thou from rage to turn aside from the truth, nor will I on my part overstrain the case. Thou rememberest when thou wert all eagerness to captain the Danai against Troy, making a pretence of declining, though eager for it in thy heart; how humble thou wert then! taking each man by the hand and keeping open doors for every fellow townsman who cared to enter, affording each in turn a chance to speak with thee, even though some desired it not, seeking by these methods to purchase popularity from all bidders; then when thou hadst secured the command, there came a change over thy manners; thou wert no longer so cordial before to whilom friends, but hard of access, seldom to be found at home. But the man of real worth ought not to change his manners in the hour of prosperity, but should then show himself most staunch to friends, when his own good fortune can help them most effectually. This was the first cause I had to reprove thee, for it was here I first discovered thy villainy; but afterwards, when thou camest to Aulis with all the gathered hosts of Hellas, thou wert of no account; no! the want of a favourable breeze filled thee with consternation at the chance dealt out by Heaven. Anon the Danai began demanding that thou shouldst send the fleet away instead of vainly toiling on at Aulis; what dismay and confusion was then depicted in thy looks, to think that thou, with a thousand ships at thy command, hadst not occupied the plains of Priam with thy armies! And thou wouldst ask my counsel, \"What am I to do? what scheme can I devise. where find one?\" to save thyself being stripped of thy command and losing thy fair fame. Next when Calchas bade thee offer thy daughter in sacrifice to Artemis, declaring that the Danai should then sail, thou wert overjoyed, and didst gladly undertake to offer the maid, and of thine own accord-never allege compulsion!-thou art sending word to thy wife to despatch thy daughter hither on pretence of wedding Achilles. This is the same air that heard thee say it; and after all thou turnest round and hast been caught recasting thy letter to this effect, \"I will no longer be my daughter's murderer.\" Exactly so! Countless others have gone through this phase in their conduct of public affairs; they make an effort while in power, and then retire dishonourably, sometimes owing to the senselessness of the citizens, sometimes deservedly, because they are too feeble of themselves to maintain their watch upon the state. For my part, I am more sorry for our unhappy Hellas, whose purpose was to read these worthless foreigners a lesson, while now she will let them escape and mock her, thanks to thee and thy daughter. May I never then appoint a man to rule my country or lead its warriors because his kinship! Ability what the general must have; since any man, with ordinary intelligence, can govern a state.\n\nCHORUS\nFor brethren to come to words and blows, whene'er they disagree, is terrible.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nI wish to rebuke thee in turn, briefly, not lifting mine eyes too high in shameless wise, but in more sober fashion, as a brother; for it is a good man's way to be considerate. Prithee, why this burst of fury, these bloodshot eyes? who wrongs thee? what is it thou wantest? Thou art fain to win a virtuous bride. Well, I cannot supply thee; for she, whom thou once hadst, was ill controlled by thee. Am I then, a man who never went astray, to suffer for thy sins? or is it my popularity that galls thee? No! it is the longing thou hast to keep a fair wife in thy embrace, casting reason and honour to the winds. A bad man's pleasures are like himself Am I mad, if I change to wiser counsels, after previously deciding amiss? Thine is the madness rather in wishing to recover a wicked wife, once thou hadst lost her-a stroke of Heaven-sent luck. Those foolish suitors swore that oath to Tyndareus in their longing to wed; but Hope was the goddess that led them on, I trow, and she it was that brought it about rather then thou and thy mightiness. So take the field with them; they are ready for it in the folly of their hearts; for the deity is not without insight, but is able to discern where oaths have been wrongly pledged or forcibly extorted. I will not slay my children, nor shall thy interests be prospered by justice in thy vengeance for a worthless wife, while I am left wasting, night and day, in sorrow for what I did to one of my own flesh and blood, contrary to all law and justice. There is thy answer shortly' given, clear and easy to understand; and if thou wilt not come to thy senses, I shall do the best for myself.\n\nCHORUS\nThis differs from thy previous declaration, but there is good in it-thy child's reprieve.\n\nMENELAUS\nAh me, how sad my lot! I have no friends then after all.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nFriends thou hast, if thou seek not their destruction.\n\nMENELAUS\nWhere wilt thou find any proof that thou art sprung from the same sire as I?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThy moderation, not thy madness do I share by nature.\n\nMENELAUS\nFriends should sympathize with friends in sorrow.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nClaim my help by kindly service, not by paining me.\n\nMENELAUS\nSo thou hast no mind to share this trouble with Hellas?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nNo, Hellas is diseased like thee according to some god's design.\n\nMENELAUS\nGo vaunt thee then on thy sceptre, after betraying thine own brother! while seek some different means and other friends.\nEnter MESSENGER.\n\nMESSENGER\nAgamemnon, lord of all Hellenes! I am come and bring thee thy daughter, whom thou didst call Iphigenia in thy home; and her mother, thy wife Clytemnestra, is with her, and the child Orestes, a sight to gladden thee after thy long absence from thy palace; but, as they had been travelling long and far, they are now refreshing their tender feet at the waters of a fair spring, they and their horses, for we turned these loose in the grassy meadow to browse their fill; but I am come as their forerunner to prepare thee for their reception; for the army knows already of thy daughter's arrival, so quickly did the rumour spread; and all the folk are running together to the sight, that they may see thy child; for Fortune's favourites enjoy a worldwide fame and have all eyes fixed on them. \"Is it a wedding?\" some ask, \"or what is happening? or has king Agamemnon from fond yearning summoned his daughter hither?\" From others thou wouldst have heard: \"They are presenting the maiden to Artemis, queen of Aulis, previous to marriage; who can the bridegroom be, that is to lead her home?\"\n\nCome, then, begin the rites-that is the next step-by getting the baskets ready; crown your heads; prepare the wedding-hymn, thou and prince Menelaus with thee; let flutes resound throughout the tents with noise of dancer's feet; for this is a happy day, that is come for the maid.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThou hast my thanks; now go within; for the rest it will be well, as Fate proceeds.\n\nExit MESSENGER.\n\nAh, woe is me! unhappy wretch, what can I say? where shall I begin? Into what cruel straits have I been plunged! Fortune has outwitted me, proving far cleverer than any cunning of mine. What an advantage humble birth possesses! for it is easy for her sons to weep and tell out all their sorrows; while to the high-born man come these same sorrows, but we have dignity throned o'er our life and are the people's slaves. I, for instance, am ashamed to weep, nor less, poor wretch, to check my tears at the awful pass to which I am brought. Oh! what am I to tell my wife? how shall I welcome her? with what face meet her? for she too has undone me by coming uninvited in this my hour of sorrow; yet it was but natural she should come with her daughter to prepare the bride and perform the fondest duties, where she will discover my villainy. And for this poor maid-why maid? Death, methinks, will soon make her his bride-how I pity her! Thus will she plead to me, I trow: \"My father will thou slay me? Be such the wedding thou thyself mayst find, and whosoever is a friend to thee!\" while Orestes, from his station near us, will cry in childish accents, inarticulate, yet fraught with meaning. Alas! to what utter ruin Paris, the son of Priam, the cause of these troubles, has brought me by his union with Helen!\n\nCHORUS\nI pity her myself, in such wise as a woman, and she a stranger, may bemoan the misfortunes of royalty.\n\nMENELAUS Offering his hand\nThy hand, brother! let me grasp it.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nI give it; thine is the victory, mine the sorrow.\n\nMENELAUS\nBy Pelops our reputed grandsire and Atreus our father I swear to tell thee the truth from my heart, without any covert purpose, but only what I think. The sight of thee in tears made me pity thee, and in return I shed a tear for thee myself; I withdraw from my former proposals, ceasing to be a cause of fear to thee; yea, and I will put myself in thy present position; and I counsel thee, slay not thy child nor prefer my interests to thine; for it is not just that thou shouldst grieve, while I am glad, or that thy children should die, while mine still see the light of day. What is it, after all, I seek? If I am set on marriage, could I not find a bride as choice elsewhere? Was I to lose a brother-the last I should have lost-to win a Helen, getting bad for good? I was mad, impetuous as a youth, till I perceived, on closer view, what slaying children really meant. Moreover I am filled with compassion for the hapless maiden, doomed to bleed that I may wed, when I reflect that we are kin. What has thy daughter to do with Helen? Let the army be disbanded and leave Aulis; dry those streaming eyes, brother, and provoke me not to tears. Whatever concern thou hast in oracles that affect thy child, let it be none of mine; into thy hands I resign my share therein. A sudden change, thou'lt say, from my fell proposals! A natural course for me; affection for my brother caused the change. These are the ways of a man not void of virtue, to pursue on each occasion what is best.\n\nCHORUS\nA generous speech, worthy of Tantalus, the son of Zeus! Thou dost not shame thy ancestry.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nI thank thee, Menelaus, for this unexpected suggestion; 'tis an honourable proposal, worthy of thee.\n\nMENELAUS\nSometimes love, sometimes the selfishness of their families causes a quarrel between brothers; I loathe a relationship of this kind which is bitterness to both.\n\nAGAMEMNON\n'Tis useless, for circumstances compel me to carry out the murderous sacrifice of my daughter.\n\nMENELAUS\nHow so? who will compel thee to slay thine own child?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThe whole Achaean army here assembled.\n\nMENELAUS\nNot if thou send her back to Argos.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nI might do that unnoticed, but there will be another thing I cannot.\n\nMENELAUS\nWhat is that? Thou must not fear the mob too much.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nCalchas will tell the Argive host his oracles.\n\nMENELAUS\nNot if he be killed ere that-an easy matter.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThe whole tribe of seers is a curse with its ambition.\n\nMENELAUS\nYes, and good for nothing and useless, when amongst us.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHas the thought, which is rising in my mind, no terrors for thee?\n\nMENELAUS\nHow can I understand thy meaning, unless thou declare it?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThe son of Sisyphus knows all.\n\nMENELAUS\nOdysseus cannot possibly hurt us.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHe was ever shifty by nature, siding with the mob.\n\nMENELAUS\nTrue, he is enslaved by the love of popularity, a fearful evil.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nBethink thee then, will he not arise among the Argives and tell them the oracles that Calchas delivered, saying of me that I undertook to offer Artemis a victim, and after all am proving false? Then, when he has carried the army away with him, he will bid the Argives slay us and sacrifice the maiden; and if I escape to Argos, they will come and destroy the place, razing it to the ground, Cyclopean walls and all. That is my trouble. Woe is me! to what straits Heaven has brought me at this pass! Take one precaution for me, Menelaus, as thou goest through the host, that Clytemnestra learn this not, till I have taken my child and devoted her to death, that my affliction may be attended with the fewest tears.\nTurning to the CHORUS\nAnd you, ye stranger dames, keep silence.\nExeunt AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS.\n\nCHORUS\nHappy they who find the goddess come in moderate might, sharing with self-restraint in Aphrodite's gift of marriage and enjoying calm and rest from frenzied passions, wilerein the Love-god, golden-haired, stretches his charmed bow with arrows twain, and one is aimed at happiness, the other at life's confusion. O lady Cypris, queen of beauty! far from my bridal bower I ban the last. Be mine delight in moderation and pure desires, and may I have a share in love, but shun excess therein\n\nMen's natures vary, and their habits differ, but true virtue is always manifest. Likewise the training that comes of education conduces greatly to virtue; for not only is modesty wisdom, but it has also the rare grace of seeing by its better judgment what is right; whereby glory, ever young, is shed o'er life by reputation. A great thing it is to follow virtue's footsteps-for women in their secret loves; while in men again an inborn sense of order, shown in countless ways, adds to a city's greatness.\n\nThou camest, O Paris, to the place where thou wert reared to herd the kine amid the white heifers of Ida, piping in foreign strain and breathing on thy reeds an echo of the Phrygian airs Olympus played. Full-uddered cows were browsing at the spot where that verdict 'twixt goddesses was awaiting thee the cause of thy going to Hellas to stand before the ivory palace, kindling love in Helen's tranced eyes and feeling its flutter in thine own breast; whence the fiend of strife brought Hellas with her chivalry and ships to the towers of Troy.\n\nOh! great is the bliss the great enjoy. Behold Iphigenia, the king's royal child, and Clytaemnestra, the daughter of Tyndareus; how proud their lineage! how high their pinnacle of fortune! These mighty ones, whom wealth attends, are very gods in the eyes of less favoured folk.\n\nHalt we here, maidens of Chalcis, and lift the queen from her chariot to the ground without stumbling, supporting her gently in our arms, with kind intent, that the renowned daughter of Agamemnon but just arrived may feel no fear; strangers ourselves, avoid we aught that may disturb or frighten the strangers from Argos.\nEnter CLYTAEMNESTRA and IPHIGENIA.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nI take this as a lucky omen, thy kindness and auspicious greeting, and have good hope that it is to a happy marriage I conduct the bride.\n(To the Attendants)\nTake from the chariot the dowry I am bringing for my daughter and convey it within with careful heed.\n\nMy daughter, leave the horse-drawn car, planting thy faltering footstep delicately.\nTo the CHORUS\nMaidens, take her in your arms and lift her from the chariot, and let one of you give me the support of her hand, that I may quit my seat in the carriage with fitting grace.\n\nSome or you stand at the horses' heads; for the horse has a timid eye, easily frightened; here take this child Orestes, son of Agamemnon, babe as he still is.\n\nWhat! sleeping, little one, tired out by thy ride in the chariot? Awake to bless thy sister's wedding; for thou, my gallant boy, shalt get by this marriage a kinsman gallant as thyself, the Nereid's godlike offspring. Come hither to thy mother, my daughter, Iphigenia, and seat thyself beside me, and stationed near show my happiness to these strangers; yes, come hither and welcome the sire thou lovest so dearly.\n\nHail! my honoured lord, king Agamemnon! we have obeyed thy commands and are come.\nEnter AGAMEMNON.\n\nIPHIGENIA Throwing herself into AGAMEMNON'S arms\nBe not wroth with me, mother, if I run from thy side and throw myself on my father's breast.\n\nO my father! I long to outrun others and embrace thee after this long while; for I yearn to see thy face; be not wroth with me.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nThou mayst do so, daughter; for of all the children I have born, thou hast ever loved thy father best.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nI see thee, father, joyfully after a long season.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nAnd I thy father thee; thy words do equal duty for both of us.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nAll hail, father! thou didst well in bringing me hither to thee.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nI know not how I am to say yes or no to that, my child.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nHa! how wildly thou art looking, spite of thy joy at seeing me.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nA man has many cares when he is king and general too.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nBe mine, all mine to-day; turn not unto moody thoughts.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nWhy so I am, all thine to-day; I have no other thought.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nThen smooth thy knitted brow, unbend and smile.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nLo! my child, my joy at seeing thee is even as it is.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nAnd hast thou then the tear-drop streaming from thy eyes?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nAve, for long is the absence from each other, that awalts us.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nI know not, dear father mine, I know not of what thou art speaking.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThou art moving my pity all the more by speaking so sensibly.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nMy words shall turn to senselessness, if that will cheer thee more.\n\nAGAMEMNON Aside\nAh, woe is me! this silence is too much.\nTo IPHIGENIA\nThou hast my thanks.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nStay with thy children at home, father.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nMy own wish! but to my sorrow I may not humour it.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nRuin seize their warring and the woes of Menelaus!\n\nAGAMEMNON\nFirst will that, which has been my life-long ruin, bring ruin unto others.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nHow long thou wert absent in the bays of Aulis!\n\nAGAMEMNON\nAye, and there is still a hindrance to my sending the army forward.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nWhere do men say the Phrygians live, father?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nIn a land where I would Paris, the son of Priam, ne'er had dwelt.\n\nIPHIGENIA\n'Tis a long voyage thou art bound on, father, after thou leavest me.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThou wilt meet thy father again, my daughter.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nAh! would it were seemly that thou shouldst take me as a fellow-voyager!\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThou too hast a voyage to make to a haven where thou wilt remember thy father.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nShall I sail thither with my mother or alone?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nAll alone, without father or mother.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nWhat! hast thou found me a new home, father!\n\nAGAMEMNON\nEnough of this! 'tis not for girls to know such things.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nSpeed home from Troy, I pray thee, father, as soon as thou hast triumphed there.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThere is a sacrifice have first to offer here.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nYea, 'tis thy duty to heed religion with aid of holy rites.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThou wilt witness it, for thou wilt be standing near the laver.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nAm I to lead the dance then round the altar, father?\n\nAGAMEMNON Aside\nI count thee happier than myself because thou knowest nothing.\nTo IPHIGENIA\nGo within into the presence of maidens, after thou hast given me thy hand and one sad kiss, on the eve of thy lengthy sojourn far from thy father's side.\n\nBosom, cheek, and golden hair! ah, how grievous ye have found Helen and the Phrygians' city! I can no more; the tears come welling to my eyes, the moment I touch thee.\nExit IPHIGENIA.\nTurning to CLYTAEMNESTRA\nHerein I crave thy pardon, daughter of Leda, if I showed excessive grief at the thought of resigning my daughter to Achilles; for though we are sending her to taste of bliss, still it wrings a parent's heart, when he, the father who has toiled so hard for them, commits his children to the homes of strangers.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nI am not so void of sense; bethink thee, I shall go through this as well, when I lead the maiden from the chamber to the sound of the marriage-hymn; wherefore I chide thee not; but custom will combine with time to make the smart grow less.\n\nAs touching him, to whom thou hast betrothed our daughter, I know his name, 'tis true, but would fain learn his lineage and the land of his birth.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThere was one Aegina, the daughter of Asopus.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWho wedded her? some mortal or a god?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nZeus, and she bare Aeacus, the prince of Cenone.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat son of Aeacus secured his father's halls?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nPeleus, who wedded the daughter of Nereus.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWith the god's consent, or when he had taken her in spite of gods?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nZeus betrothed her, and her guardian gave consent.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhere did he marry her? amid the billows of the sea?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nIn Chiron's home, at sacred Pelion's foot.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat! the abode ascribed to the race of Centaurs?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nIt was there the gods celebrated the marriage feast of Peleus.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nDid Thetis or his father train Achilles?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nChiron brought him up, to prevent his learning the ways of the wicked.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAh wise the teacher, still wiser the father, who intrusted his son to such hands.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nSuch is the future husband of thy daughter.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nA blameless lord; but what city in Hellas is his?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHe dwells on the banks of the river Apidanus, in the borders of Phthia.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWilt thou convey our daughter thither?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHe who takes her to himself will see to that.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nHappiness attend the pair! Which day will he marry her?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nAs soon as the full moon comes to give its blessing.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nHast thou already offered the goddess a sacrifice to usher in the maiden's marriage?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nI am about to do so; that is the very thing I was engaged in.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWilt thou celebrate the marriage-feast thereafter?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nYes, when I have offered a sacrifice required by Heaven of me.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nBut where am I to make ready the feast for the women?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHere beside our gallant Argive ships.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nFinely here! but still I must; good come of it for all that!\n\nAGAMEMNON\nI will tell thee, lady, what to do; so obey me now.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWherein? for I was ever wont to yield thee obedience.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHere, where the bridegroom is, will!\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhich of my duties will ye perform in the mother's absence?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nGive thy child away with help of Danai.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAnd where am I to be the while?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nGet thee to Argos, and take care of thy unwedded daughters.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAnd leave my child? Then who will raise her bridal torch?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nI will provide the proper wedding torch.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nThat is not the custom; but thou thinkest lightly of these things.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nIt is not good thou shouldst be alone among a soldier-crowd.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nIt is good that a mother should give her own child away.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nAye, and that those maidens at home should not be left alone.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nThey are in safe keeping, pent in their maiden-bowers.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nObey.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nNay, by the goddess-queen of Argos! go, manage matters out of doors; but in the house it is my place to decide what is proper for maidens at their wedding. Exit.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nWoe is me! my efforts are baffled; I am disappointed in my hope, anxious as I was to get my wife out of sight; foiled at every point, I form my plots and subtle schemes against my best-beloved. But I will go, in spite of all, with Calchas the priest, to inquire the goddess's good pleasure, fraught with ill-luck as it is to me, and with trouble to Hellas. He who is wise should keep in his house a good and useful wife or none at all.\nExit.\n\nCHORUS\nThey say the Hellenes' gathered host will come in arms aboard their ships to Simois with its silver eddies, even to Ilium, the plain of Troy beloved by Phoebus; where famed Cassandra, I am told, whene'er the god's resistless prophecies inspire her, wildly tosses her golden tresses, wreathed with crown of verdant bay. And on the towers of Troy and round her walls shall Trojans stand, when sea-borne troops with brazen shields row in on shapely ships to the channels of the Simois, eager to take Helen, the sister of that heavenly pair whom Zeus begat, from Priam, and bear her back to Hellas by toil of Achaea's shields and spears; encircling Pergamus, the Phrygians' town, with murderous war around her stone-built towers, dragging men's heads backward to cut their throats, and sacking the citadel of Troy from roof to base, a cause of many tears to maids and Priam's wife; and Helen, the daughter of Zeus, shall weep in bitter grief, because she left her lord.\n\nOh! ne'er may there appear to me or to my children's children the prospect which the wealthy Lydian dames and Phrygia's brides will have, as at their looms they hold converse: \"Say who will pluck this fair blossom from her ruined country, tightening his grasp on lovely tresses till the tears flow? 'Tis all through thee, the offspring of the long-necked swan; if indeed it be a true report that Leda bare thee to a winged bird, when Zeus transformed himself thereto, or whether, in the pages of the poets, fables have carried these tales to men's ears idly, out of season.\"\nEnter ACHILLES.\n\nACHILLES\nWhere in these tents is Achaea's general? Which of his servants will announce to him that Achilles, the son of Peleus, is at his gates seeking him? For this delay at the Euripus is not the same for all of us; there be some, for instance, who, though still unwed, have left their houses desolate and are idling here upon the beach, while others are married and have children; so strange the longing for this expedition that has fallen on their hearts by Heaven's will. My own just plea must I declare, and whoso else hath any wish will speak for himself. Though I have left Pharsalia and Peleus, still I linger here by reason of these light breezes at the Euripus, restraining my Myrmidons, while they are ever instant with me saying, \"Why do we tarry, Achilles? how much longer must we count the days to the start for Ilium? do something, if thou art so minded; else lead home thy men, and wait not for the tardy action of these Atridae.\"\nEnter CLYTAEMNESTRA.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nHail to thee, son of the Nereid goddess! I heard thy voice from within the tent and therefore came forth.\n\nACHILLES\nO modesty revered! who can this lady be whom I behold, so richly dowered with beauty's gifts?\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nNo wonder thou knowest me not, seeing I am one thou hast never before set eyes on; I praise thy reverent address to modesty.\n\nACHILLES\nWho art thou, and wherefore art thou come to the mustering of the Danai-thou, a woman, to a fenced camp of men?\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nThe daughter of Leda I; my name Clytaemnestra; and my husband king Agamemnon.\n\nACHILLES\nWell and shortly answered on all important points! but it ill befits that I should stand talking to women.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nStay; why seek to fly? Give me thy hand, a prelude to a happy marriage.\n\nACHILLES\nWhat is it thou sayest? I give thee my hand? Were I to lay a finger where I have no right, I could ne'er meet Agamemnon's eye.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nThe best of rights hast thou, seeing it is my child thou wilt wed, O son of the sea-goddess, whom Nereus begat.\n\nACHILLES\nWhat wedding dost thou speak of? words fail me, lady; can thy wits have gone astray and art thou inventing this?\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAll men are naturally shy in the presence of new relations, when these remind them of their wedding.\n\nACHILLES\nLady, I have never wooed daughter of thine, nor have the sons of Atreus ever mentioned marriage to me.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat can it mean? thy turn now to marvel at my words, for thine are passing strange to me.\n\nACHILLES\nHazard a guess; that we can both do in this matter; for it may be we are both correct in our statements.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat! have I suffered such indignity? The marriage I am courting has no reality, it seems; I am ashamed of it.\n\nACHILLES\nSome one perhaps has made a mock of thee and me; pay no heed thereto; make light of it.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nFarewell; I can no longer face thee with unfaltering eyes, after being made a liar and suffering this indignity.\n\nACHILLES\n'Tis \"farewell\" too I bid thee, lady; and now I go within the tent to seek thy husband.\n\nATTENDANT Calling through the tent-door\nStranger of the race of Aeacus, stay awhile! Ho there! thee I mean, O goddess-born, and thee, daughter of Leda.\n\nACHILLES\nWho is it calling through the half-opened door? what fear his voice betrays!\n\nATTENDANT\nA slave am I; of that I am not proud, for fortune permits it not.\n\nACHILLES\nWhose slave art thou? not mine; for mine and Agamemnon's goods are separate.\n\nATTENDANT\nI belong to this lady who stands before the tent, a gift to her from Tyndareus her father.\n\nACHILLES\nI am waiting; tell me, if thou art desirous, why thou hast stayed me.\n\nATTENDANT\nAre ye really all alone here at the door?\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nTo us alone wilt thou address thyself; come forth from the king's tent.\n\nATTENDANT Coming out\nO Fortune and my own foresight, preserve whom I desire!\n\nACHILLES\nThat speech will save them-in the future; it has a certain pompous air.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nDelay not for the sake of touching my right hand, if there is aught that thou wouldst say to me.\n\nATTENDANT\nWell, thou knowest my character and my devotion to thee and thy children.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nI know thou hast grown old in the service of my house.\n\nATTENDANT\nLikewise thou knowest it was in thy dowry king Agamemnon received me.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nYes, thou camest to Argos with me, and hast been mine this long time past.\n\nATTENDANT\nTrue; and though I bear thee all goodwill, I like not thy lord so well.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nCome, come, unfold whate'er thou hast to say.\n\nATTENDANT\nHer father, he that begat her, is on the point of slaying thy daughter with his own hand.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nHow? Out upon thy story, old dotard! thou art mad.\n\nATTENDANT\nSevering with a sword the hapless maid's white throat.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAh, woe is me! Is my husband haply mad?\n\nATTENDANT\nNay; sane, except where thou and thy daughter are concerned; there he is mad.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat is his reason? what vengeful fiend impels him?\n\nATTENDANT\nOracles-at least so Calchas says, in order that the host may start\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhither? Woe is me, and woe is thee, thy father's destined victim!\n\nATTENDANT\nTo the halls of Dardanus, that Menelaus may recover Helen.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nSo Helen's return then was fated to affect Iphigenia?\n\nATTENDANT\nThou knowest all; her father is about to offer thy child to Artemis.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nBut that marriage-what pretext had it for bringing me from home?\n\nATTENDANT\nAn inducement to thee to bring thy daughter cheerfully, to wed her to Achilles.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nOn a deadly errand art thou come, my daughter, both thou, and I, thy mother.\n\nATTENDANT\nPiteous the lot of both of you-and fearful Agamemnon's venture.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAlas! I am undone; my eyes can no longer stem their tears.\n\nATTENDANT\nWhat more natural than to weep the loss of thy children?\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhence, old man, dost say thou hadst this news?\n\nATTENDANT\nI had started to carry thee a letter referring to the former writing.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nForbidding or combining to urge my bringing the child to her death?\n\nATTENDANT\nNay, forbidding it, for thy lord was then in his sober senses.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nHow comes it then, if thou wert really bringing me a letter, that thou dost not now deliver into my hands?\n\nATTENDANT\nMenelaus snatched it from me-he who caused this trouble.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nDost thou hear that, son of Peleus, the Nereid's child?\n\nACHILLES\nI have been listening to the tale of thy sufferings, and I am indignant to think I was used as a tool.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nThey will slay my child; they have tricked her with thy marriage.\n\nACHILLES\nLike thee I blame thy lord, nor do I view it with mere indifference.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nNo longer will I let shame prevent my kneeling to thee, a mortal to one goddess-born; why do I affect reserve? whose interests should I consult before my child's?\nThrowing herself before ACHILLES\nOh! help me, goddess-born, in my sore distress, and her that was called thy bride-in vain, 'tis true, yet called she was. For thee it was I wreathed her head and led her forth as if to marriage, but now it is to slaughter I am bringing her. On thee will come reproach because thou didst not help her; for though not wedded to her, yet wert thou the loving husband of my hapless maid in name at any rate. By thy beard, right hand, and mother too I do implore thee; for thy name it was that worked my ruin, and thou art bound to stand by that. Except thy knees I have no altar whereunto to fly; and not a friend stands at my side. Thou hast heard the cruel abandoned scheme of Agamemnon; and I, a woman, am come, as thou seest, to a camp of lawless sailor-folk, bold in evil's cause, though useful when they list; wherefore if thou boldly stretch forth thine arm in my behalf, our safety is assured; but if thou withhold it, we are lost.\n\nCHORUS\nA wondrous thing is motherhood, carrying with it a potent spell, wherein all share, so that for their children's sake they will endure affliction.\n\nACHILLES\nMy proud spirit is stirred to range aloft, but it has learnt to grieve in misfortune and rejoice in high prosperity with equal moderation. For these are the men who can count on ordering all their life aright by wisdom's rules. True, there are cases where 'tis pleasant not to be too wise, but there are others, where some store of wisdom helps. Brought up in godly Chiron's halls myself, I learnt to keep a single heart; and provided the Atridae lead aright, I will obey them; but when they cease therefrom, no more will I obey. Nay, but here and in Troy I will show the freedom of my nature, and, as far as in me lies, do honour to Ares with my spear. Thee, lady, who hast suffered so cruelly from thy nearest and dearest, will I, by every effort in a young man's power, set right, investing thee with that amount of pity, and never shall thy daughter, after being once called my bride, die by her father's hand; for I will not lend myself to thy husband's subtle tricks; no! for it will be my name that kills thy child, although it wieldeth not the steel. Thy own husband is the actual cause, but I shall no longer be guiltless, if, because of me and my marriage, this maiden perishes, she that hath suffered past endurance and been the victim of affronts most strangely undeserved. So am I made the poorest wretch in Argos; I a thing of naught, and Menelaus counting for a man! No son of Peleus I, but the issue of a vengeful fiend, if my name shall serve thy husband for the murder. Nay! by Nereus, who begat my mother Thetis, in his home amid the flowing waves, never shall king Agamemnon touch thy daughter, no! not even to the laying of a finger-tip upon her robe; else will Sipylus, that frontier town of barbarism, the cradle of those chieftains' line, be henceforth a city indeed, while Phthia's name will nowhere find mention. Calchas, the seer, shall rue beginning the sacrifice with his barley-meal and lustral water. Why, what is a seer? A man who with luck tells the truth sometimes, with frequent falsehoods, but when his luck deserts him, collapses then and there. It is not to secure a bride that I have spoken thus-there be maids unnumbered eager to have my love-no! but king Agamemnon has put an insult on me; he should have asked my leave to use my name as a means to catch the child, for it was I chiefly who induced Clytaemnestra to betroth her daughter to me; verily I had yielded this to Hellas, if that was where our going to Ilium broke down; I would never have refused to further my fellow soldiers' common interest. But, as it is, I am as naught in the eyes of those chieftains, and little they reck of treating me well or ill. My sword shall soon know if any one is to snatch thy daughter from me, for then will I make it reek with the bloody stains of slaughter, ere it reach Phrygia. Calm thyself then; as a god in his might I appeared to thee, without being so, but such will I show myself for all that.\n\nCHORUS\nSon of Peleus, thy words are alike worthy of thee and that sea-born deity, the holy goddess.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAh! would I could find words to utter thy praise without excess, and yet not lose the graciousness thereof by stinting it; for when the good are praised, they have a feeling, as it were, of hatred for those who in their praise exceed the mean. But I am ashamed of intruding a tale of woe, since my affliction touches myself alone and thou art not affected by troubles of mine; but still it looks well for the man of worth to assist the unfortunate, even when he is not connected with them. Wherefore pity us, for our sufferings cry for pity; in the first place, I have harboured an idle hope in thinking to have thee wed my daughter; and next, perhaps, the slaying of my child will be to thee an evil omen in thy wooing hereafter, against which thou must guard thyself. Thy words were good, both first and last; for if thou will it so, my daughter will be saved. Wilt have her clasp thy knees in suppliant wise? 'Tis no maid's part; yet if it seem good to thee, why come she shall with the modest look of free-born maid; but if I shall obtain the self-same end from thee without ker coming, then let her abide within, for there is dignity in her reserve; still reserve must only go as far as the case allows.\n\nACHILLES\nBring not thou thy daughter out for me to see, lady, nor let us incur the reproach of the ignorant; for an army, when gathered together without domestic duties to employ it, loves the evil gossip of malicious tongues. After all, should ye supplicate me, ye will attain a like result as if I had ne'er been supplicated; for I am myself engaged in a mighty struggle to rid you of your troubles. One thing be sure thou hast heard; I will not tell a lie; if I do that or idly mock thee, may I die, but live if I preserve the maid.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nBless thee for ever succouring the distressed!\n\nACHILLES\nHearken then to me, that the matter may succeed.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat is thy proposal? for hear thee I must.\n\nACHILLES\nLet us once more urge her father to a better frame of mind.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nHe is something of a coward, and fears the army too much.\n\nACHILLES\nStill argument o'erthroweth argument.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nCold hope indeed; but tell me what I must do.\n\nACHILLES\nEntreat him first not to slay his children, and if he is stubborn, come to me. Fir if he consents to thy request, my intervention need go no further, since this consent insures thy safety. I too shall show myself in a better light to my friend, and the army will not blame me, if I arrange the matter by reason rather than force; while, should things turn out well, the result will prove satisfactory both to thee and thy friends, even without my interference.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nHow sensibly thou speakest! I must act as seemeth best to thee; but should I fail of my object, where am I to see thee again? whither must I turn my wretched steps and find thee ready to champion my distress?\n\nACHILLES\nI am keeping watch to guard thee, where occasion calls, that none see thee passing through the host of Danai with that scared look. Shame not thy father's house; for Tyndareus deserveth not to be ill spoken of, being a mighty man in Hellas.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\n'Tis even so. Command me; I must play the slave to thee. If there are gods, thou for thy righteous dealing wilt find them favourable; if there are none, what need to toil?\nExeunt ACHILLES and CLYTAEMNESTRA.\n\nCHORUS\nWhat wedding-hymn was that which raised its strains to the sound of Libyan flutes, to the music of the dancer's lyre, and the note of the pipe of reeds?\n\n'Twas in the day Pieria's fair-tressed choir came o'er the slopes of Pelion to the marriage-feast of Peleus, beating the ground with print of golden sandals at the banquet of the gods, and hymning in dulcet strains the praise of Thetis and the son of Aeacus, o'er the Centaurs' hill, down through the woods of Pelion.\n\nThere was the Dardanian boy, Phrygian Ganymede, whom Zeus delights to honour, drawing off the wine he mixed in the depths of golden bowls; while, along the gleaming sand, the fifty daughters of Nereus graced the marriage with their dancing, circling in a mazy ring.\n\nCame too the revel-rout of Centaurs, mounted on horses, to the feast of the gods and the mixing-bowl of Bacchus, leaning on fir-trees, with wreaths of green foliage round their heads; and loudly cried the prophet Chiron, skilled in arts inspired by Phoebus; \"Daughter of Nereus, thou shalt bear a son\"-whose name he gave-\"a dazzling light to Thessaly; for he shall come with an army of spearmen to the far-famed land of Priam, to set it in a blaze, his body cased in a suit of golden mail forged by Hephaestus, a gift from his goddess-mother, even from Thetis who bore him.\"\n\nThen shed the gods a blessing on the marriage of the high-born bride, who was first of Nereus' daughters, and on the wedding of Peleus. But thee, will Argives crown, wreathing the lovely tresses of thy hair, like a dappled mountain hind brought from some rocky cave or a heifer undefiled, and staining with blood thy human throat; though thou wert never reared like these amid the piping and whistling of herdsmen, but at thy mother's side, to be decked one day by her as the bride of a son of Inachus. Where now does the face of modesty or virtue avail aught? seeing that godlessness holds sway, and virtue is neglected by men and thrust behind them, lawlessness o'er law prevailing, and mortals no longer making common cause to keep the jealousy of gods from reaching them.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA Reappearing from the tent\nI have come from the tent to look out for my husband, who went away and left its shelter long ago; while that poor child, my daughter, hearing of the death her father designs for her, is in tears, uttering in many keys her piteous lamentation.\nCatching sight of AGAMEMNON\nIt Seems I was speaking of one not far away; for there is Agamemnon, who will soon be detected in the commission of a crime against his own child.\nEnter AGAMEMNON.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nDaughter of Leda, 'tis lucky I have found thee outside the tent, to discuss with thee in our daughter's absence subjects not suited for the ears of maidens on the eve of marriage.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat, pray, is dependent on the present crisis?\n\nAGAMEMNON\nSend the maiden out to join her father, for the lustral water stands there ready, and barley-meal to scatter with the hand on the cleansing flame, and heifers to be slain in honour of the goddess Artemis, to usher in the marriage, their black blood spouting from them.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nThough fair the words thou usest, I know not how I am to name thy deeds in terms of praise.\n\nCome forth, my daughter; full well thou knowest what is in thy father's mind; take the child Orestes, thy brother, and bring him with thee in the folds of thy robe.\nEnter IPHIGENIA.\nBehold chold she comes, in obedience to thy summons. Myself will speak the rest alike for her and me.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nMy child, why weepest thou and no longer lookest cheerfully? why art thou fixing thine eyes upon the ground and holding thy robe before them?\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAlas! with which of my woes shall I begin? for I may treat them all as first, or put them last or midway anywhere.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHow now? I find you all alike, confusion and alarm in every eye.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nMy husband, answer frankly the questions I ask thee.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nThere is no necessity to order me; I am willing to be questioned.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nDost thou mean to slay thy child and mine?\n\nAGAMEMNON Starting\nHa! these are heartless words, unwarranted suspicions!\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nPeace! answer me that question first.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nPut a fair question and thou shalt have a fair answer.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nI have no other questions to put; give me no other answers.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nO fate revered, O destiny, and fortune mine!\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAye, and mine and this maid's too; the three share one bad fortune.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nWhom have I injured?\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nDost thou ask me this question? A thought like that itself amounts to thoughtlessness.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nRuined! my secret out!\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nI know all; I have heard what thou art bent on doing to me. Thy very silence and those frequent groans are a confession; tire not thyself by telling it.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nLo! I am silent; for, if I tell thee a falsehood, needs must I add effrontery to misfortune.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWell, listen; for I will now unfold my meaning and no longer employ dark riddles. In the first place-to reproach thee first with this-it was not of my own free will but by force that thou didst take and wed me, after slaying Tantalus, my former husband, and dashing my babe on the ground alive, when thou hadst torn him from my breast with brutal violence. Then, when those two sons of Zeus, who were likewise my brothers, came flashing on horseback to war with thee, Tyndareus, my aged sire, rescued thee because of thy suppliant prayers, and thou in turn hadst me to wife. Once reconciled to thee upon this footing, thou wilt bear me witness I have been a blameless wife to thee and thy family, chaste in love, an honour to thy house, that so thy coming in might be with joy and thy going out with gladness. And 'tis seldom a man secures a wife like this, though the getting of a worthless woman is no rarity.\n\nBesides three daughters, of one of whom thou art heartlessly depriving me, I am the mother of this son of thine. If anyone asks thee thy reason for slaying her, tell me, what wilt thou say? or must say it for thee? \"It is that Menelaus may recover Helen.\" An honourable exchange, indeed, to pay a wicked woman's price in children's lives! 'Tis buying what we most detest with what we hold most dear. Again, if thou go forth with the host, leaving me in thy halls, and art long absent at Troy, what will my feelings be at home, dost think? when I behold each vacant chair and her chamber now deserted, and then sit down alone in tears, making ceaseless lamentation for her, \"Ah! my child, he that begat thee hath slain thee himself, he and no one else, nor was it by another's hand...to thy home, after leaving such a price to be paid; for it needs now but a trifling pretext for me and the daughters remaining to give thee the reception it is right thou shouldst receive. I adjure thee by the gods, compel me not to sin against thee, nor sin thyself. Go to; suppose thou sacrifice the child; what prayer wilt thou utter, when 'tis done? what will the blessing be that thou wilt invoke upon thyself as thou art slaying our daughter? an ill returning maybe, seeing the disgrace that speeds thy going forth. Is it right that I should pray for any luck to attend thee? Surely we should deem the gods devoid of sense, if we harboured a kindly feeling towards murderers. Shalt thou embrace thy children on thy coming back to Argos? Nay, thou hast no right. Will any child of thing e'er face thee, if thou have surrendered one of them to death? Has this ever entered into thy calculations, or does thy one duty consist in carrying a sceptre about and marching at the head of an army? when thou mightest have made this fair proposal among the Argives; \"Is it your wish, Achaeans, to sail for Phrygia's shores? Why then, cast lots whose daughter has to die.\" For that would have been a fair course for thee to pursue, instead of picking out thy own child for the victim and presenting her to the Danai; or Menelaus, inasmuch as it was his concern, should have slain Hermione for her mother. As it is, I, who still am true to thee, must lose my child; while she, who went astray, will return with her daughter, and live in happiness at Sparta. If I am wrong in aught herein, answer me; but if my words have been fairly urged, do not still slay thy child, who is mine too, and thou wilt be wise.\n\nCHORUS\nHearken to her Agamemnon, for to join in saving thy children's lives is surely a noble deed; none would gainsay this.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nHad I the eloquence of Orpheus, my father, to move the rocks by chanted spells to follow me, or to charm by speaking whom I would, I had resorted to it. But as it is, I'll bring my tears-the only art I know; for that I might attempt. And about thy knees, in suppliant wise, I twine my limbs these limbs thy wife here bore. Destroy me not before my time, for sweet is to look upon the light, and force\nme not to visit scenes below. I was the first to call thee father, thou the first to call me child; the first was I to sit upon thy knee and give and take the fond caress. And this was what thou then wouldst say, \"Shall I see thee, my child, living a happy prosperous life in a husband's home one day, in a manner worthy of myself?\" And I in my turn would ask, as I hung about thy beard, whereto I now am clinging, \"How shall I see thee? Shall I be giving thee a glad reception in my halls, father, in thy old age, repaying all thy anxious care in rearing me?\n\nI remember all we said, 'tis thou who hast forgotten and now wouldst take my life. By Pelops, I entreat thee spare me, by thy father Atreus and my mother here, who suffers now a second time the pangs she felt before when bearing me! What have I to do with the marriage of Paris and Helen? why is his coming to prove my ruin, father? Look upon me; one glance, one kiss bestow, that this at least I may carry to my death as a memorial of thee, though thou heed not my pleading.  (Holding up the babe to ORESTES)  Feeble ally though thou art, brother, to thy loved ones, yet add thy tears to mine and entreat our father for thy sister's life; even in babes there is a natural sense of ill. O father, see this speechless supplication made to thee; pity me; have mercy on my tender years! Yea, by thy beard we two fond hearts implore thy pity, the one a babe, a full-grown maid the other. By summing all my pleas in one, I will prevail in what I say. To gaze upon yon light is man's most cherished gift; that life below is nothingness, and whoso longs for death is mad. Better live a life of woe than die a death of glory!\n\nCHORUS\nAh, wretched Helen! Awful the struggle that has come to the sons of Atreus and their children, thanks to thee and those marriages\nof thine.\n\nAGAMEMNON\nWhile loving my own children, I yet understand what should move my pity and what should not; I were a madman else. 'Tis terrible for me to bring myself to this, nor less terrible is it to refuse, daughter; for I must fare the same. Ye see the vastness of von naval host, and the numbers of bronze clad warriors from Hellas, who can neither make their way to Ilium's towers nor raze the far-famed citadel of Troy, unless I offer thee according to the word of Calchas the seer. Some mad desire possesses the host of Hellas to sail forthwith to the land of the barbarians, and put a stop to the rape of wives from Hellas, and they will slay my daughters in Argos as well as you and me, if I disregard the goddess's behests. It is not Menelaus who hath enslaved me to him, child, nor have I followed wish of his; nay, 'tis Hellas, for whom I must sacrifice thee whether I will or no; to this necessity I bow my head; for her freedom must be preserved, as far as any help of thine, daughter, or mine can go; nor must they, who are the sons Hellas, be pillaged of their wives by barbarian robbery.\n\nAGAMEMNON rushes from the stage,\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nMy child Ye stranger ladies!  Woe is me for this thy death! Thy father flies, surrendering thee to Hades.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nWoe is me, O mother mine! for the same strain hath fallen to both of us in our fortune. No more for me the light of day! no more the beams of yonder sun! Woe for that snow-beat glen in Phrygia and the hills of Ida, where Priam once exposed a tender babe, torn from his mother's arms to meet a deadly doom, e'en Paris, called the child of Ida in the Phrygians' town. Would Priam ne'er had settled him, the herdsman reared amid the herds, beside that water crystal-clear, where are fountains of the Nymphs and their meadow rich with blooming flowers, where hyacinths and rose buds blow for goddesses to gather!\n\nHither one day came Pallas and Cypris of the subtle heart, Hera too and Hermes messenger of Zeus-Cypris, proud of the longing she causes; Pallas of her prowess; and Hera of her royal marriage with king Zeus-to decide a hateful strife about their beauty; but it is my death, maidens-fraught, 'tis true, with glory to the Danai-that Artemis has received as an offering, before they begin the voyage to Ilium.\n\nO mother, mother! he that begat me to this life of sorrow has gone\nand left me all alone. Ah! woe is me! a bitter, bitter sight for me\nwas Helen, evil Helen! to me now doomed to bleed and die, slaughtered by an impious sire.\n\nI would this Aulis had never received in its havens here the sterns\nof their bronze-beaked ships, the fleet which was speeding them to\nTroy; and would that Zeus had never breathed on the Euripus a wind to stop the expedition, tempering, as he doth, a different breeze to different men, so that some have joy in setting sail, and sorrow some, and others hard constraint, to make some start and others stay and others furl their sails! Full of trouble then, it seems, is the race of mortals, full of trouble verily; and 'tis ever Fate's decree that man should find distress.\n\nWoe! woe to thee, thou child of Tyndareus, for the suffering and anguish sore, which thou art causing the Danai!\n\nCHORUS\nI pity thee for thy cruel fate-a fate I would thou ne'er hadst met!\n\nIPHIGENIA\nO mother that bare me! I see a throng of men approaching.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nIt is the goddess-born thou seest, child, for whom thou camest hither.\n\nIPHIGENIA\n(Calling into the tent) Open the tent-door to me, servants, that I may hide myself.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhy seek to fly, my child?\n\nIPHIGENIA\nI am ashamed to face Achilles.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWherefore?\n\nIPHIGENIA\nThe luckless ending to our marriage causes me to feel abashed.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nNo time for affectation now in face of what has chanced. Stay then; reserve will do no good, if only we can-  (Enter ACHILLES.)\n\nACHILLES\nDaughter of Leda, lady of sorrows!\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nNo misnomer that.\n\nACHILLES\nA fearful cry is heard among the Argives.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat is it? tell me.\n\nACHILLES\nIt concerns thy child.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAn evil omen for thy words.\n\nACHILLES\nThey say her sacrifice is necessary.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAnd is there no one to say a word against them?\n\nACHILLES\nIndeed I was in some danger myself from the tumult.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nIn danger of what? kind sir.\n\nACHILLES\nOf being stoned.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nSurely not for trying to save my daughter?\n\nACHILLES\nThe very reason.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWho would have dared to lay a finger on thee?\n\nACHILLES\nThe men of Hellas, one and all.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWere not thy Myrmidon warriors at thy side?\n\nACHILLES\nThey were the first who turned against me.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nMy child! we are lost, undone, it seems.\n\nACHILLES\nThey taunted me as the man whom marriage had enslaved.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAnd what didst thou answer them?\n\nACHILLES\nI craved the life of her I meant to wed-\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nJustly so.\n\nACHILLES\nThe wife her father promised me.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAye, and sent to fetch from Argos.\n\nACHILLES\nBut I was overcome by clamorous cries.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nTruly the mob is a dire mischief.\n\nACHILLES\nBut I will help thee for all that.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWilt thou really fight them single-handed?\n\nACHILLES\nDost see these warriors here, carrying my arms?\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nBless thee for thy kind intent!\n\nACHILLES\nWell, I shall be blessed.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nThen my child will not be slaughtered now?\n\nACHILLES\nNo, not with my consent at any rate.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nBut will any of them come to lay hands on the maid?\n\nACHILLES\nThousands of them, with Odysseus at their head.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nThe son of Sisyphus?\n\nACHILLES\nThe very same.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nActing for himself or by the army's order?\n\nACHILLES\nBy their choice-and his own.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAn evil choice indeed, to stain his hands in blood!\n\nACHILLES\nBut I will hold him back.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWill he seize and bear her hence against her will?\n\nACHILLES\nAye, by her golden hair no doubt.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat must I do, when it comes to that?\n\nACHILLES\nKeep hold of thy daughter.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nBe sure that she shall not be slain, as far as that\ncan help her.\n\nACHILLES\nBelieve me, it will come to this.\n\nIPHIGENIA Mother, hear me while I speak, for I see that thou art\nwroth with thy husband to no purpose; 'tis hard for us to persist\nin impossibilities. Our thanks are due to this stranger for his ready\nhelp; but thou must also see to it that he is not reproached by the\narmy, leaving us no better off and himself involved in trouble. Listen,mother; hear what thoughts have passed across my mind. I am resolved to die; and this I fain would do with honour, dismissing from me what is mean. Towards this now, mother, turn thy thoughts, and with me weigh how well I speak; to me the whole of mighty Hellas looks; on me the passage o'er the sea depends; on me the sack of Troy; and in my power it lies to check henceforth barbarian on happy Hellas, if ever in the days to come they seek to seize her daughters, when once they have atoned by death for the violation of Helen's marriage by Paris. All this deliverance will my death insure, and my fame for setting Hellas free will be a happy one. Besides, I have no right at all to cling too fondly to my life; for thou didst not bear me for myself alone, but as a public blessing to all Hellas. What! shall countless warriors, armed with shields, those myriads sitting at the oar, find courage to attack the foe and die for Hellas, because their fatherland is wronged, and my one life prevent all this? What kind of justice is that? could I find a word in answer? Now turn we to that other point. It is not right that this man should enter the lists with all Argos or be slain fox a woman's sake. Better a single man should see the light than ten thousand women. If Artemis is minded to take this body, am I, a weak mortal, to thwart the goddess? Nay, that were impossible. To Hellas I resign it; offer this sacrifice and make an utter end of Troy. This is my enduring monument; marriage, motherhood, and fame-all these is it to me. And it is but right, mother, that Hellenes should rule barbarians, but not barbarians Hellenes, those being slaves, while these are free.\n\nCHORUS\nThou playest a noble part, maiden; but sickly are the whims of Fate and the goddess.\n\nACHILLES\nDaughter of Agamemnon I some god was bent on blessing me, could I but have won thee for my wife. In thee I reckon Hellas happy, and thee in Hellas; for this that thou hast said is good and worthy of thy fatherland; since thou, abandoning a strife with heavenly powers, which are too strong for thee, has fairly weighed advantages and needs. But now that I have looked into thy noble nature, I feel still more a fond desire to win thee for my bride. Look to it; for I would fain serve thee and receive thee in my halls; and witness Thetis, how I grieve to think I shall not save thy life by doing battle with the Danai. Reflect, I say; a dreadful ill is death.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nThis I say, without regard to anyone. Enough that the daughter of Tyndareus is causing wars and bloodshed by her beauty; then be not slain thyself, sir stranger, nor seek to slay another on my account; but let me, if I can, save Hellas.\n\nACHILLES\nHeroic spirit! I can say no more to this, since thou art\nso minded; for thine is a noble resolve; why should not one avow the truth? Yet will I speak, for thou wilt haply change thy mind; that thou mayst know then what my offer is, I will go and place these arms of mine near the altar, resolved not to permit thy death but to prevent it; for brave as thou art, at sight of the knife held at thy throat, thou wilt soon avail thyself of what I said. So I will not let thee perish through any thoughtlessness of thine, but will go to the temple of the goddess with these arms and await thy arrival there.  (Exit ACHILLES.)\n\nIPHIGENIA\nMother, why so silent, thine eyes wet with tears?\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nI have reason, woe is me! to be sad at heart.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nForbear; make me not a coward; here in one thing obey me.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nSay what it is, my child, for at my hands thou shalt ne'er suffer injury.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nCut not off the tresses of thy hair for me, nor clothe thyself in sable garb.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhy, my child, What is it thou hast said? Shall I, when I lose thee-\n\nIPHIGENIA\n\"Lose\" me, thou dost not; I am saved and thou renowned, as far as I can make thee.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nHow so? Must I not mourn thy death?\n\nIPHIGENIA\nBy no means, for I shall have no tomb heaped o'er me.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat, is not the act of dying held to imply burial?\n\nIPHIGENIA\nThe altar of the goddess, Zeus's daughter, will be my tomb.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWell, my child, I will let thee persuade me, for thou sayest well.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nAye, as one who prospereth and doeth Hellas service.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhat message shall I carry to thy sisters?\n\nIPHIGENIA\nPut not mourning raiment on them either.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nBut is there no fond message I can give the maidens from thee?\n\nIPHIGENIA\nYes, my farewell words; and promise me to rear this babe Orestes to manhood.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nPress him to thy bosom; 'tis thy last look.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nO thou that art most dear to me! thou hast helped thy friends as thou hadst means.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nIs there anything I can do to pleasure thee in Argos?\n\nIPHIGENIA\nYes, hate not my father, thy own husband.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nFearful are the trials through which he has to go because of thee.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nIt was against his will he ruined me for the sake of Hellas.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nAh! but be employed base treachery, unworthy of Atreus.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nWho will escort me hence, before my hair is torn?\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nI will go with thee.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nNo, not thou; thou say'st not well.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nI will, clinging to thy robes.\n\nIPHIGENIA\nBe persuaded by me, mother, stay here; for this is the better way alike for me and thee; but let one of these attendants of my father conduct me to the meadow of Artemis, where I shall be sacrificed.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nArt gone from me, my child?\n\nIPHIGENIA\nAye, and with no chance of ever returning.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nLeaving thy mother?\n\nIPHIGENIA\nYes, as thou seest, undeservedly.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nHold! leave me not!\n\nIPHIGENIA\nI cannot let thee shed a tear.  (Exit CLYTAEMNESTRA. To the CHORUS)  Be it yours, maidens, to hymn in joyous strains Artemis, the child of Zeus, for my hard lot; and let the order for a solemn hush go forth to the Danai. Begin the sacrifice with the baskets, let the fire blaze for the purifying meal of sprinkling, and my father pace from left to right about the altar; for I come to bestow on Hellas safety crowned with victory. Lead me hence, me the destroyer of Ilium's town and the Phrygians; give me wreaths to cast about me; bring them hither; here are my tresses to crown; bring lustral water too. Dance to Artemis, queen Artemis the blest, around her fane and altar; for by the blood of my sacrifice I will blot out the oracle, if it needs must be.\n\nO mother, lady revered! for thee shall my tears be shed, and now; for at the holy rites I may not weep.\n\nSing with me, maidens, sing the praises of Artemis, whose temple faces Chalcis, where angry spearmen madly chafe, here in the narrow havens of Aulis, because of me.\n\nO Pelasgia, land of my birth, and Mycenae, my home!\n\nCHORUS\nIs it on Perseus' citadel thou callest, that town Cyclopean workmen build\n\nIPHIGENIA\nTo be a light to Hellas didst thou rear me, and so I say not No to death.\n\nCHORUS\nThou art right; no fear that fame will e'er desert thee!\n\nIPHIGENIA\nHail to thee, bright lamp of day and light of Zeus! A different life, different lot is henceforth mine. Farewell I bid thee, light beloved!  (Exit IPHIGENIA.)\n\nCHORUS\nBehold the maiden on her way, the destroyer of Ilium's town and its Phrygians, with garlands twined about her head, and drops of lustral water on her, soon to besprinkle with her gushing blood the altar of a murderous goddess, what time her shapely neck is severed.\n\nFor thee fair streams of a father's pouring and lustral waters are\nin store, for thee Achaea's host is waiting, eager to reach the citadel of Ilium. But let us celebrate Artemis, the daughter of Zeus, queen among the gods, as if upon some happy chance.\n\nO lady revered, delighting in human sacrifice, send on its way to Phrygia's land the host of the Hellenes, to Troy's abodes of guile, and grant that Agamemnon may wreathe his head with deathless fame, a crown of fairest glory for the spearmen of Hellas.  (Enter MESSENGER.)\n\nMESSENGER\nCome forth, O Clytaemnestra, daughter of Tyndareus, from the tent, to hear my news.  (Enter CLYTAEMNESTRA.)\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nI heard thy voice and am come in sad dismay and fearful dread, not sure but what thou hast arrived with tidings of some fresh trouble for me besides the present woe.\n\nMESSENGER\nNay, rather would I unfold to thee a story strange and marvellous about thy child.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nDelay not, then, but speak at once.\n\nMESSENGER\nDear mistress, thou shalt learn all clearly; from the outset will I tell it, unless my memory fail me somewhat and confuse my tongue in its account. As soon as we reached the grove of Artemis, the child of Zeus, and the meadows gay with flowers, where the Achaean troops were gathered, bringing thy daughter with us, forthwith the Argive host began assembling; but when king Agamemnon saw the maiden on her way to the grove to be sacrificed, he gave one groan, and, turning away his face, let the tears burst from his eyes, as he held his robe before them. But the maid, standing close by him that begot her, spake on this wise, \"O my father, here am I to do thy bidding; freely I offer this body of mine for my country and all Hellas, that ye may lead me to the altar of the goddess and sacrifice me, since this is Heaven's ordinance. Good luck be yours for any help that I afford! and may ye obtain the victor's gift and come again to the land of your fathers. So then let none of the Argives lay hands on me, for I will bravely yield my neck without a word.\"\n\nShe spake; and each man marvelled, as he heard the maiden's brave, unflinching speech. But in the midst up stood Talthybius-for his this duty was-and bade the host refrain from word or deed; and Calchas, the seer, drawing a sharp sword from out its scabbard laid it in a basket of beaten gold, crowning the maiden's head the while. Then the son of Peleus, taking the basket and with it lustral water in his hand, ran round the altar of the goddess uttering these words, \"O Artemis, thou child of Zeus, slayer of wild beasts, that wheelest thy dazzling light amid the gloom, accept this sacrifice, which we, the host of the Achaeans and king Agamemnon with us, offer to thee, even pure blood from a beauteous maiden's neck; and grant us safe sailing for our ships and the sack of Troy's towers by our spears.\"\n\nMeantime the sons of Atreus and all the host stood looking on the ground, while the priest, seizing his knife, offered up a prayer and was closely scanning the maiden's throat to see where he should strike. 'Twas no slight sorrow filled my heart, as I stood by with bowed head; when lo! a sudden miracle! Each one of us distinctly heard the sound of a blow, but none saw the spot where the maiden vanished. Loudly the priest cried out, and all the host took up the cry at the sight of a marvel all unlooked for, due to some god's agency, and passing all belief, although 'twas seen; for there upon the ground lay a hind of size immense and passing fair to sec, gasping out her life, with whose blood the altar of the goddess was thoroughly bedewed. Whereon spake Calchas thus-his joy thou canst imagine-\"Ye captains of this leagued Achaean host, do ye see this victim, which the goddess has set before her altar, a mountain roaming hind? This is more welcome to her by far than the maid, that she may not defile her altar by shedding noble blood. Gladly has she accepted it and is granting us a prosperous voyage for our attack on Ilium. Wherefore take heart,\nsailors, each man of you, and away to your ships, for to-day must we leave the hollow bays of Aulis and cross the Aegean main.\"\n\nThen, when the sacrifice was wholly burnt to ashes in the blazing flame, he offered such prayers as were meet, that the army might win return; but me Agamemnon sends to tell thee this, and say what Heaven-sent luck is his, and how he hath secured undying fame throughout the length of Hellas. Now I was there myself and speak as an eye-witness; without a doubt thy child flew away to the gods. A truce then to thy sorrowing, and cease to be wroth with thy husband; for God's ways with man are not what we expect, and those whom he loves, he keepeth safe; yea, for this day hath seen thy daughter dead and brought to life again.\n(Exit MESSENGER.)\n\nCHORUS\nWhat joy to hear these tidings from the messenger! He tells thee thy child is living still, among the gods.\n\nCLYTAEMNESTRA\nWhich of the gods, my child, hath stolen thee? How am I to address thee? How can I be sure that this is not an idle tale told to cheer me, to make me cease my piteous lamentation for thee?\n\nCHORUS\nLo! king Agamemnon approaches, to confirm this story for thee.\n(Enter AGAMEMNON.)\n\nAGAMEMNON\nHappy may we be counted, lady, as far as concerns our daughter; for she hath fellowship with gods in very sooth. But thou must take this tender babe and start for home, for the host is looking now to sail. Fare thee well! 'tis long ere I shall greet thee on my return from Troy; may it be well with thee!\n\nCHORUS\nSon of Atreus, start for Phrygia's land with joy and so return, I pray, after taking from Troy her fairest spoils.  (Exeunt OMNES.)\n\nTHE END3Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1740247", "artist_names": "Ohio Players", "full_title": "Feel the Beat (Everybody Disco)

(Chap. 25) LyricsLittle Britain.\n\nWhat I write is most true..... I have a whole booke of cases lying by me, which if I should sette foorth, some grave auntients (within the hearing of Bow Bell) would be out of charity with me. NASH.\n\nIN the centre of the great City of London lies a small neighborhood, consisting of a cluster of narrow streets and courts, of very venerable and debilitated houses, which goes by the name of LITTLE BRITAIN. Christ Church School and St. Bartholomew's Hospital bound it on the west; Smithfield and Long Lane on the north; Aldersgate Street, like an arm of the sea, divides it from the eastern part of the city; whilst the yawning gulf of Bull-and-Mouth Street separates it from Butcher Lane and the regions of Newgate. Over this little territory, thus bounded and designated, the great dome of St. Paul's, swelling above the intervening houses of Paternoster Row, Amen Corner, and Ave-Maria Lane, looks down with an air of motherly protection.\n\nThis quarter derives its appellation from having been, in ancient times, the residence of the Dukes of Brittany. As London increased, however, rank and fashion rolled off to the west, and trade, creeping on at their heels, took possession of their deserted abodes. For some time Little Britain became the great mart of learning, and was peopled by the busy and prolific race of booksellers: these also gradually deserted it, and, emigrating beyond the great strait of Newgate Street, settled down in Paternoster Row and St. Paul's Churchyard, where they continue to increase and multiply even at the present day.\n\nBut, though thus fallen into decline, Little Britain still bears traces of its former splendor. There are several houses ready to tumble down, the fronts of which are magnificently enriched with old oaken carvings of hideous faces, unknown birds, beasts, and fishes, and fruits and flowers which it would perplex a naturalist to classify. There are also, in Aldersgate Street, certain remains of what were once spacious and lordly family mansions, but which have in latter days been subdivided into several tenements. Here may often be found the family of a petty tradesman, with its trumpery furniture, burrowing among the relics of antiquated finery in great rambling time-stained apartments with fretted ceilings, gilded cornices, and enormous marble fireplaces. The lanes and courts also contain many smaller houses, not on so grand a scale, but, like your small ancient gentry, sturdily maintaining their claims to equal antiquity. These have their gable ends to the street, great bow windows with diamond panes set in lead, grotesque carvings, and low arched doorways.*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* It is evident that the author of this interesting\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0communication has included, in his general title of Little\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Britain, man of those little lanes and courts that belong\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0immediately to Cloth Fair.\nIn this most venerable and sheltered little nest have I passed several quiet years of existence, comfortably lodged in the second floor of one of the smallest but oldest edifices. My sitting-room is an old wainscoted chamber, with small panels and set off with a miscellaneous array of furniture. I have a particular respect for three or four high-backed, claw-footed chairs, covered with tarnished brocade, which bear the marks of having seen better days, and have doubtless figured in some of the old palaces of Little Britain. They seem to me to keep together and to look down with sovereign contempt upon their leathern-bottomed neighbors, as I have seen decayed gentry carry a high head among the plebeian society with which they were reduced to associate. The whole front of my sitting-room is taken up with a bow window, on the panes of which are recorded the names of previous occupants for many generations, mingled with scraps of very indifferent gentleman-like poetry, written in characters which I can scarcely decipher, and which extol the charms of many a beauty of Little Britain who has long, long since bloomed, faded, and passed away. As I am an idle personage, with no apparent occupation, and pay my bill regularly every week, I am looked upon as the only independent gentleman of the neighborhood, and, being curious to learn the internal state of a community so apparently shut up within itself, I have managed to work my way into all the concerns and secrets of the place.\n\nLittle Britain may truly be called the heart's core of the city, the stronghold of true John Bullism. It is a fragment of London as it was in its better days, with its antiquated folks and fashions. Here flourish in great preservation many of the holiday games and customs of yore. The inhabitants most religiously eat pancakes on Shrove Tuesday, hot cross-buns on Good Friday, and roast goose at Michaelmas; they send love-letters on Valentine's Day, burn the Pope on the Fifth of November, and kiss all the girls under the mistletoe at Christmas. Roast beef and plum-pudding are also held in superstitious veneration, and port and sherry maintain their grounds as the only true English wines, all others being considered vile outlandish beverages.\n\nLittle Britain has its long catalogue of city wonders, which its inhabitants consider the wonders of the world, such as the great bell of St. Paul's, which sours all the beer when it tolls; the figures that strike the hours at St. Dunstan's clock; the Monument; the lions in the Tower; and the wooden giants in Guildhall. They still believe in dreams and fortune-telling, and an old woman that lives in Bull-and-Mouth Street makes a tolerable subsistence by detecting stolen goods and promising the girls good husbands. They are apt to be rendered uncomfortable by comets and eclipses, and if a dog howls dolefully at night it is looked upon as a sure sign of death in the place. There are even many ghost-stories current, particularly concerning the old mansion-houses, in several of which it is said strange sights are sometimes seen. Lords and ladies, the former in full-bottomed wigs, hanging sleeves, and swords, the latter in lappets, stays, hoops, and brocade, have been seen walking up and down the great waste chambers on moonlight nights, and are supposed to be the shades of the ancient proprietors in their court-dresses.\n\nLittle Britain has likewise its sages and great men. One of the most important of the former is a tall, dry old gentleman of the name of Skryme, who keeps a small apothecary's shop. He has a cadaverous countenance, full of cavities and projections, with a brown circle round each eye, like a pair of horn spectacles. He is much thought of by the old women, who consider him as a kind of conjurer because he has two or three stuffed alligators hanging up in his shop and several snakes in bottles. He is a great reader of almanacs and newspapers, and is much given to pore over alarming accounts of plots, conspiracies, fires, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions; which last phenomena he considers as signs of the times. He has always some dismal tale of the kind to deal out to his customers with their doses, and thus at the same time puts both soul and body into an uproar. He is a great believer in omens and predictions; and has the prophecies of Robert Nixon and Mother Shipton by heart. No man can make so much out of an eclipse, or even an unusually dark day; and he shook the tail of the last comet over the heads of his customers and disciples until they were nearly frightened out of their wits. He has lately got hold of a popular legend or prophecy, on which he has been unusually eloquent. There has been a saying current among the ancient sibyls, who treasure up these things, that when the grasshopper on the top of the Exchange shook hands with the dragon on the top of Bow Church steeple, fearful events would take place. This strange conjunction, it seems, has as strangely come to pass. The same architect has been engaged lately on the repairs of the cupola of the Exchange and the steeple of Bow Church; and, fearful to relate, the dragon and the grasshopper actually lie, cheek by jole, in the yard of his workshop.\n\n\"Others,\" as Mr. Skryme is accustomed to say, \"may go star-gazing, and look for conjunctions in the heavens, but here is a conjunction on the earth, near at home and under our own eyes, which surpasses all the signs and calculations of astrologers.\" Since these portentous weathercocks have thus laid their heads together, wonderful events had already occurred. The good old king, notwithstanding that he had lived eighty-two years, had all at once given up the ghost; another king had mounted the throne; a royal duke had died suddenly; another, in France, had been murdered; there had been radical meetings in all parts of the kingdom; the bloody scenes at Manchester; the great plot in Cato Street; and, above all, the queen had returned to England! All these sinister events are recounted by Mr. Skyrme with a mysterious look and a dismal shake of the head; and being taken with his drugs, and associated in the minds of his auditors with stuffed-sea-monsters, bottled serpents, and his own visage, which is a title-page of tribulation, they have spread great gloom through the minds of the people of Little Britain. They shake their heads whenever they go by Bow Church, and observe that they never expected any good to come of taking down that steeple, which in old times told nothing but glad tidings, as the history of Whittington and his Cat bears witness.\n\nThe rival oracle of Little Britain is a substantial cheesemonger, who lives in a fragment of one of the old family mansions, and is as magnificently lodged as a round-bellied mite in the midst of one of his own Cheshires. Indeed, he is a man of no little standing and importance, and his renown extends through Huggin lane and Lad lane, and even unto Aldermanbury. His opinion is very much taken in affairs of state, having read the Sunday papers for the last half century, together with the Gentleman's Magazine, Rapin's History of England, and the Naval Chronicle. His head is stored with invaluable maxims which have borne the test of time and use for centuries. It is his firm opinion that \"it is a moral impossible,\" so long as England is true to herself, that anything can shake her: and he has much to say on the subject of the national debt, which, somehow or other, he proves to be a great national bulwark and blessing. He passed the greater part of his life in the purlieus of Little Britain until of late years, when, having become rich and grown into the dignity of a Sunday cane, he begins to take his pleasure and see the world. He has therefore made several excursions to Hampstead, Highgate, and other neighboring towns, where he has passed whole afternoons in looking back upon the metropolis through a telescope and endeavoring to descry the steeple of St. Bartholomew's. Not a stage-coachman of Bull-and-Mouth Street but touches his hat as he passes, and he is considered quite a patron at the coach-office of the Goose and Gridiron, St. Paul's Churchyard. His family have been very urgent for him to make an expedition to Margate, but he has great doubts of those new gimcracks, the steamboats, and indeed thinks himself too advanced in life to undertake sea-voyages.\n\nLittle Britain has occasionally its factions and divisions, and party spirit ran very high at one time, in consequence of two rival \"Burial Societies\" being set up in the place. One held its meeting at the Swan and Horse-Shoe, and was patronized by the cheesemonger; the other at the Cock and Crown, under the auspices of the apothecary: it is needless to say that the latter was the most flourishing. I have passed an evening or two at each, and have acquired much valuable information as to the best mode of being buried, the comparative merits of churchyards, together with divers hints on the subject of patent iron coffins. I have heard the question discussed in all its bearings as to the legality of prohibiting the latter on account of their durability. The feuds occasioned by these societies have happily died of late; but they were for a long time prevailing themes of controversy, the people of Little Britain being extremely solicitous of funeral honors and of lying comfortably in their graves.\n\nBesides these two funeral societies there is a third of quite a different cast, which tends to throw the sunshine of good-humor over the whole neighborhood. It meets once a week at a little old-fashioned house kept by a jolly publican of the name of Wagstaff, and bearing for insignia a resplendent half-moon, with a most seductive bunch of grapes. The whole edifice is covered with inscriptions to catch the eye of the thirsty wayfarer; such as \"Truman, Hanbury, and Co's Entire,\" \"Wine, Rum, and Brandy Vaults,\" \"Old Tom, Rum, and Compounds,\" etc. This indeed has been a temple of Bacchus and Momus from time immemorial. It has always been in the family of the Wagstaffs, so that its history is tolerably preserved by the present landlord. It was much frequented by the gallants and cavalieros of the reign of Elizabeth, and was looked into now and then by the wits of Charles the Second's day. But what Wagstaff principally prides himself upon is that Henry the Eighth, in one of his nocturnal rambles, broke the head of one of his ancestors with his famous walking-staff. This, however, is considered as rather a dubious and vain-glorious boast of the landlord.\n\nThe club which now holds its weekly sessions here goes by the name of \"the Roaring Lads of Little Britain.\" They abound in old catches, glees, and choice stories that are traditional in the place and not to be met with in any other part of the metropolis. There is a madcap undertaker who is inimitable at a merry song, but the life of the club, and indeed the prime wit of Little Britain, is bully Wagstaff himself. His ancestors were all wags before him, and he has inherited with the inn a large stock of songs and jokes, which go with it from generation to generation as heirlooms. He is a dapper little fellow, with bandy legs and pot belly, a red face with a moist merry eye, and a little shock of gray hair behind. At the opening of every club night he is called in to sing his \"Confession of Faith,\" which is the famous old drinking trowl from \"Gammer Gurton's Needle.\" He sings it, to be sure, with many variations, as he received it from his father's lips; for it has been a standing favorite at the Half-Moon and Bunch of Grapes ever since it was written; nay, he affirms that his predecessors have often had the honor of singing it before the nobility and gentry at Christmas mummeries, when Little Britain was in all its glory.*\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0* As mine host of the Half-Moon's Confession of Faith may\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0not be familiar to the majority of readers, and as it is a\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0specimen of the current songs of Little Britain, I subjoin\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0it in its original orthography.

Backe and syde go bare, go bare, etc.\n\nIt would do one's heart good to hear, on a club night, the shouts of merriment, the snatches of song, and now and then the choral bursts of half a dozen discordant voices, which issue from this jovial mansion. At such times the street is lined with listeners, who enjoy a delight equal to that of gazing into a confectioner's window or snuffing up the steams of a cook-shop.\n\nThere are two annual events which produce great stir and sensation in Little Britain: these are St. Bartholomew's Fair and the Lord Mayor's Day. During the time of the Fair, which is held in the adjoining regions of Smithfield, there is nothing going on but gossiping and gadding about. The late quiet streets of Little Britain are overrun with an irruption of strange figures and faces; every tavern is a scene of rout and revel. The fiddle and the song are heard from the taproom morning, noon, and night; and at each window may be seen some group of boon companions, with half-shut eyes, hats on one side, pipe in mouth and tankard in hand, fondling and prosing, and singing maudlin songs over their liquor. Even the sober decorum of private families, which I must say is rigidly kept up at other times among my neighbors, is no proof against this saturnalia. There is no such thing as keeping maid-servants within doors. Their brains are absolutely set madding with Punch and the Puppet-Show, the Flying Horses, Signior Polito, the Fire-Eater, the celebrated Mr. Paap, and the Irish Giant. The children too lavish all their holiday money in toys and gilt gingerbread, and fill the house with the Lilliputian din of drums, trumpets, and penny whistles.\n\nBut the Lord Mayor's Day is the great anniversary. The Lord Mayor is looked up to by the inhabitants of Little Britain as the greatest potentate upon earth, his gilt coach with six horses as the summit of human splendor, and his procession, with all the sheriffs and aldermen in his train, as the grandest of earthly pageants. How they exult in the idea that the king himself dare not enter the city without first knocking at the gate of Temple Bar and asking permission of the Lord Mayor; for if he did, heaven and earth! there is no knowing what might be the consequence. The man in armor who rides before the Lord Mayor, and is the city champion, has orders to cut down everybody that offends against the dignity of the city; and then there is the little man with a velvet porringer on his head, who sits at the window of the state coach and holds the city sword, as long as a pikestaff. Odd's blood! if he once draws that sword, Majesty itself is not safe.\n\nUnder the protection of this mighty potentate, therefore, the good people of Little Britain sleep in peace. Temple Bar is an effectual barrier against all interior foes; and as to foreign invasion, the Lord Mayor has but to throw himself into the Tower, call in the train-bands, and put the standing army of Beef-eaters under arms, and he may bid defiance to the world!\n\nThus wrapped up in its own concerns, its own habits, and its own opinions, Little Britain has long flourished as a sound heart to this great fungous metropolis. I have pleased myself with considering it as a chosen spot, where the principles of sturdy John Bullism were garnered up, like seed corn, to renew the national character when it had run to waste and degeneracy. I have rejoiced also in the general spirit of harmony that prevailed throughout it; for though there might now and then be a few clashes of opinion between the adherents of the cheesemonger and the apothecary, and an occasional feud between the burial societies, yet these were but transient clouds and soon passed away. The neighbors met with good-will, parted with a shake of the hand, and never abused each other except behind their backs.\n\nI could give rare descriptions of snug junketing parties at which I have been present, where we played at All-Fours, Pope-Joan, Tom-come-tickle-me, and other choice old games, and where we sometimes had a good old English country dance to the tune of Sir Roger de Coverley. Once a year also the neighbors would gather together and go on a gypsy party to Epping Forest. It would have done any man's heart good to see the merriment that took place here as we banqueted on the grass under the trees. How we made the woods ring with bursts of laughter at the songs of little Wagstaff and the merry undertaker! After dinner, too, the young folks would play at blindman's-buff and hide-and-seek, and it was amusing to see them tangled among the briers, and to hear a fine romping girl now and then squeak from among the bushes. The elder folks would gather round the cheesemonger and the apothecary to hear them talk politics, for they generally brought out a newspaper in their pockets to pass away time in the country. They would now and then, to be sure, get a little warm in argument; but their disputes were always adjusted by reference to a worthy old umbrella-maker in a double chin, who, never exactly comprehending the subject, managed somehow or other to decide in favor of both parties.\n\nAll empires, however, says some philosopher or historian, are doomed to changes and revolutions. Luxury and innovation creep in, factions arise, and families now and then spring up whose ambition and intrigues throw the whole system into confusion. Thus in letter days has the tranquillity of Little Britain been grievously disturbed and its golden simplicity of manners threatened with total subversion by the aspiring family of a retired butcher.\n\nThe family of the Lambs had long been among the most thriving and popular in the neighborhood: the Miss Lambs were the belles of Little Britain, and everybody was pleased when Old Lamb had made money enough to shut up shop and put his name on a brass plate on his door. In an evil hour, however, one of the Miss Lambs had the honor of being a lady in attendance on the Lady Mayoress at her grand annual ball, on which occasion she wore three towering ostrich feathers on her head. The family never got over it; they were immediately smitten with a passion for high life; set up a one-horse carriage, put a bit of gold lace round the errand-boy's hat, and have been the talk and detestation of the whole neighborhood ever since. They could no longer be induced to play at Pope-Joan or blindman's-buff; they could endure no dances but quadrilles, which nobody had ever heard of in Little Britain; and they took to reading novels, talking bad French, and playing upon the piano. Their brother, too, who had been articled to an attorney, set up for a dandy and a critic, characters hitherto unknown in these parts, and he confounded the worthy folks exceedingly by talking about Kean, the Opera, and the \"Edinburgh Review.\"\n\nWhat was still worse, the Lambs gave a grand ball, to which they neglected to invite any of their old neighbors; but they had a great deal of genteel company from Theobald's Road, Red Lion Square, and other parts towards the west. There were several beaux of their brother's acquaintance from Gray's Inn Lane and Hatton Garden, and not less than three aldermen's ladies with their daughters. This was not to be forgotten or forgiven. All Little Britain was in an uproar with the smacking of whips, the lashing of in miserable horses, and the rattling and jingling of hackney-coaches. The gossips of the neighborhood might be seen popping their night-caps out at every window, watching the crazy vehicles rumble by; and there was a knot of virulent old cronies that kept a look-out from a house just opposite the retired butcher's and scanned and criticised every one that knocked at the door.\n\nThis dance was a cause of almost open war, and the whole neighborhood declared they would have nothing more to say to the Lambs. It is true that Mrs. Lamb, when she had no engagements with her quality acquaintance, would give little humdrum tea-junketings to some of her old cronies, \"quite,\" as she would say, \"in a friendly way;\" and it is equally true that her invitations were always accepted, in spite of all previous vows to the contrary. Nay, the good ladies would sit and be delighted with the music of the Miss Lambs, who would condescend to strum an Irish melody for them on the piano; and they would listen with wonderful interest to Mrs. Lamb's anecdotes of Alderman Plunket's family, of Portsoken Ward, and the Miss Timberlakes, the rich heiresses of Crutched Friars but then they relieved their consciences and averted the reproaches of their confederates by canvassing at the next gossiping convocation everything that had passed, and pulling the Lambs and their rout all to pieces.\n\nThe only one of the family that could not be made fashionable was the retired butcher himself. Honest Lamb, in spite of the meekness of his name, was a rough, hearty old fellow, with the voice of a lion, a head of black hair like a shoe-brush, and a broad face mottled like his own beef. It was in vain that the daughters always spoke of him as \"the old gentleman,\" addressed him as \"papa\" in tones of infinite softness, and endeavored to coax him into a dressing-gown and slippers and other gentlemanly habits. Do what they might, there was no keeping down the butcher. His sturdy nature would break through all their glozings. He had a hearty vulgar good-humor that was irrepressible. His very jokes made his sensitive daughters shudder, and he persisted in wearing his blue cotton coat of a morning, dining at two o'clock, and having a \"bit of sausage with his tea.\"\n\nHe was doomed, however, to share the unpopularity of his family. He found his old comrades gradually growing cold and civil to him, no longer laughing at his jokes, and now and then throwing out a fling at \"some people\" and a hint about \"quality binding.\" This both nettled and perplexed the honest butcher; and his wife and daughters, with the consummate policy of the shrewder sex, taking advantage of the circumstance, at length prevailed upon him to give up his afternoon's pipe and tankard at Wagstaff's, to sit after dinner by himself and take his pint of port\u2014a liquor he detested\u2014and to nod in his chair in solitary and dismal gentility.\n\nThe Miss Lambs might now be seen flaunting along the streets in French bonnets with unknown beaux, and talking and laughing so loud that it distressed the nerves of every good lady within hearing. They even went so far as to attempt patronage, and actually induced a French dancing master to set up in the neighborhood; but the worthy folks of Little Britain took fire at it, and did so persecute the poor Gaul that he was fain to pack up fiddle and dancing-pumps and decamp with such precipitation that he absolutely forgot to pay for his lodgings.\n\nI had flattered myself, at first, with the idea that all this fiery indignation on the part of the community was merely the overflowing of their zeal for good old English manners and their horror of innovation, and I applauded the silent contempt they were so vociferous in expressing for upstart pride, French fashions and the Miss Lambs. But I grieve to say that I soon perceived the infection had taken hold, and that my neighbors, after condemning, were beginning to follow their example. I overheard my landlady importuning her husband to let their daughters have one quarter at French and music, and that they might take a few lessons in quadrille. I even saw, in the course of a few Sundays, no less than five French bonnets, precisely like those of the Miss Lambs, parading about Little Britain.\n\nI still had my hopes that all this folly would gradually die away, that the Lambs might move out of the neighborhood, might die, or might run away with attorneys' apprentices, and that quiet and simplicity might be again restored to the community. But unluckily a rival power arose. An opulent oilman died, and left a widow with a large jointure and a family of buxom daughters. The young ladies had long been repining in secret at the parsimony of a prudent father, which kept down all their elegant aspirings. Their ambition, being now no longer restrained, broke out into a blaze, and they openly took the field against the family of the butcher. It is true that the Lambs, having had the first start, had naturally an advantage of them in the fashionable career. They could speak a little bad French, play the piano, dance quadrilles, and had formed high acquaintances; but the Trotters were not to be distanced. When the Lambs appeared with two feathers in their hats, the Miss Trotters mounted four and of twice as fine colors. If the Lambs gave a dance, the Trotters were sure not to be behindhand; and, though they might not boast of as good company, yet they had double the number and were twice as merry.\n\nThe whole community has at length divided itself into fashionable factions under the banners of these two families. The old games of Pope-Joan and Tom-come-tickle-me are entirely discarded; there is no such thing as getting up an honest country dance; and on my attempting to kiss a young lady under the mistletoe last Christmas, I was indignantly repulsed, the Miss Lambs having pronounced it \"shocking vulgar.\" Bitter rivalry has also broken out as to the most fashionable part of Little Britain, the Lambs standing up for the dignity of Cross-Keys Square, and the Trotters for the vicinity of St. Bartholomew's.\nThus is this little territory torn by factions and internal dissensions, like the great empire whose name it bears; and what will be the result would puzzle the apothecary himself, with all his talent at prognostics, to determine, though I apprehend that it will terminate in the total downfall of genuine John Bullism.\n\nThe immediate effects are extremely unpleasant to me. Being a single man, and, as I observed before, rather an idle good-for-nothing personage, I have been considered the only gentleman by profession in the place. I stand therefore in high favor with both parties, and have to hear all their cabinet counsels and mutual backbitings. As I am too civil not to agree with the ladies on all occasions, I have committed myself most horribly with both parties by abusing their opponents. I might manage to reconcile this to my conscience, which is a truly accommodating one, but I cannot to my apprehension: if the Lambs and Trotters ever come to a reconciliation and compare notes, I am ruined!\n\nI have determined, therefore, to beat a retreat in time, and am actually looking out for some other nest in this great city where old English manners are still kept up, where French is neither eaten, drunk, danced, nor spoken, and where there are no fashionable families of retired tradesmen. This found, I will, like a veteran rat, hasten away before I have an old house about my ears, bid a long, though a sorrowful adieu to my present abode, and leave the rival factions of the Lambs and the Trotters to divide the distracted empire of LITTLE BRITAIN.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 12, "api_path": "/songs/94484", "artist_names": "Howard Zinn", "full_title": "Chapter 5: A Kind of Revolution by\u00a0Howard\u00a0Zinn", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a8a93a46675b16929a5e94c585910806.231x346x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a8a93a46675b16929a5e94c585910806.231x346x1.jpg", "id": 94484, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 94502, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1475724254, "path": "/Howard-zinn-chapter-5-a-kind-of-revolution-annotated", "pyongs_count": 1, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Howard-zinn-chapter-5-a-kind-of-revolution-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 1980, "month": null, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "1980", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "1980", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/a8a93a46675b16929a5e94c585910806.231x346x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/a8a93a46675b16929a5e94c585910806.231x346x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 12, "hot": false, "pageviews": 8419}, "title": "Chapter 5: A Kind of Revolution", "title_with_featured": "Chapter 5: A Kind of Revolution", "updated_by_human_at": 1486567526, "url": "https://genius.com/Howard-zinn-chapter-5-a-kind-of-revolution-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/15117", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/91e15e4d156948cbec05ff9a1ecbf41a.1000x650x1.jpg", "id": 15117, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/e5fd9303f85e19649df958b0ef17b34f.720x480x1.jpg", "index_character": "h", "is_meme_verified": false, "is_verified": false, "name": "Howard Zinn", "slug": "Howard-zinn", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Howard-zinn"}, "artist": "Howard Zinn", "lyrics": "Chapter 5: A Kind of Revolution LyricsThe American victory over the British army was made possible by the existence of an already- armed people. Just about every white male had a gun, and could shoot. The Revolutionary leadership distrusted the mobs of poor. But they knew the Revolution had no appeal to slaves and Indians. They would have to woo the armed white population.\n\nThis was not easy. Yes, mechanics and sailors, some others, were incensed against the British. But general enthusiasm for the war was not strong. While much of the white male population went into military service at one time or another during the war, only a small fraction stayed. John Shy, in his study of the Revolutionary army (A People Numerous and Armed), says they \"grew weary of being bullied by local committees of safety, by corrupt deputy assistant commissaries of supply, and by bands of ragged strangers with guns in their hands calling themselves soldiers of the Revolution.\" Shy estimates that perhaps a fifth of the population was actively treasonous. John Adams had estimated a third opposed, a third in support, a third neutral.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, an aide of George Washington and an up-and-coming member of the new elite, wrote from his headquarters: \". . . our countrymen have all the folly of the ass and all the passiveness of the sheep... . They are determined not to be free.. . . If we are saved, France and Spain must save us.\"\n\nSlavery got in the way in the South. South Carolina, insecure since the slave uprising in Stono in 1739, could hardly fight against the British; her militia had to be used to keep slaves under control.\n\nThe men who first joined the colonial militia were generally \"hallmarks of respectability or at least of full citizenship\" in their communities, Shy says. Excluded from the militia were friendly Indians, free Negroes, white servants, and free white men who had no stable home. But desperation led to the recruiting of the less respectable whites. Massachusetts and Virginia provided for drafting \"strollers\" (vagrants) into the militia. In fact, the military became a place of promise for the poor, who might rise in rank, acquire some money, change their social status.\n\nHere was the traditional device by which those in charge of any social order mobilize and discipline a recalcitrant population-offering the adventure and rewards of military service to get poor people to fight for a cause they may not see clearly as their own. A wounded American lieutenant at Bunker Hill, interviewed by Peter Oliver, a Tory (who admittedly might have been looking for such a response), told how he had joined the rebel forces:\nI was a Shoemaker, & got my living by my Labor. When this Rebellion came on, I saw some of my Neighbors got into Commission, who were no better than myself. I was very ambitious, & did not like to see those Men above me. T was asked to enlist, as a private Soldier ... I offered to enlist upon having a Lieutenants Commission; which was granted. I imagined my self now in a way of Promotion: if I was killed in Battle, there would be an end of me, but if any Captain was killed, I should rise in Rank, & should still have a Chance to rise higher. These Sir! were the only Motives of my entering into the Service; for as to the Dispute between Great Britain & the Colonies, I know nothing of it. ...\n\nJohn Shy investigated the subsequent experience of that Bunker Hill lieutenant. He was William Scott, of Peterborough, New Hampshire, and after a year as prisoner of the British he escaped, made his way back to the American army, fought in battles in New York, was captured again by the British, and escaped again by swimming the Hudson River one night with his sword tied around his neck and his watch pinned to his hat. He returned to New Hampshire, recruited a company of his own, including his two eldest sons, and fought in various battles, until his health gave way. He watched his eldest son die of camp fever after six years of service. He had sold his farm in Peterborough for a note that, with inflation, became worthless. After the war, he came to public attention when he rescued eight people from drowning after their boat turned over in New York harbor. He then got a job surveying western lands with the army, but caught a fever and died in 1796.\n\nScott was one of many Revolutionary fighters, usually of lower military ranks, from poor and obscure backgrounds. Shy's study of the Peterborough contingent shows that the prominent and substantial citizens of the town had served only briefly in the war. Other American towns show the same pattern. As Shy puts it: \"Revolutionary America may have been a middle-class society, happier and more prosperous than any other in its time, but it contained a large and growing number of fairly poor people, and many of them did much of the actual fighting and suffering between I775 and 1783: A very old story.\"\n\nThe military conflict itself, by dominating everything in its time, diminished other issues, made people choose sides in the one contest that was publicly important, forced people onto the side of the Revolution whose interest in Independence was not at all obvious. Ruling elites seem to have learned through the generations-consciously or not-that war makes them more secure against internal trouble.\n\nThe force of military preparation had a way of pushing neutral people into line. In Connecticut, for instance, a law was passed requiring military service of all males between sixteen and sixty, omitting certain government officials, ministers, Yale students and faculty, Negroes, Indians, and mulattos. Someone called to duty could provide a substitute or get out of it by paying 5 pounds. When eighteen men failed to show up for military duty they were jailed and, in order to be released, had to pledge to fight in the war. Shy says: \"The mechanism of their political conversion was the militia.\" What looks like the democratization of the military forces in modern times shows up as something different: a way of forcing large numbers of reluctant people to associate themselves with the national cause, and by the end of the process believe in it.\n\nHere, in the war for liberty, was conscription, as usual, cognizant of wealth. With the impressment riots against the British still remembered, impressment of seamen by the American navy was taking place by 1779. A Pennsylvania official said: \"We cannot help observing how similar this Conduct is to that of the British Officers during our Subjection to Great Britain and are persuaded it will have the same unhappy effects viz. an estrangement of the Affections of the People from . . . Authority . . . which by an easy Progression will proceed to open Opposition . . . and bloodshed.\"\n\nWatching the new, tight discipline of Washington's army, a chaplain in. Concord, Massachusetts, wrote: \"New lords, new laws. The strictest government is taking place and great distinction is made between officers & men. Everyone is made to know his place & keep it, or be immediately tied up, and receive not one but 30 or 40 lashes.\"\n\nThe Americans lost the first battles of the war: Bunker Hill, Brooklyn Heights, Harlem Heights, the Deep South; they won small battles at Trenton and Princeton, and then in a turning point, a big battle at Saratoga, New York, in 1777. Washington's frozen army hung on at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, while Benjamin Franklin negotiated an alliance with the French monarchy, which was anxious for revenge on England. The war turned to the South, where the British won victory after victory, until the Americans, aided by a large French army, with the French navy blocking off the British from supplies and reinforcements, won the final victory of the war at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781.\n\nThrough all this, the suppressed conflicts between rich and poor among the Americans kept reappearing. In the midst of the war, in Philadelphia, which Eric Foner describes as \"a time of immense profits for some colonists and terrible hardships for others,\" the inflation (prices rose in one month that year by 45 percent) led to agitation and calls for action. One Philadelphia newspaper carried a reminder that in Europe \"the People have always done themselves justice when the scarcity of bread has arisen from the avarice of forestallers. They have broken open magazines- appropriated stores to their own use without paying for them-and in some instances have hung up the culprits who created their distress.\"\n\nIn May of 1779, the First Company of Philadelphia Artillery petitioned the Assembly about the troubles of \"the midling and poor\" and threatened violence against \"those who are avariciously intent upon amassing wealth by the destruction of the more virtuous part of the community.\" That same month, there was a mass meeting, an extralegal gathering, which called for price reductions and initiated an investigation of Robert Morris, a rich Philadelphian who was accused of holding food from the market. In October came the \"Fort Wilson riot,\" in which a militia group marched into the city and to the house of James Wilson, a wealthy lawyer and Revolutionary official who had opposed price controls and the democratic constitution adopted in Pennsylvania in 1776. The militia were driven away by a \"silk stocking brigade\" of well-off Philadelphia citizens.\n\nIt seemed that the majority of white colonists, who had a bit of land, or no property at all, were still better off than slaves or indentured servants or Indians, and could be wooed into the coalition of the Revolution. But when the sacrifices of war became more bitter, the privileges and safety of the rich became harder to accept. About 10 percent of the white population (an estimate of Jackson Main in The Social Structure of Revolutionary America), large landholders and merchants, held 1,000 pounds or more in personal property and 1,000 pounds in land, at the least, and these men owned nearly half the wealth of the country and held as slaves one-seventh of the country's people.\n\nThe Continental Congress, which governed the colonies through the war, was dominated by rich men, linked together in factions and compacts by business and family connections. These links connected North and South, East and West. For instance, Richard Henry Lee of Virginia was connected with the Adamses of Massachusetts and the Shippens of Pennsylvania. Delegates from middle and southern colonies were connected with Robert Morris of Pennsylvania through commerce and land speculation. Morris was superintendent of finance, and his assistant was Gouverneur Morris.\n\nMorris's plan was to give more assurance to those who had loaned money to the Continental Congress, and gain the support of officers by voting half-pay for life for those who stuck to the end. This ignored the common soldier, who was not getting paid, who was suffering in the cold, dying of sickness, watching the civilian profiteers get rich. On New Year's Day, 1781, the Pennsylvania troops near Morristown, New Jersey, perhaps emboldened by rum, dispersed their officers, killed one captain, wounded others, and were marching, fully armed, with cannon, toward the Continental Congress at Philadelphia.\nGeorge Washington handled it cautiously. Informed of these developments by General Anthony Wayne, he told Wayne not to use force. He was worried that the rebellion might spread to his own troops. He suggested Wayne get a list of the soldiers' grievances, and said Congress should not flee Philadelphia, because then the way would be open for the soldiers to be joined by Philadelphia citizens. He sent Knox rushing to New England on his horse to get three months' pay for the soldiers, while he prepared a thousand men to march on the mutineers, as a last resort. A peace was negotiated, in which one-half the men were discharged; the other half got furloughs.\n\nShortly after this, a smaller mutiny took place in the New Jersey Line, involving two hundred men who defied their officers and started out for the state capital at Trenton. Now Washington was ready. Six hundred men, who themselves had been well fed and clothed, marched on the mutineers and surrounded and disarmed them. Three ringleaders were put on trial immediately, in the field. One was pardoned, and two were shot by firing squads made up of their friends, who wept as they pulled the triggers. It was \"an example,\" Washington said.\n\nTwo years later, there was another mutiny in the Pennsylvania line. The war was over and the army had disbanded, but eighty soldiers, demanding their pay, invaded the Continental Congress headquarters in Philadelphia and forced the members to flee across the river to Princeton- \"ignominiously turned out of doors,\" as one historian sorrowfully wrote (John Fiske, The Critical Period), \"by a handful of drunken mutineers.\"\n\nWhat soldiers in the Revolution could do only rarely, rebel against their authorities, civilians could do much more easily. Ronald Hoffman says: \"The Revolution plunged the states of Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and, to a much lesser degree, Virginia into divisive civil conflicts that persisted during the entire period of struggle.\" The southern lower classes resisted being mobilized for the revolution. They saw themselves under the rule of a political elite, win or lose against the British.\n\nIn Maryland, for instance, by the new constitution of 1776, to run for governor one had to own 5,000 pounds of property; to run for state senator, 1,000 pounds. Thus, 90 percent of the population were excluded from holding office. And so, as Hoffman says, \"small slave holders, non- slaveholding planters, tenants, renters and casual day laborers posed a serious problem of social control for the Whig elite.\"\n\nWith black slaves 25 percent of the population (and in some counties 50 percent), fear of slave revolts grew. George Washington had turned down the requests of blacks, seeking freedom, to fight in the Revolutionary army. So when the British military commander in Virginia, Lord Dunmore, promised freedom to Virginia slaves who joined his forces, this created consternation. A report from one Maryland county worried about poor whites encouraging slave runaways:\n\nThe insolence of the Negroes in this county is come to such a height, that we are under a necessity of disarming them which we affected on Saturday last. We took about eighty guns, some bayonets, swords, etc. The malicious and imprudent speeches of some among the lower classes of whites have induced them to believe that their freedom depended on the success of the King's troops. We cannot therefore be too vigilant nor too rigorous with those who promote and encourage this disposition in our slaves.\n\nEven more unsettling was white rioting in Maryland against leading families, supporting the Revolution, who were suspected of hoarding needed commodities. The class hatred of some of these disloyal people was expressed by one man who said \"it was better for the people to lay down their arms and pay the duties and taxes laid upon them by King and Parliament than to be brought into slavery and to be commanded and ordered about as they were.\" A wealthy Maryland land- owner, Charles Carroll, took note of the surly mood all around him:\n\nThere is a mean low dirty envy which creeps thro all ranks and cannot suffer a man a superiority of fortune, of merit, or of understanding in fellow citizens-either of these are sure to entail a general ill will and dislike upon the owners.\n\nDespite this, Maryland authorities retained control. They made concessions, taxing land and slaves more heavily, letting debtors pay in paper money. It was a sacrifice by the upper class to maintain power, and it worked.\n\nIn the lower South, however, in the Carolinas and Georgia, according to Hoffman, \"vast regions were left without the slightest apparition of authority.\" The general mood was to take no part in a war that seemed to have nothing for them. \"Authoritative personages on both sides demanded that common people supply material, reduce consumption, leave their families, and even risk their lives. Forced to make hard decisions, many flailed out in frustration or evaded and defied first one side, then the other. .. .\"\n\nWashington's military commander in the lower South, Nathanael Greene, dealt with disloyalty by a policy of concessions to some, brutality to others. In a letter to Thomas Jefferson he described a raid by his troops on Loyalists. \"They made a dreadful carnage of them, upwards of one hundred were killed and most of the rest cut to pieces. It has had a very happy effect on those disaffected persons of which there were too many in this country.\" Greene told one of his generals \"to strike terror into our enemies and give spirit to our friends.\" On the other hand, he advised the governor of Georgia \"to open a door for the disaffected of your state to come in... .\"\n\nIn general, throughout the states, concessions were kept to a minimum. The new constitutions that were drawn up in all states from 1776 to 1780 were not much different from the old ones. Although property qualifications for voting and holding office were lowered in some instances, in Massachusetts they were increased. Only Pennsylvania abolished them totally. The new bills of rights had modifying provisions. North Carolina, providing for religious freedom, added \"that nothing herein contained shall be construed to exempt preachers of treasonable or seditious discourses, from legal trial and punishment.\" Maryland, New York, Georgia, and Massachusetts took similar cautions.\nThe American Revolution is sometimes said to have brought about the separation of church and state. The northern states made such declarations, but after 1776 they adopted taxes that forced everyone to support Christian teachings. William G. McLoughlin, quoting Supreme Court Justice David Brewer in 1892 that \"this is a Christian nation,\" says of the separation of church and state in the Revolution that it \"was neither conceived of nor carried out. .,. Far from being left to itself, religion was imbedded into every aspect and institution of American life.\"\n\nOne would look, in examining the Revolution's effect on class relations, at what happened to land confiscated from fleeing Loyalists. It was distributed in such a way as to give a double opportunity to the Revolutionary leaders: to enrich themselves and their friends, and to parcel out some land to small farmers to create a broad base of support for the new government. Indeed, this became characteristic of the new nation: finding itself possessed of enormous wealth, it could create the richest ruling class in history, and still have enough for the middle classes to act as a buffer between the rich and the dispossessed.\n\nThe huge landholdings of the Loyalists had been one of the great incentives to Revolution. Lord Fairfax in Virginia had more than 5 million acres encompassing twenty-one counties. Lord Baltimore's income from his Maryland holdings exceeded 30,000 pounds a year. After the Revolution, Lord Fairfax was protected; he was a friend of George Washington. But other Loyalist holders of great estates, especially those who were absentees, had their land confiscated. In New York, the number of freeholding small farmers increased after the Revolution, and there were fewer tenant farmers, who had created so much trouble in the pre-Revolution years.\n\nAlthough the numbers of independent farmers grew, according to Rowland Berthoff and John Murrin, \"the class structure did not change radically.\" The ruling group went through personnel changes as \"the rising merchant families of Boston, New York or Philadelphia ... slipped quite credibly into the social status-and sometimes the very houses of those who failed in business or suffered confiscation and exile for loyalty to the crown.\"\n\nEdmund Morgan sums up the class nature of the Revolution this way: \"The fact that the lower ranks were involved in the contest should not obscure the fact that the contest itself was generally a struggle for office and power between members of an upper class: the new against the established.\" Looking at the situation after the Revolution, Richard Morris comments: \"Everywhere one finds inequality.\" He finds \"the people\" of \"We the people of the United States\" (a phrase coined by the very rich Gouverneur Morris) did not mean Indians or blacks or women or white servants. In fact, there were more indentured servants than ever, and the Revolution \"did nothing to end and little to ameliorate white bondage.\"\n\nCarl Degler says (Out of Our Past): \"No new social class came to power through the door of the American revolution. The men who engineered the revolt were largely members of the colonial ruling class.\" George Washington was the richest man in America. John Hancock was a prosperous Boston merchant. Benjamin Franklin was a wealthy printer. And so on.\n\nOn the other hand, town mechanics, laborers, and seamen, as well as small farmers, were swept into \"the people\" by the rhetoric of the Revolution, by the camaraderie of military service, by the distribution of some land. Thus was created a substantial body of support, a national consensus, something that, even with the exclusion of ignored and oppressed people, could be called \"America.\"\n\nStaughton Lynd's close study of Dutchess County, New York, in the Revolutionary period corroborates this. There were tenant risings in 1766 against the huge feudal estates in New York. The Rensselaerwyck holding was a million acres. Tenants, claiming some of this land for themselves, unable to get satisfaction in the courts, turned to violence. In Poughkeepsie, 1,700 armed tenants had closed the courts and broken open the jails. But the uprising was crushed.\n\nDuring the Revolution, there was a struggle in Dutchess County over the disposition of confiscated Loyalist lands, but it was mainly between different elite groups. One of these, the Poughkeepsie anti-Federalists (opponents of the Constitution), included men on the make, newcomers in land and business. They made promises to the tenants to gain their support, exploiting their grievances to build their own political careers and maintain their own fortunes.\n\nDuring the Revolution, to mobilize soldiers, the tenants were promised land. A prominent landowner of Dutchess County wrote in 1777 that a promise to make tenants freeholders \"would instantly bring you at least six thousand able farmers into the field.\" But the farmers who enlisted in the Revolution and expected to get something out of it found that, as privates in the army, they received $6.66 a month, while a colonel received $75 a month. They watched local government contractors like Melancton Smith and Mathew Paterson become rich, while the pay they received in continental currency became worthless with inflation.\n\nAll this led tenants to become a threatening force in the midst of the war. Many stopped paying rent. The legislature, worried, passed a bill to confiscate Loyalist land and add four hundred new freeholders to the 1,800 already in the county. This meant a strong new voting bloc for the faction of the rich that would become anti-Federalists in 1788. Once the new landholders were brought into the privileged circle of the Revolution and seemed politically under control, their leaders, Mclancton Smith and others, at first opposed to adoption of the Constitution, switched to support, and with New York ratifying, adoption was ensured. The new freeholders found that they had stopped being tenants, but were now mortgagees, paying back loans from banks instead of rent to landlords.\n\nIt seems that the rebellion against British rule allowed a certain group of the colonial elite to replace those loyal to England, give some benefits to small landholders, and leave poor white working people and tenant farmers in very much their old situation.\n\nWhat did the Revolution mean to the Native Americans, the Indians? They had been ignored by the fine words of the Declaration, had not been considered equal, certainly not in choosing those who would govern the American territories in which they lived, nor in being able to pursue happiness as they had pursued it for centuries before the white Europeans arrived. Now, with the British out of the way, the Americans could begin the inexorable process of pushing the Indians off their lands, killing them if they resisted, in short, as Francis Jennings puts it, the white Americans were fighting against British imperial control in the East, and for their own imperialism in the West.\n\nBefore the Revolution, the Indians had been subdued by force in Virginia and in New England. Elsewhere, they had worked out modes of coexistence with the colonies. But around 1750, with the colonial population growing fast, the pressure to move westward onto new land set the stage for conflict with the Indians. Land agents from the East began appearing in the Ohio River valley, on the territory of a confederation of tribes called the Covenant Chain, for which the Iroquois were spokesmen. In New York, through intricate swindling, 800,000 acres of Mohawk land were taken, ending the period of Mohawk-New York friendship. Chief Hendrick of the Mohawks is recorded speaking his bitterness to Governor George Clinton and the provincial council of New York in 1753:\n\nBrother when we came here lo relate our Grievances about our Lands, we expected to have something done for us, and we have told you that the Covenant Chain of our Forefathers was like to be broken, and brother you tell us that we shall be redressed at Albany, but we know them so well, we will not trust to them, for they [the Albany merchants] are no people but Devils so ... as soon as we come home we will send up a Belt of Wampum to our Brothers the other 5 Nations to acquaint them the Covenant Chain is broken between you and us. So brother you are not to expect to hear of me any more, and Brother we desire to hear no more of you.\n\nWhen the British fought the French for North America in the Seven Years' War, the Indians fought on the side of the French. The French were traders but not occupiers of Indian lands, while the British clearly coveted their hunting grounds and living space. Someone reported the conversation of Shingas, chief of the Delaware Indians, with the British General Braddock, who sought his help against the French:\n\nShingas asked General Braddock, whether the Indians that were friends to the English might not be permitted to Live and Trade among the English and have Hunting Ground sufficient to Support themselves and Familys.... On which General Braddock said that No Savage Should Inherit the Land.. . . On which Shingas and the other Chiefs answered That if they might not have Liberty to Live on the Land they would not Fight for it....\n\nWhen that war ended in 1763, the French, ignoring their old allies, ceded to the British lands west of the Appalachians. The Indians therefore united to make war on the British western forts; this is called \"Pontiac's Conspiracy\" by the British, but \"a liberation war for independence\" in the words used by Francis Jennings. Under orders from British General Jeffrey Amherst, the commander of Fort Pitts gave the attacking Indian chiefs, with whom he was negotiating, blankets from the smallpox hospital. It was a pioneering effort at what is now called biological warfare. An epidemic soon spread among the Indians.\n\nDespite this, and the burning of villages, the British could not destroy the will of the Indians, who continued guerrilla war. A peace was made, with the British agreeing to establish a line at the Appalachians, beyond which settlements would not encroach on Indian territory. This was the Royal Proclamation of 1763, and it angered Americans (the original Virginia charter said its land went westward to the ocean). It helps to explain why most of the Indians fought for England during the Revolution. With their French allies, then their English allies, gone, the Indians faced a new land-coveting nation-alone.\n\nThe Americans assumed now that the Indian land was theirs. But the expeditions they sent westward to establish this were overcome-which they recognized in the names they gave these battles: Harmar's Humiliation and St. Glair's Shame. And even when General Anthony Wayne defeated the Indians' western confederation in 1798 at the Battle of Fallen Timbers, he had to recognize their power. In the Treaty of Grenville, it was agreed that in return for certain cessions of land the United States would give up claims to the Indian lands north of the Ohio, east of the Mississippi, and south of the Great Lakes, but that if the Indians decided to sell these lands they would offer them first to the United States.\n\nJennings, putting the Indian into the center of the American Revolution-after all, it was Indian land that everyone was fighting over-sees the Revolution as a \"multiplicity of variously oppressed and exploited peoples who preyed upon each other.\" With the eastern elite controlling the lands on the seaboard, the poor, seeking land, were forced to go West, there becoming a useful bulwark for the rich because, as Jennings says, \"the first target of the Indian's hatchet was the frontiersman's skull.\"\n\nThe situation of black slaves as a result of the American Revolution was more complex. Thousands of blacks fought with the British. Five thousand were with the Revolutionaries, most of them from the North, but there were also free blacks from Virginia and Maryland. The lower South was reluctant to arm blacks. Amid the urgency and chaos of war, thousands took their freedom-leaving on British ships at the end of the war to settle in England, Nova Scotia, the West Indies, or Africa. Many others stayed in America as free blacks, evading their masters.\n\nIn the northern states, the combination of blacks in the military, the lack of powerful economic need for slaves, and the rhetoric of Revolution led to the end of slavery-but very slowly. As late as 1810, thirty thousand blacks, one-fourth of the black population of the North, remained slaves. In 1840 there were still a thousand slaves in the North. In the upper South, there were more free Negroes than before, leading to more control legislation. In the lower South, slavery expanded with the growth of rice and cotton plantations.\n\nWhat the Revolution did was to create space and opportunity for blacks to begin making demands of white society. Sometimes these demands came from the new, small black elites in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Richmond, Savannah, sometimes from articulate and bold slaves. Pointing to the Declaration of Independence, blacks petitioned Congress and the state legislatures to abolish slavery, to give blacks equal rights. In Boston, blacks asked for city money, which whites were getting, to educate their children. In Norfolk, they asked to he allowed to testify in court. Nashville blacks asserted that free Negroes \"ought to have the same opportunities of doing well that any Person ... would have.\" Peter Mathews, a free Negro butcher in Charleston, joined other free black artisans and tradesmen in petitioning the legislature to repeal discriminatory laws against blacks, hi 1780, seven blacks in Dartmouth, Massachusetts, petitioned the legislature for the right to vote, linking taxation to representation:\n\n... we apprehend ourselves to be Aggreeved, in that while we are not allowed the Privilege of freemen of the State having no vote or Influence in the Election of those that Tax us yet many of our Colour (as is well known) have cheerfully Entered the field of Battle in the defense of the Common Cause and that (as we conceive) against a similar Exertion of Power (in Regard to taxation) too well known to need a recital in this place.. ..\n\nA black man, Benjamin Banneker, who taught himself mathematics and astronomy, predicted accurately a solar eclipse, and was appointed to plan the new city of Washington, wrote to Thomas Jefferson:\n\nI suppose it is a truth too well attested to you, to need a proof here, that we are a race of beings, who have long labored under the abuse and censure of the world; that we have long been looked upon with an eye of contempt; and that we have long been considered rather as brutish than human, and scarcely capable of mental endowments. ... I apprehend you will embrace every opportunity to eradicate that train of absurd and false ideas and opinions, which so generally prevails with respect to us; and that your sentiments are concurrent with mine, which are, that one universal Father hath given being to us all; and that he hath not only made us all of one flesh, but that he hath also, without partiality, afforded us all the same sensations and endowed us all with the same facilities. ..\n\nBanneker asked Jefferson \"to wean yourselves from those narrow prejudices which you have imbibed.\"\n\nJefferson tried his best, as an enlightened, thoughtful individual might. But the structure of American society, the power of the cotton plantation, the slave trade, the politics of unity between northern and southern elites, and the long culture of race prejudice in the colonies, as well as his own weaknesses-that combination of practical need and ideological fixation-kept Jefferson a slaveowner throughout his life.\n\nThe inferior position of blacks, the exclusion of Indians from the new society, the establishment of supremacy for the rich and powerful in the new nation-all this was already settled in the colonies by the time of the Revolution. With the English out of the way, it could now be put on paper, solidified, regularized, made legitimate, by the Constitution of the United States, drafted at a convention of Revolutionary leaders in Philadelphia.\n\nTo many Americans over the years, the Constitution drawn up in 1787 has seemed a work of genius put together by wise, humane men who created a legal framework for democracy and equality. This view is stated, a bit extravagantly, by the historian George Bancroft, writing in the early nineteenth century:\n\nThe Constitution establishes nothing that interferes with equality and individuality. It knows nothing of differences by descent, or opinions, of favored classes, or legalized religion, or the political power of property. It leaves the individual alongside of the individual. ... As the sea is made up of drops, American society is composed of separate, free, and constantly moving atoms, ever in reciprocal action ... so that the institutions and laws of the country rise out of the masses of individual thought which, like the waters of the ocean, are rolling evermore.\n\nAnother view of the Constitution was put forward early in the twentieth century by the historian Charles Beard (arousing anger and indignation, including a denunciatory editorial in the New York Times). He wrote in his book An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution:\n\nInasmuch as the primary object of a government, beyond the mere repression of physical violence, is the making of the rules which determine the property relations of members of society, the dominant classes whose rights are thus to be determined must perforce obtain from the government such rules as are consonant with the larger interests necessary to the continuance of their economic processes, or they must themselves control the organs of government.\n\nIn short, Beard said, the rich must, in their own interest, either control the government directly or control the laws by which government operates.\n\nBeard applied this general idea to the Constitution, by studying the economic backgrounds and political ideas of the fifty-five men who gathered in Philadelphia in 1787 to draw up the Constitution. He found that a majority of them were lawyers by profession, that most of them were men of wealth, in land, slaves, manufacturing, or shipping, that half of them had money loaned out at interest, and that forty of the fifty-five held government bonds, according to the records of the Treasury Department.\n\nThus, Beard found that most of the makers of the Constitution had some direct economic interest in establishing a strong federal government: the manufacturers needed protective tariffs; the moneylenders wanted to stop the use of paper money to pay off debts; the land speculators wanted protection as they invaded Indian lands; slaveowners needed federal security against slave revolts and runaways; bondholders wanted a government able to raise money by nationwide taxation, to pay off those bonds.\n\nFour groups, Beard noted, were not represented in the Constitutional Convention: slaves, indentured servants, women, men without property. And so the Constitution did not reflect the interests of those groups.\n\nHe wanted to make it clear that he did not think the Constitution was written merely to benefit the Founding Fathers personally, although one could not ignore the $150,000 fortune of Benjamin Franklin, the connections of Alexander Hamilton to wealthy interests through his father-in-law and brother-in-law, the great slave plantations of James Madison, the enormous landholdings of George Washington. Rather, it was to benefit the groups the Founders represented, the \"economic interests they understood and felt in concrete, definite form through their own personal experience.\"\n\nNot everyone at the Philadelphia Convention fitted Beard's scheme. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts was a holder of landed property, and yet he opposed the ratification of the Constitution. Similarly, Luther Martin of Maryland, whose ancestors had obtained large tracts of land in New Jersey, opposed ratification. But, with a few exceptions, Beard found a strong connection between wealth and support of the Constitution.\n\nBy 1787 there was not only a positive need for strong central government to protect the large economic interests, but also immediate fear of rebellion by discontented farmers. The chief event causing this fear was an uprising in the summer of 1786 in western Massachusetts, known as Shays' Rebellion.\n\nIn the western towns of Massachusetts there was resentment against the legislature in Boston. The new Constitution of 1780 had raised the property qualifications for voting. No one could hold state office without being quite wealthy. Furthermore, the legislature was refusing to issue paper money, as had been done in some other states, like Rhode Island, to make it easier for debt-ridden farmers to pay off their creditors.\n\nIllegal conventions began to assemble in some of the western counties to organize opposition to the legislature. At one of these, a man named Plough Jogger spoke his mind:\n\nI have been greatly abused, have been obliged to do more than my part in the war; been loaded with class rates, town rates, province rates, Continental rates and all rates ... been pulled and hauled by sheriffs, constables and collectors, and had my cattle sold for less than they were worth.... . . . The great men are going to get all we have and I think it is time for us to rise and put a stop to it, and have no more courts, nor sheriffs, nor collectors nor lawyers.. . .\n\nThe chairman of that meeting used his gavel to cut short the applause. He and others wanted to redress their grievances, but peacefully, by petition to the General Court (the legislature) in Boston,\n\nHowever, before the scheduled meeting of the General Court, there were going to the court proceedings in Hampshire County, in the towns of Northampton and Springfield, to seize the cattle of farmers who hadn't paid their debts, to take away their land, now full of grain and ready for harvest. And so, veterans of the Continental army, also aggrieved because they had been treated poorly on discharge-given certificates for future redemption instead of immediate cash-began to organize the farmers into squads and companies. One of these veterans was Luke Day, who arrived the morning of court with a fife-and-drum corps, still angry with the memory of being locked up in debtors' prison in the heat of the previous summer.\n\nThe sheriff looked to the local militia to defend the court against these armed farmers. But most of the militia was with Luke Day. The sheriff did manage to gather five hundred men, and the judges put on their black silk robes, waiting for the sheriff to protect their trip to the courthouse. But there at the courthouse steps, Luke Day stood with a petition, asserting the people's constitutional right to protest the unconstitutional acts of the General Court, asking the judges to adjourn until the General Court could act on behalf of the farmers. Standing with Luke Day were fifteen hundred armed farmers. The judges adjourned.\n\nShortly after, at courthouses in Worcester and Athol, farmers with guns prevented the courts from meeting to take away their property, and the militia were too sympathetic to the farmers, or too outnumbered, to act. In Concord, a fifty-year-old veteran of two wars, Job Shattuck, led a caravan of carts, wagons, horses, and oxen onto the town green, while a message was sent to the judges:\n\nThe voice of the People of this county is such that the court shall not enter this courthouse until such time as the People shall have redress of the grievances they labor under at the present.\n\nA county convention then suggested the judges adjourn, which they did.\n\nAt Great Barrington, a militia of a thousand faced a square crowded with armed men and boys. But the militia was split in its opinion. When the chief justice suggested the militia divide, those in favor of the court's sitting to go on the right side of the road, and those against on the left, two hundred of the militia went to the right, eight hundred to the left, and the judges adjourned. Then the crowd went to the home of the chief justice, who agreed to sign a pledge that the court would not sit until the Massachusetts General Court met. The crowd went back to the square, broke open the county jail, and set free the debtors. The chief justice, a country doctor, said: \"I have never heard anybody point out a better way to have their grievances redressed than the people have taken.\"\n\nThe governor and the political leaders of Massachusetts became alarmed. Samuel Adams, once looked on as a radical leader in Boston, now insisted people act within the law. He said \"British emissaries\" were stirring up the farmers. People in the town of Greenwich responded: You in Boston have the money, and we don't. And didn't you act illegally yourselves in the Revolution? The insurgents were now being called Regulators. Their emblem was a sprig of hemlock.\n\nThe problem went beyond Massachusetts. In Rhode Island, the debtors had taken over the legislature and were issuing paper money. In New Hampshire, several hundred men, in September of 1786, surrounded the legislature in Exeter, asking that taxes be returned and paper money issued; they dispersed only when military action was threatened.\n\nDaniel Shays entered the scene in western Massachusetts. A poor farm hand when the revolution broke out, he joined the Continental army, fought at Lexington, Bunker Hill, and Saratoga, and was wounded in action. In 1780, not being paid, he resigned from the army, went home, and soon found himself in court for nonpayment of debts. He also saw what was happening to others: a sick woman, unable to pay, had her bed taken from under her.\n\nWhat brought Shays fully into the situation was that on September 19, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts met in Worcester and indicted eleven leaders of the rebellion, including three of his friends, as \"disorderly, riotous and seditious persons\" who \"unlawfully and by force of arms\" prevented \"the execution of justice and the laws of the commonwealth.\" The Supreme Judicial Court planned to meet again in Springfield a week later, and there was talk of Luke Day's being indicted.\n\nShays organized seven hundred armed farmers, most of them veterans of the war, and led them to Springfield. There they found a general with nine hundred soldiers and a cannon. Shays asked the general for permission to parade, which the general granted, so Shays and his men moved through the square, drums hanging and fifes blowing. As they marched, their ranks grew. Some of the militia joined, and reinforcements began coming in from the countryside. The judges postponed hearings for a day, then adjourned the court.\n\nNow the General Court, meeting in Boston, was told by Governor James Bowdoin to \"vindicate the insulted dignity of government.\" The recent rebels against England, secure in office, were calling for law and order. Sam Adams helped draw up a Riot Act, and a resolution suspending habeas corpus, to allow the authorities to keep people in jail without trial. At the same time, the legislature moved to make some concessions to the angry farmers, saying certain old taxes could now be paid in goods instead of money.\n\nThis didn't help. In Worcester, 160 insurgents appeared at the courthouse. The sheriff read the Riot Act. The insurgents said they would disperse only if the judges did. The sheriff shouted something about hanging. Someone came up behind him and put a sprig of hemlock in his hat. The judges left.\n\nConfrontations between farmers and militia now multiplied. The winter snows began to interfere with the trips of farmers to the courthouses. When Shays began marching a thousand men into Boston, a blizzard forced them back, and one of his men froze to death.\n\nAn army came into the field, led by General Benjamin Lincoln, on money raised by Boston merchants. In an artillery duel, three rebels were killed. One soldier stepped in front of his own artillery piece and lost both arms. The winter grew worse. The rebels were outnumbered and on the run. Shays took refuge in Vermont, and his followers began to surrender. There were a few more deaths in battle, and then sporadic, disorganized, desperate acts of violence against authority: the burning of barns, the slaughter of a general's horses. One government soldier was killed in an eerie night-time collision of two sleighs.\n\nCaptured rebels were put on trial in Northampton and six were sentenced to death. A note was left at the door of the high sheriff of Pittsfidd:\n\nI understand that there is a number of my countrymen condemned to the because they fought for justice. I pray have a care that you assist not in the execution of so horrid a crime, for by all that is above, he that condemns and he that executes shall share alike. . . - Prepare for death with speed, for your life or mine is short. When the woods are covered with leaves, I shall return and pay you a short visit.\n\nThirty-three more rebels were put on trial and six more condemned to death. Arguments took place over whether the hangings should go forward. General Lincoln urged mercy and a Commission of Clemency, but Samuel Adams said: \"In monarchy the crime of treason may admit of being pardoned or lightly punished, but the man who dares rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death.\" Several hangings followed; some of the condemned were pardoned. Shays, in Vermont, was pardoned in 1788 and returned to Massachusetts, where he died, poor and obscure, in 1825.\n\nIt was Thomas Jefferson, in France as ambassador at the time of Shays' Rebellion, who spoke of such uprisings as healthy for society. In a letter to a friend he wrote: \"I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing.... It is a medicine necessary for the sound health of government.... God forbid that we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion.. . . The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.\"\n\nBut Jefferson was far from the scene. The political and economic elite of the country were not so tolerant. They worried that the example might spread. A veteran of Washington's army, General Henry Knox, founded an organization of army veterans, \"The Order of the Cincinnati,\" presumably (as one historian put it) \"for the purpose of cherishing the heroic memories of the struggle in which they had taken part,\" but also, it seemed, to watch out for radicalism in the new country. Knox wrote to Washington in late 1786 about Shays' Rebellion, and in doing so expressed the thoughts of many of the wealthy and powerful leaders of the country:\n\nThe people who are the insurgents have never paid any, or but very little taxes. But they see the weakness of government; they feel at once their own poverty, compared with the opulent, and their own force, and they are determined to make use of the latter, in order to remedy the former. Their creed is \"That the property of the United States has been protected from the confiscations of Britain by the joint exertions of all, and therefore ought to he the common properly of all. And he that attempts opposition to this creed is an enemy to equity and justice and ought to be swept from off the face of the earth.\"\n\nAlexander Hamilton, aide to Washington during the war, was one of the most forceful and astute leaders of the new aristocracy. He voiced his political philosophy:\n\nAll communities divide themselves into the few and the many. The first arc the rich and well-horn, the other the mass of the people. The voice of the people has been said to be the voice of God; and however generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not true in fact. The people are turbulent and changing; they seldom judge or determine right. Give therefore to the first class a distinct permanent share in the government. .. . Can a democratic assembly who annually revolve in the mass of the people be supposed steadily to pursue the public good? Nothing but a permanent body can check the imprudence of democracy.. ..\n\nAt the Constitutional Convention, Hamilton suggested a President and Senate chosen for life.\n\nThe Convention did not take his suggestion. But neither did it provide for popular elections, except in the case of the House of Representatives, where the qualifications were set by the state legislatures (which required property-holding for voting in almost all the states), and excluded women, Indians, slaves. The Constitution provided for Senators to be elected by the state legislators, for the President to be elected by electors chosen by the state legislators, and for the Supreme Court to be appointed by the President.\n\nThe problem of democracy in the post-Revolutionary society was not, however, the Constitutional limitations on voting. It lay deeper, beyond the Constitution, in the division of society into rich and poor. For if some people had great wealth and great influence; if they had the land, the money, the newspapers, the church, the educational system- how could voting, however broad, cut into such power? There was still another problem: wasn't it the nature of representative government, even when most broadly based, to be conservative, to prevent tumultuous change?\n\nIt came time to ratify the Constitution, to submit to a vote in state conventions, with approval of nine of the thirteen required to ratify it. In New York, where debate over ratification was intense, a series of newspaper articles appeared, anonymously, and they tell us much about the nature of the Constitution. These articles, favoring adoption of the Constitution, were written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, and came to be known as the Federalist Papers (opponents of the Constitution became known as anti-Federalists).\n\nIn Federalist Paper #10, James Madison argued that representative government was needed to maintain peace in a society ridden by factional disputes. These disputes came from \"the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.\" The problem, he said, was how to control the factional struggles that came from inequalities in wealth. Minority factions could be controlled, he said, by the principle that decisions would be by vote of the majority.\n\nSo the real problem, according to Madison, was a majority faction, and here the solution was offered by the Constitution, to have \"an extensive republic,\" that is, a large nation ranging over thirteen states, for then \"it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength, and to act in unison with each other.... The influence of factious leaders may kindle a flame within their particular States, but will be unable to spread a general conflagration through the other States.\"\n\nMadison's argument can be seen as a sensible argument for having a government which can maintain peace and avoid continuous disorder. But is it the aim of government simply to maintain order, as a referee, between two equally matched fighters? Or is it that government has some special interest in maintaining a certain kind of order, a certain distribution of power and wealth, a distribution in which government officials are not neutral referees but participants? In that case, the disorder they might worry about is the disorder of popular rebellion against those monopolizing the society's wealth. This interpretation makes sense when one looks at the economic interests, the social backgrounds, of the makers of the Constitution.\n\nAs part of his argument for a large republic to keep the peace, James Madison tells quite clearly, in Federalist #10, whose peace he wants to keep: \"A rage for paper money, for an abolition of debts, for an equal division of property, or for any other improper or wicked project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a particular member of it.\"\n\nWhen economic interest is seen behind the political clauses of the Constitution, then the document becomes not simply the work of wise men trying to establish a decent and orderly society, but the work of certain groups trying to maintain their privileges, while giving just enough rights and liberties to enough of the people to ensure popular support.\n\nIn the new government, Madison would belong to one party (the Democrat-Republicans) along with Jefferson and Monroe. Hamilton would belong to the rival party (the Federalists) along with Washington and Adams. But both agreed-one a slaveholder from Virginia, the other a merchant from New York-on the aims of this new government they were establishing. They were anticipating the long-fundamental agreement of the two political parties in the American system. Hamilton wrote elsewhere in the Federalist Papers that the new Union would be able \"to repress domestic faction and insurrection.\" He referred directly to Shays' Rebellion: \"The tempestuous situation from which Massachusetts has scarcely emerged evinces that dangers of this kind are not merely speculative.\"\n\nIt was either Madison or Hamilton (the authorship of the individual papers is not always known) who in Federalist Paper #63 argued the necessity of a \"well-constructed Senate\" as \"sometimes necessary as a defense to the people against their own temporary errors and delusions\" because \"there are particular moments in public affairs when the people, stimulated by some irregular passion, or some illicit advantage, or misted by the artful misrepresentations of interested men, may call for measures which they themselves will afterwards be the most ready to lament and condemn.\" And: \"In these critical moments, how salutary will be the interference of some temperate and respectable body of citizens in order to check the misguided career, and to suspend the blow meditated by the people against themselves, until reason, justice, and truth can regain their authority over the public mind?\"\n\nThe Constitution was a compromise between slaveholding interests of the South and moneyed interests of the North. For the purpose of uniting the thirteen states into one great market for commerce, the northern delegates wanted laws regulating interstate commerce, and urged that such laws require only a majority of Congress to pass. The South agreed to this, in return for allowing the trade in slaves to continue for twenty years before being outlawed.\nCharles Beard warned us that governments-including the government of the United States-are not neutral, that they represent the dominant economic interests, and that their constitutions are intended to serve these interests. One of his critics (Robert E. Brown, Charles Beard and the Constitution) raises an interesting point. Granted that the Constitution omitted the phrase \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\" which appeared in the Declaration of Independence, and substituted \"life, liberty, or property\"-well, why shouldn't the Constitution protect property? As Brown says about Revolutionary America, \"practically everybody was interested in the protection of property\" because so many Americans owned property.\n\nHowever, this is misleading. True, there were many property owners. But some people had much more than others. A few people had great amounts of property; many people had small amounts; others had none. Jackson Main found that one-third of the population in the Revolutionary period were small farmers, while only 3 percent of the population had truly large holdings and could he considered wealthy.\n\nStill, one-third was a considerable number of people who felt they had something at stake in the stability of a new government. This was a larger base of support for government than anywhere in the world at the end of the eighteenth century. In addition, the city mechanics had an important interest in a government which would protect their work from foreign competition. As Staughton Lynd puts it: \"How is it that the city workingmen all over America overwhelmingly and enthusiastically supported the United States Constitution?\"\n\nThis was especially true in New York. When the ninth and tenth states had ratified the Constitution, four thousand New York City mechanics marched with floats and banners to celebrate. Bakers, blacksmiths, brewers, ship joiners and shipwrights, coopers, cartmen and tailors, all marched. What Lynd found was that these mechanics, while opposing elite rule in the colonies, were nationalist. Mechanics comprised perhaps half the New York population. Some were wealthy, some were poor, but all were better off than the ordinary laborer, the apprentice, the journeyman, and their prosperity required a government that would protect them against the British hats and shoes and other goods that were pouring into the colonies after the Revolution. As a result, the mechanics often supported wealthy conservatives at the ballot box.\n\nThe Constitution, then, illustrates the complexity of the American system: that it serves the interests of a wealthy elite, but also does enough for small property owners, for middle-income mechanics and farmers, to build a broad base of support. The slightly prosperous people who make up this base of support are buffers against the blacks, the Indians, the very poor whites. They enable the elite to keep control with a minimum of coercion, a maximum of law-all made palatable by the fanfare of patriotism and unity.\n\nThe Constitution became even more acceptable to the public at large after the first Congress, responding to criticism, passed a series of amendments known as the Bill of Rights. These amendments seemed to make the new government a guardian of people's liberties: to speak, to publish, to worship, to petition, to assemble, to be tried fairly, to be secure at home against official intrusion. It was, therefore, perfectly designed to build popular backing for the new government. What was not made clear-it was a time when the language of freedom was new and its reality untested-was the shakiness of anyone's liberty when entrusted to a government of the rich and powerful.\n\nIndeed, the same problem existed for the other provisions of the Constitution, like the clause forbidding states to \"impair the obligation of contract,\" or that giving Congress the power to tax the people and to appropriate money. They all sound benign and neutral until one asks: tax who, for what? Appropriate what, for whom? To protect everyone's contracts seems like an act of fairness, of equal treatment, until one considers that contracts made between rich and poor, between employer and employee, landlord and tenant, creditor and debtor, generally favor the more powerful of the two parties. Thus, to protect these contracts is to put the great power of the government, its laws, courts, sheriffs, police, on the side of the privileged-and to do it not, as in premodern times, as an exercise of brute force against the weak but as a matter of law.\n\nThe First Amendment of the Bill of Rights shows that quality of interest hiding behind innocence. Passed in 1791 by Congress, it provided that \"Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press. . . .\" Yet, seven years after the First Amendment became part of the Constitution, Congress passed a law very clearly abridging the freedom of speech.\n\nThis was the Sedition Act of 1798, passed under John Adams's administration, at a time when Irishmen and Frenchmen in the United States were looked on as dangerous revolutionaries because of the recent French Revolution and the Irish rebellions. The Sedition Act made it a crime to say or write anything \"false, scandalous and malicious\" against the government, Congress, or the President, with intent to defame them, bring them into disrepute, or excite popular hatreds against them.\n\nThis act seemed to directly violate the First Amendment. Yet, it was enforced. Ten Americans were put in prison for utterances against the government, and every member of the Supreme Court in 1798-1800, sitting as an appellate judge, held it constitutional.\n\nThere was a legal basis for this, one known to legal experts, but not to the ordinary American, who would read the First Amendment and feel confident that he or she was protected in the exercise of free speech. That basis has been explained by historian Leonard Levy. Levy points out that it was generally understood (not in the population, but in higher circles) that, despite the First Amendment, the British common law of \"seditious libel\" still ruled in America. This meant that while the government could not exercise \"prior restraint\"-that is, prevent an utterance or publication in advance-it could legally punish the speaker or writer afterward. Thus, Congress has a convenient legal basis for the laws it has enacted since that time, making certain kinds of speech a crime. And, since punishment after the fact is an excellent deterrent to the exercise of free expression, the claim of \"no prior restraint\" itself is destroyed. This leaves the First Amendment much less than the stone wall of protection it seems at first glance.\n\nAre the economic provisions in the Constitution enforced just as weakly? We have an instructive example almost immediately in Washington's first administration, when Congress's power to tax and appropriate money was immediately put to use by the Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton.\n\nHamilton, believing that government must ally itself with the richest elements of society to make itself strong, proposed to Congress a series of laws, which it enacted, expressing this philosophy. A Bank of the United States was set up as a partnership between the government and certain banking interests. A tariff was passed to help the manufacturers. It was agreed to pay bondholders-most of the war bonds were now concentrated in a small group of wealthy people-the full value of their bonds. Tax laws were passed to raise money for this bond redemption.\n\nOne of these tax laws was the Whiskey tax, which especially hurt small farmers who raised grain that they converted into whiskey and then sold. In 1794 the farmers of western Pennsylvania took up arms and rebelled against the collection of this tax. Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton led the troops to put them down. We see then, in the first years of the Constitution, that some of its provisions-even those paraded most flamboyantly (like the First Amendment)-might be treated lightly. Others (like the power to tax) would be powerfully enforced.\n\nStill, the mythology around the Founding Fathers persists. To say, as one historian (Bernard Bailyn) has done recently, that \"the destruction of privilege and the creation of a political system that demanded of its leaders the responsible and humane use of power were their highest aspirations\" is to ignore what really happened in the America of these Founding Fathers.\n\nBailyn says:\n\nEveryone knew the basic prescription for a wise and just government. It was so to balance the contending powers in society that no one power could overwhelm the others and, unchecked, destroy the liberties that belonged to all. The problem was how to arrange the institutions of government so that this balance could be achieved.\n\nWere the Founding Fathers wise and just men trying to achieve a good balance? In fact, they did not want a balance, except one which kept things as they were, a balance among the dominant forces at that time. They certainly did not want an equal balance between slaves and masters, propertyless and property holders, Indians and white.\n\nAs many as half the people were not even considered by the Founding Fathers as among Bailyn's \"contending powers\" in society. They were not mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, they were absent in the Constitution, they were invisible in the new political democracy. They were the women of early America.1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 0, "api_path": "/songs/1034255", "artist_names": "Lou Rawls", "full_title": "Groovy People by\u00a0Lou\u00a0Rawls",

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nGroovy people\nI like to be around groovy, groovy people\nI don't like nobody that's got an ego\nI don't like to sit around and hold a conversation\nWith somebody who don't know where he wants to go\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nGive me the simple life, full of fun and joy\nCan't you see I'm just a big ol' country boy?\n[Chorus]\nAnd I like groovy people\nI'm talking 'bout groovy, down home people\n\n[Verse 2]\nI don't like nobody that's got an attitude\nWalking 'round with their nose in the air\nThem kind of people, I just can't use\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI like to be relaxed with my mind at ease\nThe best things in life is all I want for me\n\n[Chorus]\nSo give me some, groovy people\nI said, groovy, groovy people\nTalking 'bout groovy, groovy, groovy, groovy people\n\n[Bridge]\nNow baby, oh darling\nWe don't have to put up with them jive-time folks no more\nLet's pretend that we're not at home\nWhen they come knockin', knockin' on our door\n\n[Verse 3]\nI don't like nosy people\nGet in my business and things\nI done been through all of that, baby\nAnd I know the bad feelings that it brings\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus]\nGive me the simple life full of fun and joy\nCan't you see I'm just a big ol' country boy?\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I like groovy people\nI'm talking 'bout a groovy, down home people\nTalkin' 'bout groovy, groovy, groovy, groovy people\n\n[Outro]\nTalking 'bout groovy people (Groovy people)\nI'm talking about people (Groovy, groovy people)\nThat I can hold a conversation with (Groovy people)\nI'm talking about a people

goofus\nNot according to the rules\nThat you learn in music schools\nBut the folks just dance like fools\nThey sure go for goofus\n\nGot a job but I just couldn't keep it long\nThe leader said that I played all the music wrong\nSo I stepped out with an outfit of my own\n\nGot together a new kind of orchestra\nAnd we all played just the same goofus harmony\nAnd I must admit\nWe made a hit\nGoofus

(Ooh, on the floor)\nShe is so fine (I started to dance)\nThe way she moves, she's so fine\nShe's moving so freakishly (I wonder if she)\nAh, what she needs is me (If she'd go for me)\n\n[Chorus]\nI want you\nAnd you want me\nSo why don't we\nGet together after the dance?\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd while we dance\nLet's record, baby (Let's record, girl)\nYou were so in time (Felt so fine)\nThe way you move me (Move next to me)\nWarm eyes told me one thing (Big brown eyes and [?] thighs)\nOh, baby\nThere is good vibes between you and me (Vibrations, you wanted me)\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nThat

Okay, man, you accepted the vows\nDamn, I'm just gettin' this out, 'cause I swear on my life you got married for views\nTalk about \"clickbait\", but your girlfriend is a title, she don't care about you, damn\nAnd now the whole world is against you, and that's not because of the jealousy\nIt's 'cause you bully people and then think you're a celebrity\nKSIOlajideBT, when I do shit, know I do it creatively\nAnd it's easy to see why you're easily beat, I'm a beast and I will kill you repeatedly\nDamn\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Quadeca (as Jake Paul)]\nAhem-hem-hem...\nI'm Jake Paul\nThe shots you fired are like paintball\n'Cause it's just a game to be entertained\nBut you're more boring than watching some baseball\nUh, I've made more money from merch\nThan KSI's made from his whole career\nJust so we're clear, I've been livin' at the top of the chain\nMust be walkin' away, 'cause you are nowhere near\nI'm the fastest-growin', I'm the best\nYou got a tattoo coverin' your chest, damn\nKnowledge, strength, integrity?

\"Thank you\"\n'Cause I work so hard, they tryna put me down\nBut look around, you can never let 'em shame you\nHow it feel to wake up every day\nAnd have all the news networks tryna break you?\nI'm dealin' wit' the stress and the pressure, I'm depressed\nAnd I measure my success from the pleasure of the fans\nI'm just tryna do the best that I can\nThey all throw around my name and try to put it in the sand\nBut I'm a man, Jake Paulers, just dab on the haters\nLook past all the hatred, try to have conversations\nWith your friends, that's all you really have when you're famous\nSo I'm done with the drama, this is bad entertainment\n[Outro: Quadeca (as Jake Paul)]\nDamn...\nThis is bad entertainment, man\nThey tryna-\n-Tryna drag me downEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

when the host calls \"time\"\n\n[Round 3: Daylyt]\nI said, what I did versus Oops, I like to call this the sequel\nAnd sacrifice some of my third verse just to talk to my people\nMost of y'all

sense they killed niggas quick\nLeft kids in the field with a click/clique guns filled with a clip\nThought we was past the lashings but now these niggas will kill for a deal with a whip\nThey jealousy is jealousy\nBottom of the Amistad boat's motion which got us feeling sick\nIn videos we waving guns like we wild boy, but we run from the cowboys like the real Emmitt Smith\nIn a sense, who knows what's to be deleted but still get a whiff\nRacism, they said they was finished lying\nBut the race to the finish line is what we still dealing with\nI said Martin Luther King had a Dream\nTil one of your people left his dream's blown\nHe got scratched off like a mad itch, it was a bad stitch and yet it seem wrong\nWe lost our leader, now brothers telling, \"No more lean on me, just get your lean on.\"\nThe problem with us is there's a lot of blacks on activists\nAnd not enough black activists to make the team strong\nWhen I was young, I grew up off of Good Will clothing\nBrand new shirt with the sleeve gone\nFor food my father had to run into local routes and get his Steve on\nYou had the childhood life kids like me would dream on\nI grew up asking my father, \"How you get to Sesame Street?\"\nThis nigga daddy helped write the Sesame Street theme song\nI said, Daylyt killing Solomon, how ya do this?\nWhen you was completely assed out from the get go, but you knew this/nudist\nSoon as you start rapping I'm thinking, \"Please, that shit ease as a sneeze.\"\nI'ma chew this shit\nAnd if he fall I'm thinking, Chinese god, I'ma Buddhist/boo dis shit\nI told you, I'm back to fold you, I got a new hunch\nMy whole squad lift up trey, this the group lunch\nI ain't never seen a mark like this, this a new punk\nNiggas this scary gotta get booked, this is Goosebumps\nI said it's true chump\nI'm fro Watts where they not respecting a brother pride\nYou ask a nigga from Watts, \"Why did the chicken cross the road?\"\nCause he got his shit pocket checked on the other side!\nI said, my crew rep the hard route\nYour crew rep the small route\nIt's true, you a Goof Troop so you better fallout\nMy tool let 'em all out, crew set to draw out\nOne through your roof, roof, roof, Who Let The Dogs Out?\nIt gets live, bitch high the bitch die\nI got a World Domination pistol you get hit with the big 5\nLife, medals are bronze, silver and some are gold\nDays, some are hot, winter, some are cold\nLife, some are gangstas, some are bitch, some are bold\nBefore I go, Solomon I got one question for you\nWHAT ARE THOSE?!1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1,

beginning of their lives together\nAnxiously they'd waited for the moment\nThat their love would be complete\nShe reached inside\nHer brand new traveling bag\nAnd found her brand new negligee\nAnd then she shyly slipped it on\n\nAnd suddenly, he realized\nThe beauty of the tender prize\nHe'd waited for so long and finally won\n\nShe climbed into the bed\nHe snapped his fingers\nSaid, I've got to get champagne\n\nThere's a little store right down the block\nI'll only be a minute, close your eyes\nAnd, hon, I'll be right back again\n\nAnd time goes by so slowly\nShe's not sure how much has passed\nWhen she hears the siren\nScreaming through the night\n\nAnd seven hours later, they find her\nRocking on the bed\nJust singing in the early morning light\nYou might also likeForever lovers, forever friends\nA lifetime's a short time\nWhen love never ends\n\nShe checks into the old hotel\nAnd pays a little extra for the suite\n\nShe slips into the faded negligee\nAnd brushes down her hair of gray\nAnd lays her body down to wait\n\nAnd the night air through the curtains\nMakes a sound like someone breathing\nAnd she reaches for him with her fingertips\n\nAnd they find her in the morning\nWith tear stains on her pillow\nAnd a smile like a kiss upon her lips\n\nForever lovers, forever friends\nA lifetime's a short time\nI knew I'd see you again\n\nForever lovers, forever

Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI like to spend some time in Mozambique\nThe sunny sky is aqua blue\nAnd all the couples dancing cheek to cheek\nIt\u2019s very nice to stay a week or two\nAnd maybe fall in love, just me and you\n\n[Instrument Break]\n\n[Verse 2]\nThere\u2019s lot of pretty girls in Mozambique\nAnd plenty time for good romance\nAnd everybody likes to stop and speak\nTo give the special one you seek a chance\nOr maybe say hello with just a glance\n[Instrument Break]\n\n[Verse 3]\nLying next to her by the ocean\nReaching out and touching her hand\nWhispering your secret emotion\nMagic in a magical land\n\n[Verse 4]\nAnd when it\u2019s time for leaving Mozambique\nTo say goodbye to sand and sea\nYou turn around to take a final peek\nAnd you see why it\u2019s so unique to be\nAmong the lovely people living free\nUpon the beach of sunny Mozambique\n\n[Instrument break]You might also like1Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/732501", "artist_names":

world\nLying to myself can't make that scene\nOf wondering if you love me or just making a fool of me\nWell I hope you understand I just had to go back to the island\n[Chorus]\nAnd watch the sun go down (and watch the sun go down)\nHear the sea roll in (listen to the sea roll in)\nBut I'll be thinking of you (yes and I'll be thinking of you)\nAnd how it might have been (thinking how it might have been)\nHear the night birds cry (listen to the night birds cry)\nWatch the sunset die (sit and watch the sunset die)\nWell I hope you understand I just had to go back to the island\n\n[Bridge]\nFor all the sunny skies, it's raining in my heart\nI know down in my soul I'm really gonna miss you\nBut it had to end this way with all the games we played\nWell I hope you understand I just had to go back to the island\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd watch the sun go down (sit and watch the sun go down)\nAnd hear the sea roll in (listen to the sea roll in)\nBut I'll be thinking of you

"url": "https://genius.com/artists/Howard-zinn"}, "artist": "Howard Zinn", "lyrics": "Chapter 10: The Other Civil War LyricsA sheriff in the Hudson River Valley near Albany, New York, about to go into the hills in the fall of 1839 to collect back rents from tenants on the enormous Rensselaer estate, was handed a letter:\n\n... the tenants have organized themselves into a body, and resolved not to pay any more rent until they can be redressed of their grievances. . . . The tenants now assume the right of doing to their landlord as he has for a long time done with them, viz: as they please.\n\nYou need not think this to be children's play... . if you come out in your official capacity ... I would not pledge for your safe return. ... A Tenant.\n\nWhen a deputy arrived in the farming area with writs demanding the rent, farmers suddenly appeared, assembled by the blowing of tin horns. They seized his writs and burned them.\n\nThat December, a sheriff and a mounted posse of five hundred rode into the farm country, but found themselves in the midst of shrieking tin horns, eighteen hundred farmers blocking their path, six hundred more blocking their rear, all mounted, armed with pitchforks and clubs. The sheriff and his posse turned back, the rear guard parting to let them through.\n\nThis was the start of the Anti-Renter movement in the Hudson Valley, described by Henry Christman in Tin Horns and Calico. It was a protest against the patroonship system, which went back to the 1600s when the Dutch ruled New York, a system where (as Christman describes it) \"a few families, intricately intermarried, controlled the destinies of three hundred thousand people and ruled in almost kingly splendor near two million acres of land.\"\nThe tenants paid taxes and rents. The largest manor was owned by the Rensselaer family, which ruled over about eighty thousand tenants and had accumulated a fortune of $41 million. The landowner, as one sympathizer of the tenants put it, could \"swill his wine, loll on his cushions, fill his life with society, food, and culture, and ride his barouche and five saddle horses along the beautiful river valley and up to the backdrop of the mountain.\"\n\nBy the summer of 1839, the tenants were holding their first mass meeting. The economic crisis of 1837 had filled the area with unemployed seeking land, on top of the layoffs accompanying the completion of the Erie Canal, after the first wave of railroad building ended. That summer the tenants resolved: \"We will take up the ball of the Revolution where our fathers stopped it and roll it to the final consummation of freedom and independence of the masses.\"\n\nCertain men in the farm country became leaders and organizers: Smith Boughton, a country doctor on horseback; Ainge Devyr, a revolutionary Irishman. Devyr had seen monopoly of land and industry bring misery to the slumdwellers of London, Liverpool, and Glasgow, had agitated for change, had been arrested for sedition, and fled to America. He was invited to address a Fourth of July rally of farmers in Rensselaerville, where he warned his listeners: \"If you permit unprincipled and ambitious men to monopolize the soil, they will become masters of the country in the certain order of cause and effect....\"\n\nThousands of farmers in Rensselaer country were organized into Anti-Rent associations to prevent the landlords from evicting. They agreed on calico Indian costumes, symbol of the Boston Tea Party and recalling original ownership of the soil. The tin horn represented an Indian call to arms. Soon ten thousand men were trained and ready.\n\nOrganizing went on in county after county, in dozens of towns along the Hudson. Handbills appeared:\n\nATTENTION\nANTI-RENTERS! AWAKE! AROUSE!...\nStrike till the last armed foe expires,\nStrike for your altars and your fires-\nStrike for the green graves of your sires,\nGod and your happy homes!\n\nSheriffs and deputy sheriffs trying to serve writs on farmers were surrounded by calico-clad riders who had been summoned by tin horns sounding in the countryside-then tarred and feathered. The New York Herald, once sympathetic, now deplored \"the insurrectionary spirit of the mountaineers.\"\n\nOne of the most hated elements of the lease gave the landlord the right to the timber on all the farms. A man sent onto a tenant's land to gather wood for the landlord was killed. Tension rose. A farm boy was killed mysteriously, no one knew by whom, but Dr. Boughton was jailed. The governor ordered artillerymen into action, and a company of cavalry came up from New York City.\n\nPetitions for an antirent bill, signed by 25,000 tenants, were put before the legislature in 1845. The bill was defeated. A kind of guerrilla war resumed in the country, between bands of \"Indians\" and sheriffs' posses. Boughton was kept in jail seven months, four and a half months of that in heavy irons, before being released on bail. Fourth of July meetings in 1845 attended by thousands of farmers pledged continued resistance.\n\nWhen a deputy sheriff tried to sell the livestock of a farmer named Moses Earle, who owed $60 rent on 160 stony acres, there was a fight, and the deputy was killed. Similar attempts to sell livestock for rent payments were thwarted, again and again. The governor sent three hundred troops in, declaring a state of rebellion existed, and soon almost a hundred Anti-Renters were in jail. Smith Boughton was brought to trial. He was charged with taking papers from a sheriff but declared by the judge to have in fact committed \"high treason, rebellion against your government, and armed insurrection\" and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nThose \"Indians\" found to be armed and disguised at Moses Earle's farm, where the deputy had been killed, were declared by the judge to be guilty of murder, and the jury was so instructed. All were found guilty, and the judge sentenced four to life imprisonment and two to be hanged. Two of the leaders were told to write letters urging the Anti-Renters to disband, as their only chance to escape heavy sentences. They wrote the letters.\nThe power of the law thus crushed the Anti-Rent movement. It was intended to make clear that farmers could not win by fighting-that they must confine their efforts to voting, to acceptable methods of reform. In 1845, the Anti-Renters elected fourteen members to the state legislature. Governor Silas Wright now commuted to life imprisonment the two death sentences and asked the legislature to give relief to the tenants, to end the feudal system in the Hudson Valley. Proposals to break up the huge estates on the death of the owners were defeated, but the legislature voted to make illegal the selling of tenant property for nonpayment of rent. A constitutional convention that year outlawed new feudal leases.\n\nThe next governor, elected in 1846 with Anti-Rent support, had promised to pardon the Anti-Rent prisoners, and he did. Throngs of farmers greeted them on their release. Court decisions in the 1850s began to limit the worst features of the manorial system, without changing the fundamentals of landlord-tenant relations.\n\nSporadic farmer resistance to the collection of back rents continued into the 1860s. As late as 1869, bands of \"Indians\" were still assembling to thwart sheriffs acting for a rich valley landowner named Walter Church. In the early 1880s a deputy sheriff trying to dispossess a farmer on behalf of Church was killed by shotgun fire. By this time most leases had passed into the hands of the farmers. In three of the main Anti-Rent counties, of twelve thousand farmers, only two thousand remained under lease.\n\nThe farmers had fought, been crushed by the law, their struggle diverted into voting, and the system stabilized by enlarging the class of small landowners, leaving the basic structure of rich and poor intact. It was a common sequence in American history.\n\nAround the time of the Anti-Renter movement in New York, there was excitement in Rhode Island over Dorr's Rebellion. As Marvin Gettleman points out in The Dorr Rebellion, it was both a movement for electoral reform and an example of radical insurgency. It was prompted by the Rhode Island charter's rule that only owners of land could vote.\n\nAs more people left the farm for the city, as immigrants came to work in the mills, the disfranchised grew. Seth Luther, self-educated carpenter in Providence and spokesman for working people, wrote in 1833 the \"Address on the Right of Free Suffrage,\" denouncing the monopoly of political power by \"the mushroom lordlings, sprigs of nobility . . . small potato aristocrats\" of Rhode Island. He urged non-cooperation with the government, refusing to pay taxes or to serve in the militia. Why, he asked, should twelve thousand working people in Rhode Island without the vote submit to five thousand who had land and could vote?\n\nThomas Dorr, a lawyer from a well-to-do family, became a leader of the suffrage movement. Working people formed the Rhode Island Suffrage Association, and in the spring of 1841 thousands paraded in Providence carrying banners and signs for electoral reform. Going outside the legal system, they organized their own \"People's Convention\" and drafted a new constitution without property qualifications for voting.\n\nIn early 1842, they invited votes on the constitution; fourteen thousand voted for it, including about five thousand with property-therefore a majority even of those legally entitled to vote by the charter. In April they held an unofficial election, in which Dorr ran unopposed for governor, and six thousand people voted for him. The governor of Rhode Island in the meantime got the promise of President John Tyler that in the case of rebellion federal troops would be sent. There was a clause in the U.S. Constitution to meet just that kind of situation, providing for federal intervention to quell local insurrections on request of a state government.\n\nIgnoring this, on May 3, 1842, the Dorr forces held an inauguration with a great parade of artisans, shopkeepers, mechanics, and militia marching through Providence. The newly elected People's Legislature was convened. Dorr led a fiasco of an attack on the state arsenal, his cannon misfiring. Dorr's arrest was ordered by the regular governor, and he went into hiding outside the state, trying to raise military support.\n\nDespite the protests of Dorr and a few others, the \"People's Constitution\" kept the word \"white\" in its clause designating voters. Angry Rhode Island blacks now joined the militia units of the Law and Order coalition, which promised that a new constitutional convention would give them the right to vote.\n\nWhen Dorr returned to Rhode Island, he found several hundred of his followers, mostly working people, willing to fight for the People's Constitution, but there were thousands in the regular militia on the side of the state. The rebellion disintegrated and Dorr again fled Rhode Island.\n\nMartial law was declared. One rebel soldier, captured, was blindfolded and put before a firing squad, which fired with blank bullets. A hundred other militia were taken prisoner. One of them described their being bound by ropes into platoons of eight, marched on foot 16 miles to Providence, \"threatened and pricked by the bayonet if we lagged from fatigue, the rope severely chafing our arms; the skin off mine. . . . no water till we reached Greenville ... no food until the next day.... and, after being exhibited, were put into the State prison.\"\n\nA new constitution offered some reform. It still gave overrepresentation to the rural areas, limited the vote to property owners or those who paid a one-dollar poll tax, and would let naturalized citizens vote only if they had $134 in real estate. In the elections of early 1843, the Law and Order group, opposed by former Dorrites, used intimidation of state militia, of employees by employers, of tenants by landlords, to get out their vote. It lost in the industrial towns, but got the vote of the agrarian areas, and won all major offices.\nDorr returned to Rhode Island in the fall of 1843. He was arrested on the streets of Providence and tried for treason. The jury, instructed by the judge to ignore all political arguments and consider only whether Dorr had committed certain overt acts (which he never denied committing), found him guilty, whereupon the judge sentenced him to life imprisonment at hard labor. He spent twenty months in jail, and then a newly elected Law and Order governor, anxious to end Dorr's martyrdom, pardoned him.\n\nArmed force had failed, the ballot had failed, the courts had taken the side of the conservatives. The Dorr movement now went to the U.S. Supreme Court, via a trespass suit by Martin Luther against Law and Order militiamen, charging that the People's Government was the legitimate government in Rhode Island in 1842. Daniel Webster argued against the Dorrites. If people could claim a constitutional right to overthrow an existing government, Webster said, there would be no more law and no more government; there would be anarchy.\n\nIn its decision, the Supreme Court established (Luther v. Borden, 1849) a long-lasting doctrine: it would not interfere in certain \"political\" questions, to be left to executive and legislature. The decision reinforced the essentially conservative nature of the Supreme Court: that on critical issues- war and revolution-it would defer to the President and Congress.\n\nThe stories of the Anti-Renter movement and Dorr's Rebellion are not usually found in textbooks on United States history. In these books, given to millions of young Americans, there is little on class struggle in the nineteenth century. The period before and after the Civil War is filled with politics, elections, slavery, and the race question. Even where specialized books on the Jacksonian period deal with labor and economic issues they center on the presidency, and thus perpetuate the traditional dependency on heroic leaders rather than people's struggles.\n\nAndrew Jackson said he spoke for \"the humble members of society- the farmer, mechanics and laborers... .\" He certainly did not speak for the Indians being pushed off their lands, or slaves. But the tensions aroused by the developing factory system, the growing immigration, required that the government develop a mass base of support among whites. \"Jacksonian Democracy\" did just that.\n\nPolitics in this period of the 1830s and 1840s, according to Douglas Miller, a specialist in the Jacksonian period (The Birth of Modern America), \"had become increasingly centered around creating a popular image and flattering the common man.\" Miller is dubious, however, about the accuracy of that phrase \"Jacksonian Democracy\":\n\nParades, picnics, and campaigns of personal slander characterized Jacksonian politicking. But, although both parties aimed their rhetoric at the people and mouthed the sacred shibboleths of democracy, this did not mean that the common man ruled America. The professional politicians corning to the fore in the twenties and thirties, though sometimes self-made, were seldom ordinary. Both major parties were controlled largely by men of wealth and ambition. Lawyers, newspaper editors, merchants, industrialists, large landowners, and speculators dominated the Democrats as well as the Whigs.\n\nJackson was the first President to master the liberal rhetoric-to speak for the common man. This was a necessity for political victory when the vote was being demanded-as in Rhode Island-by more and more people, and state legislatures were loosening voting restrictions. As another Jacksonian scholar, Robert Remini (The Age of Jackson), says, after studying electoral figures for 1828 and 1832:\n\nJackson himself enjoyed widespread support that ranged across all classes and sections of the country. He attracted farmers, mechanics, laborers, professionals and even businessmen. And all this without Jackson being clearly pro- or antilabor, pro- or antibusiness, pro- or antilower, middle or upper class. It has been demonstrated that he was a strikebreaker [Jackson sent troops to control rebellious workers on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal], yet at different times ... he and the Democrats received the backing of organized labor.\n\nIt was the new politics of ambiguity-speaking for the lower and middle classes to get their support in times of rapid growth and potential turmoil. The two-party system came into its own in this time. To give people a choice between two different parties and allow them, in a period of rebellion, to choose the slightly more democratic one was an ingenious mode of control. Like so much in the American system, it was not devilishly contrived by some master plotters; it developed naturally out of the needs of the situation. Remini compares the Jacksonian Democrat Martin Van Buren, who succeeded Jackson as President, with the Austrian conservative statesman Metternich: \"Like Metternich, who was seeking to thwart revolutionary discontent in Europe, Van Buren and similar politicians were attempting to banish political disorder from the United States by a balance of power achieved through two well-organized and active parties.\"\n\nThe Jacksonian idea was to achieve stability and control by winning to the Democratic party \"the middling interest, and especially ... the substantial yeomanry of the country\" by \"prudent, judicious, well-considered reform.\" That is, reform that would not yield too much. These were the words of Robert Rantoul, a reformer, corporation lawyer, and Jacksonian Democrat. It was a forecast of the successful appeal of the Democratic party-and at times the Republican party-in the twentieth century.\n\nSuch new forms of political control were needed in the turbulence of growth, the possibility of rebellion. Now there were canals, railroads, the telegraph. In 1790, fewer than a million Americans lived in cities; in 1840 the figure was 11 million. New York had 130,000 people in 1820, a million by 1860. And while the traveler Alexis de Tocqueville had expressed astonishment at \"the general equality of condition among the people,\" he was not very good at numbers, his friend Beaumont said. And his observation was not in accord with the facts, according to Edward Pessen, a historian of Jacksonian society (Jacksonian America).\n\nIn Philadelphia, working-class families lived fifty-five to a tenement, usually one room per family, with no garbage removal, no toilets, no fresh air or water. There was fresh water newly pumped from the Schuylkill River, but it was going to the homes of the rich.\n\nIn New York you could see the poor lying in the streets with the garbage. There were no sewers in the slums, and filthy water drained into yards and alleys, into the cellars where the poorest of the poor lived, bringing with it a typhoid epidemic in 1837, typhus in 1842. In the cholera epidemic of 1832, the rich fled the city; the poor stayed and died.\n\nThese poor could not be counted on as political allies of the government. But they were there-like slaves, or Indians-invisible ordinarily, a menace if they rose. There were more solid citizens, however, who might give steady support to the system-paid-paid workers, landowning farmers. Also, there was the new urban white-collar worker, born in the rising commerce of the time, described by Thomas Cochran and William Miller (The Age of Enterprise):\n\nDressed in drab alpaca, hunched over a high desk, this new worker credited and debited, indexed and filed, wrote and stamped invoices, acceptances, bills of lading, receipts. Adequately paid, he had some extra money and leisure time. He patronized sporting events and theaters, savings banks and insurance companies. he read Day's New York Sun or Bennett's Herald-the \"penny press\" supported by advertising, filled with police reports, crime stories, etiquette advice for the rising bourgeoisie... .\n\nThis was the advance guard of a growing class of white-collar workers and professionals in America who would be wooed enough and paid enough to consider themselves members of the bourgeois class, and to give support to that class in times of crisis.\n\nThe opening of the West was being helped by mechanization of the farm. Iron plows cut plowing time in half; by the 1850s John Deere Company was turning out ten thousand plows a year. Cyrus McCormick was making a thousand mechanical reapers a year in his factory in Chicago. A man with a sickle could cut half an acre of wheat in a day; with a reaper he could cut 10 acres.\n\nTurnpikes, canals, and railroads were bringing more people west, more products east, and it became important to keep that new West, tumultuous and unpredictable, under control. When colleges were established out West, eastern businessmen, as Cochran and Miller say, were \"determined from the start to control western education.\" Edward Everett, the Massachusetts politician and orator, spoke in 1833 on behalf of giving financial aid to western colleges:\n\nLet no Boston capitalist, then, let no man, who has a large stake in New England .. . think that he is called upon to exercise his liberality at a distance, toward those in whom he has no concern. ... They ask you to give security to your own property, by diffusing the means of light and truth throughout the region, where so much of the power to preserve or to shake it resides. . . .\n\nThe capitalists of the East were conscious of the need for this \"security to your own property.\" As technology developed, more capital was needed, more risks had to be taken, and a big investment needed stability. In an economic system not rationally planned for human need, but developing fitfully, chaotically out of the profit motive, there seemed to be no way to avoid recurrent booms and slumps. There was a slump in 1837, another in 1853. One way to achieve stability was to decrease competition, organize the businesses, move toward monopoly. In the mid-1850s, price agreements and mergers became frequent: the New York Central Railroad was a merger of many railroads. The American Brass Association was formed \"to meet ruinous competition,\" it said. The Hampton County Cotton Spinners Association was organized to control prices, and so was the American Iron Association.\n\nAnother way to minimize risks was to make sure the government played its traditional role, going back to Alexander Hamilton and the first Congress, of helping the business interests. State legislatures gave charters to corporations giving them legal rights to conduct business, raise money- at first special charters, then general charters, so that any business meeting certain requirements could incorporate. Between 1790 and 1860, 2,300 corporations were chartered.\n\nRailroad men traveled to Washington and to state capitals armed with money, shares of stock, free railroad passes. Between 1850 and 1857 they got 25 million acres of public land, free of charge, and millions of dollars in bonds-loans-from the state legislatures. In Wisconsin in 1856, the LaCrosse and Milwaukee Railroad got a million acres free by distributing about $900,000 in stocks and bonds to fifty-nine assemblymen, thirteen senators, the, governor. Two years later the railroad was bankrupt and the bonds were worthless.\n\nIn the East, mill owners had become powerful, and organized. By 1850, fifteen Boston families called the \"Associates\" controlled 20 percent of the cotton spindleage in the United States, 39 percent of insurance capital in Massachusetts, 40 percent of banking resources in Boston.\n\nIn the schoolbooks, those years are filled with the controversy over slavery, but on the eve of the Civil War it was money and profit, not the movement against slavery, that was uppermost in the priorities of the men who ran the country. As Cochran and Miller put it:\n\nWebster was the hero of the North-not Emerson, Parker, Garrison, or Phillips; Webster the tariff man, the land speculator, the corporation lawyer, politician for the Boston Associates, inheritor of Hamilton's coronet. \"The great object of government\" said he \"is the protection of property at home, and respect and renown abroad.\" For these he preached union; for these he surrendered the fugitive slave.\n\nThey describe the Boston rich:\n\nLiving sumptuously on Beacon Hill, admired by their neighbors for their philanthropy and their patronage of art and culture, these men traded in State Street while overseers ran their factories, managers directed their railroads, agents sold their water power and real estate. They were absentee landlords in the most complete sense. Uncontaminated by the diseases of the factory town, they were also protected from hearing the complaints of their workers or suffering mental depression from dismal and squalid surroundings. In the metropolis, art, literature, education, science, flowered in the Golden Day; in the industrial towns children went to work with their fathers and mothers, schools and doctors were only promises, a bed of one's own was a rare luxury.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson described Boston in those years: \"There is a certain poor-smell in all the streets, in Beacon Street and Mount Vernon, as well as in the lawyers' offices, and the wharves, and the same meanness and sterility, and leave-all-hope-behind, as one finds in a boot manufacturer's premises.\" The preacher Theodore Parker told his congregation: \"Money is this day the strongest power of the nation.\"\n\nThe attempts at political stability, at economic control, did not quite work. The new industrialism, the crowded cities, the long hours in the factories, the sudden economic crises leading to high prices and lost jobs, the lack of food and water, the freezing winters, the hot tenements in the summer, the epidemics of disease, the deaths of children-these led to sporadic reactions from the poor. Sometimes there were spontaneous, unorganized uprisings against the rich. Sometimes the anger was deflected into racial hatred for blacks, religious warfare against Catholics, nativist fury against immigrants. Sometimes it was organized into demonstrations and strikes.\n\n\"Jacksonian Democracy\" had tried to create a consensus of support for the system to make it secure. Blacks, Indians, women, and foreigners were clearly outside the consensus. But also, white working people, in large numbers, declared themselves outside.\n\nThe full extent of the working-class consciousness of those years-as of any years-is lost in history, but fragments remain and make us wonder how much of this always existed underneath the very practical silence of working people. In 1827 an \"Address ... before the Mechanics and Working Classes ... of Philadelphia\" was recorded, written by an \"Unlettered Mechanic,\" probably a young shoemaker, who said:\n\nWe find ourselves oppressed on every hand-we labor hard in producing all the comforts of life for the enjoyment of others, while we ourselves obtain but a scanty portion, and even that in the present state of society depends on the will of employers.\n\nFrances Wright of Scotland, an early feminist and Utopian socialist, was invited by Philadelphia workingmen to speak on the Fourth of July 1829 to one of the first city-wide associations of labor unions in the United States. She asked if the Revolution had been fought \"to crush down the sons and daughters of your country's industry under ... neglect, poverty, vice, starvation, and disease....\" She wondered if the new technology was not lowering the value of human labor, making people appendages to machines, crippling the minds and bodies of child laborers.\n\nLater that year, George Henry Evans, a printer, editor of the Workingman's Advocate, wrote \"The Working Men's Declaration of Independence.\" Among its list of \"facts\" submitted to \"candid and impartial\" fellow citizens:\n\nl. The laws for levying taxes are . . . operating most oppressively on one class of society....\n3. The laws for private incorporation are all partial . .. favoring one class of society to the expense of the other. . ..\n6. The laws .. . have deprived nine tenths of the members of the body politics, who are not wealthy, of the equal means to enjoy \"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" ... The lien law in favor of the landlords against tenants ... is one illustration among innumerable others.\n\nEvans believed that \"all on arriving at adult age are entitled to equal property.\"\n\nA city-wide \"Trades' Union\" in Boston in 1834, including mechanics from Charlestown and women shoe binders from Lynn, referred to the Declaration of Independence:\n\nWe hold . .. that laws which have a tendency to raise any peculiar class above their fellow citizens, by granting special privileges, are contrary to and in defiance of those primary principles....\n\nOur public system of Education, which so liberally endows those seminaries of learning, which ... are only accessible to the wealthy, while our common schools ... are so illy provided for ... Thus even in childhood the poor are apt to think themselves inferior.. . .\n\nIn his book Most Uncommon Jacksonians, Edward Pessen says: \"The leaders of the Jacksonian labor movement were radicals.. . . How else describe men who believed American society to be torn with social conflict, disfigured by the misery of the masses, and dominated by a greedy elite whose power over every aspect of American life was based on private property?\"\n\nEpisodes of insurrection of that time have gone unrecorded in traditional histories. Such was the riot in Baltimore in the summer of 1835, when the Bank of Maryland collapsed and its depositors lost their savings. Convinced that a great fraud had taken place, a crowd gathered and began breaking the windows of officials associated with the bank. When the rioters destroyed a house, the militia attacked, killing some twenty people, wounding a hundred. The next evening, other houses were attacked. The events were reported in Niles' Weekly Register, an important newspaper of that time:\n\nLast night (Sunday) at dark, the attack was renewed upon Reverdy Johnson's house. There was now no opposition. It was supposed that several thousand people were spectators of the scene. The house was soon entered, and its furniture, a very extensive law library, and all its contents, were cast forth, a bonfire made of them in front of the house. The whole interior of the house was torn out and cast upon the burning pile. The marble portico in front, and a great portion of the front wall were torn down by about 11 o'clock.. .. They proceeded to that of the mayor of the city, Jesse Hunt, esq. broke it open, took out the furniture, and burnt it before the door. . ..\n\nDuring those years, trade unions were forming. (Philip Foner's History of the Labor Movement in the U.S. tells the story in rich detail.) The courts called them conspiracies to restrain trade and therefore illegal, as when in New York twenty-five members of the Union Society of Journeymen Tailors were found guilty of \"conspiracy to injure trade, riot, assault, battery.\" The judge, levying fines, said: \"In this favored land of law and liberty, the road to advancement is open to all.... Every American knows that or ought to know that he has no better friend than the laws and that he needs no artificial combination for his protection. They are of foreign origin and I am led to believe mainly upheld by foreigners.\"\n\nA handbill was then circulated throughout the city:\n\nThe Rich Against the Poor!\nJudge Edwards, the tool of the aristocracy, against the people! Mechanics and working men! A deadly blow has been struck at your liberty!... They have established the precedent that workingmen have no right to regulate the price of labor, or, in other words, the rich are the only judges of the wants of the poor man.\n\nAt City Hall Park, 27,000 people gathered to denounce the court decision, and elected a Committee of Correspondence which organized, three months later, a convention of Mechanics, Farmers, and Working Men, elected by farmers and working people in various towns in New York State. The convention met in Utica, drew up a Declaration of Independence from existing political parties, and established an Equal Rights party.\n\nAlthough they ran their own candidates for office, there was no great confidence in the ballot as a way of achieving change. One of the great orators of the movement, Seth Luther, told a Fourth of July rally: \"We will try the ballot box first. If that will not effect our righteous purpose, the next and last resort is the cartridge box.\" And one sympathetic local newspaper, the Albany Microscope, warned:\n\nRemember the regretted fate of the working-men-they were soon destroyed by hitching teams and rolling with parties. They admitted into their ranks, broken down lawyers and politicians.... They became perverted, and were unconsciously drawn into a vortex, from which they never escaped.\n\nThe crisis of 1837 led to rallies and meetings in many cities. The banks had suspended specie payments-refusing to pay hard money for the bank notes they had issued. Prices rose, and working people, already hard-pressed to buy food, found that flour that had sold at $5.62 a barrel was now $12 a barrel. Pork went up. Coal went up. In Philadelphia, twenty thousand people assembled, and someone wrote to President Van Buren describing it:\n\nThis afternoon, the largest public meeting I ever saw assembled in Independence Square. It was called by placards posted through the city yesterday and last night. It was projected and carried on entirely by the working classes; without consultation or cooperation with any of those who usually take the lead in such matters. The officers and speakers were of those classes.... It was directed against the banks.\n\nIn New York, members of the Equal Rights party (often called the Locofocos) announced a meeting: \"Bread, Meat, Rent, and Fuel! Their prices must come down! The people will meet in the Park, rain or shine, at 4 o'clock, P.M. on Monday afternoon.... All friends of humanity determined to resist monopolists and extortioners are invited to attend.\" The Commercial Register, a New York newspaper, reported on the meeting and what followed:\n\nAt 4 o'clock, a concourse of several thousands had convened in front of the City Hall.. .. One of these orators ... is reported to have expressly directed the popular vengeance against Mr. EH Hart, who is one of our most extensive flour dealers on commission. \"Fellow citizens!\" he exclaimed, \"Mr. Hart has now 53,000 barrels of flour in his store; let us go and offer him eight dollars a barrel, and if he does not take it...\"\n\nA large body of the meeting moved off in the direction of Mr. Hart's store . . . the middle door had been forced, and some twenty or thirty barrels of flour or more, rolled into the streets, and the heads staved in. At this point of time, Mr. Hart himself arrived on the ground, with a posse of officers from the police. The officers were assailed by a portion of the mob in Dey Street, their staves wrested from them, and shivered to pieces. .. .\n\nBarrels of flour, by dozens, fifties and hundreds were tumbled into the street from the doors, and thrown in rapid succession from the windows... . About one thousand bushels of wheat, and four or five hundred barrels of flour, were thus wantonly and foolishly as well as wickedly destroyed. The most active of the destructionists were foreigners-indeed the greater part of the assemblage was of exotic origin, but there were probably five hundred or a thousand others, standing by and abetting their incendiary labors.\n\nAmidst the falling and bursting of the barrels and sacks of wheat, numbers of women were engaged, like the crones who strip the dead in battle, filling the boxes and baskets with which they were provided, and their aprons, with flour, and making off with it....\n\nNight had now closed upon the scene, but the work of destruction did not cease until strong bodies of police arrived, followed, soon afterward, by detachments of troops.. . .\n\nThis was the Flour Riot of 1837. During the crisis of that year, 50,000 persons (one-third of the working class) were without work in New York City alone, and 200,000 (of a population of 500,000) were living, as one observer put it, \"in utter and hopeless distress.\"\n\nThere is no complete record of the meetings, riots, actions, organized and disorganized, violent and nonviolent, which took place in the mid-nineteenth century, as the country grew, as the cities became crowded, with working conditions bad, living conditions intolerable, with the economy in the hands of bankers, speculators, landlords, merchants.\n\nIn 1835, fifty different trades organized unions in Philadelphia, and there was a successful general strike of laborers, factory workers, hook-binders, jewelers, coal heavers, butchers, cabinet workers- for the ten-hour day. Soon there were ten-hour laws in Pennsylvania and other states, but they provided that employers could have employees sign contracts for longer hours. The law at this time was developing a strong defense of contracts; it was pretended that work contracts were voluntary agreements between equals.\n\nWeavers in Philadelphia in the early 1840s-mostly Irish immigrants working at home for employers-struck for higher wages, attacked the homes of those refusing to strike, and destroyed their work. A sheriffs posse tried to arrest some strikers, but it was broken up by four hundred weavers armed with muskets and sticks.\n\nSoon, however, antagonism developed between these Irish Catholic weavers and native-born Protestant skilled workers over issues of religion. In May 1844 there were Protestant-Catholic riots in Kensington, a suburb of Philadelphia; nativist (anti-immigrant) rioters destroyed the weavers' neighborhoods and attacked a Catholic church. Middle-class politicians soon led each group into a different political party (the nativists into the American Republican party, the Irish into the Democratic party), party politics and religion now substituting for class conflict.\n\nThe result of all this, says David Montgomery, historian of the Kensington Riots, was the fragmentation of the Philadelphia working class. It \"thereby created for historians the illusion of a society lacking in class conflict,\" while in reality the class conflicts of nineteenth-century America \"were as fierce as any known to the industrial world.\"\n\nThe immigrants from Ireland, fleeing starvation there when the potato crop failed, were coming to America now, packed into old sailing ships. The stories of these ships differ only in detail from the accounts of the ships that earlier brought black slaves and later German, Italian, Russian immigrants. This is a contemporary account of one ship arriving from Ireland, detained at Grosse Isle on the Canadian border:\n\nOn the 18th of May, 1847, the \"Urania\", from Cork, with several hundred immigrants on board, a large proportion of them sick and dying of the ship-fever, was put into quarantine at Grosse Isle. This was the first of the plague-smitten ships from Ireland which that year sailed up the St. Lawrence. But before the first week of June as many as eighty-four ships of various tonnage were driven in by an easterly wind; and of that enormous number of vessels there was not one free from the taint of malignant typhus, the offspring of famine and of the foul ship-hold.... a tolerably quick passage occupied from six to eight weeks. . ..\n\nWho can imagine the horrors of even the shortest passage in an emigrant ship crowded beyond its utmost capacity of stowage with unhappy beings of all ages, with fever raging in their midst ... the crew sullen or brutal from very desperation, or paralyzed with terror of the plague-the miserable passengers unable to help themselves, or afford the least relief to each other; one-fourth, or one- third, or one-half of the entire number in different stages of the disease; many dying, some dead; the fatal poison intensified by the indescribable foulness of the air breathed and rebreathed by the gasping sufferers-the wails of children, the ravings of the delirious, the cries and groans of those in mortal agony!\n\n. .. there was no accommodation of any kind on the island . . . sheds were rapidly filled with the miserable people... . Hundreds were literally flung on the beach, left amid the mud and stones to crawl on the dry land how they could... . Many of these ... gasped out their last breath on that fatal shore, not able to drag themselves from the slime in which they lay. ...\n\nIt was not until the 1st of November that the quarantine of Grosse Isle was closed. Upon that barren isle as many as 10,000 of the Irish race were consigned to the grave-pit. . ..\n\nHow could these new Irish immigrants, themselves poor and despised, become sympathizers with the black slave, who was becoming more and more the center of attention, the subject of agitation in the country? Indeed, most working-class activists at this time ignored the plight of blacks. Ely Moore, a New York trade union leader elected to Congress, argued in the House of Representatives against receiving abolitionist petitions. Racist hostility became an easy substitute for class frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, a white shoemaker wrote in 1848 in the Awl, the newspaper of Lynn shoe factory workers:\n\n... we are nothing but a standing army that keeps three million of our brethren in bondage.. . . Living under the shade of Bunker Hill monument, demanding in the name of humanity, our right, and withholding those rights from others because their skin is black! Is it any wonder that God in his righteous anger has punished us by forcing us to drink the bitter cup of degradation.\n\nThe anger of the city poor often expressed itself in futile violence over nationality or religion. In New York in 1849 a mob, largely Irish; stormed the fashionable Astor Place Opera House, where an English actor, William Charles Macready, was playing Macbeth, in competition with an American actor, Edwin Forrest, who was acting the same role in another production. The crowd, shouting \"Burn the damn den of aristocracy,\" charged, throwing bricks. The militia were called out, and in the violence that followed about two hundred people were killed or wounded.\n\nAnother economic crisis came in 1857. The boom in railroads and manufacturing, the surge of immigration, the increased speculation in stocks and bonds, the stealing, corruption, manipulation, led to wild expansion and then crash. By October of that year, 200,000 were unemployed, and thousands of recent immigrants crowded into the eastern ports, hoping to work their way back to Europe. The New York Times reported: \"Every ship for Liverpool now has all the passengers she can carry, and multitudes are applying to work their passage if they have no money to pay for it.\"\n\nIn Newark, New Jersey, a rally of several thousand demanded the city give work to the unemployed. And in New York, fifteen thousand people met at Tompkins Square in downtown Manhattan. From there they marched to Wall Street and paraded around the Stock Exchange shouting: \"We want work!\" That summer, riots occurred in the slum areas of New York. A mob of five hundred attacked the police one day with pistols and bricks. There were parades of the unemployed, demanding bread and work, looting shops. In November, a crowd occupied City Hall, and the U.S. marines were brought in to drive them out.\n\nOf the country's work force of 6 million in 1850, half a million were women: 330,000 worked as domestics; 55,000 were teachers. Of the 181,000 women in factories, half worked in textile mills.\n\nThey organized. Women struck by themselves for the first time in 1825. They were the United Tailoresses of New York, demanding higher wages. In 1828, the first strike of mill women on their own took place in Dover, New Hampshire, when several hundred women paraded with banners and flags. They shot off gunpowder, in protest against new factory rules, which charged fines for coming late, forbade talking on the job, and required church attendance. They were forced to return to the mill, their demands unmet, and their leaders were fired and blacklisted.\n\nIn Exeter, New Hampshire, women mill workers went on strike (\"turned out,\" in the language of that day) because the overseer was setting the clocks back to get more time from them. Their strike succeeded in exacting a promise from the company that the overseers would set their watches right.\n\nThe \"Lowell system,\" in which young girls would go to work in the mills and live in dormitories supervised by matrons, at first seemed beneficent, sociable, a welcome escape from household drudgery or domestic service. Lowell, Massachusetts, was the first town created for the textile mill industry; it was named after the wealthy and influential Lowell family. But the dormitories became prisonlike, controlled by rules and regulations. The supper (served after the women had risen at four in the morning and worked until seven thirty in the evening) often consisted merely of bread and gravy.\n\nSo the Lowell girls organized. They started their own newspapers. They protested against the weaving rooms, which were poorly lit, badly ventilated, impossibly hot in the summer, damp and cold in the winter. In 1834, a cut in wages led the Lowell women to strike, proclaiming: \"Union is power. Our present object is to have union and exertion, and we remain in possession of our own unquestionable rights. . . .\" But the threat of hiring others to replace them brought them back to work at reduced wages (the leaders were fired).\n\nThe young women, determined to do better next time, organized a Factory Girls' Association, and 1,500 went on strike in 1836 against a raise in boardinghouse charges. Harriet Hanson was an eleven-year-old girl working in the mill. She later recalled:\n\nI worked in a lower room where I had heard the proposed strike fully, if not vehemently, discussed. I had been an ardent listener to what was said against this attempt at \"oppression\" on the part of the corporation, and naturally I took sides with the strikers. When the day came on which the girls were to turn out, those in the upper rooms started first, and so many of them left that our mill was at once shut down. Then, when the girls in my room stood irresolute, uncertain what to do ... I, who began to think they would not go out, after all their talk, became impatient, and started on ahead, saying, with childish bravado, \"I don't care what you do, I am going to turn out, whether anyone else does or not,\" and I marched out, and was followed by the others.\n\nAs I looked back at the long line that followed me, I was more proud than I have ever been since. . . .\n\nThe strikers marched through the streets of Lowell, singing. They held out a month, but then their money ran out, they were evicted from the boardinghouses, and many of them went back to work. The leaders were fired, including Harriet Hanson's widowed mother, a matron in the boardinghouse, who was blamed for her child's going out on strike.\n\nResistance continued. One mill in Lowell, Herbert Gutman reports, discharged twenty-eight women for such reasons as \"misconduct,\" \"disobedience,\" \"impudence,\" \"levity,\" and \"mutiny.\" Meanwhile, the girls tried to hold on to thoughts about fresh air, the country, a less harried way of life. One of them recalled: \"I never cared much for machinery. I could not see into their complications or feel interested in them. ... In sweet June weather I would lean far out of the window, and try not to hear the unceasing clash of sound inside.\"\n\nIn New Hampshire, five hundred men and women petitioned the Amoskeag Manufacturing Company not to cut down an elm tree to make space for another mill. They said it was \"a beautiful and goodly tree,\" representing a time \"when the yell of the red man and the scream of the eagle were alone heard on the hanks of the Merrimack, instead of two giant edifices filled with the buzz of busy and well-remunerated industry.\"\n\nIn 1835, twenty mills went on strike to reduce the workday from thirteen and a half hours to eleven hours, to get cash wages instead of company scrip, and to end fines for lateness. Fifteen hundred children and parents went out on strike, and it lasted six weeks. Strikebreakers were brought in, and some workers went back to work, but the strikers did win a twelve-hour day and nine hours on Saturday. That year and the next, there were 140 strikes in the eastern part of the United States.\n\nThe crisis that followed the 1837 panic stimulated the formation in 1845 of the Female Labor Reform Association in Lowell, which sent thousands of petitions to the Massachusetts legislature asking for a ten-hour day. Finally, the legislature decided to hold public hearings, the first investigation of labor conditions by any governmental body in the country. Eliza Hemingway told the committee of the air thick with smoke from oil lamps burning before sunup and after sundown. Judith Payne told of her sickness due to the work in the mills. But after the committee visited the mills-for which the company prepared by a cleanup job-it reported: \"Your committee returned fully satisfied that the order, decorum, and general appearance of things in and around the mills could not be improved by any suggestion of theirs or by any act of the legislature.\"\n\nThe report was denounced by the Female Labor Reform Association, and they worked successfully for the committee chairman's defeat at the next election, though they could not vote. But not much was done to change conditions in the mills. In the late 1840s, the New England farm women who worked in the mills began to leave them, as more and more Irish immigrants took their place.\n\nCompany towns now grew up around mills in Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, using immigrant workers who signed contracts pledging everyone in the family to work for a year. They lived in slum tenements owned by the company, were paid in scrip, which they could use only at company stores, and were evicted if their work was unsatisfactory.\n\nIn Paterson, New Jersey, the first of a series of mill strikes was started by children. When the company suddenly put off their dinner hour from noon to 1:00 P.M., the children marched off the job, their parents cheering them on. They were joined by other working people in the town- carpenters, masons, machinists-who turned the strike into a ten-hour-day struggle. After a week, however, with the threat of bringing in militia, the children returned to work, and their leaders were fired. Soon after, trying to prevent more trouble, the company restored the noon dinner hour.\n\nIt was the shoemakers of Lynn, Massachusetts, a factory town northeast of Boston, who started the largest strike to take place in the United States before the Civil War. Lynn had pioneered in the use of sewing machines in factories, replacing shoemaker artisans. The factory workers in Lynn, who began to organize in the 1830s, later started a militant newspaper, the Awl. In 1844, four years before Marx and Engels's Communist Manifesto appeared, the Awl wrote:\n\nThe division of society into the producing and the non-producing classes, and the fact of the unequal distribution of value between the two, introduces us at once to another distinction-that of capital and labor... . labor now becomes a commodity.... Antagonism and opposition of interest is introduced in the community; capital and labor stand opposed.\n\nThe economic crisis of 1857 brought the shoe business to a halt, and the workers of Lynn lost their jobs. There was already anger at machine-stitching replacing shoemakers. Prices were up, wages were repeatedly cut, and by the fall of 1859 men were earning $3 a week and women were earning $1 a week, working sixteen hours a day.\n\nIn early 1860, a mass meeting of the newly formed Mechanics Association demanded higher wages. When the manufacturers refused to meet with their committees, the workers called a strike for Washington's Birthday. That morning three thousand shoemakers met in the Lyceum Hall in Lynn and set up committees of 100 to post the names of scabs, to guard against violence, to make sure shoes would not be sent out to be finished elsewhere.\n\nIn a few days, shoeworkers throughout New England joined the strike-in Natick, Newburyport, Haverhill, Marblehead, and other Massachusetts towns, as well as towns in New Hampshire and Maine. In a week, strikes had begun in all the shoe towns of New England, with Mechanics Associations in twenty-five towns and twenty thousand shoe-workers on strike. Newspapers called it \"The Revolution at the North,\" \"The Rebellion Among the Workmen of New England,\" \"Beginning of the Conflict Between Capital and Labor.\"\n\nOne thousand women and five thousand men marched through the streets of Lynn in a blizzard, carrying banners and American flags. Women shoebinders and stitchers joined the strike and held their own mass meeting. A New York Herald reporter wrote of them: \"They assail the bosses in a style which reminds one of the amiable females who participated in the first French Revolution.\" A huge Ladies' Procession was organized, the women marching through streets high with snowdrifts, carrying signs: \"American Ladies Will Not Be Slaves. . . Weak in Physical Strength but Strong in Moral Courage, We Dare Battle for the Right, Shoulder to Shoulder with our Fathers, Husbands, and Brothers.\" Ten days after that, a procession often thousand striking workers, including delegations from Salem, Marblehead, and other towns, men and women, marched through Lynn, in what was the greatest demonstration of labor to take place in New England up to that time.\n\nPolice from Boston and militia were sent in to make sure strikers did not interfere with shipments of shoes to be finished out of the state. The strike processions went on, while city grocers and provisions dealers provided food for the strikers. The strike continued through March with morale high, but by April it was losing force. The manufacturers offered higher wages to bring the strikers back into the factories, but without recognizing the unions, so that workers still had to face the employer as individuals.\n\nMost of the shoeworkers were native-born Americans, Alan Dawley says in his study of the Lynn strike (Class and Community). They did not accept the social and political order that kept them in poverty, however much it was praised in American schools, churches, newspapers. In Lynn, he says, \"articulate, activist Irish shoe and leather workers joined Yankees in flatly rejecting the myth of success. Irish and Yankee workers jointly ... looked for labor candidates when they went to the polls, and resisted strikebreaking by local police.\" Trying to understand why this fierce class spirit did not lead to independent revolutionary political action, Dawley concludes that the main reason is that electoral politics drained the energies of the resisters into the channels of the system.\n\nDawley disputes some historians who have said the high rate of mobility of workers prevented them from organizing in revolutionary ways. He says that while there was a high turnover in Lynn too, this \"masked the existence of a virtually permanent minority who played the key role in organizing discontent.\" He also suggests that mobility helps people see that others are in similar conditions. He thinks the struggle of European workers for political democracy, even while they sought economic equality, made them class-conscious. American workers, however, had already gained political democracy by the 1830s, and so their economic battles could be taken over by political parties that blurred class lines.\n\nEven this might not have stopped labor militancy and the rise of class consciousness, Dawley says, if not for the fact that \"an entire generation was sidetracked in the 1860's because of the Civil War.\" Northern wage earners who rallied to the Union cause became allied with their employers. National issues took over from class issues: \"At a time when scores of industrial communities like Lynn were seething with resistance to industrialism, national politics were preoccupied with the issues of war and reconstruction.\" And on these issues the political parties took positions, offered choices, obscured the fact that the political system itself and the wealthy classes it represented were responsible for the problems they now offered to solve.\n\nClass-consciousness was overwhelmed during the Civil War, both North and South, by military and political unity in the crisis of war. That unity was weaned by rhetoric and enforced by arms. It was a war proclaimed as a war for liberty, but working people would be attacked by soldiers if they dared to strike, Indians would be massacred in Colorado by the U.S. army, and those daring to criticize Lincoln's policies would be put in jail without trial-perhaps thirty thousand political prisoners.\n\nStill, there were signs in both sections of dissent from that unity- anger of poor against rich, rebellion against the dominant political and economic forces.\n\nIn the North, the war brought high prices for food and the necessities of life. Prices of milk, eggs, cheese were up 60 to 100 percent for families that had not been able to pay the old prices. One historian (Emerson Fite, Social and Industrial Conditions in the North During the Civil War) described the war situation: \"Employers were won't to appropriate to themselves all or nearly all of the profits accruing from the higher prices, without being willing to grant to the employees a fair share of these profits through the medium of higher wages.\"\n\nThere were strikes all over the country during the war. The Springfield Republican in 1863 said that \"the workmen of almost every branch of trade have had their strikes within the last few months,\" and the San Francisco Evening Bulletin said \"striking for higher wages is now the rage among the working people of San Francisco.\" Unions were being formed as a result of these strikes. Philadelphia shoemakers in 1863 announced that high prices made organization imperative.\n\nThe headline in Fincher's Trades' Review of November 21, 1863, \"THE REVOLUTION IN NEW YORK,\" was an exaggeration, but its list of labor activities was impressive evidence of the hidden resentments of the poor during the war:\n\nThe upheaval of the laboring masses in New York has startled the capitalists of that city and vicinity.. . .\n\nThe machinists are making a hold stand... . We publish their appeal in another column.\n\nThe City Railroad employees struck for higher wages, and made the whole population, for a few days, \"ride on Shank's mare.\"...\n\nThe house painters of Brooklyn have taken steps to counteract the attempt of the bosses to reduce their wages.\n\nThe house carpenters, we are informed, are pretty well \"out of the woods\" and their demands are generally complied with.\n\nThe safe-makers have obtained an increase of wages, and are now at work.\n\nThe lithographic printers are making efforts to secure better pay for their labor.\n\nThe workmen on the iron clads are yet holding out against the contractors. ...\n\nThe window shade painters have obtained an advance of 25 percent.\n\nThe horse shoers are fortifying themselves against the evils of money and trade fluctuations.\n\nThe sash and blind-makers are organized and ask their employers for 25 percent additional.\n\nThe sugar packers are remodelling their list of prices.\n\nThe glass cutters demand 15 percent to present wages.\n\nImperfect as we confess our list to be, there is enough to convince the reader that the social revolution now working its way through the land must succeed, if workingmen are only true to each other.\n\nThe stage drivers, to the number of 800, are on a strike.. . .\n\nThe workingmen of Boston are not behind.... in addition to the strike at the Charlestown Navy Yard. .. .\n\nThe riggers are on a strike. .. .\n\nAt this writing it is rumored, says the Boston Post, that a general strike is contemplated among the workmen in the iron establishments at South Boston, and other parts of the city.\n\nThe war brought many women into shops and factories, often over the objections of men who saw them driving wage scales down. In New York City, girls sewed umbrellas from six in the morning to midnight, earning $3 a week, from which employers deducted the cost of needles and thread. Girls who made cotton shirts received twenty-four cents for a twelve-hour day. In late 1863, New York working women held a mass meeting to find a solution to their problems. A Working Women's Protective Union was formed, and there was a strike of women umbrella workers in New York and Brooklyn. In Providence, Rhode Island, a Ladies Cigar Makers Union was organized.\n\nAll together, by 1864, about 200,000 workers, men and women, were in trade unions, forming national unions in some of the trades, putting out labor newspapers.\n\nUnion troops were used to break strikes. Federal soldiers were sent to Cold Springs, New York, to end a strike at a gun works where workers wanted a wage increase. Striking machinists and tailors in St. Louis were forced back to work by the army. In Tennessee, a Union general arrested and sent out of the state two hundred striking mechanics. When engineers on the Reading Railroad struck, troops broke that strike, as they did with miners in Tioga County, Pennsylvania.\n\nWhite workers of the North were not enthusiastic about a war which seemed to be fought for the black slave, or for the capitalist, for anyone but them. They worked in semislave conditions themselves. They thought the war was profiting the new class of millionaires. They saw defective guns sold to the army by contractors, sand sold as sugar, rye sold as coffee, shop sweepings made into clothing and blankets, paper-soled shoes produced for soldiers at the front, navy ships made of rotting timbers, soldiers' uniforms that fell apart in the rain.\n\nThe Irish working people of New York, recent immigrants, poor, looked upon with contempt by native Americans, could hardly find sympathy for the black population of the city who competed with them for jobs as longshoremen, barbers, waiters, domestic servants. Blacks, pushed out of these jobs, often were used to break strikes. Then came the war, the draft, the chance of death. And the Conscription Act of 1863 provided that the rich could avoid military service: they could pay $300 or buy a substitute. In the summer of 1863, a \"Song of the Conscripts\" was circulated by the thousands in New York and other cities. One stanza:\n\nWe're coming, Father Abraham, three hundred thousand more\nWe leave our homes and firesides with bleeding hearts and sore\nSince poverty has been our crime, we bow to thy decree;\nWe are the poor and have no wealth to purchase liberty.\n\nWhen recruiting for the army began in July 1863, a mob in New York wrecked the main recruiting station. Then, for three days, crowds of white workers marched through the city, destroying buildings, factories, streetcar lines, homes. The draft riots were complex-antiblack, antirich, anti- Republican. From an assault on draft headquarters, the rioters went on to attacks on wealthy homes, then to the murder of blacks. They marched through the streets, forcing factories to close, recruiting more members of the mob. They set the city's colored orphan asylum on fire. They shot, burned, and hanged blacks they found in the streets. Many people were thrown into the rivers to drown.\n\nOn the fourth day, Union troops returning from the Battle of Gettysburg came into the city and stopped the rioting. Perhaps four hundred people were killed. No exact figures have ever been given, but the number of lives lost was greater than in any other incident of domestic violence in American history.\n\nJoel Tyler Headley (The Great Riots of New York) gave a graphic day-by-day description of what happened:\n\nSecond Day.... the fire-bells continually ringing increased the terror that every hour became more widespread. Especially was this true of the negro population. ... At one time there lay at the corner of Twenty-seventh Street and Seventh Avenue the dead body of a negro, stripped nearly naked, and around it a collection of Irishmen, absolutely dancing or shouting like wild Indians.... A negro barber's shop was next attacked, and the torch applied to it. A negro lodging house in the same street next received the visit of these furies, and was soon a mass of ruins. Old men, seventy years of age, and young children, too young to comprehend what it all meant, were cruelly beaten and killed....\n\nThere were antidraft riots-not so prolonged or bloody-in other northern cities: Newark, Troy, Boston, Toledo, Evansville. In Boston the dead were Irish workers attacking an armory, who were fired on by soldiers.\n\nIn the South, beneath the apparent unity of the white Confederacy, there was also conflict. Most whites-two-thirds of them-did not own slaves. A few thousand families made up the plantation elite. The Federal Census of 1850 showed that a thousand southern families at the top of the economy received about $50 million a year income, while all the other families, about 660,000, received about $60 million a year.\n\nMillions of southern whites were poor farmers, living in shacks or abandoned outhouses, cultivating land so bad the plantation owners had abandoned it. Just before the Civil War, in Jackson, Mississippi, slaves working in a cotton factory received twenty cents a day for board, and white workers at the same factory received thirty cents. A newspaper in North Carolina in August 1855 spoke of \"hundreds of thousands of working class families existing upon half-starvation from year to year.\"\n\nBehind the rebel battle yells and the legendary spirit of the Confederate army, there was much reluctance to fight. A sympathetic historian of the South, E. Merton Coulter, asked: \"Why did the Confederacy fail? The forces leading to defeat were many but they may be summed up in this one fact: The people did not will hard enough and long enough to win.\" Not money or soldiers, but will power and morale were decisive.\n\nThe conscription law of the Confederacy too provided that the rich could avoid service. Did Confederate soldiers begin to suspect they were fighting for the privileges of an elite they could never belong to? In April 1863, there was a bread riot in Richmond. That summer, draft riots occurred in various southern cities. In September, a bread riot in Mobile, Alabama. Georgia Lee Tatum, in her study Disloyalty in the Confederacy, writes: \"Before the end of the war, there was much disaffection in every state, and many of the disloyal had formed into bands-in some states into well-organized, active societies.\"\n\nThe Civil War was one of the first instances in the world of modern warfare: deadly artillery shells, Gatling guns, bayonet charges-combining the indiscriminate killing of mechanized war with hand- to-hand combat. The nightmare scenes could not adequately be described except in a novel like Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage. In one charge before Petersburg, Virginia, a regiment of 850 Maine soldiers lost 632 men in half an hour. It was a vast butchery, 623,000 dead on both sides, and 471,000 wounded, over a million dead and wounded in a country whose population was 30 million.\n\nNo wonder that desertions grew among southern soldiers as the war went on. As for the Union army, by the end of the war, 200,000 had deserted.\n\nStill, 600,000 had volunteered for the Confederacy in 1861, and many in the Union army were volunteers. The psychology of patriotism, the lure of adventure, the aura of moral crusade created by political leaders, worked effectively to dim class resentments against the rich and powerful, and turn much of the anger against \"the enemy.\" As Edmund Wilson put it in Patriotic Gore (written after World War II):\n\nWe have seen, in our most recent wars, how a divided and arguing public opinion may be converted overnight into a national near-unanimity, an obedient flood of energy which will carry the young to destruction and overpower any effort to stem it. The unanimity of men at war is like that of a school of fish, which will swerve, simultaneously and apparently without leadership, when the shadow of an enemy appears, or like a sky darkening flight of grass-hoppers, which, also all compelled by one impulse, will descend to consume the crops.\n\nUnder the deafening noise of the war, Congress was passing and Lincoln was signing into law a whole series of acts to give business interests what they wanted, and what the agrarian South had blocked before secession. The Republican platform of 1860 had been a clear appeal to businessmen. Now Congress in 1861 passed the Morrill Tariff. This made foreign goods more expensive, allowed American manufacturers to raise their prices, and forced American consumers to pay more.\n\nThe following year a Homestead Act was passed. It gave 160 acres of western land, unoccupied and publicly owned, to anyone who would cultivate it for five years. Anyone willing to pay $1.25 an acre could buy a homestead. Few ordinary people had the $200 necessary to do this; speculators moved in and bought up much of the land. Homestead land added up to 50 million acres. But during the Civil War, over 100 million acres were given by Congress and the President to various railroads, free of charge. Congress also set up a national bank, putting the government into partnership with the banking interests, guaranteeing their profits.\n\nWith strikes spreading, employers pressed Congress for help. The Contract Labor Law of 1864 made it possible for companies to sign contracts with foreign workers whenever the workers pledged to give twelve months of their wages to pay the cost of emigration. This gave the employers during the Civil war not only very cheap labor, but strikebreakers.\n\nMore important, perhaps, than the federal laws passed by Congress for the benefit of the rich were the day-to-day operations of local and state laws for the benefit of landlords and merchants. Gustavus Myers, in his History of the Great American Fortunes, comments on this in discussing the growth of the Astor family's fortune, much of it out of the rents of New York tenements:\n\nIs it not murder when, compelled by want, people are forced to fester in squalid, germ-filled tenements, where the sunlight never enters and where disease finds a prolific breeding-place? Untold thousands went to their deaths in these unspeakable places. Yet, so far as the' Law was concerned, the rents collected by the Astors, as well as by other landlords, were honestly made. The whole institution of Law saw nothing out of the way in these conditions, and very significantly so, because, to repeat over and over again, Law did not represent the ethics or ideals of advanced humanity; it exactly reflected, as a pool reflects the sky, the demands and self-interest of the growing propertied classes... .\n\nIn the thirty years leading up to the Civil War, the law was increasingly interpreted in the courts to suit the capitalist development of the country. Studying this, Morton Horwitz (The Transformation of American Law) points out that the English commonlaw was no longer holy when it stood in the way of business growth. Mill owners were given the legal right to destroy other people's property by flood to carry on their business. The law of \"eminent domain\" was used to take farmers' land and give it to canal companies or railroad companies as subsidies. Judgments for damages against businessmen were taken out of the hands of juries, which were unpredictable, and given to judges. Private settlement of disputes by arbitration was replaced by court settlements, creating more dependence on lawyers, and the legal profession gained in importance. The ancient idea of a fair price for goods gave way in the courts to the idea of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware), thus throwing generations of consumers from that time on to the mercy of businessmen.\n\nThat contract law was intended to discriminate against working people and for business is shown by Horwitz in the following example of the early nineteenth century: the courts said that if a worker signed a contract to work for a year, and left before the year was up, he was not entitled to any wages, even for the time he had worked. But the courts at the same time said that if a building business broke a contract, it was entitled to be paid for whatever had been done up to that point.\n\nThe pretense of the law was that a worker and a railroad made a contract with equal bargaining power. Thus, a Massachusetts judge decided an injured worker did not deserve compensation, because, by signing the contract, he was agreeing to take certain risks. \"The circle was completed; the law had come simply to ratify those forms of inequality that the market system produced.\"\n\nIt was a time when the law did not even pretend to protect working people-as it would in the next century. Health and safety laws were either nonexistent or unenforced. In Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1860, on a winter day, the Pemberton Mill collapsed, with nine hundred workers inside, mostly women. Eighty-eight died, and although there was evidence that the structure had never been adequate to support the heavy machinery inside, and that this was known to the construction engineer, a jury found \"no evidence of criminal intent.\"\n\nHorwitz sums up what happened in the courts of law by the time of the Civil War:\n\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century the legal system had been reshaped to the advantage of men of commerce and industry at the expense of farmers, workers, consumers, and other less powerful groups within the society. ... it actively promoted a legal redistribution of wealth against the weakest groups in the society.\n\nIn premodern times, the maldistribution of wealth was accomplished by simple force. In modern times, exploitation is disguised-it is accomplished by law, which has the look of neutrality and fairness. By the time of the Civil War, modernization was well under way in the United States.\n\nWith the war over, the urgency of national unity slackened, and ordinary people could turn more to their daily lives, their problems of survival. The disbanded armies now were in the streets, looking for work. In June 1865, Fincher's Trades' Review reported: \"As was to be expected, the returned soldiers are flooding the streets already, unable to find employment.\"\n\nThe cities to which the soldiers returned were death traps of typhus, tuberculosis, hunger, and fire. In New York, 100,000 people lived in the cellars of the slums; 12,000 women worked in houses of prostitution to keep from starving; the garbage, lying 2 feet deep in the streets, was alive with rats. In Philadelphia, while the rich got fresh water from the Schuylkill River, everyone else drank from the Delaware, into which 13 million gallons of sewage were dumped every day. In the Great Chicago Fire in 1871, the tenements fell so fast, one after another, that people said it sounded like an earthquake.\n\nA movement for the eight-hour day began among working people after the war, helped by the formation of the first national federation of unions, the National Labor Union. A three-month strike of 100,000 workers in New York won the eight-hour day, and at a victory celebration in June 1872, 150,000 workers paraded through the city. The New York Times wondered what proportion of the strikers were \"thoroughly American.\"\n\nWomen, brought into industry during the war, organized unions: cigarmakers, tailoresses, umbrella sewers, capmakers, printers, laundresses, shoeworkers. They formed the Daughters of St, Crispin, and succeeded in getting the Cigarmakers Union and the National Typographical Union to admit women for the first time. A woman named Gussie Lewis of New York became corresponding secretary of the Typographers' Union. But the cigarmakers and typographers were only two of the thirty-odd national unions, and the general attitude toward women was one of exclusion.\n\nIn 1869, the collar laundresses of Troy, New York, whose work involved standing \"over the wash tub and over the ironing table with furnaces on either side, the thermometer averaging 100 degrees, for wages averaging $2.00 and $3.00 a week\" (according to a contemporary account), went on strike. Their leader was Kate Mullaney, second vice-president of the National Labor Union. Seven thousand people came to a rally to support them, and the women organized a cooperative collar and cuff factory to provide work and keep the strike going. But as time went on, outside support dwindled. The employers began making a paper collar, requiring fewer laundresses. The strike failed.\n\nThe dangers of mill work intensified efforts to organize. Work often went on around the clock. At a mill in Providence, Rhode Island, fire broke out one night in 1866. There was panic among the six hundred workers, mostly women, and many jumped to their deaths from upper-story windows.\n\nIn Fall River, Massachusetts, women weavers formed a union independent of the men weavers. They refused to take a 10 percent wage cut that the men had accepted, struck against three nulls, won the men's support, and brought to a halt 3,500 looms and 156,000 spindles, with 3,200 workers on strike. But their children needed food; they had to return to work, signing an \"iron-clad oath\" (later called a \"yellow-dog contract\") not to join a union.\n\nBlack workers at this time found the National Labor Union reluctant to organize them. So they formed their own unions and carried on their own strikes-like the levee workers in Mobile, Alabama, in 1867, Negro longshoremen in Charleston, dockworkers in Savannah. This probably stimulated the National Labor Union, at its 1869 convention, to resolve to organize women and Negroes, declaring that it recognized \"neither color nor sex on the question of the rights of labor.\" A journalist wrote about the remarkable signs of racial unity at this convention:\n\nWhen a native Mississippian and an ex-confederate officer, in addressing a convention, refers to a colored delegate who has preceded him as \"the gentleman from Georgia\" .. . when an ardent and Democratic partisan (from New York at that) declares with a rich Irish brogue that he asks for himself no privilege as a mechanic or as a citizen that he is not willing to concede to every other man, white or black ... then one may indeed be warranted in asserting that time works curious changes.. ..\n\nMost unions, however, still kept Negroes out, or asked them to form their own locals.\n\nThe National Labor Union began to expend more and more of its energy on political issues, especially currency reform, a demand for the issuance of paper money: Greenbacks. As it became less an organizer of labor struggles, and more a lobbyist with Congress, concerned with voting, it lost vitality. An observer of the labor scene, F. A. Sorge, wrote in 1870 to Karl Marx in England: \"The National Labor Union, which had such brilliant prospects in the beginning of its career, was poisoned by Greenbackism and is slowly but surely dying.\"\n\nPerhaps unions could not easily see the limits to legislative reform in an age where such reform laws were being passed for the first time, and hopes were high. The Pennsylvania legislature in 1869 passed a mine safety act providing for the \"regulation and ventilation of mines, and for the protection of the lives of the miners.\" Only after a hundred years of continuing accidents in those mines would it be understood how insufficient those words were-except as a device to calm anger among miners.\n\nIn 1873, another economic crisis devastated the nation. It was the closing of the banking house of Jay Cooke-the banker who during the war had made $3 million a year in commissions alone for selling government bonds-that started the wave of panic. While President Grant slept in Cooke's Philadelphia mansion on September 18, 1873, the banker rode downtown to lock the door on his bank. Now people could not pay loans on mortgages: live thousand businesses closed and put their workers on the street.\n\nIt was more than Jay Cooke. The crisis was built into a system which was chaotic in its nature, in which only the very rich were secure. It was a system of periodic crisis-1837, 1857, 1873 (and later: 1893, 1907, 1919, 1929)-that wiped out small businesses and brought cold, hunger, and death to working people while the fortunes of the Astors, Vanderbilts, Rockefellers, Morgans, kept growing through war and peace, crisis and recovery. During the 1873 crisis, Carnegie was capturing the steel market, Rockefeller was wiping out his competitors in oil.\n\n\"LABOR DEPRESSION IN BROOKLYN\" was the headline in the New York Herald in November 1873. It listed closings and layoffs: a felt-skirt factory, a picture-frame factory, a glass-cutting establishment, a steelworks factory. And women's trades: milliners, dressmakers, shoe-binders.\n\nThe depression continued through the 1870s. During the first three months of 1874, ninety thousand workers, almost half of them women, had to sleep in police stations in New York. They were known as \"revolvers\" because they were limited to one or two days a month in any one police station, and so had to keep moving. All over the country, people were evicted from their homes. Many roamed the cities looking for food.\n\nDesperate workers tried to get to Europe or to South America. In 1878, the SS Metropolis, filled with laborers, left the United States for South America and sank with all aboard. The New York Tribune reported: \"One hour after the news that the ship had gone down arrived in Philadelphia, the office of Messrs. Collins was besieged by hundreds of hunger-bitten, decent men, begging for the places of the drowned laborers.\"\n\nMass meeting and demonstrations of the unemployed took place all over the country. Unemployed councils were set up. A meeting in New York at Cooper Institute in late 1873, organized by trade unions and the American seed on of the First International (founded in 1864 in Europe by Marx and others), drew a huge crowd, overflowing into the streets. The meeting asked that before bills became law they should be approved by a public vote, that no individual should own more than $30,000; they asked for an eight-hour day. Also:\n\nWhereas, we are industrious, law-abiding citizens, who had paid all taxes and given support and allegiance to the government,\n\nResolved, that we will in this time of need supply ourselves and our families with proper food and shelter and we will send our bills to the City treasury, to be liquidated, until we shall obtain work... .\n\nIn Chicago, twenty thousand unemployed marched through the streets to City Hall asking \"bread for the needy, clothing for the naked, and houses for the homeless.\" Actions like this resulted in some relief for about ten thousand families.\n\nIn January 1874, in New York City, a huge parade of workers, kept by the police from approaching City Hall, went to Tompkins Square, and there were told by the police they couldn't have the meeting. They stayed, and the police attacked. One newspaper reported:\n\nPolice clubs rose and fell. Women and children ran screaming in all directions. Many of them were trampled underfoot in the stampede for the gates. In the street bystanders were ridden down and mercilessly clubbed by mounted officers.\n\nStrikes were called in the textile mills of Fall River, Massachusetts. In the anthracite coal district of Pennsylvania, there was the \"long strike,\" where Irish members of a society called the Ancient Order of Hibernians were accused of acts of violence, mostly on the testimony of a detective planted among the miners. These were the \"Molly Maguires.\" They were tried and found guilty. Philip Foner believes, after a study of the evidence, that they were framed because they were labor organizers. He quotes the sympathetic Irish World, which called them \"intelligent men whose direction gave strength to the resistance of the miners to the inhuman reduction of their wages.\" And he points to the Miners' Journal, put out by the coal mine owners, which referred to the executed men this way: \"What did they do? Whenever prices of labor did not suit them they organized and proclaimed a strike.\"\n\nAll together, nineteen were executed, according to Anthony Bimba (The Molly Maguires). There were scattered protests from workingmen's organizations, but no mass movement that could stop the executions.\n\nIt was a time when employers brought in recent immigrants-desperate for work, different from the strikers in language and culture-to break strikes. Italians were imported into the bituminous coal area around Pittsburgh in 1874 to replace striking miners. This led to the killing of three Italians, to trials in which jurors of the community exonerated the strikers, and bitter feelings between Italians and other organized workers.\n\nThe centennial year of 1876-one hundred years after the Declaration of Independence-brought forth a number of new declarations (reproduced by Philip Foner in We the Other People). Whites and blacks, separately, expressed their disillusionment. A \"Negro Declaration of Independence\" denounced the Republican party on which they had once depended to gain full freedom, and proposed independent political action by colored voters. And the Workingmen's party of Illinois, at a July 4 celebration organized by German socialists in Chicago, said in its Declaration of Independence:\n\nThe present system has enabled capitalists to make laws in their own interests to the injury and oppression of the workers.\n\nIt has made the name Democracy, for which our forefathers fought and died, a mockery and a shadow, by giving to property an unproportionate amount of representation and control over Legislation.\n\nIt has enabled capitalists ... to secure government aid, inland grants and money loans, to selfish railroad corporations, who, by monopolizing the means of transportation are enabled to swindle both the producer and the consumer.. ..\n\nIt has presented to the world the absurd spectacle of a deadly civil war for the abolition of negro slavery while the majority of the white population, those who have created all the wealth of the nation, are compelled to suffer under a bondage infinitely more galling and humiliating. . ..\n\nIt has allowed the capitalists, as a class, to appropriate annually 5/6 of the entire production of the country. . . .\n\nIt has therefore prevented mankind from fulfilling their natural destinies on earth-crushed out ambition, prevented marriages or caused false and unnatural ones-has shortened human life, destroyed morals and fostered crime, corrupted judges, ministers, and statesmen, shattered confidence, love and honor among men. and made life a selfish, merciless struggle for existence instead of a noble and generous struggle for perfection, in which equal advantages should he given to all, and human lives relieved from an unnatural and degrading competition for bread.. ..\n\nWe, therefore, the representatives of the workers of Chicago, in mass meeting assembled, do solemnly publish and declare .. .\n\nThat we are absolved from all allegiance to the existing political parties of this country, and that as free and independent producers we shall endeavor to acquire the full power to make our own laws, manage our own production, and govern ourselves, acknowledging no rights without duties, no duties without rights. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the assistance and cooperation of all workingmen, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our means, and our sacred honor.\n\nIn the year 1877, the country was in the depths of the Depression. That summer, in the hot cities where poor families lived in cellars and drank infested water, the children became sick in large numbers. The New York Times wrote: \"... already the cry of the dying children begins to be heard. ... Soon, to judge from the past, there will be a thousand deaths of infants per week in the city.\" That first week in July, in Baltimore, where all liquid sewage ran through the streets, 139 babies died.\n\nThat year there came a series of tumultuous strikes by railroad workers in a dozen cities; they shook the nation as no labor conflict in its history had done.\n\nIt began with wage cuts on railroad after railroad, in tense situations of already low wages ($1.75 a day for brakemen working twelve hours), scheming and profiteering by the railroad companies, deaths and injuries among the workers-loss of hands, feet, fingers, the crushing of men between cars.\n\nAt the Baltimore & Ohio station in Martinsburg, West Virginia, workers determined to tight the wage cut went on strike, uncoupled the engines, ran them into the roundhouse, and announced no more trains would leave Martinsburg until the 10 percent cut was canceled. A crowd of support gathered, too many for the local police to disperse. B. & O. officials asked the governor for military protection, and he sent in militia. A train tried to get through, protected by the militia, and a striker, trying to derail it, exchanged gunfire with a militiaman attempting to stop him. The striker was shot in his thigh and his arm. His arm was amputated later that day, and nine days later he died.\n\nSix hundred freight trains now jammed the yards at Martinsburg. The West Virginia governor applied to newly elected President Rutherford Hayes for federal troops, saying the state militia was insufficient. In fact, the militia was not totally reliable, being composed of many railroad workers. Much of the U.S. army was tied up in Indian battles in the West. Congress had not appropriated money for the army yet, but J. P. Morgan, August Belmont, and other bankers now offered to lend money to pay army officers (but no enlisted men). Federal troops arrived in Martinsburg, and the freight cars began to move.\n\nIn Baltimore, a crowd of thousands sympathetic to the railroad strikers surrounded the armory of the National Guard, which had been called out by the governor at the request of the B. & O. Railroad. The crowd hurled rocks, and the soldiers came out, firing. The streets now became the scene of a moving, bloody battle. When the evening was over, ten men or boys were dead, more badly wounded, one soldier wounded. Half of the 120 troops quit and the rest went on to the train depot, where a crowd of two hundred smashed the engine of a passenger train, tore up tracks, and engaged the militia again in a running battle.\n\nBy now, fifteen thousand people surrounded the depot. Soon, three passenger cars, the station platform, and a locomotive were on fire. The governor asked for federal troops, and Hayes responded. Five hundred soldiers arrived and Baltimore quieted down.\n\nThe rebellion of the railroad workers now spread. Joseph Dacus, then editor of the St. Louis Republican, reported:\n\nStrikes were occurring almost every hour. The great State of Pennsylvania was in an uproar; New Jersey was afflicted by a paralyzing dread; New York was mustering an army of militia; Ohio was shaken from Lake Erie to the Ohio River; Indiana rested in a dreadful suspense. Illinois, and especially its great metropolis, Chicago, apparently hung on the verge of a vortex of confusion and tumult. St. Louis had already felt the effect of the premonitory shocks of the uprising. . . .\n\nThe strike spread to Pittsburgh and the Pennsylvania Railroad. Again, it happened outside the regular union, pent-up anger exploding without plan. Robert Bruce, historian of the 1877 strikes, writes (1877: Year of Violence) about a flagman named Gus Harris. Harris refused to go out on a \"double- header,\" a train with two locomotives carrying a double length of cars, to which railroaders had objected because it required fewer workers and made the brakemen's work more dangerous:\n\nThe decision was his own, not part of a concerted plan or a general understanding. Had he lain awake that past night, listening to the rain, asking himself if he dared quit, wondering if anyone would join him, weighing the chances? Or had he simply risen to a breakfast that did not fill him, seen his children go off shabby and half-fed, walked brooding through the damp morning and then yielded impulsively to stored-up rage?\n\nWhen Harris said he would not go, the rest of the crew refused too. The strikers now multiplied, joined by young boys and men from the mills and factories (Pittsburgh had 33 iron mills, 73 glass factories, 29 oil refineries, 158 coal mines). The freight trains stopped moving out of the city. The Trainman's Union had not organized this, but it moved to take hold, called a meeting, invited \"all workingmen to make common cause with their brethren on the railroad.\"\n\nRailroad and local officials decided that the Pittsburgh militia would not kill their fellow townsmen, and urged that Philadelphia troops be called in. By now two thousand cars were idle in Pittsburgh. The Philadelphia troops came and began to clear the track. Rocks flew. Gunfire was exchanged between crowd and troops. At least ten people were killed, all workingmen, most of them not railroaders.\n\nNow the whole city rose in anger. A crowd surrounded the troops, who moved into a roundhouse. Railroad cars were set afire, buildings began to burn, and finally the roundhouse itself, the troops marching out of it to safety. There was more gunfire, the Union Depot was set afire, thousands looted the freight cars. A huge grain elevator and a small section of the city went up in flames. In a few days, twenty-four people had been killed (including four soldiers). Seventy-nine buildings had been burned to the ground. Something like a general strike was developing in Pittsburgh: mill workers, car workers, miners, laborers, and the employees at the Carnegie steel plant.\n\nThe entire National Guard of Pennsylvania, nine thousand men, was called out. But many of the companies couldn't move as strikers in other towns held up traffic. In Lebanon, Pennsylvania, one National Guard company mutinied and marched through an excited town. In Altoona, troops surrounded by rioters, immobilized by sabotaged engines, surrendered, stacked arms, fraternized with the crowd, and then were allowed to go home, to the accompaniment of singing by a quartet in an all-Negro militia company.\n\nIn Harrisburg, the state capital, as at so many places, teenagers made up a large part of the crowd, which included some Negroes. Philadelphia militia, on their way home from Altoona, shook hands with the crowd, gave up their guns, marched like captives through the streets, were fed at a hotel and sent home. The crowd agreed to the mayor's request to deposit the surrendered guns at the city hall. Factories and shops were idle. After some looting, citizens' patrols kept order in the streets through the night.\n\nWhere strikers did not manage to take control, as in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, it may well have been because of disunity. The spokesman of the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company in that town wrote: \"The men have no organization, and there is too much race jealousy existing among them to permit them to form one.\"\n\nIn Reading, Pennsylvania, there was no such problem-90 percent were native-born, the rest mostly German. There, the railroad was two months behind in paying wages, and a branch of the Trainman's Union was organized. Two thousand people gathered, while men who had blackened their faces with coal dust set about methodically tearing up tracks, jamming switches, derailing cars, setting fire to cabooses and also to a railroad bridge.\n\nA National Guard company arrived, fresh from duty at the execution of the Molly Maguires. The crowd threw stones, fired pistols. The soldiers fired into the crowd. \"Six men lay dead in the twilight,\" Bruce reports, \"a fireman and an engineer formerly employed in the Reading, a carpenter, a huckster, a rolling-mill worker, a laborer.... A policeman and another man lay at the point of death.\" Five of the wounded died. The crowd grew angrier, more menacing. A contingent of soldiers announced it would not fire, one soldier saying he would rather put a bullet through the president of Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron. The 16th Regiment of the Morristown volunteers stacked its arms. Some militia threw their guns away and gave their ammunition to the crowd. When the Guardsmen left for home, federal troops arrived and took control, and local police began making arrests.\n\nMeanwhile the leaders of the big railway brotherhoods, the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, the Brotherhood of Engineers, disavowed the strike. There was talk in the press of \"communistic ideas . . . widely entertained ... by the workmen employed in mines and factories and by the railroads.\"\n\nIn fact, there was a very active Workingmen's party in Chicago, with several thousand members, most of them immigrants from Germany and Bohemia. It was connected with the First International in Europe. In the midst of the railroad strikes, that summer of 1877, it called a rally. Six thousand people came and demanded nationalization of the railroads. Albert Parsons gave a fiery speech. He was from Alabama, had fought in the Confederacy during the Civil War, married a brown-skinned woman of Spanish and Indian blood, worked as a typesetter, and was one of the best English- speaking orators the Workingmen's party had.\n\nThe next day, a crowd of young people, not especially connected with the rally of the evening before, began moving through the railroad yards, closed down the freights, went to the factories, called out the mill workers, the stockyard workers, the crewmen on the Lake Michigan ships, closed down the brickyards and lumberyards. That day also, Albert Parsons was fired from his job with the Chicago Times and declared blacklisted.\n\nThe police attacked the crowds. The press reported: \"The sound of clubs falling on skulls was sickening for the first minute, until one grew accustomed to it. A rioter dropped at every whack, it seemed, for the ground was covered with them.\" Two companies of U.S. infantry arrived, joining National Guardsmen and Civil War veterans. Police fired into a surging crowd, and three men were killed.\n\nThe next day, an armed crowd of five thousand fought the police. The police fired again and again, and when it was over, and the dead were counted, they were, as usual, workingmen and boys, eighteen of them, their skulls smashed by clubs, their vital organs pierced by gunfire.\n\nThe one city where the Workingmen's party clearly led the rebellion was St. Louis, a city of flour mills, foundries, packing houses, machine shops, breweries, and railroads. Here, as elsewhere, there were wage cuts on the railroads. And here there were perhaps a thousand members of the Workingmen's party, many of them bakers, coopers, cabinetmakers, cigarmakers, brewery workers. The party was organized in four sections, by nationality: German, English, French, Bohemian.\n\nAll four sections took a ferry across the Mississippi to join a mass meeting of railroad men in East St. Louis. One of their speakers told the meeting: \"All you have to do, gentlemen, for you have the numbers, is to unite on one idea-that the workingmen shall rule the country. What man makes, belongs to him, and the workingmen made this country.\" Railroaders in East St. Louis declared themselves on strike. The mayor of East St. Louis was a European immigrant, himself an active revolutionist as a youth, and railroad men's votes dominated the city.\n\nIn St. Louis, itself, the Workingmen's party called an open-air mass meeting to which five thousand people came. The party was clearly in the leadership of the strike. Speakers, excited by the crowd, became more militant: \". . . capital has changed liberty into serfdom, and we must fight or die.\" They called for nationalization of the railroads, mines, and all industry.\n\nAt another huge meeting of the Workingmen's party a black man spoke for those who worked on the steamboats and levees. He asked: \"Will you stand to us regardless of color?\" The crowd shouted back: \"We will!\" An executive committee was set up, and it called for a general strike of all branches of industry in St. Louis.\n\nHandbills for the general strike were soon all over the city. There was a march of four hundred Negro steamboat men and roustabouts along the river, six hundred factory workers carrying a banner: \"No Monopoly- Workingmen's Rights.\" A great procession moved through the city, ending with a rally often thousand people listening to Communist speakers: \"The people are rising up in their might and declaring they will no longer submit to being oppressed by unproductive capital.\"\n\nDavid Burbank, in his book on the St. Louis events, Reign of the Rabble, writes:\n\nOnly around St. Louis did the original strike on the railroads expand into such a systematically organized and complete shut-down of all industry that the term general strike is fully justified. And only there did the socialists assume undisputed leadership.... no American city has come so close to being ruled by a workers' soviet, as we would now call it, as St. Louis, Missouri, in the year 1877.\n\nThe railroad strikes were making news in Europe. Marx wrote Engels: \"What do you think of the workers of the United States? This first explosion against the associated oligarchy of capital which has occurred since the Civil War will naturally again be suppressed, but can very well form the point of origin of an earnest workers' party. . . .\"\n\nIn New York, several thousand gathered at Tompkins Square. The tone of the meeting was moderate, speaking of \"a political revolution through the ballot box.\" And: \"If you will unite, we may have here within five years a socialistic republic. . . . Then will a lovely morning break over this darkened land.\" It was a peaceful meeting. It adjourned. The last words heard from the platform were: \"Whatever we poor men may not have, we have free speech, and no one can take it from us.\" Then the police charged, using their clubs.\n\nIn St. Louis, as elsewhere, the momentum of the crowds, the meetings, the enthusiasm, could not be sustained. As they diminished, the police, militia, and federal troops moved in and the authorities took over. The police raided the headquarters of the Workingmen's party and arrested seventy people; the executive committee that had been for a while virtually in charge of the city was now in prison. The strikers surrendered; the wage cuts remained; 131 strike leaders were fired by the Burlington Railroad.\n\nWhen the great railroad strikes of 1877 were over, a hundred people were dead, a thousand people had gone to jail, 100,000 workers had gone on strike, and the strikes had roused into action countless unemployed in the cities. More than half the freight on the nation's 75,000 miles of track had stopped running at the height of the strikes.\n\nThe railroads made some concessions, withdrew some wage cuts, but also strengthened their \"Coal and Iron Police.\" In a number of large cities, National Guard armories were built, with loopholes for guns. Robert Bruce believes the strikes taught many people of the hardships of others, and that they led to congressional railroad regulation. They may have stimulated the business unionism of the American Federation of Labor as well as the national unity of labor proposed by the Knights of Labor, and the independent labor-farmer parties of the next two decades.\n\nIn 1877, the same year blacks learned they did not have enough strength to make real the promise of equality in the Civil War, working people learned they were not united enough, not powerful enough, to defeat the combination of private capital and government power. But there was more to come.Embed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 326, "api_path": "/songs/3759187", "artist_names": "Genius", "full_title": "March 2019 Album Release Calendar by\u00a0Genius", "header_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a4199be89a393339c9b1f7681a45ebc.300x300x1.jpg", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a4199be89a393339c9b1f7681a45ebc.583x583x1.jpg", "id": 3759187, "instrumental": false, "language": "en", "lyrics_owner_id": 498964, "lyrics_state": "complete", "lyrics_updated_at": 1664022664, "path": "/Genius-march-2019-album-release-calendar-annotated", "pyongs_count": 4, "relationships_index_url": "https://genius.com/Genius-march-2019-album-release-calendar-sample", "release_date_components": {"year": 2019, "month": 3, "day": null}, "release_date_for_display": "March 2019", "release_date_with_abbreviated_month_for_display": "Mar. 2019", "song_art_image_thumbnail_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a4199be89a393339c9b1f7681a45ebc.300x300x1.jpg", "song_art_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/9a4199be89a393339c9b1f7681a45ebc.583x583x1.jpg", "stats": {"unreviewed_annotations": 0, "hot": false, "pageviews": 46657}, "title": "March 2019 Album Release Calendar", "title_with_featured": "March 2019 Album Release Calendar", "updated_by_human_at": 1664022664, "url": "https://genius.com/Genius-march-2019-album-release-calendar-annotated", "featured_artists": [], "primary_artist": {"_type": "artist", "api_path": "/artists/204611", "header_image_url": "https://images.genius.com/822a5f872a1fcfe377695dc0046c6bc6.900x176x1.jpg", "id": 204611, "image_url": "https://images.genius.com/0ca83e3130e1303a7f78ba351e3091cd.1000x1000x1.png", "index_character": "g", "is_meme_verified": true, "is_verified": true, "name": "Genius", "slug": "Genius", "url": "https://genius.com/artists/Genius", "iq": 77869}, "artist": "Genius", "lyrics": "March 2019 Album Release Calendar Lyrics3/1\n2 Chainz - Rap or Go to the League - 14/14\nA$AP TyY - Project Rockstar - 0/11\nAce Hood - Body Bag 5 - 15/15\nAlec King - Greatest Hits, Vol. 1 - EP - 6/6\nAmbar Lucid - Dreaming Lucid - 8/8\nBackyard Babies - Sliver And Gold - 10/10\nBlu & Oh No - A Long Red Hot Los Angeles Summer Night - 17/17\nBryan Adams - Shine a Light - 12/12\nDaBaby - Baby on Baby - 13/13\nDemon Hunter - Peace - 11/11\nDemon Hunter - War - 11/11\n\u200bDijon - Sci Fi 1 - EP - 7/7\nDJ Muggs x Eto - HELLS ROOF - 12/12\nDoja Cat - Amala (Deluxe Version) - 16/16\nGary Clark Jr. - This Land - 17/17\nHamza - Paradise - 17/17\nHand Habits - placeholder - 12/12\nHozier - Wasteland, Baby! - 14/14\nHugo Helmig - Juvenile - 11/11\nIn Flames - I, the Mask - 13/13\nLemaitre - Fast Lovers - EP - 6/6\nL\u00c9ON - L\u00c9ON - 10/10\nLil Skies - Shelby - 14/14\nLittle Simz - Grey Area - 10/10\nM.D.M.A (Molly) - Witchcraft - 12/12\nMansionair - Shadowboxer - 16/16\nMark Morton - Anesthetic - 10/10\nMaria Somerville - All My People - 1/7\nMarianas Trench - Phantoms - 10/10\nMike Tramp - Stray from the Flock - 10/10\nMiss Caffeina - Oh Long Johnson - 11/11\nPond - Tasmania - 10/10\nPotty Mouth - SNAFU - 10/10\nProd3am - waves - 7/7\nQueensr\u00ffche - The Verdict - 10/10\nRick Rock - Rick Rock Beats - 4/16\nRoyal Trux - White Stuff - 1/11\nSammie - EVERLASTING - 13/13\nSinceWhen - Wishing For The Worst - 3/9\nShy Girls - Bird On The Wing - 11/11\nSnapped Ankles - Stunning Luxury - 0/10\nSolange - When I Get Home - 19/19\nSoul\u00e9 - Love Cycle - EP - 2/6\nSun Kil Moon - I Also Want To Die In New Orleans - 7/7\nSundara Karma - Ulfilas' Alphabet - 13/13\nSybyr - Sybyr Singles - Vol. 2 - 12/12\nThe Cactus Blossoms - Easy Way - 10/10\nThe Japanese House - Good At Falling - 13/13\nTom Walker - What a Time to Be Alive - 13/13\nWeezer - The Black Album - 10/10\nWestkust - Westkust - 9/9\nWHATUPRG - RAUL - 7/7\nWhile She Sleeps - So What? - 11/11\nVedo - VEDO - 14/14\nXimena Sari\u00f1ana - \u00bfD\u00f3nde Bailar\u00e1n las Ni\u00f1as? - 11/11\nXYL\u00d8 - pretty sad - 6/6\n3/2\nSybyr - Sybyr Singles - Vol. 3 - 7/7\n3/3\nProd3am - 1138 & 39 - 2/2\nxMiM3RT - Whitby - 3/3\nEl Virtual & Jay Cas - EL 3 pt.

seems to be a beat now\nI can feel it my feet now\nListen here it comes again!\n[Bridge]\nThere's a band out on the highway (Band out on the highway)\nThey're high stepping into town (They're dancing

the) Sun went down in honey\n(And the) Moon came up in wine\n(You know the) Stars were spinning dizzy\nLord, the band kept us so busy\nWe forgot about the time\n\nThey're a band beyond description\nLike Jehovah's favorite choir\nPeople joining hand in hand\nWhile the music plays the band\nLord, they're setting us on fire\nCrazy rooster crowing midnight\nBalls of lightning roll along\nOld men sing about their dreams\nWomen laugh and children scream\nAnd the band keeps playing on\nKeep on dancing through the daylight (Keep on dancing through the daylight)\n(Daylight) Greet the morning air with song (Greet the morning air with song)\nNo one's noticed, but the band's all packed and gone (Packed and gone)\nWas it ever there at all? (Was it ever here at all?)\nBut they kept on dancing\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nCome on children, come on children\nCome on clap your hands\n\n[Outro]\nWell the cool breeze came on Tuesday\nAnd the

Lyrics[Intro]\nBefore we begin, thank you\nThank you, all, thank you\nThank you\nThank you\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm not a bad person (I know), I don't drink, and I don't kill\nI got no evil habits, and I probably never will\nI don't sing like Elvis Presley, I can't dance like Fred Astaire\nBut there's one thing in my favor, I'm a millionaire (that's beautiful)\n[Chorus]\nAnd I got more money than a horse has hairs\n'Cause my rich old uncle died and answered all my prayers\nWell, having all this money is going to bring me down\nIf you ain't with me honey to help me spread it around\n\n[Verse 2]\nI could get myself a nose job, I could diet for a year\nBut I'll never be Robert Redford 'cause I'm much to fond of beer\nPlease don't misunderstand me, it's not love I'm trying to buy\nIt's just I got all this here money and I'm a pretty ordinary guy\n\n[Chorus]\nAnd I got more money than a horse has hairs\n'Cause my rich old uncle died and answered all my prayers\nBut having all this money is going to bring me down\nIf you ain't with me honey to help me spread it around\n\n[Bridge]\nI don't mind if you love me for my money\nIf you love me for whatever else I got\nBut 'cept for all this stuff I'm a lonely Fort Knox\nI don't guess I'm doing all that hot\n\n[Chorus]\nBut I got more money than a horse has hairs\n'Cause my rich old uncle died and answered all my prayers\nBut having all this money is going to bring me down\nIf you ain't with me honey to help me spread it around\nYou might also like[Outro]\n(Money, money, money, money)\n(Money, money, money)\nHey you!

As of tonight you have just four days to find your inappropriately sexy costume. Whether its inappropriately sexy Barney the dinosaur or a sexy candy corn or as playboys website recently featured, and I swear to you this is true, a sexy John Oliver costume. That\u2019s right. That is an actual photo of a human woman dressed up to look like a sexy me,. And the worst thing is there\u2019s more than one photo. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever been more confused as I am right now.  Although I'm pretty sure I'm not as confused as Louis C. K is about his sexy doppelganger, that\u2019s also real. Now at this point lets agree sexy Halloween costumes have simply gone too far but it doesn\u2019t matter because we all know what Halloween is really about candy, sweet sugar treats. This Halloween, Americans will spend 2.2 billion dollars on candy. Although to be fair that does include Necco wafers which could be better classified as coagulated dust. But is it really fair to describe sugar as a treat considering we eat it all year round?\n\nNarrator: Today the average American consumes 22 teaspoons of sugar a day, three times what we need. That\u2019s equal to 75 lbs. of sugar a year for every man, woman and child in the United States.\n\nJohn Oliver: Holy Shit. 75 lbs. of sugar that\u2019s like eating Michael Cera weight in sugar every single year. And look whilst that\u2019s a little less than it was in the late nineties its still pretty incredible. So lets talk about sugar, everyone loves it and it turns out that because we are genetically programmed to.\n\nNarrator: Eric Stice a neuroscientist at the Oregon Research Institute is using functional MRI scanners to learn how our brains respond to sweetness. \u201cSugar activates our brain in a special way that is very reminiscent of drugs like cocaine.\n\nJohn Oliver: Sugar activates our brains like cocaine. And I have to say Scarface would have been a very different movie if it ended with Al Pacino sitting in a chair sugared out of his mind off baked goods saying say hello to my little Debbie, say hello. With sugar being so vicerally appealing to us its frankly no wonder that food manufacturers put it in everything. And I do mean everything.\nNarrator: About 35 percent of the sugars that Americans consume come from beverages. But were also talking about salad dressings and ketchups and you know breads and cereals and crackers and the list goes on and on even to beef and turkey jerky.\n\nJohn Oliver: We have no idea how prevalent sugar is in almost everything that we eat, look at clamato juice the original tomato cocktail with clam. One serving has 11 grams of sugar in it. So they clearly thought lets improve the taste by adding sugar instead of thinking lets improve the taste by removing the clam. And none of this would be a problem were it not for the fact that as we all know exo-sugar is probably not good for us. Both the World Health Organization and the American Heart Association have warned against eating to much of it. And some studies suggest that too much sugar can literally mess with the brain.\n\nNarrator: This rat is perfectly healthy. Put him in a vat of water and he find his way to safety every time. Now look at this guy what he has been eating is the equivalent of a North American diet complete with all the fats and sugars we regularly consume. He doesn\u2019t know where to go. His brain has been damaged.\n\nJohn Oliver: Now I don\u2019t think that rat is unable to find the island. I think that rat is saying f**k that island there\u2019s no sugar on that island and I want sugar, I want sugar! That\u2019s a Pixar movie waiting to happen by the way. But the sweetener industry is not going to take the findings of a wet confused rat lying down. There an immensely powerful 5 billion dollar industry who fought for decades to project their products health benefits. The sugar association used to claim their product was a diet aide, with ads positioning it as cure for the fats time of day, with a woman saying, if sugar can fill that hollow feeling I\u2019m all for it. Because yes nothing says I don\u2019t feel hollow inside like a woman sitting all alone eating from a bag of sugar. Now the sugar association has gotten a little more sophisticated since then, here is there current president.\n\nNarrator:  As it relates to obesity there has been plenty of science that exonerates sugar. That clarifies sugar is not, does not contribute to obesity or diabetes.\n\nJohn Oliver: Really? Sugar doesn\u2019t contribute to obesity? I'm not saying it\u2019s the only culprit but its definitely one of the key suspects. Asking what causes obesity is a bit like asking who killed a first grade class\u2019s hamster. Sure they all killed it in a way but I think we all know one of them killed it the most. I\u2019m talking to you Kevin, you killed that hamster and you drove your father away there I said it. I said it Kevin. I said it. Although to be fair, take it back, to be fair there are some scientists who dismiss the links between sugar and obesity for instance, this guy.\n\nNarrator: We take a complex situation like obesity and we say  well if gee if we just cut down sugar, sweet and beverages or added sugars in general that would solve obesity and I think that is a very slippery slope and almost certainly wrong.\n\nJohn Oliver: That is Dr. James Rippe who like clamato juice, turns out to contain quite a lot of hidden sugar himself. He\u2019s on the payroll of the corn refiners association the corn-syrup people. And at one point he was receiving a $41,000 a month retainer from them. That\u2019s half a million dollars a year. For that much money you\u2019d expect much grander claims than it doesn\u2019t link to obesity. He should be saying that my research finds that corn syrup makes you and immortal sex god with x-ray vision. And I'm not saying that corporate money distorts science but when researchers looked at two sets of weight gain studies. One group with conflicts of interests like funding from soda companies and one group that was independent. The vast majority of independent studies found direct links between, sugar, sweets and soft drinks and weight gain and obesity. And the vast majority that weren\u2019t independent found the exact opposite of that. Particularly suspicious was a research paper titled \u201cI'm so delicious\u201d attributed to a Dr. Pepper. But look regardless of whether sugar is terrible for you or the answer to all of life\u2019s problems. Shouldn\u2019t you at least get to know when its being added to your food? And to their credit, the FDA is trying to take this on.\n\nNarrator: This week the FDA is reviewing new nutritional labeling standards. And that may force food makers to not just list total sugar content but how much sugar they\u2019re adding to their products.\n\nJohn Oliver: Yes the FDA is trying to get an added sugar category onto their food labels, which is fine. As long as it doesn\u2019t distract them from forcing honeycomb cereals to reveal what in gods name their old mascot was. What the f**k was that. It looked like some kind of tumbleweeds made of murkins. But look being forced to reveal how much sugar you are adding to people\u2019s food might seem pretty mild. But there is no way the food manufacturing industry is going to let that happen. The FDA is being swarmed with letters from every conceivable product from the National Yogurt Association to the National Pizza Institute to multiple representatives of the Cranberry Industry. Now cranberries are I think we can all agree natures most disgusting berry. Cranberries taste like cherries who hate you. Cranberries taste like what a raspberry drinks before its colonoscopy. And the industry knows it, the head of the Oceanspray Company wrote to the FDA saying cranberries are naturally low in sugar, giving them a distinctly tart, astringent, even unpalatable taste. Yes that\u2019s the head of Oceanspray describing its defining ingredient as unpalatable. Its no wonder they want certain cranberry products to be exempted from the proposed added sugars declaration. Which is tantamount to begging please don\u2019t make us tell everyone how much sugar we dump on our garbage bulk berry. But the most revealing plea came from the American Beverage Association, who wrote that if there is to be an added sugar label it must be measured in grams and not teaspoons. Because teaspoons are and I quote \u201cwell teaspoons may carry an unfair negative connotation that undermines the factual nature of nutrition information\u201d. Which is ridiculous.\n\nWhat negative connotation does a f*****g teaspoon have. Unless your thinking of an annoying dude at a diner who\u2019s always trying to balance one on his nose or the fact that they used to free base heroin. But neither of those things is the teaspoons fault. The only reason the beverage people want sugar to be measured in grams instead of teaspoons is that people understand what a teaspoon is, no one understands the metric system. Which is why this proposed FDA food label is completely missing the point, because if they really want us to understand how much sugar is in our food they need to find a measurement we can immediately grasp. That is why tonight we are proposing in the spirit of Halloween the product manufacturers express their sugar content in the form of candy. Specifically, circus peanuts, the most disgusting of all the candies. They taste like an elephant ejaculated into a packet of splenda and there is more than 5 grams of sugar in each one of these horrifying things. So what we\u2019re saying to companies is this, keep loading your products up with as much sugar as you\u2019d like on the one condition that on the front of the product you display how much sugar it contains in the form of circus peanuts. So for instance, 64oz of clamato juice has 88g of sugar or 16 peanuts worth. A can of Campbell\u2019s tomato soup, 5 \u00bd peanuts, a package of 20 circus peanuts, obviously 20 circus peanuts that goes without saying. But we as consumers must demand manufactures adopt this measurement so please tweet at them using this hash tag, #showusyourpeanuts. And ask your favorite manufacturer, ask them, you ask them to whip out their peanuts and present them to you. And if they say to you we don\u2019t want to that\u2019s embarrassing nobody wants to see our peanuts they\u2019re orange and misshapen and bumpy. You tell them again show us your peanuts, do it food makers. Expose your peanuts to the world because if you our going to shove your peanuts in our mouths, the very least you can do is tell us what we\u2019re swallowing.4Embed"}, {"_type": "song",

can't slip around\nSo let's walk out through the moonlight\nAnd lay the blanket on the ground\nOh, remember how excited\nWe used to get when love was young\nThat old moon was our best buddy\nWe couldn't wait for night to come\n\nNow you know you still excite me\nI know you love me like I am\nJust once more I wish you'd love me\nOn the blanket on the ground\n\nI'll get the blanket from the bedroom\nAnd we'll go walking once again\nTo that spot down by the river\nWhere our sweet love first began\nJust because we our married\nDon't mean we can't slip around\nSo let's walk out through the moonlight\nAnd lay the blanket on the groundYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1567604", "artist_names": "Shirley Caesar", "full_title": "No

was fixing supper\nAnd he handed her a piece paper he had been writing on\nAnd after wiping her hands on an apron\nShe took it in her hands and read it\nAnd this is what it said:\n\nFor mowing the yard five dollars\nAnd for making up my own bed this week one dollar\nFor going to the store fifty cents\nAnd playing with little brother while you went shopping twenty five cents\nTaking out the trash one dollar\nAnd for getting a good report card five dollars\nAnd for raking the yard two dollars\nTotal owed one fourteen seventy five\nWell she looked at him standing there and expecting\nAnd a thousand memories flashed through her mind\nSo she picked up pen and turned the paper over and this is what she wrote:\n\nFor the 9 months I carried you holding you inside me $ no charge\nFor the nights I sat up with doctored you and prayed for you $ no charge\nFor the time and tears and the costs through the years\nThere is no charge\nWhen you add it all up the full cost of my love is $ no charge\n\nFor the nights filled with grey\nAnd the worries ahead\nFor the advice and the knowledge\nAnd the costs of your college\nThere is no charge\nFor the toys, school, and clothes\nAnd for wiping your nose\nThere's no charge son\nWhen you add it all the full cost of my love is no charge\n\nWell you know when I think about that\nI think about the day that jesus went out to calvary and gave his life as a ransom for me\nWhen I think on the words \"if any man be in christ he's a new creature\"\nI like to think about the very minute that he shedded his blood\nMy debt was paid in full\nAnd I want you to know today\nWhen you add it all up\nThe full cost of real love is no chargeYou might also likeEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/1675071",

off\nThis morning in New Jersey\nAnd yesterday in Chelsea, New York\n\nNow I'm on the train in King's Cross in London\nGoin' to Brighton\nWas up late last night watchin' TV\nAnd talkin' to Justin about the future and our families\nAnd our music and our tour\nAnd we cancelled France\nCause the ticket sales smelled like cow manure\nI'm tired baby\nI'm tired tired tired tired tired\nI'm tired baby\nI'm tired tired tired tired tired\nI'm tired baby\nI'm tired tired tired tired\nBut I just arrived in beautiful Brighton\nAnd I hear the seagulls outside\nAnd I feel inspired\n\nGonna stand up tonight\nAnd own my space in this music venue\nI believe it's called something like Concord 2\nAnd for whoever will be there tonight\nThey're surely gonna witness\nMy lack of tending to my physical fitness\n\nThe Lord says our body is the temple of the soul\nJoel Osteen says our body is the temple of the soul\nJerry Falwell said our body was the temple of the soul\nEasier said than done, baby\nWhen you're on tour at 49 years old\n\nBut I've not smoked a cigarette in all of 2016\nAnd truly I'm keeping up\nWith my 40 pushups a day exercise routine\nAnd I'm happy to be here singing for you tonight\nIn lovely Brighton\nWith Nick on bass, Scott on drums\nAnd of course my old friend Justin\nYou might also likeThank you everyone very much for comin' out tonight\nIt means a lot to us\nWe're gonna make sure the show is super tight\nOK now, here we go with our first song\nIt's for mothers and fathers\nWho have lost their daughters and their sons\n\nNow I'm on my way to Amsterdam\nOn EasyJet\nMy shirt and jacket and underwear and socks\nAre full of sweat\nTicket sales are slow\nBut hey, that's just the way it goes\nI've oversaturated my European market\nPlayin' too many shows\nPlus there's Brexit\nAnd the Brazilian-hosted Summer Olympics\nAnd your money is thin\nCause let's face it\nThese music festivals are a fuckin' racket\nBut I woke up today\nGot my suitcase and I packed it\nI hop on airplanes every day\nLike a little fuckin' bunny rabbit\n\nOh Amsterdam\nOh Am- Am- Amsterdam\nOh Amsterdam\nOh Am- Am- Amsterdam\nHere I am here I am here I am\nHere I am here I am here I am\nHere I am here I am here I am\nHere I am here I am here I am\nAnd I'm happy to be here, I truly am\nI don't smoke marijuana or cigarettes or hash\nThat's cause generally for the most part\nI'm naturally relaxed\nPretty soon we're gonna play the song I mentioned earlier\nI thank you all from the bottom of my heart for being here\nI'm glad I'm alive and healthy\nHere tonight in Holland\nNot six feet under in a tourist graveyard\nLike Mr Mojo Risin\nOr Kurt Cobain or Prince or Michael Jackson or Janis Joplin\nI'm feelin' pretty good tonight\nThank you for askin'\n\nThis song is almost over\nAnd soon you're all gonna be clapping\nThen I'm gonna sing some songs\nDo some spoken word\nAnd then a little bit of rappin'\nThen after the show\nI'll be back in my hotel room\nWackin' my bone\nAll all all all all all all alone\n\nCause I'm almost 50\nAnd that's just the way the wind blows\nYeah I'm almost 50\nAnd it's just the way the wind blows\nAnyhow, that's that\nI hope you enjoy the show\nThanks again for coming\nI hope you enjoy the show\n\nI'm leavin' Holland today\nAnd I gotta say\nI'm not gonna miss your fuckin' bikes bikes bikes\nBikes bikes bikes\nBikes bikes bikes\nBikes bikes bikes\nBikes bikes bikes\nYikes yikes yikes\nYikes yikes yikes\nHere comes another fuckin' bike\nWatch out! Fuck!\nGet out the way!\nHere comes yet another fuckin' bike\nHoly motherfucker of Christ\nHolland loves their fuckin' bikes\nThey sneak up out of nowhere so fast\nAnd they make me paranoid and totally uptight\nI'm gonna miss you Holland\nBut my God I'm not gonna miss\nThese goddamn bikes\nYikes yikes yikes\nYikes yikes yikes\nYikes yikes yikes\nYour bikes cause me serious fuckin' fright\n\nNow I'm on my way from Amsterdam by train\nTo Poland to play the Asymmetry Festival\nYeah, it's somewhere in Poland\nIt's in a city that for the life of me I can't pronounce\nPlease forgive me\nIt's called \"Rock-law\"\nOr maybe something else (WROCLAW!)\n\nLast name is Kozelek\nAnd I'm of Polish ancestry\nLast name is Kozelek\nAnd I'm of Polish ancestry\nLast name is Kozelek\nAnd I'm of Polish ancestry\nBut honestly I don't know much about my family tree\n\nBut I'm proud of where I'm from\nAnd who I've turned out to be\nI love my father and my mother\nVery very very very dearly\nDown there in the history line\nThere must be some kind of proof of my bloodline\nFor I am strong\nAnd I love Polish food\n\nI love white borscht\nI love love love love love white borscht\nAnd Polish sausage\nAnd I also love love love red borscht\nAnd I love Perogies\nAnd potato pancakes with sour cream\nAnd kielbasa and sauerkraut\nOn Easter Sunday morning\n\nAndrew Golota is from Po- Po- Po- Poland\nAndrew Golota was known for low low low low blowin'\nAndrew Golota is from (WAR- WAR- WARSAW!), Poland\nWas disqualified in his fights with Riddick Bowe\nFor low low blowin'\nBut lots of people in this world should be disqualified\nLike both people running for office in the USA\nThey tell lots of fuckin' lies\nLots of people in high places should be disqualified\nFor low blowin' entire countries\nAnd fuckin' up millions of people's lives\n\nAnyhow, I love you Po- Po- Po- Po- Poland\nBut tomorrow morning unfortunately I gotta be goin'\nOff to Copenhagen for a show\nThen I'm goin' home\nBut I'll be back next year\nIf the OFF Festival invites me\nI hope so\n\nGood night good night\nI love you love you love you Poland\nGood night good night\nI'm proud to play for you tonight in Poland\nGood night, I love you I love you I love you Po- Po- Poland\nYou are my roots and yeah I'm proud of that\nNow I gotta get goin'\n\nBack from Denmark\nAnd now I'm in O- O- Omaha\nHad lunch at Blatt\nAnd the waiter there called me boss\nHe asked \"How's your salad, boss?\"\nI said \"It's good\"\nHe said \"That's great, boss\"\n\nThen I said \"Can I get the check?\"\nAnd he said \"Sure thing, boss\"\nThen I left and I looked at the street\nAnd I walked across it\nThinkin' that salad wasn't bad\nI liked the way they tossed it\nThen I walked in the venue\nAnd poured some water into a plastic cup\nFrom the faucet\n\nNow I'm singing in front of you all\nAnd it's fall\nAnd it's nice to be here for the first time ever in Omaha\nSo far to me it's more interesting to me\nThan, say, Fairbanks, Alaska\nOver here in Omaha, Nebraska\n\nYesterday I arrived in Ar- Ar- Arizona\nHelicopters were flyin' over my hotel room\nUntil two in the morning\nI went walking earlier in the night\nTo find a Safeway\nEnded up walkin' down a street\nThat was so dark and long\nI got so afraid\nPretty soon cop cars were drivin' by\nAnd checkin' me out\nMy heart was pounding\nMan, I gotta tell you, seriously, I was freaking out\nHelicopters appeared above\nShining their beaming lights down at me\nI thought \"holy motherfucker God\nThese motherfuckers are gonna kill me\"\n\nThen I called Ben\nI said \"Whatever you do, seriously\nDon't walk down this street\"\nHe said \"Cool man\nI'll meet you in 20 minutes in the lobby\"\nThough I wanted to run\nI walked briskly instead\nDidn't want a hundred 22 calibers\nPointed at my head\n\nDrove to the Safeway\nAnd it was surrounded by cops\nI asked a cop \"Hey, what's going on in this parking lot\"\nHe said \"A guy is loose\nDon't worry about it\nWe're gonna find him eventually\"\nI said \"How do you know that guy isn't me?\"\n\nHe said \"Listen smart ass\nYou don't fit his description\"\nI said \"Hey, I could be strapped for all you know\"\nHe said \"Hey, you want me to start friskin'?\"\nI said \"Not really\"\nAnd he said \"Listen man, I'm serious\nYou better be on your way\"\nI said \"But your cop car looks so cozy\nAnd I'm enjoying this conversation\"\n\nAnyhow, it's nice to be here here here in Phoenix\nEven though the cops are complete fucking dicks\nAnyhow it's nice to be here here here here here here in Phoenix\nI hope you like this next song\nYou might recognize it\nIt's my biggest hit\n\n(Shut the fuck up and listen to him!)\n(Shut the fuck up and listen to him!)\n(Shut the fuck up and listen to him!)\n(Shut the fuck up and listen to him!)\n\nSo now here we are in Tu- Tu- Tu- Tucson\nGot to the venue and the pow- pow- pow- power wasn't on\nThe guys at the venue said that the battery died\nIn the new generator\nI said \"You better get it fixed fast\nYou tattooed motherfuckers\nOr see you later\"\n\nBut within the hour\nThey got the power turned on\nAnd it was all smiles\nAnd I'm happy to be here in Tucson\nWe ate next door at Miss Saigon\nThe spring roll tasted good\nOnce I put the sriracha on\n\nIt's good it's good it's good to be here in Tucson\nLet's keep our fingers crossed that the power stays on\nNow I'm off to China\nAnd trust me, this song could go on and on and on\nBut maybe it's wearing out its welcome\nI don't know\nI'm enjoying singing this song\n\nThis song could go on and on and on and on and on and on\nMaybe it's almost over\nI don't know\nBut I hope you're enjoying this song\nI know that some of you are thinking\nThis song is way too long\nThat's OK with me\nYou can listen to Green Day instead\nOr play a game of ping pong\n\n(Hey Mark, sorry to stop you but I think it is getting a little too long)\nOh alright, let's take a break and maybe get some dinner over at Tu LanEmbed"}, {"_type": "song", "annotation_count": 1, "api_path": "/songs/838943", "artist_names": "Atlanta Rhythm Section", "full_title": "Angel (What in the World's Come Over Us)

telling your best friend that you love him, there are generally two schools of thought. One strongly advises against it, warning that you could lose a friend if they don\u2019t feel the same way. The other urges action because, unless you say something, you might miss out on the love of your life.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately for me, I listened to the latter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The look in Charlie\u2019s midnight blue eyes said it all: I had just made the biggest mistake of my life \u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Sorry?\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps he hadn\u2019t heard me the first time. Maybe I should say it again?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I said I love you, Charlie.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He blinked. \u2018You\u2019re not serious, are you?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Yes.\u2019 I could feel a deathly dragging sensation pulling my hope to oblivion.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Gone was the trademark Charlie grin that had been so firmly in place only moments before. In its place was a look I didn\u2019t recognise, but I knew it wasn\u2019t a good alternative.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018H-how long have you \u2026?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dropped my gaze to the potted plant beside our table. \u2018Um \u2013 a long time, actually.\u2019 Maybe I should have worn something a bit more \u2018potential girlfriend material\u2019 today? But then this morning when I pulled on my trusty jeans and purple sweater dress I wasn\u2019t expecting to have this conversation. And judging by the look of sheer horror on Charlie\u2019s face, it wouldn\u2019t have made a difference if I had been sitting opposite him in a designer gown and diamonds. This was such a mistake \u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018But \u2026 we\u2019re mates, Rom.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Yeah, of course we are. Look, forget I said anything, OK?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He was staring at his latte like it had just insulted him. \u2018I don\u2019t know how you expect me to do that. You\u2019ve said it now, haven\u2019t you? I mean it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s out there.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I looked around the busy coffee shop. It was overcrowded with disgruntled Christmas shoppers huddled ungratefully around too-small tables on chairs greedily snatched from unsuspecting single customers. \u2018I think it\u2019s safe to assume that none of that lot heard anything.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As attempts at humour go, it wasn\u2019t my finest. I took a large gulp of coffee and wished myself dead.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charlie shook his head. \u2018That doesn\u2019t matter. I heard it. Oh, Rom \u2013 why did you say that? Why couldn\u2019t you just have \u2026?\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I stared at him. \u2018Just have what?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Just not said anything? I mean, why me? Why put this on me now?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I hated the look of sheer panic in his eyes. He\u2019d never looked at me that way before \u2026 In my perennial daydream about this moment it had been so very different:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Oh Romily \u2013 I\u2019ve loved you forever, too. If you hadn\u2019t told me we could have missed each other completely \u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018We\u2019re fine as we are, aren\u2019t we? I mean, if it\u2019s good then why change it? I can\u2019t believe you actually thought this would be a good idea.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well, excuse me, but I did. Somewhere between my ridiculous, obviously deluded heart and my big stupid mouth, my brain got pushed out of the picture and I \u2013 crazy, deranged loon that I am \u2013 found myself persuaded that I might be the answer to his dreams. That maybe the reason for the many hours we\u2019d spent together \u2013 cheeky laughter-filled days and late night heart-to-hearts \u2013 was that we were destined to be more than friends. Everyone else noticed it: it had been a running joke among our friends that Charlie and I were like an old married couple. The \u2018Old Folks\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what they called us. We\u2019d lost count of the number of times complete strangers mistook us for partners. So if it was this blindingly obvious to the world, how come Charlie couldn\u2019t see it?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, I couldn\u2019t say any of this to him. Sheer embarrassment stole the clever arguments from my mind so that then and there, in the crowded caf\u00e9 packed with people who couldn\u2019t care less about what I was saying, I found that all I could say was:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charlie shook his head. \u2018I did not see this coming. I thought we were friends, that\u2019s all. But this \u2013 this is just weird \u2026\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Thanks for the vote of confidence, Charlie.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He stared at me, confusion claiming his eyes. \u2018I-I didn\u2019t mean \u2026 Heck, Rom, I\u2019m sorry \u2013 you\u2019ve just got to give me a moment to get my head round this.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I looked away and focused on a particularly harassed-looking couple talking heatedly at the next table over enormous mugs of cream-topped festive coffees. \u2018You don\u2019t appreciate me,\u2019 the woman was saying. Right now, I knew exactly how she felt.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018The thing is,\u2019 Charlie said, \u2018you\u2019ve always been just Rom \u2013 one of the guys, you know? You\u2019re a laugh, someone I can hang out with. But now \u2026\u2019 He was digging an impossible hole for himself and he knew it. He gave a massive sigh. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really not sure how to deal with this.\u2019\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was awful \u2013 I\u2019d heard enough. I rose to my feet, intense pain and crushing embarrassment pushing my body up off the chair. I opened my mouth to deal a devastating parting shot, but nothing appeared. Instead, I turned and fled, stubbing my toe on a neighbouring customer\u2019s chair and tripping over various overstuffed shopping bags, almost taking a packed pushchair with me as I beat an ungraceful retreat from the coffee shop and out into the bustling street beyond.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Outside, Birmingham\u2019s famous Christmas Market was in full flow, packed with shoppers grabbing last-minute Christmas shopping and crowding around the wooden beer stalls. The coloured lights strung overhead glowed brightly against the greyness of the December afternoon sky and Christmas music blared relentlessly from speakers along the length of New Street.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Rom! Where are you going? I\u2019m sorry \u2013 please come back! Rom!\u2019 Behind me, Charlie\u2019s shouts blended into the blur of crowd noise and Christmas hits of yesteryear. I picked up my pace, making my way blindly against the tidal flow of bodies, their countless faces looming up before me, unsmiling and uncaring. I had humiliated myself enough already: the last thing I needed was for Charlie to come back for Round Two \u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I passed each shop front the sale signs began morphing into condemnatory judgements of my actions, screaming at me from every lit window:\n\nInsane!\n\nStupid idiot!\n\nWhat were you thinking?\n\nAs the jostling crowd propelled me involuntarily towards the marble pillars of the Town Hall, Paul McCartney was singing \u2018Wonderful Christmastime\u2019 like it should have an ironic question mark at the end. Unable to wriggle free, I found myself moving along with the throng. But I felt nothing; my senses were numbed by the faceless bodies hemming me in, and my heart too beset by ceaseless echoes of Charlie\u2019s words to care any more. At a loss to make sense of the total catastrophe I\u2019d just caused, I surrendered to the irresistible force of the crowd and, quite literally, went with the flow.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What was I thinking telling my best friend in the whole world that I loved him? I hadn\u2019t even planned to say it at all \u2013 and now I couldn\u2019t quite believe I had blurted out my biggest secret seemingly on a whim. One minute we were laughing about last week\u2019s gig, his smile so warm and his eyes lit up in the way they always do when he\u2019s talking about music; the next I was confessing the feelings for him I\u2019ve been carrying for three years. What on earth made me think that was a good idea?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maybe it was the impending arrival of the \u2018Most Wonderful Time of the Year\u2019 (thanks for nothing, Andy Williams) or the deliciously festive atmosphere filling the city today that had caused me to reveal my feelings to Charlie like that. Perhaps it was the influence of watching too many chick-flick Christmas scenes that had tipped my sanity over the edge and made the whole thing seem like such a great idea (Richard Curtis, Nora Ephron, guilty as charged).\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dumped unceremoniously by the crowd at the base of the grand stone staircase in Victoria Square, I managed to squeeze through a gap in the tightly-packed, slow-moving shoppers and emerged breathless into a small pocket of pine-scented air by the barriers around the base of the huge Swedish Christmas tree. Tears stung my eyes and I swallowed angrily in a vain attempt to keep them at bay. What was the matter with me? How did I get it so devastatingly wrong?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the signs had been there, or so I had thought: hugs that lingered a moment too long; snatched glances and shy smiles during nights out with our friends; moments of unspoken understanding during conversations begun in the early evening and ending as birdsong heralded a new day. Then there were his unexplained silences \u2013 times when I felt he had something more to say, when unresolved question marks sparkled magnificently in the air between us and the room held its breath \u2013 ultimately in vain. There had been more of these lately, peppering almost every occasion we spent together with an irresistible spice of intrigue. If they didn\u2019t mean what I thought they meant, then what on earth were they all about?\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My mobile phone rang in my bag, but I couldn\u2019t face answering the call, so Stevie Wonder continued his tinny rendition of \u2018Sir Duke\u2019 unhindered by my usual intervention. Reaching into the crummy depths of my coat pocket, I retrieved a crumpled shopping list and read down the list of scribbled names: my \u2018To-Do\u2019 list for the afternoon. It was the last Saturday before Christmas and my final chance to buy everyone\u2019s presents. Christmas shopping waited for no one, it seemed \u2013 not even thoroughly embarrassed owners of newly-shattered hearts.\n\nMum & Dad\n\nWren\n\nJack & Soph\n\nUncle Dudley and Auntie Mags\n\nTom & Anya\n\nCharlie\n\nCharlie. My breath caught in the back of my throat as my eye fell on the last name. No need for that one to be there now, I hissed under my breath. I think he\u2019s had quite enough surprise gifts from me this year. I stuffed the list back into my pocket and prepared to dive back into the undulating ocean of people.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Rom!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My head snapped upright in horror to see Charlie pushing his way through the crowd, further back down the street. No, this was absolutely not going to happen now. I couldn\u2019t face it \u2013 the lead-heavy mortification gripping my insides was already too much to bear. Turning on my heels, I pushed back into the crowd and ran on again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Oh come on, Rom! Just stop!\u2019 Charlie called behind me, closer this time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Looking over my shoulder, I shouted back. \u2018Go home, Charlie!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I saw him stop, throw his hands up in the air and turn back into the horde of shoppers behind him. Furious with myself for creating this awful situation, I wanted to put as much distance between me and the scene of my worst ever decision. Tears filled my eyes as I put on another sprint, rushing through the swarming mass of bodies. Part of me wanted Charlie to be following me, to catch me and say that he\u2019d overreacted, that I hadn\u2019t been mistaken, but I knew that wasn\u2019t going to happen and I hated myself for wanting the impossible. Angrily, I wiped the tears from my eyes \u2013 just in time to see the gaudy wooden stall laden with soft toys appear directly in front of me a split second before my body slammed headlong into it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A collective gasp rose from the crowd of shoppers as I tumbled, helpless limbs flailing, in an ungracious slow-motion sprawl. Bears, rabbits and reindeer spun in the air around me like a shower of oversized plush snowflakes and, for a moment, it was as if all noise ceased as I descended. The clamour of the crowd and the Christmas music receded and my senses were now aware only of the sensation of moving through the air. This feeling was short-lived, however, followed as it was by the inevitable gut-wrenching crack as my body hit the unforgiving block-paved ground and I skidded to a halt amid a sea of stuffed animals on the frosted pavement.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It took a moment for me to catch my breath, my ears buzzing from my head\u2019s heavy meeting with the floor, but then it was as if someone flicked a switch and all the light, noise and music of the Christmas Market roared back into life \u2013 along with the shock of an intense flood of pain along my back and the appearance of one very angry stallholder.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His beetroot-red round face appeared directly over me as I lay there, but instead of helping me up he launched into a tirade of thick German-accented abuse.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Crazy woman! Look at this mess! It is ruined, ruined!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thoroughly embarrassed, I scrambled to my feet, wincing as my bruised limbs creaked and groaned back into an upright position.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m so sorry,\u2019 I mumbled, grabbing armfuls of toys and wishing I could disappear.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In true British fashion, the crowd around me didn\u2019t offer to help \u2013 the spectacle of the woman who trashed the toy stall frantically trying to reconstruct it far too much fun for them to intervene. The disgruntled stallholder didn\u2019t help either, standing by the remains of his stall with pudgy arms folded tight across his squat body as he watched me. As if I wasn\u2019t morbidly mortified enough already, I was vaguely aware that some of the onlookers had produced mobile phones and were now happily filming the scene. Great. All I needed after the events of today was to become the unwitting star of the latest YouTube viral sensation. I was cold, aching, unspeakably embarrassed and all I wanted was to get home as quickly as possible. Christmas was ruined now anyway: Charlie wouldn\u2019t want to see me and when the rest of the band found out what had happened, everything would be awkward there, too. Only Wren would understand \u2013 and no doubt even she would have a strong opinion on it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I bit back tears as I reached out to scoop more of the fallen bears from the pavement \u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026 and that\u2019s when I saw him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As my fingers closed around a toy penguin, I was suddenly aware of a gloved hand reaching out for a polar bear hand puppet next to it. Lifting my eyes I came face to face with quite the most gorgeous man I had ever seen. His hazel eyes caught the light from coloured Christmas lights above, while wavy strands of his russet-brown hair picked up the twinkling blue light from the fairy lights that framed the toy stall roof. A slight shadow of stubble edged his jawline and I noticed that his cheekbones were quite defined.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Hi,\u2019 he said, his warm smile and kind eyes momentarily numbing the sting of my bruises. \u2018Need some help?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I smiled back. \u2018Please.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We slowly moved around each other, gathering up the scattered stock. As we did so I was aware that he was watching me, his shy smile appearing whenever our eyes met. And I can\u2019t explain why, but the sudden arrival of this kind stranger after the utter awfulness of the afternoon felt like a blissful reprieve \u2013 as if everything I had experienced was merely instrumental in bringing me to this moment, this meeting.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once we had retrieved all of the toys from the wide circle they had been flung to, I turned to the stallholder and apologised again.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Whatever,\u2019 he shrugged, disappearing inside his wooden stall and slamming the door.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Spectacle over, the onlookers dispersed back into the crowd and the stranger and I were left alone by the stall.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Thank you,\u2019 I said.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018You\u2019re welcome,\u2019 he replied, pushing his hands into his coat pockets. I noticed tiny crinkles appearing at the corners of his eyes when he smiled.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For a moment, we stood in silence, our breath rising in puffs of Christmas-light-washed steam. It was clear that neither of us knew what to say and the awkwardness of the silence brought my earlier humiliation flooding back.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He\u2019s obviously just being polite, I reasoned, my heart sinking, and now he\u2019s looking for an excuse to leave.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Well, I\u2019d better \u2026\u2019 I nodded in the direction of the Town Hall behind us, as though this would be some universal indicator of the Christmas shopping I still had to do before I could go home. Thankfully, he seemed to understand, nodding and looking down at his feet.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Of course.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Thanks again.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He raised his lovely eyes once again to mine. \u2018No problem. Merry Christmas.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I hurried away, I felt like screaming. Not content with merely ruining my friendship with Charlie and making a complete idiot of myself in full view of a large section of city shoppers, I had now embarrassed myself in front of a really good-looking bloke. Nice work, Romily.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My shoulder was complaining vociferously as I reached into my coat pocket again for the list. At times like this, practicality was the only way forward. I headed towards the white lights of the craft market section. My aunt loves hand-painted glass and I vaguely remembered seeing a glass ornament stall earlier that day. Forcing my conflicting thoughts to the back of my mind, I wove my way through the dawdling shoppers until I found it.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two middle-aged ladies wrapped up against the bitter December air were chatting animatedly behind the stall, oblivious to everything else. The voice of Nat King Cole was crooning from the speakers of a small CD player on the counter.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Gotta love a bit of old Nat, eh?\u2019 the taller of the two was saying.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Tell me about it. Our Eth won\u2019t listen to anything else at Christmas.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Not even Bing or Frank?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Nope. It\u2019s Nat or nothing. Him and his chestnuts roasting on an open fire.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Always thought that sounded a bit painful myself,\u2019 the taller lady sniggered as the shorter one giggled.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I relaxed a little as their jovial banter continued, casting my gaze across the glass baubles of all shapes and sizes, suspended on delicate silver thread from white-painted twigs set in plant pots. A gentle breeze had sprung up, making the hanging glass shapes shiver and spin slowly, so that they caught the light from the white fairy lights woven around the stall edge and the coloured strings of Christmas lights swinging high over the market. One particular bauble near the front of the display immediately caught my eye: a large, teardrop-shaped ornament adorned with tiny painted silver stars \u2013 delicate brushstrokes that sparkled from the glass surface. It was beautiful, a real work of craftsmanship, and I knew my aunt would adore it. I reached out and felt the icy coolness of the glass against my fingers.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018It\u2019s beautiful, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 a deep voice said behind my right ear, making me jump and only just manage to save the bauble from falling from its twig. Leaving it safely spinning, I turned, my eyes first meeting a green, brown and cream striped scarf and then heading north to reach the shy smile of the stranger who had helped me. My breath caught in the back of my throat and I nodded dumbly at him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m sorry to \u2026 er \u2026 I just wanted to check you were OK?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m fine. Thanks again for helping me.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018You\u2019re welcome. I couldn\u2019t believe all those people were just watching.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I smiled, despite the blush I knew was glowing from my cheeks. \u2018I think they thought I was part of the entertainment.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Some entertainment,\u2019 he laughed, almost immediately hiding his amusement when he saw my expression. \u2018So \u2013 you\u2019re OK? I mean, you aren\u2019t hurt or anything?\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0His concern was touching but bearing in mind the afternoon I\u2019d had, the last thing I needed was the pity of a gorgeous man. \u2018All good. Nothing broken.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Good.\u2019 He stared at me and this time there was something more in his eyes than concern. \u2018Look, this is going to sound mental, so I\u2019m just going to say it. I couldn\u2019t let you go without telling you that you\u2019re beautiful. That\u2019s why I followed you here. Please don\u2019t think I\u2019m a psycho or that I do this a lot: I don\u2019t. But you\u2019re beautiful and I think you should know that.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stunned, I opened my mouth to reply, but just then a shout from behind us caused him to turn.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Mate, we\u2019ve got to go \u2026 Now!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What happened next was so fast that even now the details remain frustratingly sparse in my mind. But here\u2019s what I know.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When he turned back to face me, the way he looked at me took my breath away. It was the kind of look you see in movies when a bridegroom turns to see his bride walking towards him for the first time: a heady, overpowering mix of shock, surprise and all-encompassing, heart-stopping love. It was the look that Charlie should have given me when I told him I loved him. But this wasn\u2019t Charlie; and that, in itself, was part of the problem. Because \u2013 apart from not being the man to whom I had publicly expressed my undying love not half an hour beforehand \u2013 this person was almost perfect: from his wide, honest eyes and shy smile, to the woody scent of his cologne now surrounding me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But most of all because of what happened next \u2026\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He took a step back and I could see a battle raging in his eyes as the voice behind him called again, more insistent this time.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018We have to go \u2013 come on!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018One minute,\u2019 he called back, just as a hurrying shopper crashed into his shoulder, momentarily throwing him off balance \u2013 and straight into my arms.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In utter surprise, I held on to him and his strong arms reached round to cradle my back. The shock of it blew all thoughts of Charlie instantly from my mind. Heart racing, I gazed up into his eyes.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018I\u2019m so sorry, I have to go,\u2019 he whispered, his lips inches from mine. \u2018But you\u2019re beautiful.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, he kissed me.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although our lips touched for the smallest of moments, it was unlike anything else I\u2019ve experienced. It was the type of kiss you only expect to see in Hollywood films, finally uniting the two leads as the credits start to roll over the delicious tones of Nat King Cole. In fact, even the soundtrack was perfect because at that very moment Mr Cole himself began crooning \u2018Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\u2019 via the muffled speakers of the bauble stall\u2019s CD player. All thoughts of Christmas shopping dissolved from my mind as I closed my eyes and gave in to the unexpected gift of the stranger\u2019s lips on mine.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was almost perfect. Almost. But not quite. Because, as suddenly as he had appeared, he was gone: swallowed up by the heaving, unyielding mass of shoppers. I remained frozen to the spot for what felt like an age, dazed yet elated, my heart beating wildly.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And then, from somewhere deep in the recesses of my consciousness, a thought began to push urgently through the swirling mass of emotions.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Go after him!\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Wait! Come back!\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I looked in the direction I thought he had gone, but there was no sign of him. Nevertheless, I began to shove my way through the crowds, rising on tiptoes to scan across the sea of bobbing bodies for a glimpse of his hair or his scarf as I ran. Shoppers tutted as I pushed past, but I was a woman on a mission and oblivious to their disapproving glances.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I neared the end of the line of wooden stalls, I suddenly caught a glimpse of russet-brown hair, hurrying ahead of me. Heart thumping hard against my chest, I pressed on, gaining on him. Soon, I was within touching distance, so I reached out my hand and tapped his shoulder.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Hey, you can\u2019t just kiss me and then leave without giving me your name,\u2019 I said. He turned to face me \u2026 and my heart plummeted.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018That\u2019s one hell of a chat-up line, love,\u2019 the older man grinned. His yellowing teeth and pockmarked skin were anything but kissable. \u2018Now I don\u2019t know about any kiss but I\u2019m happy to oblige if you want.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recoiled, dropping my gaze as I backed away. \u2018I\u2019m sorry. I thought you were someone else.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2018Story of my life, chick,\u2019 he laughed as I hurried back towards the safety of the Christmas Market stalls. Utterly deflated, I stopped and looked up at the darkening sky, heavy with snow-laden clouds. I had lost him.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0How was it possible for something so amazing to happen and then disappear as quickly as it had arrived? And how stupid was I for not asking his name? At least then I would know something tangible about him. My scarf still retained traces of his cologne and my lips were tingling from our brief kiss, but that was all I had to show for an event so significant it might just have changed everything.\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All I knew about him was what I could remember.

Deronda (Chap. 16) LyricsMen, like planets, have both a visible and an invisible history. The astronomer threads the darkness with strict deduction, accounting so for every visible arc in the wanderer's orbit; and the narrator of human actions, if he did his work with the same completeness, would have to thread the hidden pathways of feeling and thought which lead up to every moment of action, and to those moments of intense suffering which take the quality of action\u2014like the cry of Prometheus, whose chained anguish seems a greater energy than the sea and sky he invokes and the deity he defies.\n\nDeronda's circumstances, indeed, had been exceptional. One moment had been burned into his life as its chief epoch\u2014a moment full of July sunshine and large pink roses shedding their last petals on a grassy court enclosed on three sides by a gothic cloister. Imagine him in such a scene: a boy of thirteen, stretched prone on the grass where it was in shadow, his curly head propped on his arms over a book, while his tutor, also reading, sat on a camp-stool under shelter. Deronda's book was Sismondi's \"History of the Italian Republics\";\u2014the lad had a passion for history, eager to know how time had been filled up since the flood, and how things were carried on in the dull periods. Suddenly he let down his left arm and looked at his tutor, saying in purest boyish tones\u2014\n\n\"Mr. Fraser, how was it that the popes and cardinals always had so many nephews?\"\n\nThe tutor, an able young Scotchman, who acted as Sir Hugo Mallinger's secretary, roused rather unwillingly from his political economy, answered with the clear-cut emphatic chant which makes a truth doubly telling in Scotch utterance\u2014\n\n\"Their own children were called nephews.\"\n\n\"Why?\" said Deronda.\n\"It was just for the propriety of the thing; because, as you know very well, priests don't marry, and the children were illegitimate.\"\n\nMr. Fraser, thrusting out his lower lip and making his chant of the last word the more emphatic for a little impatience at being interrupted, had already turned his eyes on his book again, while Deronda, as if something had stung him, started up in a sitting attitude with his back to the tutor.\n\nHe had always called Sir Hugo Mallinger his uncle, and when it once occurred to him to ask about his father and mother, the baronet had answered, \"You lost your father and mother when you were quite a little one; that is why I take care of you.\" Daniel then straining to discern something in that early twilight, had a dim sense of having been kissed very much, and surrounded by thin, cloudy, scented drapery, till his fingers caught in something hard, which hurt him, and he began to cry. Every other memory he had was of the little world in which he still lived. And at that time he did not mind about learning more, for he was too fond of Sir Hugo to be sorry for the loss of unknown parents. Life was very delightful to the lad, with an uncle who was always indulgent and cheerful\u2014a fine man in the bright noon of life, whom Daniel thought absolutely perfect, and whose place was one of the finest in England, at once historical; romantic, and home-like: a picturesque architectural outgrowth from an abbey, which had still remnants of the old monastic trunk. Diplow lay in another county, and was a comparatively landless place which had come into the family from a rich lawyer on the female side who wore the perruque of the restoration; whereas the Mallingers had the grant of Monk's Topping under Henry the Eighth, and ages before had held the neighboring lands of King's Topping, tracing indeed their origin to a certain Hugues le Malingre, who came in with the Conqueror\u2014and also apparently with a sickly complexion which had been happily corrected in his descendants. Two rows of these descendants, direct and collateral, females of the male line, and males of the female, looked down in the gallery over the cloisters on the nephew Daniel as he walked there: men in armor with pointed beards and arched eyebrows, pinched ladies in hoops and ruffs with no face to speak of; grave-looking men in black velvet and stuffed hips, and fair, frightened women holding little boys by the hand; smiling politicians in magnificent perruques, and ladies of the prize-animal kind, with rosebud mouths and full eyelids, according to Lely; then a generation whose faces were revised and embellished in the taste of Kneller; and so on through refined editions of the family types in the time of Reynolds and Romney, till the line ended with Sir Hugo and his younger brother Henleigh. This last had married Miss Grandcourt, and taken her name along with her estates, thus making a junction between two equally old families, impaling the three Saracens' heads proper and three bezants of the one with the tower and falcons argent of the other, and, as it happened, uniting their highest advantages in the prospects of that Henleigh Mallinger Grandcourt who is at present more of an acquaintance to us than either Sir Hugo or his nephew Daniel Deronda.\n\nIn Sir Hugo's youthful portrait with rolled collar and high cravat, Sir Thomas Lawrence had done justice to the agreeable alacrity of expression and sanguine temperament still to be seen in the original, but had done something more than justice in slightly lengthening the nose, which was in reality shorter than might have been expected in a Mallinger. Happily the appropriate nose of the family reappeared in his younger brother, and was to be seen in all its refined regularity in his nephew Mallinger Grandcourt. But in the nephew Daniel Deronda the family faces of various types, seen on the walls of the gallery; found no reflex. Still he was handsomer than any of them, and when he was thirteen might have served as model for any painter who wanted to image the most memorable of boys: you could hardly have seen his face thoroughly meeting yours without believing that human creatures had done nobly in times past, and might do more nobly in time to come. The finest childlike faces have this consecrating power, and make us shudder anew at all the grossness and basely-wrought griefs of the world, lest they should enter here and defile.\n\nBut at this moment on the grass among the rose-petals, Daniel Deronda was making a first acquaintance with those griefs. A new idea had entered his mind, and was beginning to change the aspect of his habitual feelings as happy careless voyagers are changed with the sky suddenly threatened and the thought of danger arises. He sat perfectly still with his back to the tutor, while his face expressed rapid inward transition. The deep blush, which had come when he first started up, gradually subsided; but his features kept that indescribable look of subdued activity which often accompanies a new mental survey of familiar facts. He had not lived with other boys, and his mind showed the same blending of child's ignorance with surprising knowledge which is oftener seen in bright girls. Having read Shakespeare as well as a great deal of history, he could have talked with the wisdom of a bookish child about men who were born out of wedlock and were held unfortunate in consequence, being under disadvantages which required them to be a sort of heroes if they were to work themselves up to an equal standing with their legally born brothers. But he had never brought such knowledge into any association with his own lot, which had been too easy for him ever to think about it\u2014until this moment when there had darted into his mind with the magic of quick comparison, the possibility that here was the secret of his own birth, and that the man whom he called uncle was really his father. Some children, even younger than Daniel, have known the first arrival of care, like an ominous irremovable guest in their tender lives, on the discovery that their parents, whom they had imagined able to buy everything, were poor and in hard money troubles. Daniel felt the presence of a new guest who seemed to come with an enigmatic veiled face, and to carry dimly-conjectured, dreaded revelations. The ardor which he had given to the imaginary world in his books suddenly rushed toward his own history and spent its pictorial energy there, explaining what he knew, representing the unknown. The uncle whom he loved very dearly took the aspect of a father who held secrets about him\u2014who had done him a wrong\u2014yes, a wrong: and what had become of his mother, for whom he must have been taken away?\u2014Secrets about which he, Daniel, could never inquire; for to speak or to be spoken to about these new thoughts seemed like falling flakes of fire to his imagination. Those who have known an impassioned childhood will understand this dread of utterance about any shame connected with their parents. The impetuous advent of new images took possession of him with the force of fact for the first time told, and left him no immediate power for the reflection that he might be trembling at a fiction of his own. The terrible sense of collision between a strong rush of feeling and the dread of its betrayal, found relief at length in big slow tears, which fell without restraint until the voice of Mr. Fraser was heard saying:\n\n\"Daniel, do you see that you are sitting on the bent pages of your book?\"\n\nDaniel immediately moved the book without turning round, and after holding it before him for an instant, rose with it and walked away into the open grounds, where he could dry his tears unobserved. The first shock of suggestion past, he could remember that he had no certainty how things really had been, and that he had been making conjectures about his own history, as he had often made stories about Pericles or Columbus, just to fill up the blanks before they became famous. Only there came back certain facts which had an obstinate reality,\u2014almost like the fragments of a bridge, telling you unmistakably how the arches lay. And again there came a mood in which his conjectures seemed like a doubt of religion, to be banished as an offense, and a mean prying after what he was not meant to know; for there was hardly a delicacy of feeling this lad was not capable of. But the summing-up of all his fluctuating experience at this epoch was, that a secret impression had come to him which had given him something like a new sense in relation to all the elements of his life. And the idea that others probably knew things concerning which they did not choose to mention, set up in him a premature reserve which helped to intensify his inward experience. His ears open now to words which before that July day would have passed by him unnoted; and round every trivial incident which imagination could connect with his suspicions, a newly-roused set of feelings were ready to cluster themselves.\n\nOne such incident a month later wrought itself deeply into his life. Daniel had not only one of those thrilling boy voices which seem to bring an idyllic heaven and earth before our eyes, but a fine musical instinct, and had early made out accompaniments for himself on the piano, while he sang from memory. Since then he had had some teaching, and Sir Hugo, who delighted in the boy, used to ask for his music in the presence of guests. One morning after he had been singing \"Sweet Echo\" before a small party of gentlemen whom the rain had kept in the house, the baronet, passing from a smiling remark to his next neighbor said:\n\n\"Come here, Dan!\"\n\nThe boy came forward with unusual reluctance. He wore an embroidered holland blouse which set off the rich coloring of his head and throat, and the resistant gravity about his mouth and eyes as he was being smiled upon, made their beauty the more impressive. Every one was admiring him.\n\n\"What do you say to being a great singer? Should you like to be adored by the world and take the house by storm; like Mario and Tamberlik?\"\n\nDaniel reddened instantaneously, but there was a just perceptible interval before he answered with angry decision\u2014\n\n\"No; I should hate it!\"\n\"Well, well, well!\" said Sir Hugo, with surprised kindliness intended to be soothing. But Daniel turned away quickly, left the room, and going to his own chamber threw himself on the broad window-sill, which was a favorite retreat of his when he had nothing particular to do. Here he could see the rain gradually subsiding with gleams through the parting clouds which lit up a great reach of the park, where the old oaks stood apart from each other, and the bordering wood was pierced with a green glade which met the eastern sky. This was a scene which had always been part of his home\u2014part of the dignified ease which had been a matter of course in his life. And his ardent clinging nature had appropriated it all with affection. He knew a great deal of what it was to be a gentleman by inheritance, and without thinking much about himself\u2014for he was a boy of active perceptions and easily forgot his own existence in that of Robert Bruce\u2014he had never supposed that he could be shut out from such a lot, or have a very different part in the world from that of the uncle who petted him. It is possible (though not greatly believed in at present) to be fond of poverty and take it for a bride, to prefer scoured deal, red quarries and whitewash for one's private surroundings, to delight in no splendor but what has open doors for the whole nation, and to glory in having no privileges except such as nature insists on; and noblemen have been known to run away from elaborate ease and the option of idleness, that they might bind themselves for small pay to hard-handed labor. But Daniel's tastes were altogether in keeping with his nurture: his disposition was one in which everyday scenes and habits beget not ennui or rebellion, but delight, affection, aptitudes; and now the lad had been stung to the quick by the idea that his uncle\u2014perhaps his father\u2014thought of a career for him which was totally unlike his own, and which he knew very well was not thought of among possible destinations for the sons of English gentlemen. He had often stayed in London with Sir Hugo, who to indulge the boy's ear had carried him to the opera to hear the great tenors, so that the image of a singer taking the house by storm was very vivid to him; but now, spite of his musical gift, he set himself bitterly against the notion of being dressed up to sing before all those fine people, who would not care about him except as a wonderful toy. That Sir Hugo should have thought of him in that position for a moment, seemed to Daniel an unmistakable proof that there was something about his birth which threw him out from the class of gentlemen to which the baronet belonged. Would it ever be mentioned to him? Would the time come when his uncle would tell him everything? He shrank from the prospect: in his imagination he preferred ignorance. If his father had been wicked\u2014Daniel inwardly used strong words, for he was feeling the injury done him as a maimed boy feels the crushed limb which for others is merely reckoned in an average of accidents\u2014if his father had done any wrong, he wished it might never be spoken of to him: it was already a cutting thought that such knowledge might be in other minds. Was it in Mr. Fraser's? probably not, else he would not have spoken in that way about the pope's nephews. Daniel fancied, as older people do, that every one else's consciousness was as active as his own on a matter which was vital to him. Did Turvey the valet know?\u2014and old Mrs. French the housekeeper?\u2014and Banks the bailiff, with whom he had ridden about the farms on his pony?\u2014And now there came back the recollection of a day some years before when he was drinking Mrs. Banks's whey, and Banks said to his wife with a wink and a cunning laugh, \"He features the mother, eh?\" At that time little Daniel had merely thought that Banks made a silly face, as the common farming men often did, laughing at what was not laughable; and he rather resented being winked at and talked of as if he did not understand everything. But now that small incident became information: it was to be reasoned on. How could he be like his mother and not like his father? His mother must have been a Mallinger, if Sir Hugo were his uncle. But no! His father might have been Sir Hugo's brother and have changed his name, as Mr. Henleigh Mallinger did when he married Miss Grandcourt. But then, why had he never heard Sir Hugo speak of his brother Deronda, as he spoke of his brother Grandcourt? Daniel had never before cared about the family tree\u2014only about that ancestor who had killed three Saracens in one encounter. But now his mind turned to a cabinet of estate-maps in the library, where he had once seen an illuminated parchment hanging out, that Sir Hugo said was the family tree. The phrase was new and odd to him\u2014he was a little fellow then\u2014hardly more than half his present age\u2014and he gave it no precise meaning. He knew more now and wished that he could examine that parchment. He imagined that the cabinet was always locked, and longed to try it. But here he checked himself. He might be seen: and he would never bring himself near even a silent admission of the sore that had opened in him.\n\nIt is in such experiences of a boy or girlhood, while elders are debating whether most education lies in science or literature, that the main lines of character are often laid down. If Daniel had been of a less ardently affectionate nature, the reserve about himself and the supposition that others had something to his disadvantage in their minds, might have turned into a hard, proud antagonism. But inborn lovingness was strong enough to keep itself level with resentment. There was hardly any creature in his habitual world that he was not fond of; teasing them occasionally, of course\u2014all except his uncle, or \"Nunc,\" as Sir Hugo had taught him to say; for the baronet was the reverse of a strait-laced man, and left his dignity to take care of itself. Him Daniel loved in that deep-rooted filial way which makes children always the happier for being in the same room with father or mother, though their occupations may be quite apart. Sir Hugo's watch-chain and seals, his handwriting, his mode of smoking and of talking to his dogs and horses, had all a rightness and charm about them to the boy which went along with the happiness of morning and breakfast time. That Sir Hugo had always been a Whig, made Tories and Radicals equally opponents of the truest and best; and the books he had written were all seen under the same consecration of loving belief which differenced what was his from what was not his, in spite of general resemblance. Those writings were various, from volumes of travel in the brilliant style, to articles on things in general, and pamphlets on political crises; but to Daniel they were alike in having an unquestionable rightness by which other people's information could be tested.\n\nWho cannot imagine the bitterness of a first suspicion that something in this object of complete love was not quite right? Children demand that their heroes should be fleckless, and easily believe them so: perhaps a first discovery to the contrary is hardly a less revolutionary shock to a passionate child than the threatened downfall of habitual beliefs which makes the world seem to totter for us in maturer life.\n\nBut some time after this renewal of Daniel's agitation it appeared that Sir Hugo must have been making a merely playful experiment in his question about the singing. He sent for Daniel into the library, and looking up from his writing as the boy entered threw himself sideways in his armchair. \"Ah, Dan!\" he said kindly, drawing one of the old embroidered stools close to him. \"Come and sit down here.\"\n\nDaniel obeyed, and Sir Hugo put a gentle hand on his shoulder, looking at him affectionately.\n\n\"What is it, my boy? Have you heard anything that has put you out of spirits lately?\"\n\nDaniel was determined not to let the tears come, but he could not speak.\n\n\"All changes are painful when people have been happy, you know,\" said Sir Hugo, lifting his hand from the boy's shoulder to his dark curls and rubbing them gently. \"You can't be educated exactly as I wish you to be without our parting. And I think you will find a great deal to like at school.\"\n\nThis was not what Daniel expected, and was so far a relief, which gave him spirit to answer\u2014\n\n\"Am I to go to school?\"\n\n\"Yes, I mean you to go to Eton. I wish you to have the education of an English gentleman; and for that it is necessary that you should go to a public school in preparation for the university: Cambridge I mean you to go to; it was my own university.\"\n\nDaniel's color came and went.\n\n\"What do you say, sirrah?\" said Sir Hugo, smiling.\n\"I should like to be a gentleman,\" said Daniel, with firm distinctness, \"and go to school, if that is what a gentleman's son must do.\"\n\nSir Hugo watched him silently for a few moments, thinking he understood now why the lad had seemed angry at the notion of becoming a singer. Then he said tenderly\u2014\n\n\"And so you won't mind about leaving your old Nunc?\"\n\n\"Yes, I shall,\" said Daniel, clasping Sir Hugo's caressing arm with both his hands. \"But shan't I come home and be with you in the holidays?\"\n\n\"Oh yes, generally,\" said Sir Hugo. \"But now I mean you to go at once to a new tutor, to break the change for you before you go to Eton.\"\n\nAfter this interview Daniel's spirit rose again. He was meant to be a gentleman, and in some unaccountable way it might be that his conjectures were all wrong. The very keenness of the lad taught him to find comfort in his ignorance. While he was busying his mind in the construction of possibilities, it became plain to him that there must be possibilities of which he knew nothing. He left off brooding, young joy and the spirit of adventure not being easily quenched within him, and in the interval before his going away he sang about the house, danced among the old servants, making them parting gifts, and insisted many times to the groom on the care that was to be taken of the black pony.\n\n\"Do you think I shall know much less than the other boys, Mr. Fraser?\" said Daniel. It was his bent to think that every stranger would be surprised at his ignorance.\n\n\"There are dunces to be found everywhere,\" said the judicious Fraser. \"You'll not be the biggest; but you've not the makings of a Porson in you, or a Leibnitz either.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be a Porson or a Leibnitz,\" said Daniel. \"I would rather be a greater leader, like Pericles or Washington.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay; you've a notion they did with little parsing, and less algebra,\" said Fraser. But in reality he thought his pupil a remarkable lad, to whom one thing was as easy as another, if he had only a mind to it.\n\nThings went on very well with Daniel in his new world, except that a boy with whom he was at once inclined to strike up a close friendship talked to him a great deal about his home and parents, and seemed to expect a like expansiveness in return. Daniel immediately shrank into reserve, and this experience remained a check on his naturally strong bent toward the formation of intimate friendship. Every one, his tutor included, set him down as a reserved boy, though he was so good-humored and unassuming, as well as quick, both at study and sport, that nobody called his reserve disagreeable. Certainly his face had a great deal to do with that favorable interpretation; but in this instance the beauty of the closed lips told no falsehood.\n\nA surprise that came to him before his first vacation strengthened the silent consciousness of a grief within, which might be compared in some ways with Byron's susceptibility about his deformed foot. Sir Hugo wrote word that he was married to Miss Raymond, a sweet lady, whom Daniel must remember having seen. The event would make no difference about his spending the vacation at the Abbey; he would find Lady Mallinger a new friend whom he would be sure to love\u2014and much more to the usual effect when a man, having done something agreeable to himself, is disposed to congratulate others on his own good fortune, and the deducible satisfactoriness of events in general.\n\nLet Sir Hugo be partly excused until the grounds of his action can be more fully known. The mistakes in his behavior to Deronda were due to that dullness toward what may be going on in other minds, especially the minds of children, which is among the commonest deficiencies, even in good-natured men like him, when life has been generally easy to themselves, and their energies have been quietly spent in feeling gratified. No one was better aware than he that Daniel was generally suspected to be his own son. But he was pleased with that suspicion; and his imagination had never once been troubled with the way in which the boy himself might be affected, either then or in the future, by the enigmatic aspect of his circumstances. He was as fond of him as could be, and meant the best by him. And, considering the lightness with which the preparation of young lives seem to lie on respectable consciences, Sir Hugo Mallinger can hardly be held open to exceptional reproach. He had been a bachelor till he was five-and-forty, had always been regarded as a fascinating man of elegant tastes; what could be more natural, even according to the index of language, than that he should have a beautiful boy like the little Deronda to take care of? The mother might even, perhaps, be in the great world\u2014met with in Sir Hugo's residence abroad. The only person to feel any objection was the boy himself, who could not have been consulted. And the boy's objections had never been dreamed of by anybody but himself.\n\nBy the time Deronda was ready to go to Cambridge, Lady Mallinger had already three daughters\u2014charming babies, all three, but whose sex was announced as a melancholy alternative, the offspring desired being a son; if Sir Hugo had no son the succession must go to his nephew, Mallinger Grandcourt. Daniel no longer held a wavering opinion about his own birth. His fuller knowledge had tended to convince him that Sir Hugo was his father, and he conceived that the baronet, since he never approached a communication on the subject, wished him to have a tacit understanding of the fact, and to accept in silence what would be generally considered more than the due love and nurture. Sir Hugo's marriage might certainly have been felt as a new ground of resentment by some youths in Deronda's position, and the timid Lady Mallinger with her fast-coming little ones might have been images to scowl at, as likely to divert much that was disposable in the feelings and possessions of the baronet from one who felt his own claim to be prior. But hatred of innocent human obstacles was a form of moral stupidity not in Deronda's grain; even the indignation which had long mingled itself with his affection for Sir Hugo took the quality of pain rather than of temper; and as his mind ripened to the idea of tolerance toward error, he habitually liked the idea with his own silent grievances.\n\nThe sense of an entailed disadvantage\u2014the deformed foot doubtfully hidden by the shoe, makes a restlessly active spiritual yeast, and easily turns a self-centered, unloving nature into an Ishmaelite. But in the rarer sort, who presently see their own frustrated claim as one among a myriad, the inexorable sorrow takes the form of fellowship and makes the imagination tender. Deronda's early-weakened susceptibility, charged at first with ready indignation and resistant pride, had raised in him a premature reflection on certain questions of life; it had given a bias to his conscience, a sympathy with certain ills, and a tension of resolve in certain directions, who marked him off from other youths much more than any talents he possessed.\n\nOne day near the end of the long vacation, when he had been making a tour in the Rhineland with his Eton tutor, and was come for a farewell stay at the Abbey before going to Cambridge, he said to Sir Hugo\u2014\n\n\"What do you intend me to be, sir?\" They were in the library, and it was the fresh morning. Sir Hugo had called him in to read a letter from a Cambridge Don who was to be interested in him; and since the baronet wore an air at once business-like and leisurely, the moment seemed propitious for entering on a grave subject which had never yet been thoroughly discussed.\n\n\"Whatever your inclination leads you to, my boy. I thought it right to give you the option of the army, but you shut the door on that, and I was glad. I don't expect you to choose just yet\u2014by-and-by, when you have looked about you a little more and tried your mettle among older men. The university has a good wide opening into the forum. There are prizes to be won, and a bit of good fortune often gives the turn to a man's taste. From what I see and hear, I should think you can take up anything you like. You are in the deeper water with your classics than I ever got into, and if you are rather sick of that swimming, Cambridge is the place where you can go into mathematics with a will, and disport yourself on the dry sand as much as you like. I floundered along like a carp.\"\n\n\"I suppose money will make some difference, sir,\" said Daniel blushing.\n\"I shall have to keep myself by-and-by.\"\n\"Not exactly. I recommend you not to be extravagant\u2014yes, yes, I know\u2014you are not inclined to that;\u2014but you need not take up anything against the grain. You will have a bachelor's income\u2014enough for you to look about with. Perhaps I had better tell you that you may consider yourself secure of seven hundred a year. You might make yourself a barrister\u2014be a writer\u2014take up politics. I confess that is what would please me best. I should like to have you at my elbow and pulling with me.\"\n\nDeronda looked embarrassed. He felt that he ought to make some sign of gratitude, but other feelings clogged his tongue. A moment was passing by in which a question about his birth was throbbing within him, and yet it seemed more impossible than ever that the question should find vent\u2014more impossible than ever that he could hear certain things from Sir Hugo's lips. The liberal way in which he was dealt with was the more striking because the baronet had of late cared particularly for money, and for making the utmost of his life-interest in the estate by way of providing for his daughters; and as all this flashed through Daniel's mind it was momentarily within his imagination that the provision for him might come in some way from his mother. But such vaporous conjecture passed away as quickly as it came.\n\nSir Hugo appeared not to notice anything peculiar in Daniel's manner, and presently went on with his usual chatty liveliness.\n\n\"I am glad you have done some good reading outside your classics, and have got a grip of French and German. The truth is, unless a man can get the prestige and income of a Don and write donnish books, it's hardly worth while for him to make a Greek and Latin machine of himself and be able to spin you out pages of the Greek dramatists at any verse you'll give him as a cue. That's all very fine, but in practical life nobody does give you the cue for pages of Greek. In fact, it's a nicety of conversation which I would have you attend to\u2014much quotation of any sort, even in English is bad. It tends to choke ordinary remark. One couldn't carry on life comfortably without a little blindness to the fact that everything had been said better than we can put it ourselves. But talking of Dons, I have seen Dons make a capital figure in society; and occasionally he can shoot you down a cart-load of learning in the right place, which will tell in politics. Such men are wanted; and if you have any turn for being a Don, I say nothing against it.\"\n\n\"I think there's not much chance of that. Quicksett and Puller are both stronger than I am. I hope you will not be much disappointed if I don't come out with high honors.\"\n\n\"No, no. I should like you to do yourself credit, but for God's sake don't come out as a superior expensive kind of idiot, like young Brecon, who got a Double First, and has been learning to knit braces ever since. What I wish you to get is a passport in life. I don't go against our university system: we want a little disinterested culture to make head against cotton and capital, especially in the House. My Greek has all evaporated; if I had to construe a verse on a sudden, I should get an apoplectic fit. But it formed my taste. I dare say my English is the better for it.\"\n\nOn this point Daniel kept a respectful silence. The enthusiastic belief in Sir Hugo's writings as a standard, and in the Whigs as the chosen race among politicians, had gradually vanished along with the seraphic boy's face. He had not been the hardest of workers at Eton. Though some kinds of study and reading came as easily as boating to him, he was not of the material that usually makes the first-rate Eton scholar. There had sprung up in him a meditative yearning after wide knowledge which is likely always to abate ardor in the fight for prize acquirement in narrow tracks. Happily he was modest, and took any second-rateness in himself simply as a fact, not as a marvel necessarily to be accounted for by a superiority. Still Mr. Fraser's high opinion of the lad had not been altogether belied by the youth: Daniel had the stamp of rarity in a subdued fervor of sympathy, an activity of imagination on behalf of others which did not show itself effusively, but was continually seen in acts of considerateness that struck his companions as moral eccentricity. \"Deronda would have been first-rate if he had had more ambition,\" was a frequent remark about him. But how could a fellow push his way properly when he objected to swop for his own advantage, knocked under by choice when he was within an inch of victory, and, unlike the great Clive, would rather be the calf than the butcher? It was a mistake, however, to suppose that Deronda had not his share of ambition. We know he had suffered keenly from the belief that there was a tinge of dishonor in his lot; but there are some cases, and his was one of them, in which the sense of injury breeds\u2014not the will to inflict injuries and climb over them as a ladder, but a hatred of all injury. He had his flashes of fierceness and could hit out upon occasion, but the occasions were not always what might have been expected. For in what related to himself his resentful impulses had been early checked by a mastering affectionateness. Love has a habit of saying \"Never mind\" to angry self, who, sitting down for the nonce in the lower place, by-and-by gets used to it. So it was that as Deronda approached manhood his feeling for Sir Hugo, while it was getting more and more mixed with criticism, was gaining in that sort of allowance which reconciles criticism with tenderness. The dear old beautiful home and everything within it, Lady Mallinger and her little ones included, were consecrated for the youth as they had been for the boy\u2014only with a certain difference of light on the objects. The altarpiece was no longer miraculously perfect, painted under infallible guidance, but the human hand discerned in the work was appealing to a reverent tenderness safer from the gusts of discovery. Certainly Deronda's ambition, even in his spring-time, lay exceptionally aloof from conspicuous, vulgar triumph, and from other ugly forms of boyish energy; perhaps because he was early impassioned by ideas, and burned his fire on those heights. One may spend a good deal of energy in disliking and resisting what others pursue, and a boy who is fond of somebody else's pencil-case may not be more energetic than another who is fond of giving his own pencil-case away. Still it was not Deronda's disposition to escape from ugly scenes; he was more inclined to sit through them and take care of the fellow least able to take care of himself. It had helped to make him popular that he was sometimes a little compromised by this apparent comradeship. For a meditative interest in learning how human miseries are wrought\u2014as precocious in him as another sort of genius in the poet who writes a Queen Mab at nineteen\u2014was so infused with kindliness that it easily passed for comradeship. Enough. In many of our neighbors' lives there is much not only of error and lapse, but of a certain exquisite goodness which can never be written or even spoken\u2014only divined by each of us, according to the inward instruction of our own privacy.\n\nThe impression he made at Cambridge corresponded to his position at Eton. Every one interested in him agreed that he might have taken a high place if his motives had been of a more pushing sort, and if he had not, instead of regarding studies as instruments of success, hampered himself with the notion that they were to feed motive and opinion\u2014a notion which set him criticising methods and arguing against his freight and harness when he should have been using all his might to pull. In the beginning his work at the university had a new zest for him: indifferent to the continuation of Eton classical drill, he applied himself vigorously to mathematics, for which he had shown an early aptitude under Mr. Fraser, and he had the delight of feeling his strength in a comparatively fresh exercise of thought. That delight, and the favorable opinion of his tutor, determined him to try for a mathematical scholarship in the Easter of his second year: he wished to gratify Sir Hugo by some achievement, and the study of the higher mathematics, having the growing fascination inherent in all thinking which demands intensity, was making him a more exclusive worker than he had been before.\n\nBut here came the old check which had been growing with his growth. He found the inward bent toward comprehension and thoroughness diverging more and more from the track marked out by the standards of examination: he felt a heightening discontent with the wearing futility and enfeebling strain of a demand for excessive retention and dexterity without any insight into the principles which form the vital connections of knowledge. (Deronda's undergraduateship occurred fifteen years ago, when the perfection of our university methods was not yet indisputable.) In hours when his dissatisfaction was strong upon him he reproached himself for having been attracted by the conventional advantage of belonging to an English university, and was tempted toward the project of asking Sir Hugo to let him quit Cambridge and pursue a more independent line of study abroad. The germs of this inclination had been already stirring in his boyish love of universal history, which made him want to be at home in foreign countries, and follow in imagination the traveling students of the middle ages. He longed now to have the sort of apprenticeship to life which would not shape him too definitely, and rob him of the choice that might come from a free growth. One sees that Deronda's demerits were likely to be on the side of reflective hesitation, and this tendency was encouraged by his position; there was no need for him to get an immediate income, or to fit himself in haste for a profession; and his sensibility to the half-known facts of his parentage made him an excuse for lingering longer than others in a state of social neutrality. Other men, he inwardly said, had a more definite place and duties. But the project which flattered his inclination might not have gone beyond the stage of ineffective brooding, if certain circumstances had not quickened it into action.\n\nThe circumstances arose out of an enthusiastic friendship which extended into his after-life. Of the same year with himself, and occupying small rooms close to his, was a youth who had come as an exhibitioner from Christ's Hospital, and had eccentricities enough for a Charles Lamb. Only to look at his pinched features and blonde hair hanging over his collar reminded one of pale quaint heads by early German painters; and when this faint coloring was lit up by a joke, there came sudden creases about the mouth and eyes which might have been moulded by the soul of an aged humorist. His father, an engraver of some distinction, had been dead eleven years, and his mother had three girls to educate and maintain on a meagre annuity. Hans Meyrick\u2014he had been daringly christened after Holbein\u2014felt himself the pillar, or rather the knotted and twisted trunk, round which these feeble climbing plants must cling. There was no want of ability or of honest well-meaning affection to make the prop trustworthy: the ease and quickness with which he studied might serve him to win prizes at Cambridge, as he had done among the Blue Coats, in spite of irregularities. The only danger was, that the incalculable tendencies in him might be fatally timed, and that his good intentions might be frustrated by some act which was not due to habit but to capricious, scattered impulses. He could not be said to have any one bad habit; yet at longer or shorter intervals he had fits of impish recklessness, and did things that would have made the worst habits.\n\nHans in his right mind, however, was a lovable creature, and in Deronda he had happened to find a friend who was likely to stand by him with the more constancy, from compassion for these brief aberrations that might bring a long repentance. Hans, indeed, shared Deronda's rooms nearly as much as he used his own: to Deronda he poured himself out on his studies, his affairs, his hopes; the poverty of his home, and his love for the creatures there; the itching of his fingers to draw, and his determination to fight it away for the sake of getting some sort of a plum that he might divide with his mother and the girls. He wanted no confidence in return, but seemed to take Deronda as an Olympian who needed nothing\u2014an egotism in friendship which is common enough with mercurial, expansive natures. Deronda was content, and gave Meyrick all the interest he claimed, getting at last a brotherly anxiety about him, looking after him in his erratic moments, and contriving by adroitly delicate devices not only to make up for his friend's lack of pence, but to save him from threatening chances. Such friendship easily becomes tender: the one spreads strong sheltering wings that delight in spreading, the other gets the warm protection which is also a delight. Meyrick was going in for a classical scholarship, and his success, in various ways momentous, was the more probable from the steadying influence of Deronda's friendship.\n\nBut an imprudence of Meyrick's, committed at the beginning of the autumn term, threatened to disappoint his hopes. With his usual alternation between unnecessary expense and self-privation, he had given too much money for an old engraving which fascinated him, and to make up for it, had come from London in a third-class carriage with his eyes exposed to a bitter wind and any irritating particles the wind might drive before it. The consequence was a severe inflammation of the eyes, which for some time hung over him the threat of a lasting injury. This crushing trouble called out all Deronda's readiness to devote himself, and he made every other occupation secondary to that of being companion and eyes to Hans, working with him and for him at his classics, that if possible his chance of the classical scholarship might be saved. Hans, to keep the knowledge of his suffering from his mother and sisters, alleged his work as a reason for passing the Christmas at Cambridge, and his friend stayed up with him.\n\nMeanwhile Deronda relaxed his hold on his mathematics, and Hans, reflecting on this, at length said: \"Old fellow, while you are hoisting me you are risking yourself. With your mathematical cram one may be like Moses or Mahomet or somebody of that sort who had to cram, and forgot in one day what it had taken him forty to learn.\"\n\nDeronda would not admit that he cared about the risk, and he had really been beguiled into a little indifference by double sympathy: he was very anxious that Hans should not miss the much-needed scholarship, and he felt a revival of interest in the old studies. Still, when Hans, rather late in the day, got able to use his own eyes, Deronda had tenacity enough to try hard and recover his lost ground. He failed, however; but he had the satisfaction of seeing Meyrick win.\n\nSuccess, as a sort of beginning that urged completion, might have reconciled Deronda to his university course; but the emptiness of all things, from politics to pastimes, is never so striking to us as when we fail in them. The loss of the personal triumph had no severity for him, but the sense of having spent his time ineffectively in a mode of working which had been against the grain, gave him a distaste for any renewal of the process, which turned his imagined project of quitting Cambridge into a serious intention. In speaking of his intention to Meyrick he made it appear that he was glad of the turn events had taken\u2014glad to have the balance dip decidedly, and feel freed from his hesitations; but he observed that he must of course submit to any strong objection on the part of Sir Hugo.\n\nMeyrick's joy and gratitude were disturbed by much uneasiness. He believed in Deronda's alleged preference, but he felt keenly that in serving him Daniel had placed himself at a disadvantage in Sir Hugo's opinion, and he said mournfully, \"If you had got the scholarship, Sir Hugo would have thought that you asked to leave us with a better grace. You have spoiled your luck for my sake, and I can do nothing to amend it.\"\n\n\"Yes, you can; you are to be a first-rate fellow. I call that a first-rate investment of my luck.\"\n\n\"Oh, confound it! You save an ugly mongrel from drowning, and expect him to cut a fine figure. The poets have made tragedies enough about signing one's self over to wickedness for the sake of getting something plummy; I shall write a tragedy of a fellow who signed himself over to be good, and was uncomfortable ever after.\"\n\nBut Hans lost no time in secretly writing the history of the affair to Sir Hugo, making it plain that but for Deronda's generous devotion he could hardly have failed to win the prize he had been working for.\n\nThe two friends went up to town together: Meyrick to rejoice with his mother and the girls in their little home at Chelsea; Deronda to carry out the less easy task of opening his mind to Sir Hugo. He relied a little on the baronet's general tolerance of eccentricities, but he expected more opposition than he met with. He was received with even warmer kindness than usual, the failure was passed over lightly, and when he detailed his reasons for wishing to quit the university and go to study abroad. Sir Hugo sat for some time in a silence which was rather meditative than surprised. At last he said, looking at Daniel with examination, \"So you don't want to be an Englishman to the backbone after all?\"\n\n\"I want to be an Englishman, but I want to understand other points of view. And I want to get rid of a merely English attitude in studies.\"\n\n\"I see; you don't want to be turned out in the same mould as every other youngster. And I have nothing to say against your doffing some of our national prejudices. I feel the better myself for having spent a good deal of my time abroad.

It will not do to give yourself to be melted down for the benefit of the tallow-trade; you must know where to find yourself. However, I shall put no vote on your going. Wait until I can get off Committee, and I'll run over with you.\"\n\nSo Deronda went according to his will.

They so thoroughly accepted Deronda as an ideal, that when he was gone the youngest set to work, under the criticism of the two elder girls, to paint him as Prince Camaralzaman.Embed"}, {"_type":
